People asked to change lifestyle till availability of vaccine," Postgraduate Medical Institute and Amir Uddin Medical College Principal Prof Dr Sardar Muhammad Al-freed Zafar has said that the measures taken to curb the spread of coronavirus and lockdowns have revolutionised the world, leading to a significant reduction in air pollution and the spread of complex diseases among citizens. There has also been a decline in ozone depletion from air pollution and toxic gases./In a press statement on Sunday, he appealed to the citizens to change their lifestyle till the availability of coronavirus vaccine. 'We have to change and learn to live with this virus,' he added. He said that coronavirus is not only in Pakistan but the whole world is under its grip. He said 'We can succeed in defeating the virus.'/The PGMI principal said that if the public did not follow the SOPs, the consequences could be dire and the hard work of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff fighting on the frontlines could be wasted. He said that the only solution is to maintain social distance and the process of washing hands frequently is inevitable. He stated that citizens should also be aware of the environment around them and keep it clean and spray disinfectant to prevent from diseases./He also urged the youths to give more importance to tree plantation so that the country could be made greener and the damage caused by climate change could be avoided all over the world."
Experts urged govt to spend for resilience of capital," Experts and civil society representatives speaking to a webinar criticised Capital Development Authority (CDA) for its tug of war with Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) since the inception of the latter for the last over four years./They said citizens have badly suffered from the illogical rift as the civic services and environmental conditions have deteriorated over a few years of the local government system in the federal capital. The tug of war between the two, the city managers and the peoples' representatives, over the funds and authority have spoiled the sustainability of the entire system of service delivery./The civil society reps highlighted that water shortage, lack of proper management of domestic waste and sewage, broken roads, diminishing green cover and belts and irrational development have marred the sustainability of the city./Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) organised the webinar on the subject 'Population and Sustainable Urban Practices for Islamabad' on Saturday to mark the UN World Population Day./The key speakers included water and climate expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh who is the former Director Asia for the Climate and Knowledge Development Network (CKDN) project, MCI Deputy Mayor Zeeshan Naqvi, Solid Waste Management expert Saadat Ali, environmental advocacy expert Mome Saleem, and Dr Hammad Gillani who is researcher, analyst and assistant professor at the Institute of Space Technology (IST)./Among others who spoke included Dr Naveed, Syed Haq, Arshad Mahmood, Nilofar Jamil. The webinar was conducted and hosted by Devcom-Pakistan and DTN Director Munir Ahmed who is a well-known environmentalist and climate advocacy expert. Zeeshan Naqvi said Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) was allocated Rs14 billion two years back for different project proposals but no penny was released so far. Even the MCI cannot use the tax it collects from different sources because the MCI Rules of Business are not approved as yet by the government. The MCI House has approved the schemes of small dams on eight natural streams originating from the foot of Margalla Hills, improvement in the sewage treatment plants, repair and provision of water, filter plants, maintenance of parks. They are all possible if the funds are provided. We are handcuffed by the government, perhaps, because we belong to the opposition party./Naqvi said the encroachments cannot be removed without the support of ICT district management. Despite repeated requests MCI was not extended due cooperation by the district management to remove illegal constructions from the green belts and national park areas. However, he said, MCI is trying to take care of the city with whatever limited human resources and funds are available. Collection of domestics waste has been improved while working on the landfill site, trying to improve the conditions of parks besides efforts are underway to overcome shortage of water supply. He asked the government to urgently start a process of amendments in the rules and regulations framed for the capital city to ensure rights to the locals. He said legislation is needed on the contradictions in the same zone that perturb the rights of citizens./Talking about the new paradigm of sustainable urban management, the water and climate expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh said resilience of the city matters that how good coping mechanisms are in place to face the disasters, urban flooding, impact of harsh weathers, water scarcity, recycling and waste management systems. He said the concept of smart city for Islamabad is already underway but without meaningful measures it would not be sustainable. The population density becomes more productive in terms of socioeconomic outcomes if they have opportunities to be productive. The federal city is expanding beyond limits without any planning and resource management that would become liability soon if conditions remained so./Devcom-Pakistan Director Munir Ahmed said civil society representatives and experts should play their role in bridging the conflicts among the city managers ICT district management, CDA and MCI for the sake of citizens. He also urged the government to urgently release the funds so that development projects should begin to improve the civic and environmental conditions in the federal capital./Mome Saleem urged the government to take immediate steps to remove encroachments from the green belts and national park areas./Saadat Ali said a comprehensive plan is required to segregate 750 ton waste at source and its disposal in an adequate manner. At present, he said it is being dumped in I-12 in the open that is causing air pollution and source of many diseases while the subsoil water is also contaminated. A landfill site towards Rawat would be more suitable for waste management./Presenting his research on the diminishing green cover in Islamabad, Dr Hmmad Gilani said we have lost a major portion of the green cover in the last five years due to illegal removal of trees for the irrational construction in the hills and green belts. CDA has also played its role in the loss of vegetative cover by undue expansion of infrastructures, undue permissions to the departments to construct within the green belts."
Crackdown ordered on farmers involved in stubble burning," Commissioner Javed Akhtar Mehmood Monday ordered a crackdown on farmers involved in stubble burning./The commissioner directed the Environment Protection Department to seal factories involved in air pollution in Multan, Vehari, Khanewal and Lodhran districts. Chairing a EPD performance review meeting, the commissioner directed Road Transport Authority officials and traffic police to jointly conduct operations against smoke-emitting vehicles./He ordered officials to launch an awareness drive on smog and environmental pollution. He directed all Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of the division to launch a smog prevention campaign in their respective districts and activation of divisional and district smog committees./He said the violators of environmental pollution should be trialed strictly. He warned EPD officials to complete scrutiny of the environmental feasibility report before the final construction. He said no leniency would be tolerated in this connection./The commissioner ordered shifting of bricks kiln to zigzag technology on war footings. He said the EPD should play his vital role against environmental hazards./Briefing the meeting, EPD deputy director Dr Zafar Iqbal said two factories involved in pollution have been sealed in industrial estate. The EPD has constituted an environmental squad in coordination with traffic police. He added./LPP inks MoU with BZU in field of education: The Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) and Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU) Monday inked a three-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for mutual cooperation in the field of education under public private partnership to achieve Sustainable Development Goals./Addressing an MoU signing ceremony, LPP chief executive Dr Abdul Saboor said the partnerships between educational institutions and development organisations are crucial because educational institutions are think tanks offering solutions to challenges and issues faced by the youth./This is the sole responsibility of development organisations to engage the young and enable them through participation in different programmes to address the challenges. The MoU also include knowledge exchange and mutual capacity building and research. The LPP will the collaboration of the BZU will nurture leadership skills in the youth and strengthen previously formed peace clubs and students' societies by the LPP./The LPP will provide all technical and logistic support to BZU in conceiving, designing and implementing different projects to form students' clubs and societies that are key in promoting peace and social cohesion in society./The LPP through these clubs and societies will mentor young people by imparting important life-skills, peace building through sports programmes, safe charity, and communication skills and how to set up and run a students' society./Lauding the LPP efforts, BZU vice chancellor Prof Dr Mansoor Akbar Kundi said the LPP has provided students different opportunities of professional training in the past and they hope that the LPP will continue the same consideration towards the welfare of students in the future./BZU RO Tahir Mehmood said they have a wonderful experience of working with LPP and currently LPP is disinfecting the BZU premises for a safe reopening of the university. The LPP through its 'WASH Response in Communities Affected by Covid-19' programme with the support of UNICEF Pakistan is equipped with trainings to prepare Sodium Hypochlorite solution and WATA kit, has disinfected the classrooms, conference halls, administration offices and university premises to ensure a safe reopening for students./'South Punjab Agri Dept to make wheat calendar': The South Punjab Agriculture Department has decided to make a wheat calendar for safe and secure return of the crop. The calendar would be made for the first time in the history. The wheat calendar would show year long activities for the betterment of the crop./It was told by South Punjab Agriculture Secretary Saqib Ali while chairing a meeting of wheat yellow rust prevention held at the committee room of the South Punjab Agriculture Secretariat here on Monday./The secretary said that the Punjab Seed Corporation had provided 9,000kg seed of new wheat variety Ghazi-19. He said that only yellow rust was resistant and additional wheat producing seed varieties would be encouraged to cultivate in the South Punjab. The Regional Agriculture Research Institute had developed a yellow rust resistant seed variety Ghazi-19, he told./The 9,000kg pre basic seed of this variety was provided to the PSC for production, he informed. He said that unregistered pesticides without labeling usage instructions would not be allowed to spray on crops. These types of pesticides were not only health hazardous but also such crops were not fit for export, he added./Saqib Ali directed the Agriculture Department to compile data on temperature and humidity from wheat sowing to harvesting because yellow rust directly links to humid weather and fluctuation in temperature./He directed the agriculture officials to ensure availability of pesticides against yellow rust. If the required pesticides faced shortage in the market, then the concerned department would be held responsible, he warned. This was necessary to concerned departments to make foolproof planning for the swift availability of anti-fungal sprays in February next, he continued./He advised the growers to use only recommended sprays against fungus. Senior agriculture officers, including Dr Lal Hussain Akhtar, Dr Muhammad Aslam, Shahzad Sabir, Naveed Asmat Kahloon and others were also present./Rs 300b allocated to boost agriculture sector: Punjab Agriculture Secretary Wasif Khurshid Monday said the government has allocated Rs 300 billion to increase per acre yield potential and uplift the agriculture sector under the Prime Minister Agriculture Emergency Program./Talking to reporters, the secretary said the Punjab Agriculture Department has accelerated work on the growth and uplift of wheat, paddy, sugarcane, oil, seed crops, establishment of model agriculture markets and water management schemes./He said Rs 12.54 billion has been allocated under PMAEP for the wheat crop bringing considerable increase in per acre production. The Punjab government is spending Rs 8.37 billion for the uplift and bringing per acre increase in production in rice and sugarcane crops, Rs 5.11 billion for the promotion of oil and seed crops and Rs 28.59 billion on water management and alignment of watercourses./Wasif said the government is spending Rs 21.27 billion for the establishment of model agriculture markets across the province and the scheme has covered majority districts in the province. The Punjab government has provided most advanced agriculture machinery to peasants on subsidy worth Rs 300 million. He said Rs 57.20 million has been distributed among farmers at Rs 2,000 per acre subsidy. At least 10, 000 watercourses are being improved and bricked across Punjab and farmers are provided laser land levelers on subsidy at Rs 250, 000 to each farmer per unit of laser land leveler, he maintained."

"Air pollution, traumatic brain injuries and alcohol consumption termed risk factors for dementia"," In addition to traumatic brain journey and alcohol consumption, air pollution has emerged as a new risk factor for dementia. Modifying these risk factors along with that others that were previously identified could prevent as much as 40 per cent of dementia, experts said on Saturday./They stated that Karachi and some other cities of the country were ranked as some of the most polluted cities of the world where traumatic brain injuries were also quite common in road accidents as commuters did not bother to wear helmets and fasten seat belts while alcohol consumption was also on the rise./Speaking at an online international seminar at the Aga Khan University (AKU) in connection with World Alzheimer's Day that will fall be observed tomorrow (September 21), eminent neurologists said limiting contact with air pollution, avoiding head injuries, and limiting alcohol consumption may help prevent dementia./Dementia is a general term for a significant decline in mental ability accompanied with memory loss that disturbs daily life; whereas, Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disease that is caused by complex brain changes following cell damage. Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, experts said./They maintained that other risk factors for dementia include less education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes and low social contact. It was said that most of these risk factors were modifiable and dementia could be prevented or delayed for many years by adopting a healthy lifestyle./The online seminar was organised by the Pakistan Neurology Society (PSN). It was addressed by eminent neurologists and psychiatrists from India, Singapore and various cities of Pakistan who spoke on various aspects of Alzheimer's disease as well as dementia and advised the people to change their lifestyle to prevent the disease, which usually strikes after the age of 60 years./Speaking on the topic of the global perspective on Alzheimer's disease, Prof Dr Man Mohan Mehndiratta from New Delhi said that around 50 million people lived with dementia worldwide but this number was projected to increase to 152 million by 2050. He added that dementia was rising in low- and middle-income countries where around two thirds of the people with dementia lived./He deplored that although dementia was on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, unfortunately the family care was weakening in those countries, including India, due to migration of children and working women./Dr Muhammad Wasay, a neurologist associated with the AKU and organiser of the seminar, spoke about the management of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, saying that once a person was diagnosed with these neurological disorders, they could not be completely cured but the progression of their disease could be slowed down with the help of medicines./He advised the people to approach trained and qualified neurologists when their parents and elderly relatives started showing symptoms of the disease./'Memory loss, difficulty in performing routine tasks, confusion and trouble in understanding are some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but with the help of medicines, its progression can be slowed down and patients can live a normal life,' he said, adding that no medicine could completely stop the progression of the disease./Dr Wasay maintained that people should not go for unproven treatment options, dietary supplements and alternative medicines as there was no proven treatment for Alzheimer's disease./He added that in case of behavioural problems in the patients with Alzheimer's disease, they should consult neurologists as well as psychiatrists./Neurologist Dr Abdul Malik spoke about the incidence of dementia in Pakistan, saying that it was on the rise due to increased life expectancy in the country. He added that public awareness was needed for taking care of elderly people with dementia in the country./Physician and professor of medicine Prof Ejaz Vohra called for strengthening family system and providing support to people with dementia, saying that such patients should not be left at the mercy of managements of old homes./Pakistan Psychiatric Society President Prof Iqbal Afridi spoke on the psychiatric and behavioural aspects of dementia and Alzheimer's disease and called for providing mental support to patients with neurological disorders. He added that even the caregivers of such patients needed counselling./The seminar was also addressed by Dr Keira Joann from Singapore amd Prof Saleem Ullah. The chief guest of the event was Prof Dr Saleem Barech, the PSN president and faculty member at Bolan University, Quetta."
What they need is what you need," Early brain and behavioural development in children sets the stage for later achievements in life. There is ample and unequivocal research showing that the foundation of healthy adulthood and productivity is laid in the early years. Also, their living environment effects the developmental potential of children in their formative years. If there is some form of developmental delay, an unsupportive environment and under stimulation weigh in as much to the problem as the underlying biological and genetic constitution of the child./Traditionally labelled by socio-economic characteristics, neither poverty nor wealth are explanatory. They are in fact misleading. Not all children from poor homes live in unstimulating environment; neither do all children from affluent homes receive adequate support for their developmental progress./Family or home environment for the young child includes many other parameters. The pillars holding a child's environment strong are sensitive parents (or sometimes caregivers if parents are not present) who are responsive to their child's needs. Parents who show affection and provide rich environment facilitate development. As a corollary, a harsh way of punishing the child to discipline leads to low self-esteem./Besides the quality of parenting, other factors playing in are physical home environment, quality of language spoken, limited amount of distractible audio-visual stimulation and adequate cognitive aka higher mental stimulation. For instance, parents having a satisfying relationship with each other have the cognitive and emotional resources when interacting with their children. Availability of age appropriate toys and learning materials along with adult interaction benefits child's cognitive learning./Play is a very important contributor to a child's physical and social development and wellbeing if it allows freedom for exploration. Active play typically occurs outdoors and refers to a form of 'gross motor' or total body movement in which young children exert energy in a freely chosen, fun, and unstructured manner. Access to active play in nature and outdoors with its risks is essential for healthy development. It is associated with a wide range of physiological, psychological and socio-emotional health benefits that can track into adulthood, and importantly, contribute to a decreased risk of chronic disease./Protection from safety hazards is another very important aspect and unhealthy environments also have their negative part to play. Household air pollution and below par water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) being the main risk factors. These risk factors target the vulnerable increasing the burden of communicable (acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, diarrhoea), non-communicable diseases and malnutrition. They directly affect child developmental, resulting in cognitive deficits and affecting sensorimotor and socio-emotional development, especially if exposure occurs during the first few years of life./Scientific research has proved that nurturing environment provided in very early years of childhood is most important for their development and their brain function in adulthood. Exposure to severe deprivation (in first few years of life) is associated with profound and enduring alterations in brain volume and structure in young adulthood. Such alterations were identified in brain MRI scans conducted in one study. The ones deprived had substantially smaller brains (i.e. reduced total brain volume TBA) than their non-deprived counterparts did, it was clearly detectable even when individuals exposed to this form of deprivation were subsequently brought up in families that provided nurturing environments for the rest of their childhoods./Many parents send their young children to Montessori and playgroups where they get stimulation to learn and socialise. After invasion of Covid-19, school closures have shifted education from the classroom to the home, and for the immediate future, the burden of education now falls largely on parents. It is time to see how much of learning stimulation young kids are receiving while restricted to their homes within the full spectrum of socio-economic strata. It is also important to understand how much parents and caregivers are aware of the need of providing a rich environment to kids and how much they respect their identity and needs./Parents can be the buffer between, and-or the mechanism through which, crises in the environment affecting young children's experiences. Parenting and family factors are the critical drivers of children's early healthy growth and development and are thus primary in determining the immediate severity of pandemic on young children now and in the future. Before the pandemic, 43 per cent of all children under 5 years of age were estimated to be at risk of not achieving their developmental potential. The challenge has now amplified for parents and caregivers/Research on the effects of prior pandemics and disasters indicates that there will be both immediate and long-term adverse consequences for many children, with particular risks faced during early childhood, when brain architecture is still rapidly developing and highly sensitive to environmental adversity. Close attention and great efforts are required to address these emerging issues effectively and avoid any long term consequences in children. Families can spend more time together talking, playing, and learning and help children develop self-discipline skills. Children are constantly exposed to epidemic-related news, so having direct conversations with children about these issues could alleviate their anxiety and avoid panic. Home confinement could offer a good opportunity to enhance the interaction between parents and children; involve children in family activities, and improve their self-sufficiency skills. With the right parenting approaches, family bonds can be strengthened, and child psychological needs met.  "
Anti-colonial struggle," The closely dated murders of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minnesota, of Breonna Taylor by white police officers in Kentucky, of Ahmaud Arbery by a retired cop with white supremacist ties and his son in Georgia, and of Tony McDade by a white police officer in Florida, all coalesced to reignite the US civil rights movement./This popular uprising has drastically shifted society at large, as evidenced by public opinion polls which show society-wide support for them, and by the movement's long list of policy and action achievements thus far. However, the even longer list of Black people killed, or almost killed, by white racists has only continued growing since the protests began./Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has caused the deaths of nearly one million people worldwide. In the US, the country with the highest levels of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths, demographic data shows that the brunt of this burden is being born disproportionately by Black and Indigenous people, as well as non-Black communities of colour, and women in particular./This pandemic has exposed fundamental differences in how society protects life, from unequal access to services and medical attention, to unequal application of criminal justice and law, and beyond./Consider the intensifying problem of environmental pollution. A study from the University of Exeter, published in June 2020, found that half of the world's population is exposed to air pollution, which is increasing. Even before the pandemic, it was estimated that nine million people died a year because of air pollution./You might have guessed that the spread of pollution also has a disproportionate impact on communities of colour, a well-known and documented phenomenon known as 'environmental racism'. And of course, as if to neatly complete the vicious cycle, air pollution makes people more vulnerable to the effects of contracting Covid-19. These problems feed each other./As the effects of climate change intensify, the spread of pathogens and viruses will only become more likely. For example, the World Bank estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion humans will be reckoning with malaria outbreaks. Likewise, industrial agricultural practices, like the vast monoculture plantations that are replacing tropical rainforests at an alarming pace, reducing biodiversity and therefore, making the spread of diseases more likely./In other words, the risk of new, more frequent, and deadlier pandemics is also growing./And the planet keeps on warming. Currently, one out of every four species faces extinction, and before the end of this century, Earth might be uninhabitable by large mammals like humans. However, well in advance of that, the indirect escalation towards our extinction will itself be difficult and painful./Accelerating waves of mass extinctions, soil erosion, droughts, famines, wildfires, infectious diseases adding to already-strained infrastructure, and mounting social instability overall will - or rather, is already and will growingly - make life very volatile, even for the most privileged."
Rushing to reopen?," After six months, since the government imposed a lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus, students are back to their education institutions. They returned amid much anxiety from parents who discussed in great detail, on social media, if it was safe to send children to school. So far, only students of Grades 9 and 10, and college- and university-going students have returned to classrooms, officially at least./But a number of private schools have called students of lower secondary and primary classes too, and sent fee vouchers. Already there is confusion. Under federal government orders, those attending lower-grade classes would be going back in phases over the rest of this month. A week after the first phases of schools' reopening, the Sindh government conducted tests at several education institutions. By then, there was a 2.4 percent increase in Covid-19 cases in Sindh. The provincial government, then, decided to delay the reopening for lower-grade classes. The University of Balochistan closed for in-person classes after it reported a few positive cases. Amid the rumours of another school closure, dozens of schools in Sindh have been sealed./Even as coronavirus cases climbed, Federal Minister for Education Shafqat Mahmood said that schools would not be shut down, given the losses already suffered by students./Undoubtedly, education institutions cannot remain closed indefinitely. It is especially true in a county where almost 23 million children are already out of school and the literacy rate is one of the lowest in the world. However, the need for education has to be balanced against the need to safeguard health. Only two days after schools resumed, scores of schools and colleges across the country have had to be closed down or sealed after they reported Covid-19 cases./At Riphah International University alone, 16 cases of the virus were detected. The institute has now been labelled a 'super spreader'. In Karachi, the highly prestigious IBA suspended on-campus classes and announced additional precautions, but refused to comment on whether there had been any coronavirus case./At the first phase of the reopening, there are already so many concerns about whether the decision was right. Things are likely to become more confusing for decision makers when primary and lower secondary classes reopen. For schools, it is already difficult to follow the government-mandated SOPs. In public education institutions, the resources to enforce social distancing measures simply do not exist. Many do not even have hand washing facilities. This is also true for smaller private schools. And, of course, it will become more difficult to manage when younger children are involved. It is virtually impossible for teachers to manage them./The argument goes that children generally suffer mild Covid-19 symptoms. While evidence still coming in from around the world suggests that this is true, children are silent, asymptomatic carriers of the virus and can spread to high risk groups at home or school. In a relatively small number of cases, children with coronavirus also develop Kawasaki disease, a condition that is usually easily treatable, but if not treated or not diagnosed can lead to potentially serious cardiac conditions. A study from Pakistan, conducted at Lahore's Children's Hospital, and also published internationally, found Kawasaki-like symptoms in eight patients with Covid. We have no idea how many undiagnosed or unreported cases there may be. To protect both adults and children, we need to carefully monitor events over the coming days and do whatever is possible to prevent education institutions from becoming the epicentres of the virus./The problem appears to be a global one. Multiple cases of Covid in some newly opened US schools have caused alarm. There, further complications have been created by the protests led by some parents against masks - they argue that it is cruel to make children wear them. While masks may seem uncomfortable, we should note that in East Asia wearing masks was normal, even for children, well before the Covid-19 pandemic for protection against air pollution and other common viruses. Certainly, masks were not considered inhumane or unbearable. Today, they are serving as a vital defence against the virus. A mask is simply an accessory that needs getting used to, and which can save us from several illnesses./But masks or no masks, the reality is that education institutions all over the world are becoming places where the coronavirus is quickly spreading. It can easily spread in packed dormitories and halls. Even as some universities in the US opened, they were forced to change to online learning after Covid cases were reported. Israel was among the first countries to experience the problem of rise in coronavirus cases after reopening schools earlier this year. Germany, the UK and other countries in the region are facing the same problem. How children can be educated and kept safe at the same time has become a key issue./Other issues are related to this one. Psychologists say it is essential that children go to school and associate with peers as well as experience the daily life at schools. In the UK, there have been warnings that in quarantine, children will miss out permanently on socialising. At the same time, some parents and children say that they are scared of getting the virus at schools. There are no apparent solutions at the moment./The question that arises for Pakistan is a difficult one. This year, thousands of children didn't take exams. Their grades were given on the basis of previous years' results. Some say this has affected them badly in acquiring places at colleges or professional institutions. They and their parents hope then that there will be no further disruptions. So do the parents, teachers and students due to sit for important exams this year./While we hope the almost miraculous success of Pakistan's battle against Covid will be repeated at its schools, apprehensions are being voiced that this may be too much to expect. There is also concern that too many institutions were opened up to0 quickly. On last Wednesday (Sep 16), for the first time in over a month, Pakistan reported 700 cases of Covid. The number had till then been declining and had averaged around 300 cases. Naturally, this spike in the cases is being linked with schools' reopening. The next few days will tell the full story./The decision concerning schools was always a difficult one, as the federal government has already accepted. The reopening also coincides with the 'flu season', notably in colder regions. Is it fair to put the health of students, their families, their teachers and school staff at risk for the sake of education? The ethical dilemma becomes even more complex when we consider the difference between schools. While the most elite schools have staff in PPE carrying out health checks and doling out hand sanitizer, there are other schools that can barely afford soap. This inequality suggests that once again it is the poorest who will suffer and who are at greater risk of catching the virus. The answers are not easy to find, but life and welfare should come ahead of everything else. A year lost at school can be compensated. A life lost cannot be returned."
World Bank to support govt's green recovery initiatives," The World Bank has committed financial, technological and knowledge resources to support Pakistan's green recovery initiatives in forestry, environmental protection, and climate change resilience to restore people's lives and livelihoods affected by the COVID-19 pandemic./The commitment was made during a meeting between World Bank's Country Director to Pakistan Najy Benhassine and Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam. The director was leading a three-member delegation, a statement said on Thursday./World Bank and Ministry of Climate Change agreed to work closely in various areas, including environmental development, climate change adaptation and mitigation, air pollution reduction, forest management, and disaster risk mitigation at the meeting, the statement said./'It is really amazing and inspiring that despite limited financial resources, Pakistan launched green stimulus initiative under Clean Green Pakistan Programme, which has led to creation of thousands of green jobs for those rendered unemployed due to COVID-19 pandemic.'/He lauded the government's initiatives for economic recovery, afforestation, wildlife conservation, and resilience against adverse impacts of climate change on water, energy, agriculture, food security, health, education, and lives and livelihoods of vulnerable rural and mountain communities./Benhassine said the World Bank would support Pakistan in its initiatives to support climate-vulnerable socioeconomic sectors./Aslam thanked Benhassine for conveying the World Bank's commitment for supporting the present government's post-COVID 19 recovery through the Green Stimulus Programme initiated under the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Programme (TBTTP). Both sides vowed to tackle negative fallouts of the present global health crisis and global warming on various socio-economic sectors of the country for achieving equitable and inclusive social and economic growth and mitigating poverty and diseases."
"Workshop at University of Haripur: GIS potential in agriculture, natural resource management underlined"," The Geographical Information System GIS has a great potential in agriculture and natural resource management together with career development of researchers opting to use the modern technique in their project drawing and design./This was the main focus of the speeches that the scientists gave during the inaugural session of two days international workshop on 'Use of GIS Technology and Stable Isotopes for sustainable development in Agriculture and environment'. The Departments of Soil and Climate Sciences University of Haripur had organized the event in collaboration with Pakistan Science Foundation and Chemistry Department of varsity here on Thursday./The scientists, researchers, academia and students from different parts of the country were in attendance on this occasion. The speakers said that the GIS was a computer based system for collecting, checking, integrating and analyzing information related to the surface of the earth. Highlighting the major applications of GIS, the speakers said that the GIS techniques were being used globally in natural resource and environmental protection. They said socio-economic development, land  and  water management, civic supplies and crime detection and the developing agro-based economy of Pakistan ought to benefit from the modern techniques for the desired results of prosperity./They said that GIS has an important role to play in farm management, pest/disease tracking, crop monitoring, yield production and soil analysis. While in environmental sciences it has a very vital role for analysis and formulating the quick mitigation plan for high risk environments, they said. The speakers said it could serve as the ultimate communication of environmental information to the public and policy makers for wildland analysis, hazards mitigation  and  future planning, air pollution and control, disaster management, oil spills and remedial actions and coal mine fires. They said the GIS could also be used for business purposes, geology, archaeology and architecture purposes and its applications have multidimensional benefits for the researchers, policymakers and the public at large. Dr Arshad Ashraf principal scientist Climate Change, Alternative Energy and Water Resource Institute Islamabad, Dr Sarfraz Ahmed, Dr Imran Shahzad Department of Metrology COMSATS, Dr Rasheed Ahmed, Prof Dr Anwarul Hasan, VC UoH, Dr Ali Raza Gurmani, Chairman, Department of Soil  and  Climate Sciences, were prominent among those who spoke to the participants on this occasion."
The right to breathe," The right to life must surely include the right to breathe or take clean air into one's lungs, especially at a time when a dystopian future seems more and more likely for humanity. It is a right that has been challenged in parts of the country, notably Lahore, due to the air pollution that comes in every winter. Noting the gradual deterioration in air quality even before winter has fully hit the province, the Punjab government has announced measures to deal with the problem. Two of the most important steps are to stop the burning of any kind of crop residue and to ban vehicles emitting pollutants from the roads. In addition, there is another long list of measures which include a ban on brick kilns which are not built in a zigzag fashion. All brick kilns have to be brought under this new design intended to avoid emissions, by the end of the year. Factory smoke and traffic jams during which large amounts of pollutant smoke builds up have also been banned./While these measures are to be applauded, the question however, is whether they will be implemented and how effectively. It is not easy to control the activities of people in a city the size of Lahore. It is not easy to deal with air pollution either. New Delhi succeeded partially for a short period by putting all public transport vehicles on liquid natural gas. But even this did not prove to be a permanent solution with too many other vehicles crowded onto the roads. In the first place, we need to be more transparent about our air quality by putting up metres at public places. This is all the more important in the time of Covid when there is serious respiratory infection around in the first place. If people can see the numbers, it may help increase awareness and therefore encourage activities that limit pollution including using vehicles that are not driven on diesel, or emit fumes or burning materials, which let off noxious gases. This is the only way to deal with pollution./Last year's 'State of Global Air' report put Pakistan second in the list of countries with the highest mortality rate due to air pollution. India and China tied for first place in a list that no one should be proud to be on. A total of 1.2 million die each year of air pollution in China and India. The numbers of India suggest that more people die of air pollution than smoking. India and Pakistan both rank higher than China in terms of household air pollution, which means the air is not safe in over half of the households in our countries. Pakistan also suffers because polluted breeze swings in from neighbouring countries, carrying with it the particles that hang in the air of winter, and cause illness, respiratory infection and an increase in asthma, notably among children and old people that has been commented upon in medical journals. This is a serious issue. And the fact is that those in power know this. We need action now to save us and our future generations."
Can smog be far behind?," The phenomenon of smog has become a regular feature - the fifth season, so to say - of the Punjab, and acts as a very unwelcome harbinger of winters/Research has uncovered links between exposure to air pollution and the risk of Covid-19 mortality. Simply put, poor air quality diminishes immunity and increases risk of exposure to coronavirus. - Photos by Rahat Dar/Last year, the Air Quality Index (AQI) ranked Lahore's air quality as the second worst in the world in terms of health risks posed by the ambient air pollution. Parts of Lahore scored as high as 454 on an index of 500, second only to New Delhi, India. The phenomenon of smog has become a regular fifth season in the Punjab, acting as a very unwelcome harbinger of winters./For a number of years now, the month of October heralds in a period of increasing respiratory illnesses and eye diseases, accompanied with a thick, acrid odour of burnt garbage in the air. But that is not all, for air pollution brings with it particulate matter (PM) - microscopic particles of pollution that can end up causing long-term, permanent health damage, even fatalities./A World Health Organisation (WHO) research clearly indicates the impacts of short-term exposure to PM10 on respiratory health, including deficits in lung function, reduced lung development in children and a host of other illnesses. In terms of mortality, especially due to long-term exposure, PM2.5 is a stronger risk factor, most adversely impacting populations with pre-existing lung or heart disease, the elderly, and children. The exposure (to bad air) is ubiquitous and involuntary, increasing the significance of smog and air pollution on public health. There is no evidence of a safe level of exposure or a threshold below which no adverse health effects occur./Around the world, increasing air pollution in pre-Covid days was combated by shutting down schools, encouraging the public to wear N95 masks and restricting the operation of vehicles and industries emitting air pollution. A growing body of research has uncovered links between exposure to air pollution and the risk of Covid-19 mortality. Simply put, poor air quality diminishes immunity, increases risk of exposure to coronavirus, and may result in severe symptoms which can tip the scale away from recovery./The emergence of smog as a new phenomenon, particularly in and around Lahore, has been attributed to everything from burning crop remnants to wind vortices to poor quality fuel being consumed by vehicles. Indeed, the provincial government's Environment Protection Department (EPD) vacillates between closing brick kilns using 'old technology,' banning stubble burning and tightening the noose around small industrial and semi-industrial units./The consensus seems to be that smog or air pollution is a seasonal issue caused by massive crop-burning across the border in India. This explanation, however, cannot be lent much credence, considering that the air quality in Lahore is generally poor throughout the year./Historically, notable smog events have been accompanied by a temperature inversion - a phenomenon that is akin to a 'lid' trapping pollutants close to the surface of the earth. An inversion generally occurs when air adjacent to the earth cools rapidly, becoming cooler than the overlying warm air. This usually happens in cool weather, especially in the early mornings and late nights./Although meteorological conditions do cause air pollution to build up, it is ultimately human activities that are the culprit behind excessive pollutant emissions. Research conducted by the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) on the sectoral emission inventory of the Punjab showed that the major portion of total air pollutants are emitted by the transport sector (43 percent), followed by industry (25 percent), and agriculture (20 per cent)./A report by the World Bank identified main sources of air pollution in Pakistan as heavy-duty vehicles and motorised 2-3 wheelers; followed by power plants and waste-burning. The report analysed a partial inventory of emission sources (using available data) to highlight that the transport sector alone is responsible for a whopping 85 percent of particulate matter emissions of potentially carcinogenic and lethal PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter./The exposure (to bad air) is ubiquitous and involuntary, increasing the significance of smog and air pollution for public health. There is no evidence of a safe level of exposure or a threshold below which no adverse health effects occur./According to the UNDP, Pakistan is the most urbanised country in South Asia. It is estimated that nearly half of the country's residents will live in cities by 2025. With urban centres in Pakistan continuing to swell with people, traffic, and industrial and commercial activities, the air quality is likely to deteriorate further in years to come./The increasing dependence on cheap but inefficient and highly polluting fuels, including coal, is worsening the air quality around the world, particularly in developing countries./It is estimated that the number of vehicles in Pakistan has increased by around fivefold in the past 20 years alone. The number of two-stroke engine vehicles has grown more than tenfold, and emissions from large industries and power generation have also increased. The situation is compounded by a combination of weak environmental legislation and inefficient implementation of global emission standards - one example of this is that the EPDs have no say in vehicle emissions; it has been deferred to the Petroleum Division./The Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch analyses global extreme weather events and their socio-economic impact. The 2020 Index ranks Pakistan as the '5th most vulnerable country to climate change.' Among growing climate challenges, air quality is emerging as a formidable new foe - one that is largely misunderstood. The general assumption appears to be that until visibility is greatly diminished, the eyes and throat are irritated, and you can wipe off pollutant particles from you face; the air is just fine./Moreover, declining government attention to air quality management results in a paucity of reliable data, further hinders effective policy interventions to tackle air pollution./Strategic interventions on air quality control should start with an emphasis by the Health and Environment Departments on reducing levels of pollutants linked to high morbidity and mortality - PM2.5, PM10, sulfur oxides [SOx] and nitrogen oxides [NOx] - in collaboration with the Petroleum Division. This includes improving fuel quality, enforcing vehicle emission standards particularly on heavy vehicles, and promotion of battery electric vehicles in the country./The Punjab government should also assign resources to develop an inventory of mobile, industrial and stationary sources of air pollution. Reliable air quality data must be made a provincial and national priority to understand the sources, transport, dispersion, and fate of air pollutants. Restrictions on burning solid waste, stubble, and ensuring control of emissions from brick kilns and industry already exist, but must be enforced./In terms of legislation, the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) need to be realistically revised in view of attainable goals under the conditions that currently exist in Pakistan. Both industries and municipalities must be given incentives to reduce both the concentrations and masses of air pollutant emission, the provisions for which are there in the Pakistan Environment Protection Act./Pakistan's sectors with significant climate change mitigation and air pollution control co-benefits are energy, transport, and agriculture. Finally, national and provincial frameworks for air quality monitoring must be strengthened in order to take a solid step towards eliminating the nation's severe urban air pollution problem. Institutional strengthening at both federal and provincial levels, and effective coordination and liaison among stakeholders from climate, energy and health must be prioritiaed so that future generations are not left gasping for air./The writer is a development sector professional with nearly a decade of experience in communications and reporting.

Smog may increase virus deaths," Deteriorating air quality due to smog may increase the death rate among the corona patients, which are again on rise especially in the provincial metropolis and generally across the province./Following this situation, Relief Commissioner, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), issued a letter to all the divisional commissioners to strictly implement the SOPs regarding smog prevention./In his letter issued on 15 October, the relief commissioner said that whereas, there is recorded evidence of persistent deterioration in the Air Quality Index of the city of Lahore in particular and Punjab in general, from satisfactory level to moderately and poorly polluted levels, which is likely to cause breathing discomfort, respiratory tract diseases, including asthma, besides heart related ailments amongst children and older adults specifically and the people of all age in general./It added there was a continuous trend of new COVID-19 patients throughout the province and overlap of conducive conditions for respiratory tract diseases due to smog could exacerbate the casualty rate. It has been corroborated by the World Health Organisation that 4.2 million people die every year as a result of exposure to ambient air pollution and Pakistan was declared the second most polluted country during the year 2019, it added./The letter stated that the Supreme Court of Pakistan and Lahore High Court had already directed the government to take necessary measures to control smog and the Punjab Cabinet, in its 36th meeting, declared smog a calamity under Section 3 of The Punjab National Calamities (Prevention  and  Relief), Act 1958, which has been notified vide Notification No. Smog-2020/10/Coord-1 dated 14.10.2020; hence it is mandatory to take all possible measures to contain and arrest the rapid deterioration of ambient Air Quality Index in territorial limits of the province. The relief commissioner announced that in his opinion there were sufficient grounds to proceed under Section 4 (2) (h) of The Punjab National Calamities (Prevention  and  Relief) Act 1958, as an immediate preventive and speedy remedy and the directions hereinafter appearing are necessary to ensure public safety of smog in the province of Punjab:/'Now therefore, I Babar Hayat Tarar, Relief Commissioner, Government of the Punjab, conserve lives and preempt and mitigate imminent threat in exercise of the powers vested in me under Section 4(2)(h) of The Punjab National Calamities (Prevention  and  Relief) Act, 1958, hereby order that there shall be a complete ban on the following activities in the territorial limits of the Province of the Punjab:/Burning of any type of crop residue, vehicles emitting visible smoke and pollutants, all industries working without emission control deteriorating Air Quality Index, all stone crushers operating without wet scrubbers, burning of all types of solid waste, tyres, rubber and plastics and use of all types of sub-standard fuels, all types of encroachments which hinder the smooth flow of traffic on public roads, including footpaths, any kind of parking which may hamper smooth flow of traffic, all types of activities without proper safeguard which contribute in generating fugitive dust, uncovered and open dumping/storage of construction material, uncovered transportation of construction and other material like sand, mud and cement, any unauthorised activity which may contribute to formation of smog./For brick-kilns, the letter stated that all kilns built on old methodology shall not be allowed to operate wef 7 November, 2020 to 31 December, 2020, as per the order dated 17.09.2020 passed in WP No. 227807/2018 by the Lahore High Court. All kilns built on zigzag methodology shall be allowed to operate as per SOPs devised by Environment Protection Department, Punjab, all kilns have to be converted to zigzag methodology by 31 December, 2020 as per notification issued by Environment Protection Department, Punjab. No kiln built on methodology other than zigzag methodology will be allowed to operate after 31 December, 2020./The letter stated that municipal offences under clauses 22 and 23 of Schedule 15 of Punjab Local Government Act, 2019 which relate to unlawful use of public space, contributing to pollution, will be dealt with under the Act ibid and all the municipal authorities and waste management companies shall ensure water sprinkling on roads, streets and construction sites emanating fugitive dust./This order shall remain in force in the entire province of Punjab with effect from 15 October until further orders. The order shall be given wide publicity in official Gazette, daily newspapers, broadcasting through Radio Pakistan, state TV, other TV channels as news item as well as social media for information of the general public, the letter concluded."
114 illegal treatment centres sealed," The Punjab Healthcare Commission sealed 114 illegal treatment outlets in 12 cities of the province./During the last week, commission's enforcement teams raided 780 treatment centres and sealed 114 outlets where quacks were illegally treating patients. As per data, businesses were found to have been changed on 227 quack premises. Among major actions, 19 quackery centres were sealed in Sialkot, Hafizabad 18, Layyah 17, Bahawalpur 14, 11 each in Multan and Rajanpur and 10 in Jhelum. Also, four outlets each in Lahore and Sheikhupura, Rawalpindi 3 and one was closed down in Kasur. Bilal Medical Store, Al-Sami Homoeopathic Clinic, Chicago Clinic and Ramzan Medical Centre were locked down in the provincial capital./The PHC spokesperson said so fare 84,369 raids had been made and around 28,000 quacks centres sealed. 'A fine of more than Rs570 million was imposed on quacks by the commission's hearing committees,' he added./'Pollution a big threat to human lives'/Ameer Uddin Medical College/Lahore General Hospital Principal Prof Dr Sardar Muhammad Al-freed Zafar has said that environmental pollution and climate change are big threats to the human lives and we all should perform our duties in this regard and take preventive measures./According to a press release issued here on Sunday, he said another threat in the shape of smog also needs immediate attention and people should opt for short and long-term measures to deal with it./Prof Al-freed said that if people decide to remain careful, they can easily avoid air pollution threat. Practical steps would be needed for that. Prof Al-freed stated that, in fact, smog is the merger of fog and smoke and this air pollution started with the use of coal as fuel. He called upon the citizens to drink maximum water and avoid going out of the houses unnecessarily./Similarly, motorcyclists and cyclists should also use face masks. The doors and windows of houses should be kept closed, he said./PU awards PhD/Punjab University (PU) has awarded PhD degree to a student from Nigeria. Olawale Samuel Adeyinka s/o Adeyinka has been awarded a PhD degree in the subject of Molecular Biology after roval of his thesis entitled 'Investigation of Potential Double Stranded Ribonucleic Acid (dsRNA) as Alternate Control Measure for Maize Stem Borers (Chilo Partellus)'. He has completed his PhD under the supervision of National Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology Professor Dr Idrees Ahmad Nasir and Assistant Professor Dr Bushra Tabassam."
Pollutants increase in air to form smog," As the minimum temperature starts to go down, the concentration of pollutants has increased in the air of the provincial capital in the form of smog./The US embassy on Monday at 4pm declared the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city as 152 AQI, which was termed unhealthy. 'Everyone may begin to experience health problem when AQI values are between 151 and 200. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects,' the US embassy website warned./The phenomenon of smog has become a permanent feature of the provincial metropolis and it is necessary for both the government and citizens to take appropriate measures before and during this season for their health./For the past many years, the smog season starts when the minimum temperature drops while the humidity level increases and this time usually comes near the end of October and continues till end of December every year./Met officials predicted that presently the humidity level in the city is around 65 per cent while minimum temperature is dropping every day and till the start of November smog season will start./Air pollution caused by industries, traffic smoke, crop burning and brick kilns is the major contributor of smog, said environmentalists, who believed that a thick layer of smog would take over the city skies in the coming days./Smog contains pollutants which cause eye/throat irritation as well as difficulty in breathing and public should take precautionary measures such as wearing sunglasses and covering mouth and nose with face masks./Naseem-ur-Rehman, a senior EPD official, said smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in the atmosphere, which leave airborne particles (called particulate matter) and ground-level ozone. He said Ozone (O3) is a gas that can form and react under the action of light and that is present in two layers of the atmosphere i.e first high in the atmosphere, which forms a layer that shields the earth from ultraviolet rays and second at the ground level./Usually, in developed world pre-smog health warnings are issued and citizens especially children are directed to stay indoors because smog may result in serious health hazard, especially diseases relating to eyes, lungs and skin, Dr Tariq Chishti, a family physician said./'People with heart and lungs problems such as emphysema, bronchitis and asthma should avoid going out in smog, Dr Chishti said, adding smog can also inflame breathing passages, decreasing the lung's working capacity and causing shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. He said long-term exposure to smog at low levels can affect lungs elasticity and the ability to resist disease, effectively aging lungs prematurely./Children, the elderly, asthmatics and sufferers of other chronic lungs diseases are more susceptible to smog effects than the general population, he maintained. 'There is a dire need for public awareness in this regard as majority of citizens living in low lying and middle class localities do not know much about smog and its dangerous effects,' he said, adding any delay in starting pre-smog activities may turn disastrous./On the other hand, Environmental Protection Department (EPD) Punjab took several pre-smog measures to minimise its impact, which include closure of all brick kilns from November till December 30. Similarly, the department put a ban on burning crops and all field formations are directed to ensure closure of all smoke emitting industrial units./EPD officials said that the AQI status of Town Hall has been recorded at 209 while it was much higher at some points including Township Industrial zone, Data Darbar, Badamibagh, GT Road, Sundar Industrial Estate, Yateem Khana, Thokar Niaz Beig, etc. The EPD officials said the measures taken by the department will help in controlling smog."
Rising pollution," As the temperature goes down and people feel relieved of the sultry and humid season, the creeping smog nullifies the comfort level that a change in weather was expected to bring./Smog has begun to appear on the skies that were left clear and blue after the rainy season. Major cities face a serious problem of air and noise pollution. Both have a negative effect on the health of the citizens, school-going children and elderly alike./The polluted air causes coughing, wheezing and lung complications. Asthma patients suffer the most. Stubble burning in villages after the harvest season is the main source of air pollution in rural areas. Although stubble burning is banned, not many care about it; and nor do the reps of the environment department bother to visit the fields to ensure that no such burning takes place. And in cities, it is the burning of trash and plastics that make the air dense with suit and smoke. For instance, burning of garbage along the Ring Road in the outskirts of Lahore produces clouds of suit and smog that continue to shroud the city./According to one estimate, Lahore city produces about 9,000 tons of waste every day. Underage waste pickers comprising mostly Afghan children and women collect most of it manually before it is carted away to dumpsites. One wonders how effectively the Lahore Waste Management Company, which has a high-sounding name, handles garbage. In November 2018, it was announced that the Punjab government signed an agreement with a Chinese firm to produce 40 MW electricity by setting up an incineration plant on 52 hectares of land near Lahore. The plant was to go into operation within 22 months. Do such plants emit toxic pollutants?/The provincial environment department has warned that smog levels will rise in the coming days. A warning is not enough. The public should be informed what necessary measures the department intends to take to prevent the pollution. What adds to the smog are smoke-emitting vehicles, especially goods carrying overloaded long-body vehicles. Two-stroke engines in Chingchi rickshaws and motorcycles emit smoke and unburnt carbon particles that pollute the air./There was a time when every vehicle had to obtain a fitness certificate periodically to be declared roadworthy. The driver of the vehicle had to demonstrate to the checking staff that all lights on his/her vehicle functioned, the wipers and the indicators operated and that the vehicle didn't emit smoke. One wonders if any such checks are carried out nowadays, as we have done away with most of the civic practices of the past. These days not even traffic wardens check smoke-emitting vehicles./Noise pollution is another nuisance that could be easily controlled if the government recognised its adverse effects on the citizens' health. Human ears are designed to tolerate sound within a certain decibel (dB) level. Up to 60 dB is considered as the normal conversation level. Noise above 80 dB could trigger aggressive behaviour in humans, making them jittery, unfocussed and cantankerous./The main cause of noise pollution are the pressure horns indiscriminately used by buses and truckers. A high-pressure horn touches 200 dB. When blown incessantly on the roads, it could permanently impair the hearing of those living or working nearby. The police could easily check pressure honking if they wanted to. However, the callousness by the motorway police can be observed only a hundred meters from its kiosk on the Multan road near the NHA office. Buses park illegally, wait for passengers by blowing their pressure horns but no motorway police official seems to care. Maybe the motorway police have developed an ear for musical pressure honking./It's time for the environment department to treat noise pollution as harmful for human health as are air and water pollution. Uncontrolled noise pollution could turn us into a noisy nation that's hard of hearing, insensitive, angry and intolerant. When one hears loud, one speaks loudly. Smog is short-lived but noise pollution remains a permanent curse in our lives."
"'Economic, social issues behind stroke'"," In a major medical breakthrough for Pakistan, the global access to catheter-based treatment of Acute ischemic stroke called Mechanical Thrombectomy was emphasised in liaison with US-based society SVIN (Society of vascular and interventional neurology) at Lahore General Hospital./University of Health Sciences Vice-Chancellor Dr Javed Akram and Principal Post Graduate Medical Institute Dr Sardar Muhammad Al-freed Zafar expressed concern over the rapid rise in stroke in Pakistan and talked about its reasons./In order to address the root causes of this disease, it is necessary to establish a system based on economic and social justice as well as to pay full attention to public awareness so that the rate of diseases like stroke can be minimised, they added./They expressed these views while talking to journalists at a workshop held here at the LGH's Neuro Radiology Department on the occasion of World Paralysis Day Thursday./Principal PGMI Prof Al-freed Zafar said that economic and social problems, class conflict, depression, deprivation and other psychological factors were leading to increase in stroke which had led to high blood pressure and diabetes in people. As a result, brain hemorrhage cases have become common and mental and physical disability is increasing rapidly./Dr Umair and Dr Saima said that with government's support and public awareness programmes, patients and their families would no longer face lifelong paralysis after stroke, because treatment options were available in Pakistan. Other doctors advised the general public to avoid fast food and use fresh fruits and vegetables./PHA: To counter increasing air pollution and smog, Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has decided to plant more trees and create more forests./No negligence will be tolerated in the process of trimming, cleaning and watering the trees throughout the city, said PHA DG Jawad Ahmad Qureshi while chairing a meeting here on Thursday./LWMC: Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has released its special cleanliness plan on Eid Miladun Nabi (SAW). The objective is to ensure waste free surroundings in the city, especially on major roads, mosques and routes of processions./Wasa: Following the rising air pollution and smog, Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) organised a bicycle rally here Thursday. Wasa Vice-Chairman Sheikh Imtiaz Mahmood, MD Syed Zahid Aziz and all officers participated in the rally. They cycled around Gaddafi Stadium./Talking to media, Wasa Managing Director said the rally aimed to promote anti-smog activities in the City./PMS officers: A delegation of senior serving and retired officers of Provincial Management Service (PMS) called on Punjab chief secretary at his office here on Thursday. Issues related to problems being faced by PMS officers, capacity-building and improvement in performance came under discussion in the meeting./Mianwali Express: Railway has decided to restore Mianwali Express (147-Up/148-Dn) running between Sargodha, Khushab, Kundian and Mari Indus from October 30 (today) for the passengers. The timing of the train will be according to the current timetable./Trains stop: The railway administration has decided to stop Sir Syed Express (35UP/36DN) between Rawalpindi and Karachi) for two minutes at Hafizabad railway station. Rehman Baba Express (47UP/48DN) between Peshawar and Karachi) will stop for two minutes at Alipur Chatha railway station."
Minister opens tree planting campaign at PU," Punjab Minister for Irrigation Mohsin Laghari has said that lack of forests in Pakistan has created several environmental problems; therefore, there is a need for planting more trees and forestation in Pakistan./He was addressing the inaugural ceremony of a fruit tree planting drive organised by Punjab University's College of Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) at its lawns here Tuesday. The minister inaugurated the tree plantation drive by planting a guava tree. Addressing the ceremony, Mohsin Laghari said the smoke-emitting machinery was polluting our environment and we must create awareness among people and relevant stakeholders to plant trees. Earlier, PU Vice-Chancellor Prof Niaz Ahmed also inaugurated a tree plantation campaign near Gate No 1. In this regard, a ceremony and a walk were organised by the PU Department of Social Work. Addressing the ceremony, Prof Niaz Ahmad said that we must make efforts to keep our environment clean./Another Miyawaki Forest inaugurated/Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) on Tuesday inaugurated another Miyawaki Forest in Johar Town in collaboration with private companies. The PHA management said it had become imperative to plant more trees to eliminate smog and air pollution and PHA is working with private companies to plant eco-friendly artificial forests. On the occasion, PHA officials said that planting of Miyawaki Forest was a method of planting trees in a small area, which become shady trees in a short time."
Fast charging stations to be set up along motorways," As part of the efforts to promote clean and green environment the government is pondering over a proposal to set up fast charging stations for electric vehicles after every 15 to 30 kilometres on major motorways and highways in the country./The climate change ministry is supporting this proposal to help promote the use of electric vehicles with an aim to reduce air pollution and increase eco-friendly traffic on roads./According to the details, the climate change ministry would have no role in setting up fast charging stations but it would extend its technical support to identify the areas where there is more need to promote electric vehicles due to increasing air pollution./The Engineering Development Board would sort out modalities and make final arrangements for the establishment of fast charging stations in the country./The details showed that the ministry has suggested to first installing these stations at motorways M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M9 where there is a heavy flow of vehicular traffic and air pollution in these areas is becoming a serious issue day by day./The Electric Distribution Companies (DISCO) will identify the feeders where electricity load can be managed to support the fast charging stations./The reports have pointed out that the vehicles running on dirty fuels and spewing hazardous smoke in the major cities are one of the main reasons for pollution and smog, so they should be gradually replaced with electric-run vehicles./Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam has maintained that the use of electric vehicles can not only further their climate goals but also has the potential to breathe new life into the national economy."
"Fast charging stations to be set up along motorways, highways"," As part of the efforts to promote clean and green environment the government is pondering over a proposal to set up fast charging stations for electric vehicles after every 15 to 30 kilometres on major motorways and highways in the country./The climate change ministry is supporting this proposal to help promote the use of electric vehicles with an aim to reduce air pollution and increase eco-friendly traffic on roads. According to the details, the climate change ministry would have no role in setting up fast charging stations but it would extend its technical support to identify the areas where there is more need to promote electric vehicles due to increasing air pollution./The Engineering Development Board would sort out modalities and make final arrangements for the establishment of fast charging stations in the country. The details showed that the ministry has suggested to first installing these stations at motorways M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M9 where there is a heavy flow of vehicular traffic and air pollution in these areas is becoming a serious issue day by day./The Electric Distribution Companies (DISCO) will identify the feeders where electricity load can be managed to support the fast charging stations. The reports have pointed out that the vehicles running on dirty fuels and spewing hazardous smoke in the major cities are one of the main reasons for pollution and smog, so they should be gradually replaced with electric-run vehicles./Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam has maintained that the use of electric vehicles can not only further their climate goals but also has the potential to breathe new life into the national economy./'The incumbent government under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan has been taking effective measures to improve air quality by using the best available technologies,' he said."
Smog further intensifies in Punjab,"  The smog phenomenon is likely to further intensify in Lahore and rest of the Punjab in the next couple of days, taking the air pollution level above 400 on air quality index, which can also cause breathing difficulties. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), however, claimed that effective multiple steps were being taken to tackle the smog situation./PDMA Director Nisar Sani said a state-of-the-art monitoring cell had been set up, which was closely monitoring the situation and taking steps in coordination with the allied departments. The latest technology was being used to monitor anti-smog activities in the province./He said transport sector was a major factor behind smog, as it was contributing 42 percent of the total pollution. To control transport related emissions, stringent steps were being taken by the PDMA, along with allied departments, he said, adding that fine amounting to Rs15 million had been imposed on smoke-emitting vehicles in the provincial capital besides issuing around 8,000 challans during the ongoing crackdown./During the last 24 hours only, he said that 270 smoke-emitting vehicles were impounded whereas 338 industrial units were sealed besides arresting 18 violators. Rs1.9 million fine was imposed over violations during the said period and 87 FIRs were got registered./Encroachments were causing congestion and slow traffic flow on roads, he said adding that operation was being conducted against encroachments./Ride sharing concept was being promoted under which single person ride usage would be discourage because when every individual would come on road with a vehicle, it would ultimately increase traffic and more emissions./He said electric vehicles were future of the country and a vital source to tackle environment related issues. The provincial government was working on it to replace old fuel reliant vehicles with environment friendly electric vehicles./In the first phase, he said, locally manufactured electric rickshaws were being introduced which would help in decreasing air pollution in the city. He said the rickshaws would be cheap and economically low cost than traditional rickshaws as these would be saving fuel consumption./He said burning of crops residue was also a major source of smog; however, the PDMA was using the latest satellite images through Suparco to identify stubble burning spots and prompt action was being taken accordingly with the help of revenue and other departments. FIRs were being lodged on stubble burning by the relevant departments, he added./The PDMA official said that water sprinkle activities were also being carried out to minimise dust which was also a source of smog and water sprinkle activities were carried out in 11,259 localities in last three days./Commenting on brick-kilns closure, he said that all kilns operating on old technology had been closed down until Dec 31 and kilns using the latest zig-zag technology were allowed to operate./December 31 was also a deadline for old technology brick kilns to convert to new technology, he said adding that the provincial government was also facilitating the brick-kiln owners of getting loans amounting to Rs 1.2 million to convert their kilns to the latest technology."
Smog causes breathing problems," The anti-smog activities of different departments concerned seem ineffective as the smog level in the provincial metropolis is rising constantly./As per the data provided by EPA, the highest level of AQI on Friday at Town Hall was recorded as 253 while the AQI data of US Embassy witnessed a highest level of 366 during the day./The average AQI level released by US Embassy was 271, which was termed Very Unhealthy. Similarly, as per the IQAir website, the average AQI of Lahore was 282. 'AQI values between 201 and 300 triggers a health alert, meaning everyone may experience more serious health effects,' the US Embassy website advised./Meanwhile, the city witnessed partly cloudy and smoggy weather and citizens visiting all the major crossings and commercial hubs witnessed hazy vision, irritation in throat and eyes and many citizens witnessed difficulty in breathing./These points included Data Darbar, Bati Chowk, Chowk Yateem Khana, More Samanabad, Chauburji, Punjab Civil Secretariat, Circular Road, Ravi Bridge, Shahdara More, Hall Road, Safan Wala Chowk, Faisal Chowk, Davis Road, Railway Station, Link Road Shalimar, Pakistan Mint and many other areas./The 27km long Orange Train's track lacks proper vegetation underneath and at several points road network was yet to be completed. This is also one of the main sources of increasing PM 2.5 in the air./Scattered waste is also another major source of rising dust particulates in the air. Absence of sanitary workers on the streets has resulted in un-lifted waste and heaps of garbage can be found in several localities such as various blocks of Gulshan-e-Ravi, new and old Samanabad, Chauburji, Outfall Road and adjoining localities. Smoke-emitting vehicles were also seen plying on the city roads without any fear. Movement of sand loaded trolleys in the provincial metropolis is also rising the levels of air pollutions especially PM 2.5. Keeping in view all these circumstances, it can be predicted that the smog level will increase in the coming days, if no rain occurs./However, Met officials predicted that a westerly wave was likely to affect Western/Upper parts of the country. They said rain-thunderstorm (with snowfall over the hill) was expected in Islamabad, Potohar region, Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir, Northern Balochistan and Upper Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa./They added that partly cloudy weather with chances of light rain is expected at a few plain areas of Lower Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Central Punjab. Smog is expected in few plain areas of Punjab. Friday's minimum temperature was recorded at Skardu where mercury fell down to -03°C while in Lahore, it was 11.1°C and maximum was 26.4°C./The scribe repeatedly tried to contact Commissioner Lahore and also left messages on his WhatsApp and SMS but he didn't reply. EPD's spokesperson said the department was doing its best as almost 70 percent kilns in the province were already sealed for not using zig zag technology and strict action has already been initiated against the industries causing pollution. He said according to a recent report, vehicular pollution contributed 43 percent while stubble burning was contributing 33 percent to smog."
Out of breath," In Lahore and Faisalabad, people are literally unable to breathe. Worsening air pollution as the winter comes in means that, according to environmental monitors, the quality of air in Lahore was on Friday worse than the quality of air in New Delhi. The particulate matter hanging in the air was measured at levels 12 times over the number declared to be safe by the WHO; and it is possible that this smog which enters our lungs each time we take a breath could worsen further in the days ahead. While the government had claimed it had taken measures to control smog this season and the EPD insists that air quality monitors or mobile phone apps which are showing PM2.5 particles, the most dangerous component of smog at almost 700, are flawed, citizens say that these are indeed accurate numbers. Doctors are reporting that more and more people are coming in with respiratory problems, headaches or issues with breathing. Environmental experts also say that the problem cannot be blamed on the burning crop stubble alone. Although Suparco has picked up multiple sites notably in Punjab where stubble is being burnt, those who have studied pollution say that in Lahore and other large cities vehicular emissions and factory pollution are huge culprits in the problem./So far, the wind is also reportedly not bringing in smog from across the border given its directions. While this has been a problem in the past, it is currently a very small factor in the smog problem. The government has also banned brick kilns from working till the end of December, while at least 80 kilns are being re-built on a zig-zag pattern to help avoid dangerous smoke from being bellowed out. However, what we need is monitoring of the kilns that continue to operate in secrecy, late in the night./Clearly, the steps to manage smog are not working. The situation in Lahore and Faisalabad is extremely dangerous for all the people living in these giant cities. In the past courts have ordered the government in Punjab to do more to manage the smog problem. This has not happened and the levels of smog in Lahore are testament to the administration's inability to manage a very hazardous problem. Cities around the world have adopted drastic measures to deal with air pollution. In some cases, cars with even number plates run on one day, and those with odd numbers the next day. We also need to educate people about planting more trees, avoiding burning rubbish and limiting the use of plastic bags. There has been some success in this, but it is obviously insufficient and we need to do more if we are to breathe safely. This is for us, our children and our future generations."
Joint efforts stressed to control pollution," Smog is a form of air pollution that is exacerbated by climate change and temporary restrictions on industry and transportation are not the answer./These views were expressed by Punjab Finance Minister Makhdoom Hashim Jawan Bakht while addressing a seminar on the role of civil society in controlling pollution organised by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority here on Monday./The shift to industrial technology and electric vehicles purchases require time and resources, which are gradually being ensured. Changing social attitudes is a matter of time for a quick and lasting solution to the problem. Increasing the number of trees in industrial and residential areas, reducing the use of fuel-powered rides and using safe methods for waste disposal can play an important role in controlling pollution, the minister said and added changing social attitudes to control pollution is not possible without the involvement of civil society, educational institutions and the media./Ensure that civil society representatives are aware of the harmful health effects of pollution and discourage the causes of pollution. Students should be made part of tree planting campaigns. NGOs and organisations should promote pollution control activities at the local level, he said./Research scholars introduced ideas for a healthy and clean environment. Other participants of the seminar included Punjab Relief Commissioner Babar Hayat, Director Punjab Disaster Management Authority Raja Khurram Shehzad Umar, Chairman Urban Development Unit, representatives from civil society and media and faculty members from various universities./Punjab Relief Commissioner Babar Hayat while briefing the seminar participants on the causes of increase in air pollution and smog said that the main cause of pollution in cities is smoke from transport which is 43pc of air pollution./Sustainable pollution control measures are being taken at the government level. The process of shifting brick kilns to Zigzag technology is also underway. The Punjab Disaster Management Authority is ensuring operations on a daily basis. Temperature regulation and arson are constantly being monitored through the dashboard. Local-level committees have been hired to control fires in villages and monitor industrial units. The offer of civil society representatives to form committees at the community level in cities is being accepted. Under the Environment Department, the installation of modern machinery for measuring air quality and controlling pollution from different parts of the city is also being ensured, he added."
Air pollution spoils clean environment," Vice Chairman of Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) Malik Abid Hussain has said the air, aquatic and land pollution eats up clean environment resulting in upsurge in diseases that pour extra financial burden on the poor. Multiple difficulties and problems are there as a result of these pollution and to get rid of them every citizen, who loves his country and city, should come forward to shoulder his responsibilities with regard to lessen pollution./He stated this during his visit to a park along Rawal Road to monitor the advancement on the work of naturalizing public parks of the city to which he was given the special task by the Adviser of Chief Minister Punjab Asif Mehmood, who is also the chairman of PHA. He went round the various parts of the park and directed the concerned staff to work hard above the greed of material benefits as they were doing virtue that would give them reward in their eternal life hereafter./He also met with citizens who came over there for recreation and urged them to help PHA make the city's parks, green belts and open spaces attractive with flowering plants and greenery which would consequently lessen the environmental pollution. He said that without public support, PHA could not achieve success in various revolutionary initiatives being taken to task with regard to making our city clean and green./Therefore, Malik Abid Hussain asked, the citizens should fulfill their responsibilities in such a way that they not only plays their role in the protection and nurture of saplings planted in parks and other places under government supervision but they must plants saplings in their houses, streets, markets and open spaces at their own responsibility./He said that PHA would also take several steps to create awareness among the masses about the need and importance of tree plantation. 'Clean and Green Pakistan Movement' demands more than that to meet the success, he mentioned saying more that the use of plastic shopping bags is the largest cause of creating pollution and eating greenery from our earth. Housewives should say no to use plastic bags and they should refuse to accept the eatables that are carried into plastic bags."
Electric vehicles charging stations: Electricity to be provided at low rates,"  As part of the plan to promote the use of electric vehicles, the government has decided to provide electricity at low rates at fast-charging stations to be established at motorways and highways of the country./According to the information shared by the climate change ministry, the inter-ministerial committee has approved the process of registration of electric vehicles and incentives to be offered to those who would start to use electric vehicles in the coming months./Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam held extensive talks with a couple of other federal ministers after which it was decided that the government would start registering electric vehicles with attractive incentives for motorists./The information revealed that the fast-charging stations would be established on the basis of the input to be given by the ministry of science and technology. It also stated that the relevant authorities have proposed 10 percent Custom duty on two and three-wheelers under the incentive package based on some time frame rather than the number of electric vehicles./Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam stated 'The vehicles being run on dirty fuels spew hazardous smoke, which causes pollution and smog, so they will be gradually replaced with hybrid or electric vehicles.' He said the official policy was introduced to promote the use of electric vehicles that would reduce air pollution, control fuel import bills and save about two-thirds of the cost of transportation./'The government has set a target to bring half a million electric motorcycles and rickshaws along with more than 100,000 electric cars, buses, and trucks into the transportation system in the next five years,' he said."
Environmental Pollution: Lahore air quality readings spark dispute,"  In the last few weeks, global air quality markers for various cities including Karachi and Lahore, have been pointing towards alarming levels of environmental pollution in the Pakistani region./The arguably increased pollution has been repeatedly cited to be a leading cause for the spike in skin, respiratory and related diseases being reported the Punjab province. Based on which, multiple international publications have listed the Mughal city, among one of the polluted places in the world. Amid growing concerns, experts have also cautioned motorcyclists to wear pollution masks and avoid travelling to severely polluted areas of the city during hazardous air quality levels./Per local environmentalist Dawar Hameed Butt, a potential cause for Lahore's spiraling air quality, is the continued usage of heavy-duty generators in various power plants, factories, mills and furnaces in the region. 'It is further believed that the advent of winter, followed by burning of wood log, incineration of garbage and emissions from motor vehicles and furnaces have also led to increased toxin levels in the air./Hot smoke entering the fog at night not only causes smog but also air pollution,' told Butt. Worst in the world? Yet however, where the Mughal city's air quality has been subject to international criticism, the question remains whether it truly is one of the most polluted places in the world? Air Quality Index, an American institution monitoring environmental pollution, recently claimed Lahore to have a hazardous particulate matter (PM) rating of 423 at 2.5 metres./Alleging fault in American measuring systems, the Punjab Environmental Protection Minister Bao Muhammad Rizwan claimed the figures to be a misleading and defamatory representation of a country endeavoring against climate change. Partly agreeing with the minister, environmental expert Dawar Hameed Butt said that where international figures are not entirely untrue, they are prone to certain exaggerations./'Pollution levels in Lahore have clearly gone up, but it is still misleading to declare the entire city equally polluted based on data of a specific time and area,' said the environmentalist. 'The US Consulate in Lahore has installed state-of-the-art pollution-testing devices, while the Department of Environmental Protection and some private educational and industrial institutions have also installed devices in various areas. Data on the US devices is updated every hour./So instances when the pollution rate is high, media instead of averaging 24 hour readings, immediately starts sharing data that is inaccurate and not truly representative of the city's air quality,' he added. Although Minister Bao Muhammad Rizwan has claimed that accurate representation of the country's air quality index can be found on the official website of the environmental protection department, certain NGOs have contested the department's readings for gross inaccuracies./On the other hand, the department, in response, has alleged American air quality testing equipment to be incapable of differentiating between smog and pollution. Per Rizwan, their devices have been repaired and properly calibrated for securing regional data. While more than 30 devices have been procured recently at the cost of Rs25 to 30 million each./'The project is now being completed with the help of World Bank, and new devices are to be installed in multiple cities in the next six months,' the minister told. Environmentalist Dawar Hameed Butt however, believes the department's claims about American equipment to be a scapegoating attempt by the government in absence of actual solutions. 'The government should instead focus on providing people access to affordable clean fuel, especially during winters to cut down log and coal burning. Similarly, LNG should be brought to Pakistan as soon as possible, solar energy should be promoted and above all, the sources of pollution should be duly monitored for a greener tomorrow,' he told The Express Tribune."
Bad air," Lahore has reached hazardous air quality levels, in keeping with the annual smog nightmare the city goes through during the winter season. In fact, Pakistan as a country faces a severe air pollution challenge; the issue exceeds European levels by almost 10-20 times, and sometimes even more. According to the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI), air pollution causes 59,241 deaths in Pakistan each year. Even when lives are not directly lost, millions more continue to suffer long-term breathing ailments as a result of the high levels of air toxicity. For example, in Lahore, in the last half a decade, a smog cloud has continued to engulf the city throughout the year, which gets worse in the winter months. There is a need to set up monitoring mechanisms and target numbers which must be achieved by taking action against polluting industries. This cannot be done without taking a comprehensive approach towards curbing pollution./Over the years, there has been a failure to come up with strict domestic regulatory frameworks, without much regard to the fact that this has led directly to a spike in respiratory illnesses and thousands of premature deaths every year. What was once a blanket of fog, a traffic hazard at its worst, is now a death trap for the public. And, contrary to what was the most popular theory behind smog, crop burning is not enough to explain the intense concentration of pollutants in major cities. It is the absence of environment-friendly industrialisation and transport policies that are the biggest factors for the rise in urban areas such as Lahore. But, we have seen how governments had rather blame each other instead of coming up with policies to regulate smoke and pollutant emissions. What Pakistan needs is measures to look for a way to stop our dependence on a coal-friendly energy policy and a car-friendly transport policy./The impact of smog on respiratory illnesses is well-known and experienced by all. Disturbingly, a few years back Unicef unveiled research that said that air pollution can damage a child's brain forever. The South Asian region has the largest proportion of babies living in an area where air pollution is at least six times higher than international limits. If that doesn't make our countries' leadership focus on combating air pollution, nothing will. Which means we need a larger push by the people of the region - demanding their governments do better and do right by them. Environmental activists in Pakistan say that there is woefully little attention paid to air pollution - and that too just when smog season starts. Needless to say, much more is required. We need to ensure our children breathe in air that doesn't kill them. We need to demand this from those that lead us."
Kissan body stresses steps for clean environment," Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee (PKRC) has organised a demonstration for implementation of policies for climate justice. The call for the demonstration in Asian countries for 'Action for Climate Justice Now' was given by Asian People's Movement for Debt and Development (APMDD)./Farooq Tariq, General Secretary PKRC, said the year 2020 will go down in history as one of the most horrific years for humanity./'And even as we all struggled to survive and overcome Covid-19 and its impacts - we had to also simultaneously battle other crises - of deepening economic injustice and inequality, of the rise in violence and authoritarianism, and of an escalating climate emergency. We are now at the threshold of the most critical decade for climate action,'/he said and added, 'This decade is our last chance to prevent run-away climate catastrophe and stabilise rise in global temperature to the safest level still possible - below 1.5 degrees Celsius.'/He called on the Pakistani masses to join hands to begin 2021 and new decade with sounding the alarm about the climate emergency and demand climate justice from governments and corporations. Pakistan emits only a tiny portion of the global greenhouse gases but is predicted to be among the hardest hit by extreme weather such as droughts and floods./Untimely rains, floods, increasing temperatures and untimely change of seasons have incurred huge losses to peasants in Pakistan, he said. 'Mega projects like Orange Train and big dams won't be able to reduce the negative impacts of environmental pollution. Orange Line Metro Train has yet to draw commuters as envisioned. Only about 0.6pc of Lahore's population (62,000 people) use the train at the moment - with just 24pc of the trains' capacity being used,' he said./Millions have developed breathing problems due to smog and toxic air, said PKRC member Saima Zia and added air quality index (AQI) of Lahore and Faisalabad was worse than New Delhi in early November last year./Citing Pakistan's Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), she said that the institution found 28 of the 36 districts in Punjab were witnessing increasing levels of smog in November 2020./Health experts have noticed a serious increase in respiratory diseases, eye infections and allergies in Lahore in the past four years. Research has also shown that polluted air causes depression and other physical illnesses./Around three million die every year from air pollution, she said. Others who spoke on the occasion include Nasir Iqbal, Riffat Maqsood and Muhammad Ashiq."
Cycling Gala held to promote healthy activity in citizens," The Islamabad Chamber of Commerce  and  Industry (ICCI) in collaboration with Islamabad Cycling Association (ICA) organised ICCI International Cycling Gala to promote healthy activity among the citizens. Apart from local and national cyclists, the cyclists from United States of America, Spain, Brazil and other countries also participated in the event, says a press release./Sardar Yasir Ilyas Khan, President, Islamabad Chamber of Commerce  and  Industry inaugurated the Cycle Race at D-Chowk, Islamabad and distributed shields, awards and cash prizes amongst the winners at the closing ceremony. Fatma Azim Senior Vice President, Abdul Rehman Khan Vice President ICCI, Muhammad Ejaz Abbasi, Hafiz Bilal, Muhammad Shakir, Umar Hussain, Javed Iqbal, Khalid Chaudhry and others were present at the occasion./The cycle race started from D-Chowk, Islamabad and finished at F-9 Park, Islamabad covering the route of Jinnah Avenue, Centaurs Flyover, MacDonald's Chowk, Service Road East F-10 and Bolan Gate (F-10 Side)./Men (Professional) 17 years above, men amateur 40 above, women amateur 17 above, boys and girls from 9 years to 16 years and toddlers/tricycles 8 years and below participated in the Cycle Race and Ride./Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Sardar Yasir Ilyas Khan emphasized that the government should focus on promoting cycling in major cities as it would help reduce congestion, air pollution and CO2 emissions besides improving the health of riders. He said that promoting cycling would be very beneficial for society as it would regular cycle riders from serious diseases including stroke, heart attack, some cancers, depression, diabetes, obesity and arthritis. He said that promotion of cycling would develop a healthy nation that would contribute more effectively towards the economic development of the country./Sardar Yasir Ilyas Khan said that many countries including China, Japan, Norway, UK, Sweden, Germany and Denmark have promoted cycling in their citizens to promote healthy lifestyle and reduce congestion, air pollution and harmful emissions, therefore, he stressed that the Government of Pakistan should also take initiatives to promote cycling in major cities so that our citizens could reap benefits of this healthy mode of transport. He said that the government was spending billions of rupees on providing healthcare services to the people and it could make significant cut in this expenditure by promoting cycling culture in the country. He urged that CDA should develop dedicated cycle tracks and jogging tracks in Islamabad so that the citizens could use them for exercise and develop a healthy lifestyle."
Air pollution," Karachi's air quality has reduced drastically over the last year. It appears that pollution levels in the city are actually getting worse. According to a WHO report which was published in 2017, around 4.7 percent of Pakistanis die due to lung disease and around 0.5 percent die due to asthma./The authorities concerned should take significant initiatives to control air pollution."
"Barbecue, lightning fire banned at Margalla Hills"," The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) has imposed section 144 and prohibited barbecue and campfires in the vicinity of the Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) for next three months./According to the official order issued by the IWMB, there is a complete ban on smoking, bonfires, burning of garbage, carrying flammable items such as lighters, charcoal, matchstick and bottles of petrol and kerosene oil in the MHNP./It said that lightning fire often leads to forest fire especially in the summer season when the rising temperature further aggravates the situation./An official said the ban on lightning fire has been imposed due to the fact that the warm conditions in the upcoming summer months often caused fire incidents that ultimately not only resulted in loss of tree cover but also damaged natural habitats of the wildlife animals./'We are developing a mechanism to prevent fire incidents in MHNP for which the coordination of the local people and visitors is vital otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the desired results,' he said./Some 300 personnel of the civic agency and IWMB are there to keep vigil but the seasonal fires are still a big issue that poses threats to the vegetative cover and wildlife species in the Margalla hills./Currently, 10 pickets have been set up and staff deployed on ground and prepared to tackle the fire incidents. Spreading over 12,605 hectares, the MHNP witnesses fire incidents every year. Sometimes bigger and more frequent fires damage trees and plants besides adding to the air pollution and rising temperature in the area./The IWMB chairperson said the ban on lightning fire would expire on June 30 and it would hopefully help prevent fire incidents in the summer season."
Faulty planning in power sector to deepen environmental woes," Civil society activists have demanded the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate the failures of planning and regulatory processes aimed at making the power sector technically efficient, financially sustainable and responsive to the imperatives of climate change./They criticised the 'misplaced' priorities set in the Integrated Generation Capacity Enhancement Plan (IGCEP)-2047 and Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) reforms. They were addressing an online press conference organised by the Alliance for Climate Justice and Clean Energy on Friday./Despite the coal moratorium announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan in December 2020, they said, the rising share of coal power in national energy mix under the IGCEP-2047 did not make any sense./Owing to the opaque, arbitrary and exclusionary nature of the decision-making processes in the power sector, power plans such as the IGCEP-2047 have ended up being least sensitive to the needs of end-consumers. These plans affected communities, were too ambitious in forecasting electricity demand, were riddled with flawed economic reasoning and reckless in prioritising dirty fossil-fuels, particularly coal-based power in the national energy mix./The CTBCM reforms though well intentioned, might lead to more of the same, as they ignore the interests of regular consumers while favouring corporate and industrial entities, they said./Muhammad Ali Shah, Chairperson of Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, said the rising share of indigenous coal as envisioned under IGCEP-2047 would exacerbate the existing social, economic and environmental problems being faced by the local people of Thar due to ongoing projects of coal mining and thermal power plants in the area./'Forcible land acquisition for coal power projects has already turned the life of Tharis into a living hell, imposing involuntary displacement on them, robbing them of their gowchar, common grazing land-crucial to their livelihood - and exposing them to groundwater contamination and numerous diseases induced by the air pollution caused by ever-increasing number of coal power plants in the region,' he said./He criticised the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) for not accounting for social and environmental costs of ongoing coal power projects while setting the priority to enhance the use of indigenous coal under IGCEP-2047./Haneea Isaad, Research Associate at Rural Development Policy Institute (RDPI), said the end-consumers and the communities adversely impacted by power projects had invariably been given lowest priority in the power sector's plans./'Therefore, they had never benefited from any such plans, be it the power purchase agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), long-term capacity expansion planning or setting up wholesale markets through the CTBCM mechanism.'/She said considering indigenous coal as cheaper source of energy without ascertaining the economic value of the social and environmental externalities induced by it was nothing but a myth. To lower the overall basket price of electricity, she urged the authorities concerned to prioritise cost-effective and environment-friendly resources such as solar and wind power plants into the country's generation mix./Zain Moulvi, Legal and Policy Analyst at the Alternative Law Collective (ALC) said the mishandling of the IPPs' issue, the controversies around the IGCEP-2047, and the limitations of the CTBCM market reform plans all pointed to misplaced priorities and systemic shortcomings in the planning and regulatory processes./He said there was an urgent need to restructure this process to better reflect the principles of democratic consultation and sustainable development. 'Reforms must take an integrated approach that is responsive to the long-term needs of the affected communities and the average citizen to ensure that the future of the power sector was based on economically, environmentally, and socially responsible policy-making,' he concluded."
Punjab shifts all kilns on Zigzag technology to fight pollution," Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Mailk Amin Aslam on Sunday revealed that all brick kilns in Punjab province, which accounted for significant portion of choking air pollution, have been shifted on zig-zag technology, a move that will significantly help mitigate the province's air pollution woes./In total, 7896 traditional brick kilns, which ran on smog-causing fossil fuels, in the entire Punjab province, have been converted in a period of six months to the environmentally smart zig-zag technology that help reduce breath-chocking carbon emissions by 60 percent and save energy by 30 percent, the PM's aide said, according to a press statement issued here from the Ministry of Climate Change./Malik Amin Aslam, who played a vital role behind the shift, said, ""It's indeed a great milestone the Punjab government has achieved in such a short period of time to fight spiking air pollution in the province.'/All other provinces, where air pollution has become a leading cause of re-mature deaths and various health diseases, should also follow the suit to fight environmental degradation and protect public health, he urged./There are around 20,000 traditional brick kilns in the country, which use mainly coal, rubber and shoe soles as fuel, emitting lethal back carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Most are located around urban areas and contribute significantly to air pollution./The country's brick sector is highly unregulated and uncoordinated but is responsible for around 1.5% of the Gross Domestic Product./Malik Amin Aslam said that the traditional brick production consists of hand-made bricks, which are baked in Fixed Chimney Bull's Trench Kilns (FCBTK), a widely used brick firing technology in South Asia, ranked as the most contaminating techniques for brick production, resulting in myriad adverse social and environmental effects including air pollution, climate change, cardio-respiratory diseases, land use impacts and deforestation./The traditional kiln type and fuels burned, make it difficult to accurately identify the make-up of air pollutants emitted by the sector, but they likely include sulphur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), forms of particulate matter (PM) including black carbon, and additional compounds released by burning coal and other fuels, he highlighted./The PM's aide further emphasized that black carbon a major component of soot from the brick kilns) is produced as a result of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass. Besides, it is known for planet-warming impact on climate 460 to 1500 times stronger than CO2./When accumulated on ice and snow, the black carbon is so adverse that it spiked both atmospheric warming and increases the melting rate, and hence is a threat to glaciers in the country's north, he elaborated."

Also that these new kilns running on zigzag technology offer hope as they are environment friendly and make a strong business case, "" Malik Amin stressed."
AJK elections," I was born on November 15, 1924, and I am not sure if I will get to see my next birthday. Extreme weather conditions, air pollution, and, on top of that, the coronavirus pandemic are too much for my age. Global warming seems to have caused abrupt weather patterns - extreme heat, droughts and flash floods. Covid-19, on the other hand, has affected the world in unimaginable ways. Despite the availability of the vaccine, this deadly virus continues to wreak havoc across the world. Our leadership, however, seems too busy with more important matters such as fighting with political opponents. While they should be following SOPs to encourage people to do the same, they do just the opposite. They hold rallies and meetings where a majority don't wear masks or follow social distancing. Even though the number of Covid-19 cases has gone down, the virus is still here. No disease can be eliminated if people do not work in complete unity. The carelessness of a few can lead to a disastrous situation, resulting in a large number of deaths and disruption of economic activities./At present, political parties are more interested in winning the upcoming elections in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). I wish our politicians had any regard for people. At this time, election campaigns can lead to a surge in coronavirus cases. Our country cannot afford it. It will be nearly impossible for us to manage the load of critically ill patients. Our politicians must realise that postponing the elections is better than dealing with crowded hospitals."
Funds released for 200 electric buses: minister," The Punjab government has released Rs3.4 billion for procurement of 200 eco-friendly electric buses to reduce air pollution./Chairing a meeting held at Civil Secretariat on Friday in connection with better transport facilities in Punjab, Punjab Finance Minister Hashim Jawan Bakht observed that the eco-friendly buses would be run in major industrial and commercial cities of Punjab to control the serious situation of air pollution. He said the buses had been selected which would not only be smoke-free but also be reasonable in operational cost. Other eco-friendly technologies will be used later to reduce air pollution, he said./The meeting was attended by Provincial Minister for Transport Jahanzeb Kachchi, Adviser to Chief Minister on Economic Affairs Dr Salman Shah, Finance Secretary Iftikhar Ali Saho, Planning and Development Secretary Imran Sikandar, transport secretary, Punjab Mass Transit Authority managing director, Chief Executive Officer Lahore Transport and other relevant officers. The transport secretary informed the meeting that electric buses had been used for public transport in developed countries since 2015. The countries in which the electric buses are being used include China, India, Europe and the United States. The major manufacturers of these buses include the companies from France, Germany, China and the United States. He said that under the Electric Vehicle Policy, a target of 1,000 buses was set in Pakistan for the next five years. 'We have to complete 50% of our target by 2030,' he said. Provincial Minister for Transport Jahanzeb Kachchi called on the private sector to invest in environment-friendly transport./The finance minister directed the transport secretary to formulate transport models for Faisalabad and Bahawalpur after Lahore. 'Create opportunities for the companies that are aware of use and usefulness of modern technology in view of the future expansion of the scope of electric transport. Green financing can also be used with the subsidised model of transport,' he said."
Pakistani children among most affected in South Asian climate crisis,"Young people living in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh are among those at most risk of the impacts of climate change, threatening their health, education, and protection, according to a first-ever UNICEF report launched on Friday./In addition, Nepal and Sri Lanka are among the top 65 countries most impacted globally. 'The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis: Introducing the Children's Climate Risk Index' (CCRI) is UNICEF's first child-focused climate risk index./It ranks countries based on children's exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services./Pakistan, Bangladesh Afghanistan, and India are among four South Asian countries where children are at extremely high risk of the impacts of the climate crisis, with a ranking of 14, 15, 15, and 26 respectively. While Nepal is ranked 51, Sri Lanka is at 61st place./Bhutan is ranked 111, with children at relatively lower risk. Approximately 1 billion children live in one of the 33 countries are classified as 'extremely high-risk', including the four South Asian countries. 'For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia. Droughts, floods, air pollution, and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless and hungry, and without any healthcare and water,' said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia./'Together, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have created an alarming crisis for South Asian children. The time to act is now - if we invest in water, healthcare, and education, we can protect their futures from the impacts of a changing climate and degrading environment.'/The report found that these South Asian children are in constant danger from riverine floods and air pollution, but also that investments in child health, nutrition, and education can make a significant difference to protect children from climate change./South Asia is home to over 600 million children and has the highest number of young people globally. South Asian countries are among the most vulnerable globally to the impacts of climate change. Extreme climate-related events - heatwaves, storms, floods, fires, and droughts - affect more than half of the region's population every year and continue to burden South Asian countries' economies./Rising global temperatures and changing weather patterns have put the futures of millions of children living in climate-vulnerable areas in South Asia at constant risk. Worse, before they can recover from one disaster, another one strikes, reversing any progress made./The report also reveals a disconnect between where greenhouse gas emissions are generated, and where children are enduring the most significant climate-driven impacts. The 33 extremely high-risk countries, including four from South Asia, collectively emit just 9 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Conversely, the 10 highest emitting countries collectively account for nearly 70 per cent of global emissions. 'The frightening environmental changes we are seeing across the planet are being driven by a few but experienced by many in South Asia,' added Laryea-Adjei./'We must urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work together as a community to build greater resilience in South Asia. Children and young people are at the heart of this change, with almost half of 1.8 billion people below the age of 24 in South Asia.'/Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes, and diseases, among other factors. Without the urgent action required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally, children will continue to suffer the most."
Tree plantation drive launched in IPH," Dean Institute of Public Health, Prof Dr Zarfishan Tahir has said that environmental and air pollutions are serious threats for human health and causing adverse impact on human life, tree plantations at massive level can overcome these issues effectively./She further said that according to the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Chief Minister, tree plantation campaign in the Institute of Public Health (IPH) has been launched to make the environment green and pollution free./She stated this while leading an awareness walk to highlight the importance of tree plantation at the institute. Besides, Dr. Saima, Dr. Anjum Razzaq, Dr. Rukhsana, all the faculty members and the staff participated in the walk. Including Dean, Dr. Zarfishan, all the faculty members planted saplings to celebrate tree plantation campaign./On this occasion, Dr. Zarfishan was of the view that environment and air pollution creating serious problems for human life and respiratory diseases, asthma, infection of eyes, skin allergy are increasing due to bad effects of pollution. She said that Pakistan is very short of forests and it is the duty of everyone to plant trees as much as possible./Dr. Zarfishan further said that present government, especially Prime Minister is taking practical steps to increase and cultivate forests in the country. Awareness campaigns also being conducted to convince the masses to participate enthusiastically in tree plantation campaign so that the set targets could be achieved with the cooperation of people. She said that IPH is ready to play its role effectively in this regard."
Pollution impacts," Among the most pernicious maladies that today's world faces is air pollution. Now, new research has confirmed that exposure to air pollution is linked to increased severity of mental illnesses. According to reports, this is the finding of the most comprehensive study of its kind which involved 13,000 people in London. Even if a relatively small increase in exposure to nitrogen dioxide takes place, it may lead to a 32 percent increase in the risk of needing community-based treatment and an 18 percent increase in the risk of being admitted to hospital. If this is the condition in developed countries, the situation in developing countries must be even worse. In countries such as Pakistan, air pollution is increasing day-by-day and the occurrence of mental illnesses may be related to this type of pollution in the country too. The research suggests that a reduction in air pollution could benefit millions of people./This study has a particular lesson for Pakistan as this pollution is modifiable if the concerned authorities in the country take it seriously. Reducing population-level exposure to air pollution in cities and towns should be one of the top priorities of the federal and provincial governments in Pakistan. The government must explore what interventions are helpful in fighting air pollution. For example, expanding low-emission zones is one such remedy that the research recommends. In Pakistan, one of the primary causes of air-pollution is toxic emission from motor vehicles. In most cities and towns of the country, there is hardly any control on such emissions as the concerned departments do not check and implement the required standards of vehicle fitness. Then there is untreated smoke emitted by factories, foundries, and brick kilns. Increasing use of air-conditioning and power generators is also compounding the problem of air pollution./When mental health hazards emerge as a result of people's exposure to such pollution, the correlation is not always established and medical interventions at the individual level become quite difficult. There are other physical ailments also that spiral from air pollution such as respiratory diseases and skin and eye problems. Research shows that even at low levels of air pollution there are significant effects on mental health. Anxiety and depression are among the foremost mental conditions that people suffer from, and in Pakistan too these are now more frequent than ever before. A mentally and physically healthy nation is the sign of a country at ease with itself. If dirty air contributes to mental disorders and leads to increased suicides, the top decision-makers of the country must take note and do something about it. Finally, there is also evidence that air pollution is adversely affecting intelligence level in children and youth and is also linked to dementia in old age. All this calls for an immediate action."
CSOs back KP government efforts for clean environment," Civil society organisations (CSOs) working for a clean environment have termed the recent directive by Peshawar Division Commissioner Riaz Khan Mehsud to take stringent action against smoke emitting-industries a great achievement of the citizens./A communication by the Sarhad Conservation Network (SCN) and Peshawar Clean Air Alliance (PCAA), which are making collective efforts for a healthier air quality, said on Thursday the citizens of Peshawar had suffered from adverse effects of uncontrolled industrial and vehicular emission in terms of increasing cardiac and respiratory diseases, cancer, deteriorating memory and cognitive functions and loss in economic terms./It said these industrial units had been operating without appropriate technology adoption for control of hazardous and life threatening emissions./They are presently in the process of installing air monitors donated by philanthropists to generate real time data of air quality in Peshawar to generate an evidence-based policy, added the press release./Besides, public interest litigation has been initiated against a few industries operating without a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) and in violation of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, which is mandatory under the law. The EPA needs public support to implement the policy of a cleaner city./Environmental Protection Tribunal (EPT) have been moved against these industries for operating against a Peshawar High Court order which states, 'No one shall be allowed to run Industrial Unit without issuance of proper NOC and environmental Management Plan (EMP) from the concerned quarter'./The communication said the provincial government agencies should ensure that all air polluting industries like chipboard and steel should strictly adhere to the National Environmental Quality standards (NEQS) and obtain NOCs from EPA which is mandatory as per KP Environmental Protection Act 2014./As per EPA sources, none of these factories have obtained mandatory Operational NOC. The EPA lab results show some industries to be emitting above 25000 PPM against a permissible limit of 300ppm./The SCN-PCAA proposed a broad-based commission comprising independent environmental experts from the Environmental Engineering Department at the University of Engineering and Technology , experts from Environmental Science Department, University of Peshawar, environmental economics experts at IMSciences, public health experts, environment law experts and senior citizens./The communication said the SCN-PCAA members believed that environmental expert and advisor to KP government Dr Shafiqur Rehman was the best suited person to lead this commission which should support the government and the EPA at both regulatory and policy levels./It said the KP government policy on a healthy environment and strict measures to implement this agenda deserved public support through awareness and advocacy at the grassroots level to make it a success./The communication said the CSOs planned to support the ongoing clean air drive through public awareness campaigns and media group meetings for a healthy environment and eventually to pass a Clean Air Act KP bill in the assembly."
"One in two Pakistanis has hypertension and every third person is with heart disease, seminar told"," 'Heart disease is the world's number one killer and is responsible for 19 million premature deaths (more than 80 per cent of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income developing countries) and results in 31 per cent of all global deaths. The incidence of heart diseases is steadily rising, so much so that 23.6 million people are predicted to die from cardiovascular diseases by 2030.'/These statistics were shared by Prof Faisal Ahmed, eminent consultant cardiologist and head of the department, Liaquat National Hospital  and  Tabba Heart Institute, Karachi, during a public awareness seminar organised by Neurospinal  and  Cancer Care Postgraduate Institute in collaboration with prestigious Amarant pharmaceuticals on World Heart Day on Wednesday./The seminar highlighted and raised awareness of maintaining good heart health and provided advice on what to do if a heart attack was suspected. It also provided the public with tips on how to improve their heart health by sharing information about heart conditions and to help people live longer, more heart-healthy lives./Focusing on cardiovascular diseases in Pakistan, Prof Faisal Ahmed said: 'About 25 per cent of adult Pakistanis have diabetes. Obesity is also on the rise, with 20 per cent of Pakistanis being obese or overweight (severe obesity leads to structural and functional changes of the heart, which causes heart failure). One in two Pakistanis has hypertension and every third person is with heart disease. Forty-two per cent of those do not even know they have high blood pressure, which leads to strokes, CVD and kidney disease, and these conditions are causes of the high rate of heart attacks and killing 400,000 innocent Pakistanis annually.'/'It has many causes: from smoking in all forms, including the fastest growing sheesha, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, coronary artery diseases, heart rhythm problems, heart defects you're born with, heart valve disease, to air pollution, and less common conditions such as Chagas disease and heart infections,' he explained./Prof Faisal further said that prevention is better than cure, but we do not pay attention to it. He pointed out that cardiovascular disease in Pakistan and across the world is on the rise, and although it can often be treated, primary prevention is the best way to reverse this trend./The federal and provincial health authorities are requested to set up preventive cardiology units at district levels, preventive cardiology units will focus on lowering patients' risk of developing heart disease and having a first heart attack or stroke while also preventing further issues in people who already have cardiovascular disease./In the wake of the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, 'Covid-19 has only been more heartbreaking for this figure as it has made 520 million people living with heart diseases, more vulnerable to developing severe forms of the coronavirus and now taking care of their heart is more important than ever before,' Prof Faisal added./'Remember, missing medical appointments, lack of contact with family and friends or reduced physical exercise can lead to heart diseases. It is important to avoid skipping any medication that you may be on, and do not ignore common symptoms like chest pain and tightness, shortness of breath, nausea, indigestion, heartburn and pain that spreads to the arm. Don't forget to monitor vitals like blood pressure and blood sugar regularly, So, don't let Covid-19 stop you from attending your regular check-ups especially if you have underlying health conditions like heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure or obesity.'/His recommendations included limiting the intake of ready-made snacks which are often high in sugar, fat and salt; ensuring the intake of at least five servings of fresh fruits and vegetables a day; reducing salt consumption to one teaspoon a day and preparing meals at home for school or work./Other suggestions are quitting smoking and increasing activity by limiting the time spent watching TV or using the computer, and getting involved in outdoor activities such as cycling, gardening, or walking and above all a calm sleep for at least eight hours, concluded by Prof Faisal./Mr Iftikhar H. Syed, renowned entrepreneur  and  philanthropist, thanked the participants and promised that they would initiate soon a very comprehensive and free campaign to detect and treat heart diseases in rural areas for less privileged communities because this was his social/responsibility./The question-answer session with the panel of doctors saw a lot of queries about day-to-day life and different faces of heart diseases, especially in women and younger population."
Three EPA air quality monitors out of order,"As smog season is approaching, three air quality monitors of Punjab Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are out of order, The News has learnt./Sources in EPA revealed six air quality monitoring stations are present in the provincial metropolis out of which five are fixed stations and one is mobile monitoring station. The fixed stations are installed in Township, Met office, EPA Head office at Qaddafi Stadium, Town Hall and Ghurki Hospital in Wahgah Town area./Sources said air quality monitors installed at EPA head office, Wagah and Met office are out of order while the stations at Township and Town Hall are working. The mobile air quality unit is also working, sources said./The most important thing, the sources revealed is that none of the five fixed installed air quality monitors has the ability to measure the parameter of PM 2.5, which is the basic cause of smog in the provincial capital. However, the mobile air quality monitoring unit is being able to collect the data of PM 2.5. Sources said the out of order stations are not working because of petty issues such as air-conditioning unit of the monitor installed at EPA head office is not working, the electricity connection of the air quality monitor installed at Met office is not stable due to frequent tripping it restarted again and again so it was closed down while the internet connection charges of these mobile air quality units are also unpaid. Sources said the government allocated only Rs40,000 per year for repair and maintenance to the EPA's laboratory section, which is not enough. They said the annual repair and operating cost of each monitor is in millions but the government didn't allocate any funds in this regard./On the other hand, as the smog season is near, Chairman Judicial Water and Environmental Commission Justice (retd) Ali Akbar Qureshi held a meeting on smog prevention here on Thursday. The meeting was attended by newly-appointed Secretary Environment Syed Mubashir Hussain. Justice (retd) Ali Akbar Qureshi directed the EPD to be proactive in controlling smog. He said teams should be made to prevent smog. He said the teams should also ensure that all kilns were converted to Zigzag technology. The commission also passed instructions for taking strict action against smoke-emitting vehicles. It was decided to take action against industries that burn crop residues and cause air pollution. No negligence or omission will be tolerated with regard to smog, Ali Akbar Qureshi said./During the meeting, Managing Director Wasa told the commission that he has already instructed his team to stop using heavy machinery from October 15, 2021. He said all Wasa staff was directed to come to office on bicycles one day a week from October 31, 2021./When contacted, the newly-appointed secretary EPD didn't attend the call and no reply was received from his side. The News then talked to EPA's Lahore Laboratory head Farooq Alam who said that his duty was to monitor air quality and issue data to the department head. He said implementation of smog SOPs was not his work./He said he took charge of his office on June 22, 2021 and since then he started repair of the closed stations and brought two of them to work. He said the remaining stations will also be in working condition soon. To a question about the air quality data issued by private companies and individuals, he said the data of any individual or company was not reliable. He said the media should only rely on the official data released by EPA during smog. Meanwhile, Minister for EPD M Rizwan held a meeting on dengue during which he said cooperation of all stakeholders was obligatory for effective control of dengue. The minister was informed that surveillance teams were inspecting various hotspots to check the dengue larva. The meeting was informed that 27 notices were also issued while 5 FIRs also registered against relevant persons for violating of dengue prevention measures. The minister asked the department to launch campaign for dengue control through print, electronic and social media."
Travel on potholed underpass a nightmare," A ten minutes drive on potholed Islamabad Expressway's PWD underpass has become a harrowed experience for harried commuters./The CDA's tall claims of completing development projects take a big hit when one looks at the construction of the PWD underpass./The relevant authorities have failed to meet the deadline for completion of the PWD underpass on the Islamabad Expressway at least thrice./Despite the passage of more than four months to the first deadline of June 2021, no chance of its completion looks imminent right now. Traffic snarls and potholes have turned the PWD service road into a living hell as the pace of construction on the Rs428 million project is deadly slow owing to poor or rather compromised oversight by the Capital Development Authority (CDA)./Dust emanating from underpass roads is taking a heavy toll on the health of commuters. When a vehicle passes through underpass roads, billows of dust leave commuters gasping for breath. The underpass especially the service area connecting the highway with the PWD road is enveloped in a layer of dust. The road rather bumpy patch which is home to a host of many upscale city residential clusters is a nightmare for motorists, pedestrians, and residents alike as deep ditches and potholes, especially on the service lanes of the underpass, have taken a heavy toll on commuters./Perennial gridlocks on these jerky roads have become a nightmare for commuters who travel on these stretches on regular basis and bear physical as well as financial loss. The entire area is now littered with dust, be it homes, roads, or trees. 'The CDA authorities and the so-called private contractor have literally reduced our lives to a virtual hell. The bumpy rides and rough travel we face due to deep potholes and uneven surface of the so-called underpass and its service lanes is enough to increase our resentment against the contractors as well as CDA,' Ahmed who is also a regular commuter here, rued./'I have seen many two-wheeler drivers and pillion riders falling in the middle of the road and sustaining injuries,' he added./According to experts, dust on roads contributes to air pollution./They said dust is the main component of suspended particulate matter (SPM) that pollutes the air./The problems like pollution are a part of the development but say that it is also the government's duty to ensure timely completion of the projects rather than allowing the unlimited delays and prolonging the miseries of the people through the diseases caused by air pollution./The doctors said that number of patients with respiratory problems has increased manifold./Dr. Asif Chatta said, ""constant exposure to dust can lead to respiratory problems.' 'Diseases like lower respiratory tract infection can become common. Dust can also trigger asthma attacks,"" he added./The Capital Development Authority (CDA) through its contractors started construction of the PWD underpass towards the end of last year, to ease the flow of traffic on the Islamabad Expressway. -APP/The expressway is one of busiest roads and traffic jam is a routine on it particularly from Koral to G.T. Road as this road was not widened in accordance with the need of the hours./When contacted in this regard, an official of the civic body said that work on the said project was continued and will be completed soon."
Activities increasing smog intensity banned: minister," Punjab Minister for Disaster Management Mian Khalid Mahmood has said the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has banned all activities that could increase intensity of smog due to climate change./The minister said smog in Pakistan was usually caused by a mixture of smoke in fog due to a change in the humidity ratio in the air at the beginning of winter. Complete elimination of smog as a natural phenomenon cannot be claimed, but intensity of smog can be reduced by controlling human activities that increase the amount of smoke in atmosphere, he said. Top of the list is smoke from vehicles and industries, solid waste disposal and burning of crop residues for the cultivation of new crops. In addition to smoke, dust, dirt and other construction materials, including sand, gravel, cement, etc, also cause air pollution./The Authority has been continuously monitoring all such activities. For this purpose, a regular cell has been set up in PDMA which is operational 24 hours a day. It is also taking legal action against those elements. About 100 percent of kilns in Punjab have been converted to ZigZag technology, said the minister while briefing the media at the end of a review meeting on anti-smog activities at PDMA. It has been decided that action will be taken against the chief officer of the area where the garbage will be set on fire. The Transport Department has been directed to remove the smoky vehicles from roads, the minister said. He said that the traffic police had also been directed to conduct awareness campaigns against the vehicles causing pollution./PHA: In a move to combat smog, Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has imposed a ban on burning of green waste in the provincial capital. The directions were passed by PHA Director General Jawad Qureshi here Wednesday. He said that the PHA was conducting an anti-smog operation in the provincial capital and in this regard, a complete ban was imposed on burning of green waste. He said instead of burning green waste, it was being used as compost which would be used in other tree planting places, including PHA nurseries. He made it clear that strict action would be taken against PHA officials who violate this order. He sought the people's role in the betterment of the environment and elimination of air pollution."
Impending smog," It has become an annual ritual to curse smog and do nothing about it to prevent it in the next winter. The problem is particularly recurring in Punjab, centering areas in and around Lahore. Air pollution is a major issue in all major cities in Pakistan, but the way it engulfs Lahore and its surrounding areas in the months of winter should compel authorities to devise a comprehensive strategy to combat this menace. Air pollution and smog has been rapidly increasing and the Punjab government is yet to initiate any significant measures to forestall the impending crisis. Smog affects people's health and also takes a huge economic toll as businesses and educational activities come to a standstill. For the past two years, the country has already suffered a lot in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and educational institutions have mostly remained closed for over a year./With this pandemic-related loss of business and education, if smog once again takes its hold it will be a dangerous situation for all who live in areas that are commonly engulfed by smog. Its impact is devastating and requires proper planning and implementation of steps needed to combat this problem. People face various diseases due to increasing smog and emergency wards in hospitals experience an undue pressure of patients who come with respiratory complications. The smog that has an annual resurgence is extremely harmful to health as the air quality index touches lowest levels. The number of polluted particles record a rapid surge, there is almost an abrupt decline in visibility and making it extremely hard for people to travel or ride on motorbikes or even move around on foot. Then there are the related and serious instances of eye and throat infections making it difficult to breathe and see./The smog is acrid and turns toxic when stubble burning takes place in winter. The plain regions of the country are especially prone to this poisonous mixture of fog and smoke. There is a need to monitor the situation via satellite imagery over the areas susceptible to smog. But there is no need to wait for real-time data to tell us what to do. Our past experiences should have taught us lessons on how to prepare for such crises. This is a grave issue which cannot afford any procrastination. Without an adequately coordinated and organised strategy to address the issue of smog, we end up blaming neighbouring countries which has not helped us in the past. In fact, we need coordinated regional efforts to help this situation. The Ministry of Climate Change must utilise the expertise of the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) to obtain all relevant information about the emerging situation in the coming weeks. There is also a need to set up more control rooms to monitor the situation."
Smog back to haunt Lahorites," Smog has engulfed the provincial metropolis here on Monday blurring the vision and causing serious health problems for the citizens as the Air Quality Index (AQI) reached 289./The sudden increase in smog has raised serious questions over the performance of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Environmental Protection Department (EPD), which seemed to fail in implementing the SOPs to counter smog. Sources in EPA revealed that a number of furnaces in northern side of Lahore were operating at night and used sub-standard fuel and material such as rubber tyres, plastic and other materials which also contributed to rising air pollution. Sources further said that a very half-hearted campaign was started against smoke emitting vehicles in the city and EPA's claims of using safe city cameras to take action against smoke emitting vehicles was just a statement./Increase in fine particles (PM 2.5) are the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in Lahore on Monday and several citizens interviewed by the scribe on roads claimed they were feeling irritation in eyes and difficulty in breathing and irritation in throat followed by cough./As per the report released by EPD's spokesperson, the AQI level in the city on Monday was 289, which as per their standards come in 'Moderately Pollution' while as per USA standards AQI level between 201-300 is 'Very Unhealthy' and health warnings of emergency conditions should be issued because the entire population was more likely to be affected by this./It is pertinent to mention here that EPA has only one mobile van, which can monitor the level of PM 2.5 while rest of its eight fixed stations in the provincial metropolis were either non-functional or were not able to detect PM 2.5./On the other hand, District Officer (Environment) Lahore Ali Ejaz while talking to the scribe claimed that smog was coming from India due to massive crop burning. It is pertinent to mention here that on Monday AQI of Amritsar in India was 189 while Lahore's AQI was 289, which didn't match with the statement of DO (Env) Lahore./Over a question about action against polluting industries, he said EPA was taking regular actions against industries. He said out of over 300 steel furnaces, 60 per cent were already closed down or shifted outside Lahore. He said six industries were inspected on Monday out of which three were sealed over violation of SOPs. He further said that 166 vehicles were checked out of which 44 were fined and three vehicles were impounded. The News called both Secretary EPD Mubashar Hussain and DG EPA Ambreen Sajid but both didn't attend the call nor replied to text messages. Health experts said that the size of particles was directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Small particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter pose the greatest problems, because they can go deep into lungs and some may even get into bloodstream. 'Exposure to such particles can affect both lungs and heart,' said Dr Tariq Chishti, a general physician./He said numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of problems including premature death in people with heart or lung disease, non-fatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, increased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the airways, coughing or difficulty breathing. Dr Tariq advised that people with heart or lung diseases, children and adults were the most likely to be affected by particle pollution exposure and they should remain indoor during smog season."
Present situation doesn't come under definition of smog: minister," Minister for Environment Protection Department (EPD) Muhammad Rizwan has declared the city smog free while the Lahore commissioner has constituted five squads to check the smog./The situation has confused the general public and environmentalists as they do not know whom to believe. Environmentalists were of the view that the EPD minister and the commissioner were not on one page, saying they should sit together on this issue./EPD Minister Muhammad Rizwan while talking to The News said he was ready to prove his argument that 'Lahore is smog-free' at any forum. He said for the last two years there had not been a minute when the city was hit by smog./To a question why the commissioner has constituted anti-smog squads if there was no smog, the minister said the commissioner didn't know anything about the environment. He said the EPD has already made a committee on smog, which was working and there was no need to constitute special squads./The minister claimed that smog was formed during fog and for the past two years there had been no fog. He said he was not denying that there was no air pollution in the city but he was just saying that the present situation didn't come under the definition of smog./The minister claimed that the government already warned private individuals and companies against issuing fake data of air quality of the city because this was harming the country's reputation./To a question that the US Consulate in Lahore was also issuing air quality data over which he said a team of EPA had already visited the US Consulate and inspected their air monitoring system./The minister said the US Consulate's monitor was collecting data from only one point (Shimla Hill) where there was always a traffic jam and air quality data of one point didn't represent the overall quality of the city's air. He said overall air quality was based on the average of air quality data collected from various points of the city. On the other hand, Commissioner Muhammad Usman has chaired a meeting at his camp office here on Saturday and passed several directions to the recently constituted five squads to combat smog./Addressing the meeting, he said the squads would be comprised of officials of Environment, MCL, Wasa, police, district administration and other departments concerned./DC Omer Sher Chatha has also issued a notification regarding the composition of the five squads and their TORs./The commissioner said two teams will take action against smoky vehicles in the city. He said 305 factories were using boilers and furnaces in city and a special squad will seal the industrial units using substandard fuel or generating excessive smoke. He said a squad will check the status of pollution devices and ensure compliance of environmental laws and orders of the Judicial Commission./Another squad will check use of substandard fuel and non-operative scrubbers and emission control measures in industry./The commissioner said each squad must check 12 industrial units per day and 60 units per week and rotation would be ensured to check industries frequently. He said anyone who broke seal must be arrested to ensure writ of administration and such incident would not be tolerated./He said all brick kilns should be shifted to zigzag technology and those who had already been shifted must be re-checked and revisited."
Effective strategy stressed to curb smog," Smog is a global issue and there is a need to adopt carpooling system to reduce toxic effects of smoke. Asthma, heart, nose, ear and throat diseases are on the rise due to smog./These views were expressed by discussants at Jang Economic Session on 'smog impacts on social and economic lives'. The panellists were Dr Asim Mehmood, Abbadur Rehman, Dr Sammar Asim, Dr Arshad Hamayon and Shahid Abbas while the session was moderated by Sikindar Lodhi. Dr Asim Mehmood said smog was not a new phenomenon rather a global problem which was the result of combination of smoke and fog known as London Smog for a long time. He observed that pollution and smog can be reduced by using better quality petrol and promoting tree plantation, adding the present government is focusing on the issue./Effective public transport system is also essential to avoid smog, he said and suggested adopting a car pooling system to reduce smoke toxic effect. London-style rush charges law can reduce number of vehicles on roads. Attention should be paid to setting up waste energy plants like in Denmark and no such project should be allowed to fall victim to politics, he said. Abbadur Rehman said smog often intensifies in late October and November due to rice crop harvesting as leftovers were burned in fields to prepare for new crop./Only farmers should not be held responsible for it alone as toxic emissions from industries and kilns are also equally contributing to air pollution, he said and added Lahore is adjacent to Indian Punjab and smog intensifies here as rice crop in India first ripened which can lead to serious human health problems due to burning of harmful particles in air. He said strict crop burning laws and fines significantly improved the situation. Farmers were not provided guidance and subsidy for the use of modern machinery and efficient composers of crops leftover instead of burning crops, he said. Dr Sammar Asim said intensified smog aggravates problem for asthma patients and increases other respiratory problems. He said patients should be vaccinated against corona and other diseases and stay homes and use masks. He said the government should ensure use of high quality petrol to reduce air pollution and create awareness and ensure implementation of laws./Dr Arshad Hamayon said smog was an invisible pollution which causes diseases including asthma, respiratory problems and lung cancer and premature deaths. He said impact of smog was reduced during Covid lockdown as industry and transport were closed. He called for adopting effective strategies to reduce industrial pollution to keep industry operational. He said imposing heavy fines on industries was not the solution rather there should be an access to latest environmental friendly technology. The solution to all the problems will be possible by making the management effective, he said. Shahid Abbas said smog was the combination of fog and smoke. Smog intensifies with growing pollution. It is not necessary that the intensity of smog be the same every year. Fog will increase, smog will increase and its intensity will decrease in case of rain but weather will remain the same for next ten to twelve days after which the situation is expected to improve, he said."
Lack of water sprinkling at construction sites worsens air quality," Lack of water sprinkling at the sites of ongoing mega projects and washing major roads to stop dust emerges as one of the top reasons for deteriorating air quality of the city./Lahore Development Authority (LDA) is carrying out three mega projects in three different sides of the city. These projects are under-construction outside Gulab Devi Hospital on Ferozpur Road, Sheranwala Flyover on Circular Road and a flyover at Shahkam Chowk on Multan Road. Environment Protection Agency's (EPA) Director (Labs) Farooq Alam said the agency has already asked all the departments concerned for extensive water sprinkling at the sites of all under-construction projects and washing of roads to stop rising of dust./Farooq Alam said AQI at Model Town, which was purely a residential locality with a lot of greenery, has increased due to movement of heavy machinery for ongoing project outside Gulab Devi Hospital. He said AQI of Thokar Chowk and adjoining localities is high because of ongoing project at Shahkam Chowk. He said at present the city was covered with dust whereas the level of hazardous gases in the air was not very high. He said EPD minister was also told about the situation./It is pertinent to mention here that LDA has a monitoring system to ensure water sprinkling at project sites by its contractors but it is a general practice that contractors do not sprinkle water at project sites to save money./Environmentalists say higher concentration of PM 2.5 in the air played a major role in creating a blanket over the city, which blocked all other gases in the air and didn't allow the vehicular/industrial pollution to escape in the air./Taking immediate measures, Minister EPD Muhammad Rizwan directed Secretary Housing to ensure extensive water sprinkling at project sites as well as on greenbelts in the city while the commissioner Lahore was directed to ensure washing of roads to clear dust. The minister also directed the traffic police officials to ensure smooth traffic flow in the provincial capital and strict action will be taken against smoke-emitting vehicles./The minister also requested the general public to minimise use of vehicles. He said carpooling should be encouraged for going to offices and for pick and drop of children from schools. To a question, the minister said official letters were also written to the departments concerned./Meanwhile, the district administration continued its anti-smog operations and sealed 18 paralysis plants operating in various city localities. Officials said these plants were causing smog and air pollution by burning various items at high temperature through hydrocarbons. They said cases were also being registered against those who set fire to garbage. On the other hand, Met officials said that continental air was prevailing over most parts of the country. They predicted mainly cold and dry weather in most parts of the country while smog/fog was likely in plain areas of Punjab. Thursday's lowest minimum temperature was recorded at Leh where mercury dropped down to -08°C while in Lahore it was 10°C and maximum was 27°C."
IG for joint efforts to curb smog,"  Inspector General of Police Punjab Rao Sardar Ali Khan has said that co-operation of police, district administration, environment, health and other departments concerned is essential for curbing anti-environmental activities causing smog./Police teams in all districts should continue their anti-smog operation and take action against massive smoke-emitting vehicles, stubble burning and factories and kilns owners for causing environmental pollution. As per directions of IG Punjab, crackdown against anti-smog has been intensified across the province./A spokesperson for Punjab Police, while presenting a report on all smog-related activities in all districts of province, said that since January 1, this year, overall 2,224 anti-smog cases were registered and 2,376 accused were arrested. During last seven days, 225 cases have been registered across Punjab and 153 accused have been arrested./OPEN COURT: The IGP said that provision of assistance and justice to distressed citizens and victims of oppression is among prime priorities of Punjab Police. He directed RPOs and DPOs to expedite process of resolving the issues faced by citizens under Open Door Policy. IGP emphasised upon resolving issues of Overseas Pakistanis under their personal supervision./He stressed that Pakistanis living abroad were our valuable assets who play a vital role in development of country and provision of best service delivery must be ensured to them./He said that if any overseas Pakistani is facing a case of seizure of property or land, supervisory officers should use all available resources for their immediate redress. He forwarded complaints of citizens to different RPOs and DPOs and directed them to resolve these complaints and send report to Central Police Office. He issued these instructions during an open court./In open court, IG Punjab listened to the complaints of citizens and issued orders for redress. Rs4.91b fine imposed: Provincial Transport Department has imposed fines worth Rs4.913 billion on smoke-emitting vehicles in different areas of the province during October and November./It also ticketed 12,176 vehicles while impounding 2,472 of them for emitting smoke on roads. According to a statement of the department spokesperson issued here Monday, the department's secretaries have been directed to ticket and impound such vehicles for three days on the direction of Judicial Water and Environment Commission. The field teams are working to keep a constant check on smoke-emitting vehicles under rule 163 of MVR, 1969, the spokesperson added./PMA: Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) is very much concerned about the worsening smog situation in Punjab particularly in Lahore. The city ranks among the worst cities in the world for air pollution. A mixture of low-grade diesel fumes, smoke from seasonal crop burn-off, and colder winter temperatures combine into stagnant clouds. Lahore had an air quality level of 348 last Wednesday, well above the hazardous level of 300, according to the Swiss technology company that operates the Air Visual monitoring platform."
Resolves made to tackle air pollution issue in Peshawar," The members of the civil society and senior government officials on Wednesday resolved to tackle the air pollution issue in Peshawar./A press release said Peshawar Commissioner Riaz Mehsud chaired the meeting to find a sustainable solution to the increasing air pollution in Peshawar./The officials of the district administration of Peshawar and Khyber, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) KP Economic Zones Development and Management Company, Industries Department were present on the occasion./He reiterated the resolve for a clean, green and healthy environment being a top priority./The Sarhad Conservation Network team was led by senior citizen Sarwar Mohmand Sarwar. The members included Prof Shafeeq ur Rehman, Dr Adil Zareef, Dr Maqbool Khan and Dr Yousaf Sarwar./The team urged punitive administrative and legislative measures against the industrial units causing serious diseases and suffering to people./They informed that 3000 citizens in Hayatabad had signed in a recently launched petition campaign urging the KP government to support their fundamental right to clean air./The petition shall also be presented to the Environmental Protection Tribunal for necessary action./The Khyber deputy commissioner said industrial units inspections had been carried out, fines were imposed and written warnings issued, besides sealing 40 units including crush machines and steel furnaces./However, some of these have been de-sealed on the directive by the Environmental Protection Tribunal./It was added the status quo granted to the industry by the Peshawar High Court had restricted the scope of government intervention./The government officials resolved action against non-complying industrial units after the final outcome of the cases were adjudicated by the court./The EPA director apprised that mainly chipboard and plastic industry in an industrial estate, besides steel industry in Khyber district were involved in smoke emission, creating serious public health hazards./He said a dedicated assistant director has been deputed for Khyber and Peshawar districts each for day to day monitoring and inspection./The director said future inspections of the industrial units would be carried out in coordination with concerned district administration./The commissioner concluded with a directive to constitute a technical committee under the supervision of additional deputy commissioner (G) Peshawar./It will comprise experts from civil society and industries, district administration Khyber, EPA and Industry Department and later prepare a comprehensive action plan with clear timelines./The technical committee would work to find lacunas in the existing EPA regulations to frame a new policy document for a KP Clean Air Act, pioneering landmark legislation ahead of other provinces."
Action against smoky vehicles," Inspector General Police Punjab (IGP) Rao Sardar Ali Khan has said that co-operation of police, district administration, environment, health and other departments concerned is essential to impede anti-environmental activities causing smog. He directed police teams to continue anti-smog operations and take stern actions against vehicles emitting massive smoke on highways, stubble burning and also factories and kilns owners for causing air pollution."
Hygiene horrors," This is to bring the attention of the authorities to the problems of residents of Bhara Kahu, which is located around 17 kilometres from Islamabad. As the town has grown, waste produced has increased as well. There is no proper place assigned by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for disposing waste. Residents are compelled to dump the garbage along roadsides, on empty plots and in playgrounds./As a result, land and air pollution have increased. People do not allow their children to go to parks for fear that they may catch diseases. The CDA should establish a proper garbage disposal system. Garbage collection bins should also be placed at across the town."
"JI holds protests against inflation, civic problems","  Jamaat-e-Islami launched an agitation movement against the government's 'apathy' towards soaring inflation and persistent civic problems of provincial metropolis here on Sunday, holding protests at over a number of public spots, where workers holding banners and placards raised anti-government slogans and demanded rulers either ensure basic needs of masses or quit./JI Lahore ameer Zikrullah Mujahid led the protest on Multan Chungi while other leaders led the workers to protest on different areas including Wahdat road, Muslim Town, Iqbal Town, Sabzazar, Bund Road, Ghaziabad, Township, Ichhra, Shahdara, Begum Kot, Johar Town, Gulshan Ravi, Wasanpura, Harbanspura, etc. Addressing the workers, Zikruallh Muhahid and other leaders lamented that Lahore used to be a city of gardens and flowers, but now turned into a large heap dirt and filth due to sheer negligence of PTI. He recalled that Prime Minister Imran Khan made hundreds of promises but all proved packs of lies. He said Lahore has now become the dirtiest city of the world in terms of air pollution, deprived of clean drinking water, people are forced to drink contaminated water and suffer from a myriad of diseases, but despite all those miseries the civic authorities, Wasa and LWMC, are extracting huge monthly bills from the masses under the reign of inflation and unemployment./He said all roads are broken and dilapidated, streets lights missing and manholes without covers putting the pedestrians and motorists at the high risk of accidents and injuries. The PTI government only managed to build Langar Khanas only. The opposition parties who ruled the country also let down the residents, especially those who made tall claims of dragging Zardari on the streets but ended up resting in costly flats purchased in London. He said protest movement will continue and next protests will be held on December 19 and Road caravans will take round of city on December 30 to wake up Lahore./In other areas the JI protests converted into agitation against the scarcity and dearness of utilities like electricity, Sui gas and water. The leaders lamented that PTI subjected the people to load shedding of Sui-Gas, after the electricity and water. They also condemned the recent 5 rupees per unit price raise of electricity tariff on the demands of IMF for releasing next loan installment. The leaders who addressed people included Ahmed Salman Baloch, Khalid Ahmed Butt and others./Ahmad Salman Baloch said people's stoves turned cold and poor masses were forced to purchase costly food from hotels. He strongly condemned Prime Minister Imran Khan for declaring Pakistan as the cheapest country, terming it a cruel joke and comic relief in his otherwise tragic and incoherent speeches."
EPA to adopt new formula to bring down AQI," In a bid to bring down the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the provincial metropolis, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has decided to adopt a new formula to calculate AQI, which will show around 25 per cent less figures./This decision was taken after all the short-term measures taken by the Punjab government failed to improve AQI of the city; sources said adding the main reason behind increased AQI of the city was inability of the EPA to shut down the industries, which used sub-standard fuel to run their factories late night./Sources further said that movement of heavy traffic, ongoing construction of mega projects in three different corners of the city and non-serious action against smoke-emitting vehicles were the other reasons due to which the AQI was not improving. Dr Amir Farooq, focal person of EPA, said that the official AQI figures being shared with the media on daily basis were not correct. He admitted that a new formula was adopted to calculate the figures and from Thursday (today) the media will get 'accurate' figures of AQI. Over a question about hidden operation of industries in night, he said the department has capacity issues and can't check each and every industry. He said that's why the govt has involved PDMA, District Govt and police to carry out operation against the industries violating the smog SOPs./On the other hand, as a thick layer of fog engulfed the city on Wednesday, the provincial capital remained on the first position among the top five cities of the world with worst air quality. A per the IQAir, the top five cities with worst air quality are Lahore (Pakistan), Hanoi (Vietnam), Delhi (India), Kolkata (India) and Dhaka (Bangladesh) respectively./According to the official data of EPA released on Wednesday, the air quality in Lahore on Wednesday morning at DHA was 420, at Hockey Stadium, Gulberg it was 401, at Township it was 229 and at Town Hall it was 200. Environmentalists said the Punjab govt should take immediate measures to save the citizens from the hazardous effects of air pollution and smog. They recommended an immediate closure of schools and colleges besides imposing a complete ban on smoke-emitting vehicles./They claimed that all the short-term measures taken by the govt didn't bring down the AQI while Met office also predicted that no rain will occur in the city in near future. They suggested that the govt should impose a week-long lockdown to bring down the AQI. On the other hand, Met officials said that a westerly wave was present over upper parts of the country and may persist till tonight. They predicted that cold and dry weather was expected in most parts while very cold in Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir, upper Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and districts of north Balochistan. Dense smog/fog was likely in plain areas of Punjab during night/morning./Rainfall was witnessed at several cities, including Muzaffarabad, Garhi Dupatta, Rawalakot, Malam Jabba, Balakot, Dir, Kalam, Pattan, Kakul, Mir Khani and Saidu Sharif while snowfall was recorded at Malam Jabba and Kalam. Wednesday's minimum temperature was recorded at Leh where mercury dropped to -12°C while in Lahore, it was 4.6°C and maximum was 19.5°C."
Breathless," This is to draw the attention of the authorities to the issue of smog and air pollution in the country. Because of the ever-increasing number of cars and deforestation, the air quality of Lahore is getting worse by the day. This has led to a decline in the beauty of the city and worsening health of people. Smog causes diseases like eye irritation, emphysema, asthma, chronic bronchitis, lung infections, and a number of cancers. Lahore's Air Quality Index has crossed 300, whereas the acceptable range is between 1 and 100./To overcome this issue, the government should take appropriate actions against the factories, industries, and the major contributors of smoke. Brick kilns should have zigzag chimneys to prevent the release of heavy smoke. Industries should comply with the standard of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), when discarding waste. Owners of industries and factories that create more pollution than the permissible limit should be penalised. There should also be attempts to plant more trees."
Clean up," The alarming air pollution problem that the world is experiencing is a consequence of mismanagement of industrial waste. The increasing number of factories are becoming a matter of concern because they are responsible for releasing harmful gases and smoke into the atmosphere. If the situation continues, the whole world will be completely surrounded by poisonous gases./Industries must be made responsible for purifying impure gases before releasing them into the environment. Factories must also be built away from the residential vicinities. The relevant authorities must take appropriate actions to remedy the problem, before it is too late."
Official data shows air quality very poor," Air quality of the City has been in the categories of poor and very poor for the past five days, raising questions over the performance of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)./As per an official data, Air Quality Index (AQI) of the City on Wednesday was 267 at Town Hall, 134 at Township, 368 at Jallo Moree (mobile van) and 315 at National Hockey Stadium. On December 21, the AQI recorded at Town Hall was 250, 208 at Township, 307 at Manawan Batapur (Mobile Van) and 377 at the EPA Head Office at National Hockey Stadium, Gulberg./On December 20, 2021 the AQI recorded at Town Hall was 243, 190 at Township, 266 at Manawan Batapur (Mobile Van) and 353 at the EPA Head Office at National Hockey Stadium, Gulberg./On December 19, 2021 the AQI recorded at Town Hall was 145, 154 at Township, 282 at Manawan Batapur (Mobile Van) and 348 at the EPA Head Office at National Hockey Stadium, Gulberg. On December 18, 2021 the AQI recorded at Town Hall was 122, 117 at Township, 294 at Manawan Batapur (Mobile Van) and 274 at the EPA Head Office at National Hockey Stadium, Gulberg. Lahore has become one of the most polluted cities in the world but EPA Lahore office is allegedly carrying out a 'selected' operation against polluters./It is pertinent to mention here that Environment Minister Muhammad Rizwan has already admitted that EPA's Lahore office has failed to take action against real polluters. During a speech in Punjab Assembly, the minister said that EPA's Lahore district officer Ali Ijaz was not interested in taking action against the real polluters and was not acting upon the directions of his seniors. While showing a report, the minister informed the house that the district officer (DO) Environment submitted a fake answer in Punjab Assembly on a question from an MPA./Lahore and its adjoining cities have been under the grip of severe air pollution since 2019 and the situation worsened in winter when smog started prevailing./Punjab Disaster Management Authority and the City administration took responsibility to control pollution. On the directions of Lahore commissioner, the City district administration established five anti-smog squads comprising officials from EPA, Wasa, MCL and other departments./During their action against polluters, these squads sealed various industrial units and imposed fines and demolished pyro industry which was recycling old tyres in Lahore. Owner of a demolished pyro plant alleged that pyro plant owners were asked to give 'protection money' if they wanted to operate. When they refused, he said, over 20 pyro plants were demolished in the name of not having approved building plants. The demolished plants included several units which were not operative. 'After demolishing, we are even not allowed to enter the buildings as we have been directed to get approval from the commissioner,' he said,/When contacted DO (Environment) Ali Ijaz said pyrolysis plants were demolished by the district administration for not having approved building plans. To a question about allegations of demanding money from these plants, he said he also came to know about this allegation. He, however, said pyro plants were extremely anti-environment and had no NOC from EPA./To a question that many pyro plants were operating in other districts of Punjab but none of them was demolished or stopped from operating, he said this was out of his domain and he can't answer this question. Talking about ongoing anti-smog operations in Lahore, he said 100 CCTV cameras were installed to check smoke emitting industries."
"Poor air quality leading cause of deaths, disabilities in world: experts"," Air pollution is now the leading cause of deaths and disability due to stroke in the world, especially in developing countries where poor air quality is responsible for 42 percent of all the stroke cases, experts said and urged policymakers to improve the air quality in major Pakistani cities, including Lahore and Karachi, to prevent people from premature death and disability./'Air pollution is responsible for the deaths of nine million people and one of the leading causes of deaths due to poor air quality is stroke, followed by cardiovascular disease and lung ailments. Data is being collected on the effects of air pollution on health in Pakistan but it must be causing scores of deaths and disabilities among people in highly-polluted cities of Lahore and Karachi', renowned neurologist Prof. Muhammad Wasey told a conference here at a local hotel on Thursday./The two-day event, titled 'Zindagi Stroke Workshop' was organized by the Pakistan Stroke Society in collaboration with multinational pharmaceutical firm Sanofi, which brought senior neurologists, general practitioners and family physicians to one place to get trained on prevention, management and treatment of stroke in major and relatively smaller cities of the country./Neurologists believe that around 1,000 people daily have large and minor strokes in Pakistan, of which 400 die on the same day while around 200 or 250 become disabled for life. But Prof. Muhammad Wasey, a professor of neurology at the Aga Khan University, believes that poor air quality is now the leading cause of stroke in the world, including Pakistan, especially in Lahore and Karachi, which are among the top 10 most-polluted cities in the world./'Every person in these two cities and other areas where air quality is the worst is inhaling pollutants, hazardous gasses, and particulate matter, which is equal to smoking 20-25 cigarettes in a single day. Polluted air contains carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead, sulphur dioxide, black carbon, nitrous oxide, ozone and other pollutants, especially the particulate matter of 2.5 microns, which are extremely hazardous for our cardiovascular system and are causing strokes,' Prof. Wasey maintained./""Deaths reduced by 30 percent in Pakistan during the strict lockdown in pandemic last year despite deaths caused by Covid-19 and it is largely attributed to improved air quality. A significant reduction in number of strokes, heart attacks and other non-communicable diseases was observed due to improvement in air quality despite the ongoing deaths due to viral infectious disease,"" he claimed./He maintained that as per the World Health Organization, 23 percent of total deaths are being caused by air pollution and of these deaths, number one cause is stroke. ""Air pollution is not only causing stroke but also resulting in other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease as well as developmental disorders among children.""/Urging health policymakers to take measures to reduce air pollution and improve air quality index, he said Pakistan lacks its own data of air quality and relies on US consulates for air quality index. He urged the authorities to strengthen environmental protection agencies not only to collect data of the air quality index but also take measures to reduce environmental pollution caused by burning of fuel, industries and vehicles./Medical Director of the Sanofi Dr. Nadim ur Rehman, said in the absence of trained and qualified neurologists, they were training general practitioners and family physicians from across Pakistan with the support from Pakistan Stroke Society and Pakistan Society of Neurology (PSN) for prevention, management and treatment of stroke, which is a leading cause of deaths and disability in the country./Renowned neurologist Dr. Saleem Barech from Quetta, spoke on the burden of stroke and risk factors in Pakistan, Dr. Qasim Bashir explained secondary prevention of stroke while Dr. Taj Farhat spoke on stroke rehabilitation."
Battling smog," Lahore has been at the top of the list of the world's most polluted cities over the past few weeks. The number of patients suffering from heart issues, chest infections etc is increasing day by day./Daily life has been practically suspended due to smog; safety measures have been taken in view of serious traffic accidents; motorways are being closed from time to time; flight operations of various airlines have also been disrupted. Despite the temporary closure of educational institutions, offices and markets, the challenge of air pollution has not been overcome. According to research data issued by the University of Chicago, the average age of every Pakistani citizen has decreased by 2.7 years due to air pollution./The areas adjacent to the Pakistani border in India are also facing a similar situation. According to media reports, Delhi has been declared one of the most polluted cities in the world, due to smoke emitted from factories and vehicles. According to a report by an international organisation, 22 cities out of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in India. Reportedly, New Delhi is termed as the most polluted capital in the world. In 2019, air pollution was believed to be the reason for casualties of around 1.7 million people in India./Farmers in eastern Punjab used to burn crop stubble on a large scale, considering it an affordable and fast way to prepare the land for the next crop. The widespread crop fires could also be seen through NASA satellite images. However, the Supreme Court of India is now continuously monitoring government measures to tackle air pollution. All construction and demolition activities in the capital were banned last month. On court orders, other strict measures have also been taken./Similarly, several world powers including China, Russia and the US are also struggling to combat the challenge of air pollution. According to experts, the huge use of coal is the main reason for causing smog in China. The Chinese government, in this regard, introduced various environmental initiatives such as the Great Green Wall to plant more than 35 billion trees across 12 provinces./Air pollution, in my view, is a year-round problem that needs to be addressed globally. However, we have to deal with smog in a specific season each year. Sadly, countries in our region are indulging in playing blame-game on this issue rather than increasing cooperation. Various international forums and accords, particularly related to the Paris Climate Agreement, SDGs, ASEAN, Saarc, and the Male Declaration also emphasise collaboration at the state level to control air pollution./In my view, the lack of governmental cooperation on public issues is the biggest challenge that our region is facing currently. Although we understand the significance of dialogue on bilateral peace, border disputes and other sensitive subjects, issues like smog affecting all the people in the region are badly ignored by the policy makers. In 2017, then- CM of Pakistani Punjab, Mian Shahbaz Sharif, in a letter to his Indian counterpart Amarinder Singh, wrote that it was in the best interest of both parts of Punjab to ensure a collective effort towards identifying technologies and business methods that may help in controlling smog formation. Unfortunately, the offer was not well-received on both sides of the border./I am ready to play my due role so that the two neighbouring countries stand together to solve public issues regardless of border tensions. In order to protect people from smog, it is recommended to take concrete measures by taking all regional governments on board."
Ignorance, This is to draw the attention of the authorities to the issue of improper garbage disposal and burning of trash across the country. Most people seem to be unaware of the effects that burning garbage has on the environment./It leads to global warming. It also causes air pollution which threatens the health of people and creates diseases and smog. The government should ensure that proper mechanism to address the issue is enforced.
For a sustainable tomorrow," The UN theme for International Women's Day (IWD) 2022, is 'Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow'. It also supports the main theme of the 66th session on the Commission of the Status of Women 'achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environment, and disaster risk reduction policies and programs.'/This year's theme aims to emphasise the vulnerabilities of women all over the world due to climate change-induced catastrophes. It also acknowledges the contribution of women climate activists for their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Two important Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - climate action and gender equality - also align with this year's theme./According to the UN World Prospects 2019, 'The population of females in the world is estimated at 3,904,727,342 or 3,905 million or 3.905 billion, representing 49.58 percent of the world population.' Such statistics show that women and girls - who constitute half the world's population - are further threatened by gender inequalities in the face of climate disasters. These threats are looming in the form of the disproportionate distribution of all socio-economic opportunities./Climate disasters negatively impact the health of women as they usually lead to malnutrition and lack of healthcare facilities. There are numerous reasons for the unequal distribution of health facilities for women during climate-led emergencies. Climate calamities destroy infrastructure, which includes hospitals and clinics. Healthcare resources are diverted to meet the requirement of those who are directly affected by the disaster. As a result, the reproductive health issues of women are neglected in low-income countries. Similarly, floods and droughts destroy agricultural land, increasing poverty risks for farmers. Such emergencies cause poverty risks and ignore the nutrition of adolescent girls and pregnant women, which create long-lasting health issues for them./The trauma of financial problems accelerates the cases of domestic violence and abusive relationship. The Women's Health Goulburn North East organisation (a specialist women's health service) reported in the wake of the Black Saturday Bushfires in Victoria in 2009 an increase in the incidence of domestic violence against women during post-disaster recovery. Men usually engaged in physical and mental violence against women to release their frustration and tension./Climate crises are also a hurdle in promoting gender equality in the education sector. The financial crisis increases the school dropout rate for girls. Underprivileged families, due to their inability to meet their educational expenses, force their girls to shut the doors of education and support the livelihood of the family. A report published by 'Assembly' (published by Malala Fund) mentions 'Droughts, floods, increased exposure to zoonotic diseases and air pollution are exacerbating the inequalities girls face, further limiting their ability to learn.'/Climate disasters also impact the livelihood of rural women, especially in agricultural countries where women earn through working in fields. During such times, the physical security of women and girls is also undermined. Cases of women abduction and rape increase manifold, which compromises their safety and security./To mitigate and adapt to climate change, gender equality in climate actions cannot be neglected. Many countries made commitments in COP26 to invest in gender equality projects. The UK announced the allocation of 165 million pounds to foster gender equality in climate change action; Bolivia pledged to reflect gender data in its nationally determined contributions, and Canada pledged that 80 percent of its climate investments over the next five years will target gender equality outcomes. It is important to have credible data of each country, comprising the exact number of women and negative impacts faced by them during several climate crises every year. According to this data, policies and projects can be launched for gender equality./Governments of low-income countries should fix two percent of national and international scholarships dedicated to girls and women who want to conduct their research in the area of climate change. Education of girls from poor families and the livelihood of women from the agriculture sector should be insured. These governments should ensure the smooth functioning of women-only wards during any natural disasters./Also, the role and involvement of women and girls in policies related to climate change should be promoted at the national and international levels to make their voices heard. Media outlets should give more space to writings and programmes that highlight the role of gender in climate crises to create mass awareness./Law-enforcement agencies should be more vigilant during climate calamities to prevent crimes against women and girls. Temporary women's shelters should be established in disaster-prone areas to protect displaced women and girls. Such shelters should be fully equipped with accurate information, medical and legal facilities. Strict punishment should be implemented in cases of domestic violence or mental abuse. In small villages of developing countries, women community leaders can be designated, according to the indigenous culture, to give climate education to women and girls of that area./The writer is a graduate in public policy from University of Oxford.

Emerging biogas,"  The importance of local energy/gas resources should be realised in these days of rising oil and gas prices, which may take the shape of a major crisis if the international political climate remains unchanged. Local oil and gas production is so important for energy security./For a variety of reasons, no significant success could be made over the last two or more decades with regard to oil or gas discovery. It is now time to use some other source. It is estimated that biogas can provide 600-1200 mmcfd of gas and will be in a ready-to-distribute form in most parts of the country, where biomass is available./In order to comply with the Paris Agreement, all gas supplies in Europe must be renewable or decarbonised by 2050. In addition, the transport sector has to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Biogas has been declared as an important agent for achieving the climate-related 2050 objectives by credible sources. A 2018 study organised by six major gas companies of the EU concludes, 'it is possible to scale up renewable gas (bio-methane and renewable hydrogen) production to a quantity of 122 bcm by 2050 in [the] EU. We also conclude that using this gas with existing infrastructure... can lead to Euro 138 billion annual societal cost savings compared to a decarbonisation framework without a role [for] renewable gas.'/In Pakistan, biogas has been underestimated, neglected and even dubbed as 'gobar gas', limited to providing cooking gas in rural areas. Only a few thousand household plants have been installed as opposed to 931,000 in India and 43 million in China. India also plans to install 5,000 bio-CNG plants in the next five years. Germany has more than 10,000 big biogas plants, and several hundred of them produce biomethane. Global biogas production in 2018 stood at 59.3 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, about half of which was produced in Europe./Biogas is not only a source of energy but also part of the circular economy concept, providing many services and functions including environmental management, solid waste disposal, waste water treatment, safe dairy hygiene and practices, natural fertiliser production, smog control and protection of freshwater resources. A circular economy targets zero waste and pollution throughout the full life cycle of materials. The conventional linear economy relies on the take, make, use, and dispose principle. The circular economy, on the other hand, involves a framework of production and consumption that consists of sharing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling./Waste - sewerage - water remains untreated in most areas of the country, polluting fresh water resources and resulting in the outbreak of several diseases. Biogas plants can use waste water to produce gas and fertilisers, subsidising waste water treatment capital and operating costs. Similarly, municipal solid waste (MSW) can be disposed of in the biogas plant system by first separating and recycling inorganic materials like paper, textiles, metals, plastics etc, and then digesting organic biomass to produce biogas./Every year, we deal with the problem of smog, largely due to rice stubble burning by farmers. This rice stubble along with other agro waste can be processed in biogas plants, subsidising the overall rice stubble collection in a smooth and mechanised system. Cow dung is spread in our rural areas, deteriorating air, water and food quality. It can be collected through a scientific method, giving income to cattle owners and farmers. 'Sabzi mandis' - wholesale vegetable and fruit markets - and food streets produce a lot of waste, which can be diverted and processed in biogas plants. In addition to gas production, digestate water is produced, which contains useful nutrients. Farmers can avail this cheap fertiliser and save some cost in buying expensive urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP)./There are all kinds of biogas plants - household drums or a cavern; mid-sized plants for individual industrial and commercial consumers; large plants for producing CNG for vehicles; and even larger plants for producing clean and processed gas for injection into the gas grid. Small household plants can be made underground by sand, mud or cement. These days, plastic drums or rubber containers are also made in factories and supplied to the market for ready installation - although this has not been initiated yet in Pakistan. It can be made available in less than Rs10,000 without any subsidies, and last a decade./Household food waste, human and animal excreta can be used, solving the waste disposal problem and producing gas and fertilisers in small quantities. Community-sized plants can also be made in areas where agro and dung waste is available. Make-do distribution pipes and small compressors can provide for the population clusters of 50-200 people. Dairies with 1,000 cattle in and around can install a reasonably sized plant. In earlier times, electricity production with biogas used to be quite popular, which is being increasingly replaced by solar panels./Biogas is made in two forms - unprocessed as produced and processed gas. Unprocessed gas contains 50-60 percent methane and the rest is CO2 and H2S. For cooking and even electricity production, unprocessed biogas is good enough and is used abundantly. For vehicle use as CNG and for injecting into the standard pipeline system, biogas has to be processed and cleaned of CO2, H2S and water vapour, etc. This adds to the cost. Processed biogas may cost between the prices of normal fossil gas and LNG and much cheaper than LPG prices./Clean cooking fuel is a basic requirement of people. Only 30 percent of the population is getting clean piped gas and 70 percent of the population relies on burning smoke-emitting biomass. Better biomass fuel and stoves can also be provided where biomass resources may not be available in some areas like non-agricultural or urban 'katchi abadis'. Community biogas plants would be much cheaper and affordable than LPG-Air mix plants that have been installed, and the demand from certain quarters, especially Balochistan, continues to be there. In Balochistan, cattle farming is a significant activity where community-based biogas plants can be installed at much reasonable costs./It should be noted that a power plant project based on solid waste incineration has been approved. It is a highly undesirable project, causing pollution and producing expensive electricity. Fortunately, it has not been installed - possibly due to the later evaluation by stakeholders. Burning solid waste directly is archaic and outdated technology having air pollution risks./If air pollution control equipment is installed, the cost becomes prohibitive. It would be much preferable to separate in organic and organic materials, sell inorganic materials like glass, plastic, paper, etc, and produce biogas for injection into the gas grid or use it in the CNG form to run local government vehicles, including waste collection trucks./Several biogas (biomethane and bio-CNG) projects are being studied. In Karachi, a bio-CNG project is being planned in Landhi Cattle Colony, which will supply bio-CNG to the Green Line bus project. The SSGC and SNGPL have invited proposals for build-own-operate (BOO) projects to buy biomethane from the projects for injecting into their grids. A biogas policy is now required to provide a satisfactory framework in this respect./For biomethane injection and bio-CNG stations, Ogra may have to devise some standards and rules. A digestate fertiliser policy specifying standards and a feedstock supply contract on the lines of the fuel supply agreement (FSA) for IPPs may be required as well. Such policies and rules are usually developed interactively with consultations among stakeholders as it happened in the case of IPPs. For community projects, a cooperative framework for owning and managing community plants may be required as well./Email: /<a href=""mailto:akhtarali1949@gmail.com"">akhtarali1949@gmail.com</a>"
'Early diagnosis of glaucoma can prevent needless vision impairment'," More than 4 million people across the globe are blind because of glaucoma, making it the third highest cause of blindness worldwide. The prompt diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma can prevent needless vision impairment, however, so many are unaware they have the disease or may not have access to much-needed care./These views were expressed by Post Graduate Medical Institute Principal Prof Dr Al-freed Zafar while addressing an awareness walk on 'World Glaucoma Week 2022' at Lahore General Hospital (LGH). HoD Prof Muhammad Moin, Prof Hussain Ahmad Khaqan, Prof Tayyaba Gul Malik, MS Dr Khalid Bin Aslam, Dr Abdul Aziz, Dr Lubna Siddique, and other doctors, nurses and paramedics were present on the occasion. He said that to prevent eye diseases and blindness, it is important to control diabetes, high blood pressure and air pollution./'Similarly, constantly watching cartoons on the small screens of the phone by children and working without computer shields in adults also harmful for eye health./Medical experts have also introduced a motto that ""Make the Kids play, keep the glasses away"" and by implementing it we can save our children's eyes.' Prof Muhammad Moin and Prof Hussain Ahmad Khaqan said that 1.8 million people in Pakistan are suffering from eye disease (glaucoma). They said that this disease can affect any age group in general. Prof Al-freed Zafar said that eye examination and operation facility is available at General Hospital from Monday to Saturday./There is modern medical equipment for timely diagnosis and treatment, he added. Dr Lubna Siddique said that the rate of visual impairment in children is increasing day by day as most of the parents give mobile phones to the children of 2 to 6 years of age to entertain or feed them. They should spend part of the day on the ground and on the greenery and they have good eyesight, she added. Medical experts also informed about the symptoms and precautions of cataract and highlighted its timely treatment, she said./Talking to the media, Prof Al-freed Zafar said that in order to observe the beauty of the world and enjoy the true sense of life, it is essential to have eyesight. Their value can be assessed only by those who for some reasons have been deprived of this great blessing of Allah Almighty. He said that raising public awareness for timely diagnosis and treatment of cataracts is a need of the hour so that older people can change their lifestyle./He stressed that to make daily exercise and walking routine, control diabetes and blood pressure, as well as avoiding any stress in daily life./In addition, unnecessary use of children's mobile phones should be stopped which is leading to wearing thick spectacles in low sun, he said and added that air pollution, vehicles emitting smoke on the roads are also affecting eye health./Therefore, the departments concerned should also pay proper attention to this issue for the betterment of public health so that the eyes of the citizens are not affected by the smoke, he said. Dr Adeel Randhawa, Dr Urooj Amjad, Dr Ali Haider, Dr Amna Jibran, Kaneez Fatima, Zehra Umbereen, Nabila Nazir, Misbah Tariq, Warsha Rehman, Khalida Tabasum, Effat Fatima, Hina Bukhari, Sabiha Majeed, Anwar Sultana, Ishrat and others were present."

The horror of war [Part IV]," In this concluding part of this series, I would like to discuss how wars, conflicts, civil strife, armament, nuclearization and weapons tests have affected the environment and what potential they have to threaten the very existence of humanity./This especially picked up steam following Russian President Putin's orders to his armed forces regarding nuclear deterrence, which many interpreted as a signal for a nuclear armageddon that has the potential of killing around 34 million people within a few hours. Such a specter is haunting pacifists and environmentalists all over the world who assert it could not only cause deaths on an epic scale but could be devastating for the global environment, turning the planet into an inhabitable place./One of the factors contributing to the degradation of the planet is the world's armies that contribute as much as 10 percent of global air pollution. The devastating Operation Desert Storm did not only kill people but also generated 80,000 tons of global-warming gases./According to Environmentalists against War, a website tracing the impacts of wars and militarization on environment, the US dropped 88,000 tons of bombs on Iraq in 1991, destroying 9,000 homes, water systems, power plants, critical bridges and four major dams. In 2002, the sole superpower dropped a quarter-million cluster bomblets on Afghanistan while in 2003, it targeted the Arab state with around 28,000 rockets, bombs and missiles. According to the Conflict and Environment Observatory, the 1991 Gulf War's oil fires contributed more than two percent of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions that year, with distant and long-lasting consequences. This includes pollution from the fires contributing to the accelerated melting of Tibetan glaciers due to the soot deposited on the ice./It is claimed that on any given day, more than 60,000 US troops are engaged in operations or military exercises in about 100 foreign countries under the supervision of the Pentagon, which is the world's largest polluter, generating 750,000 tons of hazardous waste each year. US military bases have polluted communities in Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Greenland, Iceland, Italy, Panama, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain and Turkey. Such bases are also playing havoc with the lives and environment in the US. There are more than 14,000 contaminated military sites in the US, many located near low-income neighbourhoods and communities of color./Today there is much hue and cry over the burning of fossil fuels. Developing states are lambasted for resorting to this environmentally unfriendly means of energy but the vast global military empire manages to escape such criticism. The military empire must be maintained to feed the world's oil-based economies. Waging war requires burning vast stores of oil and generates significant spikes of greenhouse gasses. World War II consumed from six to nine billion barrels of oil; Desert Storm: 45 million barrels. The Pentagon consumed 134 million barrels in 2001. The world's armies consume nearly two billion barrels of oil annually. The Pentagon is the largest consumer of oil, chemicals, precious metals, paper and wood./It is not a secret that wars and conflicts destroy wildlife, disrupt native habitats and contaminate the land, air and water. Experts believe the damage caused by them could last for generations. According to various environmental reports, the US dropped 25 million bombs and 19 million gallons of Agent Orange herbicide and other chemical weapons on the forests, fields and farms of Vietnam which proved to be catastrophic for the environment of that country. It is also believed that millions of acres from Russia's Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean have been contaminated by military chemicals and radioactive wastes./In Cambodia, 1,300 square miles are salted with several million mines that continue to kill wildlife and humans. Such lands cannot be used for cultivation. Angola's environment is burdened with more than 10 million landmines. Cluster bombs, thermobaric explosions, chemical and biological weapons and projectiles made with radioactive depleted uranium are indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction besides being hazardous for atmosphere./A study of 2008 looked at a Russia-US nuclear war scenario, where Russia would target 2,200 weapons on Western countries and the US would target 1,100 weapons each on China and Russia. In total, therefore, 4,400 warheads detonate, equivalent to roughly half the current inventories held each by Russia and the US. Nuclear weapons held by other states were not used in this scenario, which has a 440-Mt explosive yield, equivalent to about 150 times all the bombs detonated in World War II./This full-scale nuclear war was estimated to cause 770 million direct deaths and generate 180 Tg of soot from burning cities and forests. In the US, about half the population would be within 5km of ground zero, and a fifth of the country's citizens would be killed outright./A study published in March 2016 looked at the likely impacts of a nuclear exchange of about 100 Hiroshima-sized detonations (15 kt yield each) on the most-populated urban areas of India and Pakistan. Each detonation was estimated to incinerate an area of 13 square km, with this scenario generating about 5 Tg (teragrams) of soot as smoke from wildfires and burning buildings entered the atmosphere. Direct human deaths in this 'limited' nuclear war scenario are not quantified in the study, but would presumably number in the tens to hundreds of millions. The study observed, 'The planetary impacts are also severe: as the soot reaches the stratosphere it circulates globally, blocking incoming solar radiation and dropping the Earth's surface temperature by 1.8C in the first five years.'/According to the study this would be a greater cooling than caused by any recent volcanic eruption, and more than any climate perturbation for at least the last 1,000 years. Rainfall patterns are drastically altered, and total precipitation declines by about 8 percent. The study predicted that in this case food exports collapse as stocks are depleted within a single year, and by year four a total of 1.3 billion people face a loss of about a fifth of their current food supply. The researchers conclude that 'a regional conflict, using 1 percent of the worldwide nuclear arsenal, could have adverse consequences for global food security unmatched in modern history.'/Since wars and conflicts have created the specter of a nuclear holocaust, its possible horrors are unimaginable. With the rising tensions in Ukraine, it is important to understand the danger that is lurking around. Russia and Nato are both heavily armed with WMDs. With its supersonic missiles, Russia seems to have an edge over its rivals because such missiles cannot be detected by radar easily. Some experts believe that the American National Missile Defense System may not be effective against such missiles./So, if a war between Nato and Russia really erupts, it will push the world towards a conflagration that incinerates every living being - besides pushing the planet towards the verge of extinction. Therefore, it is important that our schools, colleges, universities, academia, media especially western media, inform masses about the horrors of wars and conflicts. Some environmentalists believe a mere 50 billion euros is needed to tackle the damage to the environment caused by human activities. Food experts feel a fifty-billion-dollar package could wipe out hunger from several parts of the world./A UNDP report some years ago asserted that primary education, primary healthcare and some basic amenities could be made accessible to billions of people by spending $50 billion dollars. It is time that we understood the horrors of wars and conflicts, diverting the colossal amount being spent on defense and militarization towards human development and prevention of environmental degradation./Email: /<a href=""mailto:egalitarianism444@gmail.com"">egalitarianism444@gmail.com</a>/The writer is a freelance journalist who can be reached./Concluded"
Garbage woes," This is to draw the attention of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board to unattended heaps of garbage in various parts of Larkana. The once clean and green city has now, unfortunately, become a city of garbage./Unattended garbage outside hospitals doesn't only create air pollution but also plays a big role in the spread of several life-threatening diseases. The department concerned is requested to solve the issue on a priority basis."
People are talking about -,"  the brutal murder of a young seminary teacher by three of her colleagues because one of their relatives, a thirteen year old girl, had a dream that the victim had committed blasphemy and she had been ordered to slaughter the victim. People say if this is the mindset that results from attending seminaries, there needs to be strict monitoring of what is being taught there that influences young minds in this manner, as this incident has shocked everyone./- the good news that out of 192 pavilions set up in Dubai Expo 2020, Pakistan bagged the Silver Award (2nd) for interior design, an uplifting occurrence among all the political turmoil taking place in the country these days. People say the pavilion received an overwhelming response and crossed the one million visitors mark, exceeding the expectations of the organizers and according to remarks and social media, was highly appreciated by all those who managed to visit it./- the wheeling and dealing going on PDM and smaller political parties, amply demonstrating that there is little that politically defines them apart from narrow self-interest and petty power grabs. People say it's a shame that politicians that lord over thousands in their constituencies set such a bad example to follow, as now most of them will argue, when being bribed to do something dishonest, that 'what is good for the goose (politician) is good for the gander (voter)!'/- the simple but heart-breaking video message released by Nazim Jokhio's wife, pardoning those suspected of involvement in her husband's murder and how it spoke volumes about our justice system. People say that it's sad that while giving her reasons, she said she had four children and was unable to run from pillar to post to seek justice, clarifying that her decision was not based on greed as she had wanted to fight the case but had been abandoned even by frightened, close relatives./- the dismaying fact that the women's cricket team has received much backlash and criticism on social media for not being able to handle the pressure and performed incompetently. People say it is worth considering that the team's journey to the World Cup was not an easy one given the little investment and support it gets, therefore they must be praised for withstanding the obstacles and giving impressive individual performances and despite the losses, we must continue to support and uplift the team./- how refreshing it was when the chief justice expressed his desire that the judges of the highest calibre and experts in their respective fields should be selected for the apex courts, coming up with the four-pronged selection criterion which include integrity, competence, capacity to deliver and judicial temperament, although the media only picked up one aspect of the speech to highlight - the power to form benches. People say the same criterion should be adopted at the grassroots level in the district judiciary./- how the civic administration of every city in the country is unable to deal with the garbage problem as unattended heaps of garbage in various parts of all cities are growing bigger by the day and unfortunately they have become cities of garbage instead of clean and green ones. People say this is a health hazard and also creates air pollution, while unattended garbage outside hospitals also plays a big role in the spread of several life-threatening diseases. - I.H."
Preparing for Earth Day," Earth Day, observed on April 22, is an opportunity to pause and reflect on what should be done to make the planet a safer place not only for us but for the coming generations, too. Like other countries in the region, Pakistan should do whatever it can to save the planet./Pakistan has made several pledges in line with its commitment to play its part to combat climate change and avert man-made disasters. Whether or not these pledges have resulted in adequate actions on the ground is open to question./The theme for the Earth Day 2022 is 'invest in our planet'. According to the UN, the 'Mother Earth is clearly urging a call to action. Nature is suffering. Oceans filling with plastic and turning more acidic.' This is because 'extreme heat, wildfires and floods, as well as a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season, have affected millions of people.'/The UN warns that 'climate change, man-made changes to nature as well as crimes that disrupt biodiversity, such as deforestation, land-use change, intensified agriculture and livestock production or the growing illegal wildlife trade, can accelerate the speed of destruction of the planet.'/The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, for example, says that Pakistan will face greater consequences of climate change in coming decades in both rural and urban areas. The report warns that 'up to 3.6 billion people live in highly vulnerable countries of South Asia, small-island developing states, the Arctic, Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa.'/It is worrying that Pakistan is among the top ten climate impacted countries on the globe experiencing frequent and intense climate change events, such as floods, droughts, cyclones, heavy rains, heat waves and extremely high temperatures, according to a recent report of the Federal Flood Commission./The report also warns about locust attacks. Experts have pointed out that conducive temperature and increased rains in deserts create favourable conditions for locust breeding. Recent locust attacks in South Asia and Africa have destroyed crops and taken farmers' incomes. According to an estimate, Pakistan lost 2 percent of its agricultural production in the fiscal year 2019-20 to locust attacks./This is the first Earth Day being celebrated in the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration. It has been emphasised that 'restoring our damaged ecosystems will help end poverty, combat climate change and prevent mass extinction. But we will only succeed if everyone plays a part,' the UN says. For that to happen 'we need a shift to a more sustainable economy that works for both people and the planet.'/One step taken in the direction of combating climate change and saving the planet by Pakistan has been recognised by the world. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in March this year praised Pakistan for its efforts to increase ecosystem restoration and for its efforts on its Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Project (TBTTP)./Sustainable Development Goal 13 asks states 'to take action to combat climate change and its impacts.' Climate change is affecting economies and lives across the globe. A desirable change can only result from more people becoming responsible citizens of the world./UNEP's regional director for Asia and the Pacific, Dechen Tsering, appreciated the, 'large-scale restoration initiatives, such as The Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Project' as 'central to Pakistan's efforts to support the UN Decade and to increase ecosystem restoration.' The TBTTP was launched in 2019. It aims to revive forests and wildlife resources in Pakistan and to improve the overall conservation of existing protected areas besides promoting eco-tourism, community engagement and creating jobs. Under the project, 1.42 billion trees were planted between 2019 and December 2021, covering 1.36 million acres across almost 10,000 sites, according to the UNEP report./Can we be sure that the existing forests are not being cut in connivance with the relevant government departments?/There are many areas where Pakistan lags behind and needs to catch up with the rest of the world. These include disposal of industrial and medical waste, and air pollution caused by burning of waste and crops residue./The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has recently warned that the discharge of domestic sewage, toxic industrial effluent, port-related waste, dumping of solid waste, cow dung from cattle colonies and effluent of slaughterhouses into the sea are destroying the marine environment./The department claimed that more than 90 percent of industrial wastewater was going into the sea without treatment. The meeting was told that there was no combined effluent treatment plant (CETP) in Sindh except the one for tanneries in Karachi and another in Kotri. Both these plants were malfunctioning, it said. The five treatment plants recommended by a Supreme Court-mandated judicial commission on water in 2018 for Karachi are yet to be installed./Dangerous medical waste is being disposed of carelessly in big cities, including Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. It poses serious health hazards to the people and the environment./Experts have also warned about the plastic waste caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been estimated that more than eight million tonnes of pandemic-associated plastic waste has accumulated across the globe. More than 25,000 tonnes has entered the oceans./Air pollution caused by burning of crop residue in Pakistan and India is a problem that is yet to be solved. The smoke, which develops into smog, is a huge threat to not only humans but also for birds and insects./Cooperation and sharing of experiences at the global level can be one way of saving the Earth. In January this year, China provided biogas digesters to households of a small town near Islamabad to recycle waste of livestock aimed at reducing pollution and protecting the environment. The biogas digesters provided to 50 households will recycle waste from farming, instead of being burned, to reduce pollution. Over the last few months, Lahore has repeatedly been the most-polluted city in the world in terms of air quality./Are we creating awareness of the problems among our children? One way of investing in our planet is to be responsible citizens. Sustainable Development Goal 13 urges states 'to take action to combat climate change and its impacts.' Climate change is affecting economies and lives across the globe. A positive change can result from more people becoming responsible citizens of the world."
Body formed to address air quality challenges," The Environment Department under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet has taken a lead role in implementing the National Environment Quality Standards (NEQs) by constituting an 'oversight committee' on the 'Clean Air Peshawar Initiative' 2022./A press release said this is the most dynamic development by the KP government to improve the air quality in Peshawar./It promises to address air quality challenges, improve coordination among various stakeholders, develop strategies and make recommendations for air quality management at the quarterly cabinet meetings./The cabinet also approved an 'implementation committee' comprising stakeholders from the government and representatives of the local governments./This would ensure the implementation of policies and coordination from local government to the top level and bridge the gaps in 'environmental governance' through a holistic approach grassroots./Despite constraints, the KP government has taken proactive steps in terms of strategic planning and intervention in key sectors e.g. KP Climate Change policy 2022 and Clean Air Peshawar Initiative 2022./It is hoped that various policy gaps and limitations would be identified by the 'oversight committee'. The foremost priority should be the availability of real-time air quality data for accurate analysis and comprehensive air quality reports./The quality air monitors would be installed at major pollution points in Peshawar and public health impacts of air pollution would also require primary data research for the identification of diseases/impacts./A proactive transport and industrial sector task force would be essential to help identify key pollution points and recommend policy on mitigation, adaptation and/or penalties against public offenders./Powerful lobbies in industrial and transport sectors that until now resisted adaptation or reform would pose a serious challenge to the government to overcome./Advocacy at the community level through local government can help raise awareness among people about public hazards and prevention strategies./This promising initiative would have a better outcome and chances of success if civil society and academia are added to the policymaking strategy with a research component on air quality and health impacts."
10 air quality index devices installed on highways in capital," The Islamabad police have installed 10 air quality index measurement meters on the main avenues of the city with an aim to reduce air pollution by ensuring strict action against smoke-emitting vehicles, a police public relations officer said./To implement the vision of the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Mian Shahbaz Sharif and as per instructions of the Federal Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah Khan, reforms in Islamabad capital police is underway. In this regard, IGP Islamabad Dr. Akbar Nasir Khan and Dr. Faheem Khokhar Head of Department for Environment, National University of Science and Technology decided to install an Air quality index management system on the Srinagar highway and Islamabad Expressway during a meeting held at Safe city."
Breathless," Air pollution of any kind is dangerous for our well-being. The burning of land and fossil fuels in agriculture and industry, respectively, is constantly polluting our air. Then this air pollution causes various diseases like lung cancer./For the sake of our and our future generations' health, we must crackdown on the sources of air pollution."
Master action plan to deal with smog approved," A meeting chaired by Minister for Environment Protection, Cooperatives and Parliamentary Affairs Muhammad Basharat Raja has approved a master action plan to deal with possible danger of smog. Environment Protection, Local Government, Agriculture, Transport, Cooperatives Secretaries and DIG Traffic Police Punjab also participated in the meeting. It was decided that joint squad of Environmental Protection, Transport and Police shall be constituted and a special control room will be set up to monitor smog situation. Lahore, Faisalabad and Gujranwala divisions which have heavy ratio of traffic will be focus of 'Master plan'. It was suggested that Instead of imposing Section 144, Calamity Act should be implemented to deal with smog./Environment protection minister Muhammad Basharat Raja while addressing the meeting said that the provincial government was taking concrete steps to deal with air and water pollution on the instructions of the chief minister. 'As compared to the past, measures have been started since May to deal with possible danger of smog' said the minister. He regretted the tradition of burning crop residue in India, saying that the neighbouring country is responsible for 90 percent of the smog in Pakistan. 'However, the intensity of smog can be reduced by taking measures at the local level', the minister observed./Raja Basharat said there was a need to conduct an awareness campaign for the public, especially school students. Emphasising the need to increase plantations, he said that all relevant departments should take practical steps, verbal plans are not acceptable. 'Focus on problem of air pollution throughout the year instead of just one season', he directed./On this occasion, Secretary Environment Protection said that special squads impounding vehicles emitting smoke and sizeable fines are also imposed. The minister directed that the documents of smoke-emitting vehicles should be seized and not returned until the vehicle's full fitness is ensured. He said that burning crops and solid waste cannot be allowed. 'All Deputy Commissioners should bound patwaris and lumberdars to ensure prevention of crop residue burning in their respective areas', he said./The minister called a video link meeting of all commissioners and deputy commissioners next week and said that to discourage the tradition of crop burning, farmers should use straw cutters and happy seeder equipment. 'Small farmers will be given loans from cooperative banks for purchase of straw cutters and happy seeders' he announced. He said that the Department of Cooperatives should ensure that no housing society was established without the NOC of the Environment Protection Department. Every year instead of mere a symbolic planting, housing societies should practically work for planting and make sure survival of the same./Secretary Environment Protection while briefing the meeting said that no brick-kiln will be allowed to operate without zig-zag technology. 'Legal notices have been issued in this regard' he told the meeting."
"Intense smog, fog next environmental challenge: experts"," Intense smog or (smoke plus fog) and fog are the next major environmental challenges Pakistan is going to face in the months ahead as heavy moisture in the atmosphere due to unprecedented rains and floods combined with pollutants may cause intense smog to grip plains of Sindh and Punjab from early November and December this year, meteorological scientists warned on Tuesday./They said the current year was unprecedented in terms of extreme meteorological events in the history of Pakistan but the next challenge for the country could be early and intense smog conditions in November and heavy fog in December in the plains of Sindh and Punjab./'Due to floods and extension of monsoon into the month September, there is abundance of moisture available in the atmosphere, which is likely to cause intense smog early in the month of November in the plains of Sindh and Punjab,' Director General, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Mahr Sahibzad Khan told The News in an exclusive interview./Around 140,000 people are killed annually in Pakistan due to air pollution, experts believe as Pakistan is one of the top countries after China and India where highest number of deaths occur due to complications resulting from air pollution as millions of people are compelled to breather highly toxic air./Khan said they had not yet issued any warning regarding early onset of smog in the country, but added that with the drop in temperature and burning of rice crop residue by the end of October and early November, they feared intense smog in the plains of Sindh and Punjab. 'Moisture in the atmosphere and level of air pollution that is likely to increase in the last weeks of October and early November would be the cause of intense smog in the plains of the country. Intense fog would be followed by heavy fog in the months of December and January with drop in the temperature in the plains,' the DG Met said./Scientist and former director general PMD Dr Ghulam Rasool also predicted intense smog and fog in the winter season and advised the authorities to take preventive measures as much as possible to prevent air pollution through burning of crop residue and brick kilns. Commenting on the health effects of smog in the months ahead, public health expert Dr Shahzad Ali Khan said smog could increase the incidence of chest infections, pneumonia and allergies among a large segment of people and advised elderly people to avoid walking in the smog and must use N95 masks to save themselves,' Dr Khan, who is the vice chancellor of the Health Services Academy Islamabad, added."
Toxic air," According to a new study by a team of international scientists, air pollution can cause lung cancer even in people who have never smoked cigarettes in their whole life. The polluted smoke of the traffic creates tumours in the body. These particles are 50 times smaller than the size of a human hair and these enter the blood through the lungs, making them stickier, and causing inflammation. These hazardous particles are found in diesel, brake pads, tires, and road dust./We know that these particles are detrimental but we have no way to avoid inhaling them. It is worth mentioning that at the beginning of this year, a survey reported that 1.8 million deaths occur every year due to air pollution. The government must find ways of reducing air pollution."
Hazardous highways," Along with the increase in the population of Karachi, the traffic is also increasing. The ever-growing traffic is creating an excess of air pollution, leading to a rise in breathing difficulties, asthma and lung disease among the people of the city./The cacophony of the traffic at nearly all hours is a constant source of noise pollution, damaging ears and minds. Traffic can no longer be seen as a mere nuisance that leads to uncomfortable delays, it is a genuine and growing threat to the health and safety of the people of our city."
Depts asked to chalk out joint action plan to tackle smog," Secretary Environment Protection Department (EPD) Punjab Usman Ali Khan has said that government departments have to work in coordination and implement joint action plan to tackle the upcoming smog season./Secretary EPD Punjab said this while chairing a high level meeting regarding Joint Action Plan against smog at EPD Head office on Tuesday. The meeting was attended by senior officials of Transport, Agriculture, Labour, Industry, RTA, PDMA, Local Govt, PITB, Traffic and Urban Unit. The chair reiterated the directions from Chief Secretary Punjab made during the last meeting held on Monday last for preparing a Joint Action Plan against smog in coordination with all departments concerned with special emphasis on Lahore. The meeting discussed smog control activities pertaining to the departments concerned and their requirements and implementation mechanism./Secretary EPD Punjab said that agriculture department will utilise the digital girdawari and get the contact numbers of rice cultivators and awareness messages will be delivered in Urdu for their awareness and sensitization. Besides, the agriculture officers would also get the data from last year violators list and share it with EPD, which would be later on shared with Deputy Commissioners. He said that the number of Smoke Emitting Vehicle squads will be increased and they will check the commercial vehicles' VICS certificates at all three entry points of the city including Saggian, Thokar Niaz Baig and Chowk Yateem Khana./Usman Ali further said that Transport Department will ensure the availability of Euro-V standard compliant fuel at all oil marketing companies outlets. All departments concerned will also depute their focal persons for data compilation and dissemination in the Smog Control Room established in EPD head office, he added. He also asked the PITB officials to speed up the work to complete the mobile application for the daily actions reporting, equipped with necessary features to alert Deputy Commissioners about real time geo-tagged fire and smoke emission instances./Meanwhile, IG Police Faisal Shahkar has said that the police teams in all districts of the province should continue intensive operations regarding anti-smog and vehicles that emit a lot of smoke on the roads. He directed to take stern actions against burning crop residues, factories and kiln owners which cause air pollution. IG Punjab while giving instructions to the field officers to speed up countermeasures to prevent smog, said that police, district administration, Environment Department and other agencies should speed up the crackdown and action should be taken indiscriminately on the violation of smog SOPs."
Lahore on top of five most polluted cities in Asia," The provincial capital ranked on top of the five most polluted cities in Asia while third across the world on Thursday. The top ranking of Lahore in the index of world's most polluted cities showed that the ongoing campaign of city administration and the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) seemed an eye-wash./Data collected from IQAir revealed that Lahore, Pakistan stood at the first place in the list of top five polluted cities in Asia with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 171 on Thursday. Similarly, the US Embassy's air quality data also declared Lahore's air unhealthy due to its 171 AQI./The other top four cities of Asia included Beijing (China) with 166 AQI, Delhi (India) with 166 AQI, Shenyang (China) with an AQI of 152 and Kuwait City with an AQI of 132. On the other hand, the most polluted city in world on Thursday as per IQAir was Portland (USA) where AQI reached 231 and the second most polluted city in the world was Seattle (USA) with an AQI of 212./On the other hand, the air quality data issued by Environmental Protection Department (EPD) claimed that the AQI in Lahore at Town Hall was 119, at Township it was 160 and 210 in China Scheme and Karol Ghati area. It is pertinent to mention that EPD and District Administration were carrying out operations late in the night against polluting factories especially those operating in the Northern Lahore side and claimed to seal and stop many such units in the last couple of days./Interestingly, as per the own data of EPD the AQI on Thursday was 210 in China Scheme and Karol Ghati area, which are considered a hub of steel related cottage industry, steel mills and other manufacturers who allegedly used substandard fuel like rubber, plastic, tyres and other unhealthy material due to which thick black smoke and ash is produced./Environmental experts said that the EPD as well as the district administration started its operation against polluting factories very late. They said there were reports that many factories, which were sealed by the administration and EPD broke the seal and started operating again./Provincial Secretary EPD while talking with the scribe said that the department was monitoring city's AQI in a scientific manner and a dedicated control room was also established. He said the department was carrying anti-smog operations day and night./Dr Tariq Chishti, a general physician said that intake of smog was very harmful especially for the elderly and children. He said the season was already changing and many people were already suffering from common flu and cough, which can be aggravated if they inhale smog./He said breathing air pollution increased chances of getting sick with the flu and multiple studies have confirmed that exposure to elevated levels of air pollution increased the likelihood that one will become sick due to PM2.5, PM10 particulates, fuel exhaust, nitric oxides, sulfur dioxide and ozone./Dr Zubair Afzal, an allergists said polluted air made symptoms of the flu worse for those who were already sick. Pollution particles rub against the bronchial tubes and create inflammation and irritation similar to flu symptoms. He said everyone should use face mask while going outdoor. He said that people should boost their immune system to fight with the side effects of the air pollution./Meanwhile, the City witnessed a hazy day on Thursday while Met office said a westerly wave was present over northern parts. They predicted that dry weather was expected in most parts of the country./Rainfall was recorded at several cities, including Dir, Pattan, Kakul, Kalam, Saidu Sharif, Peshawar, Malam Jabba, Balakot, Bacha Khan, Parachinar, Charat, Drosh, Chitral, Mardan, Garhi Dupatta, Kotli, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Murree, Mangla, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Bagrote, Astore, Babusar, Chilas, Gupis and Gilgit./Thursday's minimum temperature was recorded at Leh where mercury dropped down to -03°C, while in Lahore, it was 18.8°C and maximum was 32°C."
A particulate matter," L/ast week, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) declared the city of Lahore as 'calamity hit,' due to smog. The booming megalopolis is now routinely shrouded in dense, grey smog at the onset of winter every year. The smog doesn't just herald in cooler weather; it is accompanied by a public health crisis causing an increase in respiratory infections./The ill effects of smog aren't limited to itchy throats and irritated eyes, the particulate matter (pollutant particles suspended in the air) are known to cause cancer. The Word Health Organisation (WHO) reported more than 4 million preventable deaths due to air pollution in 2016 alone./People in developing countries like Pakistan are more vulnerable to ill effects of air pollution. There are a number of reasons for this, chief among them being the lax environmental regulations leading to the use of poor quality fuels; the absence of effective control on industry emissions and stubble burning; a general lack of knowledge about the ill effects of breathing heavily polluted air; and, of course, the precedence 'development' and 'productivity' take over human health./The greatest public health burden caused by air pollution exists in South East Asia, where a combination of dietary factors and genetic predisposition already render most of the population vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases. A 2013 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that outdoor air pollution is carcinogenic for humans, with particulate matter (PM) being most closely associated with increased cancer incidence, especially lung cancer./Air quality measurements are reported in concentrations of particulate matter (PM). But what exactly is 'particulate matter'? PM is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles suspended in the air. It can include pollutants harmful to human health such as sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon and mineral dust. Particles with a diameter of up to 10 microns (PM 10) can penetrate and lodge deep in the lungs./Even more damaging are the smaller particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, commonly known as PM 2.5. These particles can penetrate from the lungs into the bloodstream thus carrying pollution throughout the body. This immeasurably increases the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer./Alarmingly, PM 2.5 pollution has health impacts even at very low concentrations. This means that any amount of air pollution caused by small particulate, no matter how small or seemingly invisible to the eye, damages health. Consequently, the WHO Global guidelines do not have a lower threshold for PM 2.5 air pollution, and instead aim to minimise exposure./The PDMA has been empowered to take such steps as necessary to formulate effective disaster risk management and mitigation policies; coordinate disaster response and financial management; increase public awareness; provide technical support and give directions to provincial departments as necessary./Alarmingly, PM 2.5 pollution has health impacts even at very low concentrations. This means that any amount of air pollution caused by small particles, no matter how small or seemingly invisible to the eye, damages health. Consequently, the WHO Global guidelines do not have a lower threshold for PM 2.5 air pollution, and instead aim to minimise exposure./In terms of tackling smog, the PDMA has worked to introduce legislation for local industry in order to reduce overall pollution. Meanwhile, the provincial Environment Protection Department (EPD) has mapped out brick kilns and industries emitting air pollution and imposed fines on the owners. The government of the Punjab has gone as far as to provide loans for the refurbishment of traditional brick kilns to zigzag technology in order to reduce air pollution./T/he ground reality is that many of the factors and policy elements directly causing, or indirectly contributing to air pollution remain. For starters, the poor quality of fuel coupled with the poor upkeep of vehicles, especially heavy vehicles, has long been cited as a major reason for air pollution./Until last year, only one oil refinery in Pakistan had the capability to refine fuel to Euro 5 standards, which considerably reduces the air pollution from vehicles. Early this year, the Ministry of Energy granted refineries a five-year extension to comply with Euro 5 standards. This is akin to choking communities already gasping for air./In 2021, the Punjab government claimed to have drastically 'improved' the air quality, not by addressing the root cause of pollution but by simply changing the standards against which air pollution was measured. Because numerous 'air index rankings' rely on official government data, Lahore fell from the worst air quality in the world to currently sitting at the 20th spot on the IQAir Index - problem solved by a simple stroke of genius./Reports from a high court hearing indicate that last year the PDMA claimed that the increased consumption of grilled fish and barbecue had caused smog. These facts, in themselves, are sufficient to reflect on the commitment of the government to address what is fast becoming a permanent environmental problem and public health catastrophe./More importantly, perhaps, the aforementioned factors also indicate a serious lack of knowledge about smog, its causes and impacts. The PDMA which has been mandated to make provincial disaster management policies, does not list a single air pollution expert or air quality scientist among its staff. For a province plagued by smog on an annual basis, the most recent policy document available in the public domain is a 2017 policy on controlling smog published by the EPD./Addressing all the factors causing air pollution may not be immediately possible but there are successful examples from around the world. Beijing, China, was in international headlines in 2008 with the worst air quality in the world. In just over a decade, the city has seen a dramatic reduction in smog. This improvement in air quality didn't happen overnight; it owes its success to a series of careful policy measures upheld over time by political will, investment and consistency. Some of the steps that reduced PM 2.5 concentrations by around 35 percent include vehicle emissions control, industry restructuring, provision of clean fuels for domestic use, and reducing coal use. A stringent and independent air monitoring unit regularly evaluated air quality data and enforced strict environmental laws./Air pollution control is not an easy or a short-term process. Tackling all of the causes overnight is not practicable. Most sources of outdoor air pollution are beyond the control of individuals or groups. The need of the hour is for the provincial government to take concerted action by involving local and provincial policymakers, air quality experts and environmentalists, and representatives from critical sectors such as transport, energy, urban planning and agriculture."
Lahore third among most polluted cities of world," Lahore continued to retain its third position among the top ten most polluted cities amongst the world here on Saturday./As per the data collected from IQAir, an international website issuing air pollution data of the world cities, Lahore remained on the third position for the second consecutive day with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 140./Chongqing, China with an AQI of 163 and Karachi, Pakistan with an AQI of 154 were the first and second most polluted cities on the list of top ten cities. The remaining top polluted cities included Delhi, India with AQI of 139, Chengdu, China with an AQI of 129, Kuwait City, Kuwait with an AQI of 127, Lima, Peru with and AQI of 126, Kaohsiung, Taiwan with an AQI of 122, Yangon, Myanmar with an AQI of 120 and Hangzhou, China with an AQI of 108./Statistics revealed that during 2021, Pakistan was ranked as the third most polluted country in the world with an average AQI of 156./In 2021, Bangladesh was ranked first in the list of top ten most polluted cities with an average AQI of 161, Chad stood second in the list with AQI of 161 and Tajikistan stood fourth with an AQI of 152. As per the data of IQAir, India was the fifth most polluted country in 2021 with an AQI of 151 after which came Oman with an AQI of 146, Kyrgyzstan with an AQI of 138, Bahrain with an AQI of 136, Iraq with an AQI of 136 and Nepal with an AQI of 126./It is pertinent to mention here that Environmental Protection Department was measuring PM 2.5, which is the major pollutant to measure smog, only through a mobile van and through a low cost device installed at China Scheme Karol Ghaati. As per EPD's official data of AQI for Saturday was that at Town Hall, Lahore, Carbon Monoxide (CO) 5 (mg/m3) was 111, at Township, C2 sector, Block 1, Carbon Monoxide (CO) 5 (mg/m3) was 100, at Punjab Civil Secretariat, Islampura, the AQI was recorded through Mobile van and Particulate matter (PM2.5) was 141 and at China Scheme/Karol Ghati, Lahore AQI was measured through AERAS AQMS-500 the PM2.5 was 119./It was again pertinent to mention here that smog was increasing in the city every day. Several citizens were witnessing haze, irritation in eyes and breathing problems in the localities where traffic jams were a routine while those areas where Lahore Development Authority was completing its ongoing development projects. On the other hand, Met officials said that continental air was prevailing over most parts of the country. They predicted that mainly dry weather was expected in most parts while cold in hilly areas of the country. Saturday's lowest minimum temperature was recorded at Leh where mercury dropped down to -05°C while in Lahore it was 16.1°C and maximum was 30.6°C."
