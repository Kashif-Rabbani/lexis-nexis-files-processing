"KPT directed to ensure safe storage, transportation of coal"," The Sindh High Court has directed the Karachi Port Trust to take appropriate measures for safe handling and transportation of coal and submit a report within a month./The court also ordered environmental impact assessment of the handling facility that deals with over 4.5 million tons of imported coal./The directions came on a petition of Ashfaq Qureshi and other residents of the Shireen Jinnah colony against coalstorage facility near the residential area. Petitioners' counsel Khawaja Shamsul Islam had submitted that handling of millions of tons coal at the KPT terminal was causing serious threat to the health of residents of the area and the environment./He stated that due to the coal terminal inhabitants of the area were facing the serious consequences of environmental effects which had resulted in raising number of cases of respiratory diseases in the locality besides the road from Shireen Jinnah Colony to the sea always remain clogged with heavy vehicles transporting coal to various industrial units./Report submitted by the Sindh Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on import, handling and storage of imported coal at Karachi Port Trust said that the KPT neither had carried out the Environmental Impact Assessment mandatory under the Pakistan Environment Protection Act nor obtained an environmental approval for handling and transportation import of over 4 million tons coal./Director General SEPA Naeem Mughal said that in view of coal storage site in a densely populated area the entire locality seems an environmental disaster. He said that it was obvious that hundreds of people in the particular location could be affected with respiratory, eye and other diseases due to air pollution containing coal dust particles./The report said that dust pollution was causing respiratory and other diseases at the location and local people also expressed their grievances due to pollution generated from the coal yard./The DG submitted that the SEPA entirely remained unaware of such large activity of coal import, although it was being carried out for last 8 to 10 years, having serious environmental issues, adding that in case compliance of environmental laws, the SEPA would have imposed some specific bindings on the KPT for taking strict careful measures to minimise the present environment concerns through implementation of a management plan./The SEPA submitted that the KPT should conduct detailed environmental audit through a reputable and independent environmental firm for coal import, handling and storage and a report be provided to the agency so that mitigation measures may be taken by the KPT to deal such an environmental issue./It was also suggested that huge quantity of coal may not be stored for a long time and cycle of import should maintain quantity of coal and its onward transportation in order to minimise the adverse effects on environment and residents of the locality./The report suggested that all operation must be carried out in such a manner that flow of dust particles into the air were minimised and this could be achieved if transportation of coal be made thoroughly in completely covered vehicles. Besides, the SEPA should be allowed to form a committee of experts who shall be authorised to inspect the coal handling and give suggestions to ensure protection of the environment./The division bench, headed by Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, after perusal of the report directed for safe storage and transportation of coal and for submission of a report with a month./The court also ordered environmental impact assessment of the coalhandling facility, reduction of coal quantity to 300,000 tons, transportation of coal through covered vehicles and regular spray of water on coal stakes."
Power generators add to pollution," Heavy power generators installed in residential and commercial localities are posing a serious health hazards to citizens./The Environment Protection Wing of City District Government Lahore (CDGL), which is supposed to protect citizens from pollution and its effects, is only acting as observant. During the current year no major campaign has so far been launched to check the major cause of pollution and only individual raids have been conducted to increase the volume of progress files./The sale of generators, especially diesel generators, has surged in the city due to loadshedding. Another important point is that there is no authority to regulate installation and use of heavy generators, which have increased noise and air pollution in residential and commercial localities./The city is already facing increased levels of noise and air pollution and residents are suffering a lot. Now the use of high power diesel generators installed outside business outlets in commercial localities in almost every nook and corner of the city has increased poison in the atmosphere./Use of generators was once confined to industrial areas, but following the ongoing loadshedding businessmen have started installing generators at their shops, offices and outlets. Majority of the generators were installed and operated without any precautionary measures to contain discharge of air pollutants and noise./One can hear heavy noise of generators in almost every commercial area during electricity breakdowns. In most of the cases, people have placed these heavy generators outside their shops and offices or on footpaths. On the other hand, the rules and regulations of Environmental Protection Department are not clear about installation of generators. The rules only cover industrial sector and these consumers are bound to get an NOC from the department. A senior official of EPD revealed that noise releasing from generators should not be more than 70 decibels but in majority of cases this noise is more than 80 decibels. He claimed majority of public complaints filed before the Environment Department of CDGL were either used to get some favours from the violators or would be used later on. He revealed noise level has already crossed the permissible limits of National Environment Quality (NEQ) standards in majority of the city's congested areas such as Bhatti Gate, Railway Station, DCO Office, Mozang, Charing Cross and Yateem Khana Chowk is between 102 to 114 decibels. ""Sustained noise over a period of time can engender deafness in the form of gradual losses in hearing. This is the most common loss in teenagers today listening to loud music,"" said Dr Hamza Imran, a TNT specialist. He said rising level of noise pollution is one of the major sources of heart, mental and ear diseases among the Lahorites, he said, adding voice unit beyond 75 decibel become injurious to human health. He said hospitals and educational institutions are among the places badly affected by noise pollution and now unchecked installation of generators in the residential localities will be injurious to human health./On Tuesday, officials of Environment department, CDGL issued notices to two business concerns of Gulberg for causing pollution through generators. Multiple complaints from general public were pending against these concerns./When contacted, District Officer (Environment) Younaz Zahid refused to give any data or answer any question officially. He said he is not a focal person and can't give any comment on any news related to environment."
MKRMS holds seminar on COPD," An awareness seminar on 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)' was held here on Tuesday. The seminar was organised by the Mir KhalilurRehman Memorial Society (MKRMS)  Jang Group of Newspapers, in collaboration with GSK Pakistan and Pakistan Chest Society and was largely attended by health officials, patients of pulmonary diseases and students./The speakers on the occasion were Brigadier (r) Dr. Mohammad Babar Cheema, who is professor of Medicine and Chest Diseases, visiting pulmonologist at Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, Margalla Institute of Medical Sciences, and Dr. Kausar Rehana, assistant professor of Pulmonology at PIMS./Brigadier (r) Dr. Mohammad Babar Cheema, while speaking on the occasion, said COPD can occur due to many factors. The major factor for COPD is cigarette smoking, smokeemitting cars and factories and indoor fuel burning. ""It is quite different from allergies that does not grow with time but these diseases grow with time silently and the patient knows when the damage is done. It is never too late and regular checkups from doctors help stop its progression. The quality of life can be improved if there is an early detection. If a person experiences shortness of breath, he should immediately consult the doctor so that early diagnosis can lead to proper treatment at an early stage. Further delay can cause inflammation and destruction of walls and can obstruct oxygen transfer from atmosphere to the blood. Doctor's invention is a must before the damage is being done. In Northern Areas, the major cause of COPD is fuelburning without proper ventilation,"" he said./Dr. Kausar Rehana said that COPD is a common and treatable disease that is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The causes for COPD includes smoking, air pollution (environmental pollution), biomass inhalation, passive smoking, genetic factors and aging can somewhat contribute to these chronic illnesses. After 40 years of age, the functions of the airways of the lungs start deteriorating. ""When we breathe in air, the air travels through airways in our lungs to millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli but in COPD the airways may become inflamed and clogged with mucus. There can be occupational exposures to people i.e. coal mines, asbestos, etc. that can lead to respiratory infections. In cigarettes there are 70 chemicals that can lead to cancer. 'Sheesha', 'Beeri', 'Niswar' are no less dangerous than cigarette because they all lead to pulmonary infections and if left unattended can lead to death. There is a test being done for people which is called spirometry test, through this test the doctors can determine COPD and the treatment can be started. People think that they are having smoking cough taking it lightly until it's too late. They don't consult the doctor and 50% of the lung function is damaged. This problem should be captured in stage 1 and stage 2, but nothing can be offered in stage 3 and stage 4 and that damage cannot be reversed,"" she said./Dr. Rehana said that if a person experiences shortness of breath, persistent cough, coughing up mucus/phlegm, wheezing, fatigue, tiredness, weight loss or weight gain, morning headaches then he should immediately consult the doctor. ""A person with COPD sees worsening of cough, a change in the colour or amount of phlegm, should also consult the doctor immediately. According to WHO survey done in 2010, 2.9 million death in the world. Exacerbations of COPD in Pakistan is highest in the world. Ion from COPD, the experts suggested that a person should avoid these triggers that are cigarettes, chemicals, fumes, dust, air pollution, flu and pneumonia. To avoid COPD from occurring, a person should wash their hands regularly, develop healthy eating habits and exercise. Proper usage of inhalers and vaccines for flu should be done to avoid these diseases,"" she said."
Concern over pollution in Rawal Lake," The Federal Minister for Climate Change, Mushahid Ullah Khan, has expressed his deep concern over different environmental, particularly water and air pollution, which continue to affect the health of the people. He said that environmental degradation has emerged to be a grave socio-economic issue for the country and effective policy measures are needed to address these problems./In his statement issued here on Monday, the minister called upon the officials of different sections of climate the change ministry, particularly environment, forestry and Environmental Protection Agency-Islamabad (Pak-EPA) to play their due role in this regard and work hard consistently to cope with the environmental issues, particularly illegal tree-cutting, deforestation, water and air pollution. He warned, ""There is no place for inefficient, incompetent and lethargic officials and officials in the climate change ministry./They have to prove themselves through hard work and efficiency to address the environmental problems being face by the country or they have to go."" Mushahid Ullah Khan said it is a matter of deep worry that pollution in the Rawal Lake continues to increase and relevant environmental agencies and departments have failed to check the contamination of the lake. ""He said that no one will be spared if found of not tacking against those, who are responsible for contamination of the Rawal Lake,"" he warned./He noted that the thousands of people are being affected with different water-borne diseases by drinking the contaminated water of the lake, because the people have no choice but to consume the water infested with diseases."
Pakistans disease burden may escalate further," Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Mushahidullah Khan has warned that Pakistans disease burden and its overall impact on socio-economic development made in recent years may further escalate because of rapidly changing and erratic climate./""The disease burden is likely to increase in urban areas like Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar, where living standard and health quality of the people are continuously declining, particularly in the context of increasing air and water pollution,"" he said./He said primarily fuelled by increasing level of carbon pollution, climate change poses a grave risk to the health and well-being of people, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan right from aggravating the risk of asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses/allergies to the spread of certain vector-borne diseases./The minister said that scientists have already projected that ozone concentration in most of the urban centres across the world including Pakistan would increase because of climate change, swelling worldwide the number of ozone-related emergency room visits for asthma by 7.3 per cent./Senator Mushahidullah Khan highlighted that climate change has also caused rise in frost-free days and warmer air temperatures, as being witnessed in colder areas of Pakistan including Islamabad. These can, in turn, cause a greater production of plant-based allergens, he warned./Referring to WHO studies on climate change impacts on human health, he said pre-existing health conditions make older adults particularly vulnerable to the respiratory impacts of air pollution. Higher rates of diabetes, obesity and asthma in some communities may place them at greater risk of climate-related health impacts."
Unending woes," Iraqs dismal health situation is testimony to the invasion of the country by foreign forces, including now the takeover of important parts of its territory by Isil. The Iraqi people have been the subject of mass executions, rape, torture and, in addition, the destruction of the countrys infrastructure. The international community has been mostly deaf to the needs of Iraqis, who have undergone difficulties much greater that during the regime of Saddam Hussein./It is estimated that since January 2014, 2.9 million people have fled their homes, 6.9 million Iraqis need immediate access to essential health services, and 7.1 million need easier access to water, sanitation and hygiene assistance. Presently, 8.2 million people in Iraq need immediate humanitarian support./Women and children have not been spared the brutal consequences of the war. Survivors of gender-base violence and rape experience trauma, and suicides among women and girls have risen markedly in recent years. Childrens health status has deteriorated in the last 12 years. In addition, they have been used as suicide bombers and human shields and have been killed by crucifixion or buried alive./Iraqis health status is a reflection of the deterioration of the countrys health system. Medical facilities, which in the 1980s were among the best in the Middle East, have deteriorated significantly after the 2003 invasion. It is estimated that during the war 12 percent of hospitals and the countrys two main public health laboratories were destroyed./Sanitary conditions in hospitals remain unsatisfactory, and medications and trained personnel are in short supply. Even basic health care is unavailable in regions of the country under armed conflict. As a result of the collapsed sanitation infrastructure, the incidence of cholera, dysentery and typhoid fever has increased. Malnutrition among children and other childhood diseases have also increased./Doctors in the thousands have been leaving the country and those that remain are under constant threat to their personal safety. As Medecins sans FrontiAÂ¨res (MSF) stated, ""Until now, it is extremely difficult to find Iraqi doctors willing to work in certain areas because they fear for their security.""/Despite some government aid and reconstruction plans, several remote areas are excluded from state reconstruction and development efforts, leaving thousands of Iraqis without access to essential health care up to this day. As a result, thousands of Iraqis are obliged to sell their homes and possessions to seek health care abroad./The widespread environmental damage caused by the war, including the degradation of forests and wetlands, destruction of wildlife, and increased air pollution will have long term impacts on peoples health. In addition, medical researchers have expressed concern about peoples health being seriously affected by the use of white phosphorus and depleted uranium by American and British forces./The continuing conflict has exacted a heavy toll on all Iraqis mental health and quality of life. ""Many Iraqis have been pushed to their absolute limit as decades of conflict and instability has wreaked devastation. Mentally exhausted by their experiences, many struggle to understand what is happening to them. The feelings of isolation and hopelessness are compounded by the taboo associated with mental health issues and the lack of mental healthcare services..."" said Helen ONeill, MSFs head of mission in Iraq./We are facing nothing less than the almost total destruction of a country by an ill-advised invasion whose consequences are still being felt. Someday, somebody will have to respond for it."
Urban health risks," Rapid urbanisation has significant repercussions on migrants' health. The increasing movement of people from rural to urban areas often alters the characteristic epidemiological disease profile of the country, and at the same time new diseases appear or old ones reemerge. Such is the case of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Urbanisation is also associated with changes in diet and exercise that increase the prevalence of obesity with increased risks of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease./Additional mobility-related risks among migrants include poverty, vulnerability to sexual abuse and exploitation, dangerous working conditions and separation from social support networks. Many of these conditions affect the most vulnerable segments of the population: women, children and the elderly./Although many migrants are young and healthy when they arrive in the cities, poor and overcrowding conditions increase the incidence of some diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and respiratory diseases when compared to local residents. In recent years, for example, tuberculosis has shown higher rates of infection, a problem compounded by delayed diagnosis and inadequate care./In addition, migrants show high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Because of their high mobility, migrants tend to spread the virus when they return to the countryside, where health facilities are not as well equipped to deal with the infection as they are in the cities./Many of migrants' health problems are due to their lack of knowledge of how to use existing health services. In addition, because of the high cost of hospital attention, many migrants are reluctant to come to the hospitals to be taken care of./On most indicators of maternal and infant health, migrants fare worse than the urban population. Many migrant women work in industries where they are in contact with environmental contaminants which are especially dangerous to the reproductive system of women when they are pregnant./Children are especially susceptible to disease when they are born and develop in an environment characterized by overcrowding, poor hygiene, excessive noise, and lack of space for recreation and study. They suffer not only from a hostile physical environment, but from stress and other factors such as violence that such environments create./Many city dwellers take for granted access to basic public services, such as drinking water supply, housing, solid waste disposal, transportation and health care. For the poor, however, these services are either deficient or nonexistent. Instead, those living in marginal poor zones usually receive an extra dose of environmental pollution, since many industries tend to cluster in outlying areas where regulations are more lax. Unemployment, poverty and living in crowded conditions contribute to violence, substance abuse and mental illness./Particularly in cities, motor vehicles are an important source of air pollution. In addition, they can be a significant cause of pedestrian injuries and fatalities. The pollutants that originate from motor vehicles, particularly nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, ozone, and particulate matter, account for a substantial proportion of air pollution in cities which can have a serious impact on health./Crowded urban neighborhoods, combined with poor sanitary conditions and inadequate waste removal, create situations favorable to the spread of infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and diarrhea. Inadequate sanitation is an important risk factor for diarrheal and parasitic diseases./Given the serious effects that urbanisation can have on health, it is essential to include health considerations into policy making."
"Report calls for global action to protect environment, secure health of future generations"," A new report released Thursday by The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health, calls for immediate global action to protect the health of human civilization and the natural systems on which it depends. The report, Safeguarding Human Health in the Anthropocene Epoch, provides the first-ever comprehensive examination of evidence showing how the health and well-being of future generations is being jeopardized by the unprecedented degradation of the planets natural resources and ecological systems./The report was written by a Commission of 15 leading academics and policymakers from institutions in 8 countries, and was chaired by Professor Sir Andy Haines of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK. It demonstrates how human activity and development have pushed to near breaking point, the boundaries of the natural systems that support and sustain human civilizations./""This Commission aims to put the health of human civilizations, and their special relationship with the larger biosphere, at the centre of concerns for future planetary sustainability,"" says Dr. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet and one of the report authors./The Commission warns that a rising population, unsustainable consumption, and the over-use of natural resources will exacerbate these health challenges in the future. The worlds poorest communities will be among those at greatest risk, as they live in areas that are most strongly affected and have greater sensitivity to disease and poor health./""The Commission has issued a dire warning: human action is undermining the resilience of the earths natural systems, and in so doing we are compromising our own resilience, along with our health and, frankly, our future,"" said Dr. Judith Rodin, president of The Rockefeller Foundation./""We are on the verge of triggering irreversible, global effects, ranging from ocean acidification to biodiversity loss,"" says Professor Haines. ""These environmental changes - which include, but extend far beyond climate change - threaten the gains in health that have been achieved over recent decades and increase the risks to health arising from major challenges as diverse as under-nutrition and food insecurity, freshwater shortages, emerging infectious diseases, and extreme weather events.""/Solutions to these clear and potent dangers are within reach, say the Commission authors, but the world needs to take decisive, coordinated action to protect the environment and secure the health of future generations. The Commission outlines a range of beneficial policies and actions that can be taken by governments, international organizations, researchers, health professionals and citizens that are good for both health and the environment. Examples include benefits from reduced air pollution, healthy diets with more fruit and vegetables, active transport (walking and cycling), reduced urban heat stress from green spaces, and increased resilience to coastal flooding from intact wetlands and mangroves. In addition, the report identifies some major gaps in evidence and the research that is needed./The 15 distinguished commissioners of the Planetary Health Commission are Chris Beyrer, Fred Boltz, Tony, Capon, Alex Ezeh, Gong Peng, Richard Horton, Sam Myers, Sania Nishtar Steve Osofsky, Subhrendu Pattanayak, Montira Pongsiri, Agnes Soucat, Jeanette Vega, Derek Yach. These commissioners are from academic institutions (Duke University, Harvard University, John Hopkins School of Public Health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Tsinghua University, UCL and the United Nations University; government institutions (the National Health Fund (FONASA) of Chile and the United States Environmental Protection Agency); multilateral institutions (the World Bank); and civil society institutions (African Health and Population Research Centre, and Heartfile, Pakistan./The News reached out to Dr. Sania Nishtar, one of the Commissioners based in Pakistan, to get to know what planetary health was first-hand. She explained, ""Planetary health is the concept that the health of humans and the natural systems of the planet we live on are interlinked and that making positive changes to benefit the environment can also substantially improve the health and wellbeing of people everywhere. By taking a holistic or ""planetary health"" approach, we can help protect both the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends.""/Sharing her views about Pakistans situation in relation to the report, Sania Nisthar said, ""Pakistan is facing threats from a combination of adverse environmental trends and high population growth rate. To cite an example, Pakistans per-capita surface water availability, which was 5,260 cubic meters per-person annually in 1951, is expected to decline to 1,100 by 2035, the water scarcity mark and less than 900 by 2050. On the other hand, the countrys population is exploding. From 34 million in 1950 to 190 million today, our population is expected to rise to 300 million by 2050. The two trend lines drawn based on these figures should be a wakeup call.""/Dr. Sania added, ""Water scarcity has serious implications for economic growth since agriculture contributes 23% of the total GDP. It has grave implications for food and energy security in an already constrained milieu. Supply side water scarcity can be compounded manifold when complicated by demand-induced scarcity due to the countrys exploding population, especially when viewed in the context of constrained economic opportunities and joblessness."" She went on to explain that ""Our existing pattern of inequitable distribution of resources is compounding water stresses-in particular rifts between the countrys agricultural and industrial elite over distribution of water for irrigation vis-AÂ -vis water for hydroelectric power generation; rivalries between feudal strongholds over availability of water for irrigation and tenuous relationships between the provinces over the share of water and revenues tied to it. As climate change and environmental changes become more manifest, the chances of conflict due to competition for resources will increase. As a country, we need to think about these mattes strategically and with a view to taking definitive action.""/The Commission has ambitious plans for a number of regional launch events - in Johannesburg, New York, Los Angeles, Islamabad, Kuala Lumpur, Nairobi, Melbourne, Beijing, Santiago and London. The Islamabad launch is planned for July 24."
The cost of coal," Lahore is fortunate that the Punjab government last month abandoned its plan of setting up a small coal-fired power station near the BRB Canal following which the Lahore High Court disposed off a writ petition by some concerned citizens against the pollution-causing project./However, the government is moving ahead with a similar project of a 110-MW coal-fired power plant in the suburbs of Faisalabad city. The civil society is silent over this. No elected representative of the people has raised a voice in the provincial or national assembly to enquire about the pros and cons of this project and its likely impact on the people living in that area./The Punjab Power Development Company Limited, a government entity, is building the electricity-generation coal-fired plant at the newly-developed M-3 Industrial Estate, 15 kilometres from the Faisalabad city and four kilometres from Chak Jhumra town. At least 12 villages, with a population of nearly 30,000, lie within the three kilometre radius of the power station's site./According to Punjab's Planning and Development (P and D) department, the project will be completed in 2017-18 with a total cost of Rs15.15 billion. Till June 2015, the government has already spent Rs450 million on the project while Rs2.5 billion has been allocated for FY2015-16./There are dense residential areas within 10km of the power station and comparatively sparse residential areas within 1km to 3km of the coal plant. While the electricity generated by the plant will be dedicated to the industrial area, the pollution caused by it will hit all the residents of the surrounding areas./The proposed coal-fired plant will be a conventional thermal power plant operating on sub-critical pressure, non-reheat steam cycle with regenerative feed heating arrangement - technology that is being abandoned in the developed world as well as China./Sub-critical small coal-fired plants are considered to be the most polluting, least efficient and oldest power plants all across the world, but Pakistan is acquiring them. It is widely known that subcritical coal-fired power stations produce 75 percent more carbon pollution and use 67 percent more water as the most efficient coal plants being installed in the US and Europe./According to an environmental and social impact assessment of the project carried out by MMP Consultants in association with Mott MacDonald, if elaborate mitigating measures are not taken, the Chak Jhumra coal-fired power station will pose high risk to the surrounding environment at least on three counts - creation of hazardous material and waste, noise pollution and generation of ash./The assessment report shows that if pollution-control measures are adopted, the environmental degradation of the area will be somewhat reduced but will not disappear. For instance, the leaching of pollutants in the ground water will persist and the concentration of sulphur dioxide, using indigenous coal, would exceed the National Environmental Quality Standards (120Âµg/m3). Noise caused by the power plant will also remain higher than standard limits./A major adverse effect of this plant will be the toxic constituents of coal ash produced in the process; this ash has the potential to impact air, land and human drinking water if mitigating systems are not appropriately designed and ash handling is not correctly managed./The resultant ash from coal usage will consist of silica, lime, aluminium oxide, iron oxide, calcium oxide, sulphate, and silicate and titanium oxide. Potential health risks include cancer, neurological effects, heart damage, lung disease, kidney disease, reproductive problems, gastrointestinal illness, birth defects, and impaired bone growth in children./The disposal of ash, especially flying ash, from the plant will have significant residual impacts on the ground water even after mitigation measures are taken. The water table of the area is already high and disposal of ash in landfill may cause leaching of hydrocarbons in the groundwater./The plant will be located quite close to Faisalabad city which already has significant air pollution, according to the Environment Protection Department. A recent ambient air quality survey in the city showed that concentration of pollutants including particulate matter and nitrogen oxides were higher than the permissible national standards aka NEQS./The operation of the coal-fired power station will lead to emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other pollutants, which have direct and indirect negative impacts on the health of human and other living organisms. Coal plants are also known to release mercury as a waste hazardous material./The impact assessment report has suggested more than 100 pollution-control measures while building and operating the coal-fired power plant. It requires regular monitoring of air quality and ground water by the provincial Environment Protection Department (EPD), which does not have a single laboratory that consistently remains functional to monitor air quality./It's doubtful that the government will adopt these steps given the high cost attached to them. Thus, transparent installation of the plant and its operation are mandatory so that stakeholders know the level of emissions produced by the coal-fired power station./Keeping in view the EPD's defective and dysfunctional laboratories and poorly skilled staff, one can't expect regular monitoring of mitigating measures at the coal plant. There is genuine fear that the coal plant will have a major negative impact on the surrounding environment if the civil society does not keep a close eye on it./The fact is that in developing countries like Pakistan many coal-fired plants operate far below their design efficiencies because of poor quality coal, poor plant maintenance and lack of diagnostic tools./It's hard to imagine that the Punjab government officials, notorious for their lackadaisical attitude, poor work ethics and corrupt practices, will efficiently operate the Chak Jhumra coal plant. A small lapse in pollution-mitigating measures and maintenance of the plant may play havoc with the local population./In 2004, the US enforced strict pollution-control measures at coal power stations such as doubling of the amount of scrubbers installed at power plants and additional retirements of coal capacity which led to a sharp decline in the emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide./Pakistan needs to adopt such standards from the outset to avoid the negative effects of power-generation from coal. It would be better for the government to install coal-fired power stations with the latest and relatively clean technology, which could be a little more expensive but worth it when weighed against the risks involved."
Residents urge CDA for proper disposal of waste," The residents have urged the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to adopt a comprehensive mechanism for proper collection and disposal of solid waste as heaps of rubbish were posing serious threat to the health of citizens./The residents of various areas of the capital told this news agency that the heaps of garbage could be seen everywhere in different areas of Sohan, Faizabad and New Shakarial./Raja Mushtaq, a senior citizen, said that residents of Faizabad and Sohan were facing foul stench emanating from garbage heaps resulting in air pollution. Burning of waste plastic bags and other waste material also pollutes air threatening residents of respiratory and other diseases./CDA was oblivious to this problem over the years and heaps of had become a permanent source of nuisance for the residents he added./Kashif Raja a resident of Khanna Pul said the issue of waste disposal required immediate attention of the authorities./He said sanitary workers instead of removing the garbage used to collect and dump and incinerate the waste on roadside. This causes more trouble to the residents especially the elders suffering from a range of ailments./A senior official of the civic body in municipal wing said people in these areas were used to dump solid waste at improper places despite availability of CDA dustbins. He said that huge piles of rubbish could be seen everywhere even in front of these dustbins./He said that most of waste generated in these areas is dumped on streets or some unauthorised sites like vacant plots which creates difficulty for CDA workers./Federal Government Poly Clinic (FGPC) Executive Director Dr. Zahid told Media that untreated and improper disposal of waste is causing ailments and serious hazards to human health in the various areas of the capital./He said that residents of the areas where there is no proper waste disposal method suffer from infectious diseases like Hepatitis and respiratory disorders. Dr Zahid further said that plastic waste accumulating on the roadside in Faizabad and Pirwadhai areas was posing serious threats to the health of citizens."
Unplanned urbanisation behind pollution," Rising urban congestion in the provincial capital has increased all kinds of pollution, especially air and water whereas our town planners are busy in turning more city localities in commercial zones./Unplanned expansion of urban areas, absence of public transport and mass transit services, tremendous increase in the number of privately owned vehicles are resulting in high concentrations of pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides and sulphur oxide, which are seriously affecting the health of general public./Though various government departments such as Transport, Environment and CDGL initiated several short-term campaigns against smoke-emitting vehicles and two stroke motorcycle rickshaws but they failed to improve the air quality. A little respite was seen to the commuters on signal-free corridor where traffic is running smooth./Presence of excessive Suspended Particulate Matter (PM10) in the ambient air is also one of the biggest causes of increased air pollution in the city. Major sources of the PM10 in the city are vehicles, industry, burning of solid waste, brick kilns and natural dust. Unpaved roads and absence of greenbelts are the originators of this major pollutant./Ironically the level of PM10 is far higher in less privileged localities because Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) which is responsible for maintaining greenbelts is only performing its duties with dedication in posh localities and big roads of the city. Sources in Environmental Protection Department (EPD) Punjab revealed that average PM concentration in Lahore had exceeded manifold from the international standards and WHO guidelines. EPD sources claimed that amongst all vehicles running on diesel are putting more impact on the environment./Scattered solid waste, non-implementation of Hospital Waste Management Rules, 2005 and sale of hospital waste to the recycling industry in the city are also the other hot issues, which are contributing to the city's environmental health. Recently, EPD launched a massive operation against hospital waste but citizens feared that this crackdown may ended like the previous operations during which only notices were issued to the culprits instead of taking strict action against them./It is worth mentioning that since last many years, the government and city planners made repeated announcements that light and heavy industrial units operating in various residential city localities i.e. Misri Shah, Baghbanpura, Mughalpura, Daroghawala, Bhagatpura, Chah Miran, Shad Bagh and others along the Bund Road and GT Road would be shifted outside these residential areas. But, unfortunately not a single practical step had been taken in this regard. These industries included steel foundries, steel re-rolling mills, brick kilns, steel furnaces, scrapyards, plastic recycling industry, marble grinding, furniture making and several other kinds of cottage industries. These industrial units are causing air pollution, noise, vibration and heat./Besides these industrial clusters, the regular industrial zones have now been surrounded by residential localities due to which citizens are forced to bear the hazardous effects of pollution caused by industries. Small drives were launched repeatedly against violators but a serious action is still awaited./As per Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997 all industrial units are supposed to obtain NOC from EPD but over 90 percent units, including industrial units operating in the city, did not bother to fulfill this legal formality. The lack of enforcement of rules to discourage polluters has made the EPD a toothless tiger, sources said./Naseem-ur-Rehman, a senior EPD official said the department had taken a number of steps to bring down the pollution levels. He said tree plantation was the biggest source through which pollution could be brought down. He said the department had already engaged private sector for this activity and a large number of fruit trees would be planted in various city areas very shortly."
Abolishing district-level setup can lead to environmental disaster," The already rising pollution levels across the province can lead to an environmental disaster as the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) Punjab has proposed to abolish its district level setup, which is the very first check on polluters./Abolishing district level setup of the department means giving a clean chit to the polluters and they can do whatever they want, said leading environmentalists who urged the government to immediately withdraw the proposed changes in the department./It is pertinent to mention here that policymakers of the EPD did nothing except giving colorful presentations and policy papers to please politicians and ruling elite while on the ground people were compelled to drink contaminated water and inhale poisonous air, especially in urban localities./Priority of the government towards the environment can be gauged from the fact that during the year 2015-16, the department has not introduced a single new scheme while the Punjab government had reduced the budgetary allocations for environment by 74 percent in comparison with the previous year./Last year the government allocated Rs 190 million for environment but for the year 2015-16 the government only allocated Rs 50 million, which astonishingly didn't include any new scheme. This year the government's vision is promotion and attainment of sustainable development in the province through integration of environmental considerations while achieving the goals of economic growth and development./It is pertinent to mention here that in 2008-09 the annual development budget for environmental protection was Rs 1 billion, in 2009-10 the development budget was cut down to Rs 500 million, in 2010-11 it was further reduced to Rs 335 million, in 2011-12 it was Rs 350 million and in 2012-13 it remained Rs 350 million. During the year 2013-14, the budgetary allocations for environment were further slashed to Rs 164 million while in 2014-15 it was revised a little and increased to Rs 190 million./During the last several years Punjab government introduced different visions for improving environment, which included encouraging use of clean fuels, green public transport and treatment of industrial effluents, but ironically all these visions remained in the books and environmental issues seemed to be the last priority of the government in practical./The practical efforts of the EPD can be gauged from the fact that majority of industrial units across the province are still throwing their toxic and untreated waste water into the ground as well as water channels like canals and rivers, ultimately affecting the overall environmental system of the nature. And there is no one to stop them./Similarly, in urban areas smoke and noise emitting vehicles are thronging the roads while industrial units are continuously polluting the air. In urban areas, especially the provincial metropolis, the main cause of deterioration of air quality was presence of excessive Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the ambient air./It is important to note that to tackle different environmental issues, the EPD established laboratories in eight different cities, but interestingly the performance of these laboratories except the one in Lahore was zero. Even the mobile units are out of order and standing at the EPD head office for the past three years./Safe disposal of hospital waste and enforcement of Hospital Waste Management Rules 2005 is also a very big issue, which needs to be dealt with serious efforts to save huge population from its very hazardous effects. Hospital waste includes both risk waste and non-risk waste./Experts said there was an urgent need to raise awareness and educate general public and persons concerned on medical waste issues while proper waste management strategy was needed to ensure health and environmental safety./EPD sources claimed that according to a recent study, average air pollution in big cities was about 4 times higher than the World Health Organisation (WHO) limits. They said the main causes are vehicular emissions, industrial emissions and dust fall. They said air pollution was causing respiratory diseases, eye irritation, reduced visibility, loss of vegetation, damage to material, heritage and monuments and effects on growth of plants./About water pollution, department sources said water pollution was the contamination of water bodies like lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater. Water pollution occurs when pollutants are discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds./They said main causes were disposal of untreated municipal liquid waste, leaking sewer lines and industrial waste water. They said water pollution was contaminating drinking water, polluting water bodies, sub-soil water, loss of aquatic life, crop damages, heavy metals in food chain and increased rate of water borne diseases./Environmental experts said the treatment plants should be installed for municipal and industrial effluents before disposal to water bodies. They said adequate collection, recycling and disposal should be ensured while application of Clean Technology at the industrial units. They said segregation of sewage lines was a must to avoid mixing with drinking water supply while fitter plants should be installed for clean drinking water./Director General EPA Dr Javed Iqbal while talking with The News said the proposal of abolishing district level setup was made, but this proposal had never been submitted to the government. He agreed that abolishing this setup could be a catastrophic move and the department would lose its representation in all the districts."
Cancer advice," When I started my career in pathology 34 years ago, cancer was a common ailment in our country, especially among the elderly. Now cancer has reached epidemic proportions. The reason is simple: we are floating in a sea of carcinogens (cancer causing agents). We have ruthlessly destroyed our environment. We are inhaling polluted air. Driving behind a bus or truck is like puffing 20 cigarettes simultaneously. Our water table is polluted by industrial waste containing arsenic and mercury. Due to air pollution we are more exposed to radiation from the sun./We must respect and protect our environment. It is the moral duty of the media to create awareness among people that cancer is a preventable disease."
Speed demons on two wheels," Time was when I pedalled around on a bicycle on Karachi's busy roads and streets, sometimes with a little sister or brother on the crossbar. I didn't even wear spectacles then./Today, I hate to even cross the same roads, having learnt to be extra-cautious about motorcycles after a number of close calls. Not many years ago, a fellow journalist was quite seriously injured by a motorcyclist as he returned from work late at night. His injury was all the more serious since at middle age, he can be considered an old case of diabetes./As for myself, in the early 2000s, a motorcyclist riding at breakneck speed could have left me maimed, or worse, as I was crossing a road with the customary caution I have developed./He spared me by inches by quickly applying the brakes, but he still had to swerve to avoid hitting me. I bet he must have been amused at my silly near-death scream. A few years later, I was actually hit - right on the kneecap./Thank goodness it was a light, glancing blow, and thank goodness the motorcyclist was slowed by the parked vehicles on the side-street he had entered. His response to my avuncular chiding at his rashness was an insolent glare./As I was coming to work one recent afternoon, I had an unsettling experience of another kind. The motorcyclist, a balding middle-aged man, seemed to be in a tearing hurry to get to the petrol station on the other side of the road./So he cut right across my rickshaw's path to reach it. There would surely have been an almighty crash if the rickshaw driver hadn't applied the brakes just in time. Afterwards, the elderly Pathan kept shaking his head in disgusted disbelief at the man's devil-may-care recklessness, muttering choice words of abuse for someone who could have wrecked his rickshaw and got him in deep trouble with the police for no fault of his own. To say nothing of what would almost surely have happened to the man and his motorcycle, and to the driver and myself./On another recent occasion late one night, a rickshaw I had just hired was slowly making a U-turn when - thud! - it was hit by a motorbike. Encouraged by the fact that it was midnight, with no policeman around, the man blamed the rickshaw driver for the hit. He didn't stop at that./He removed the rickshaw's ignition key to force the driver to straighten up the motorcycle's front wheel which had gone out of alignment from the impact, returning it only after the driver had complied by going on his haunches to do the job. It was almost miraculous the rickshaw suffered only minor damage./Again, as I left a shop on one of the broad footpaths still remaining in Karachi's once lovely Saddar area, a man who had just started his bike immediately went into high gear, coming straight at me as I walked to the road. During the row that followed, he said that I was to blame. How on earth? Because, he replied, I had left the shop too quickly (aap bohot tezi se baahar nikle)./Until the late-1980s, footpaths were strictly for pedestrians' use. Since then, however, they have been increasingly arrogated by Karachi's motorcyclists. To claim his right of way on the footpath, a motorcyclist would typically beep at you with impatience. This isn't confined to footpaths, though./Visiting a graveyard in the Malir area for the burial of a cousin back in 2006, I found that the graveyard's narrow path between its gates at opposite ends was being used by motorcyclists as a convenient two-way shortcut to the entrances at opposite ends. The motorcyclists expected the mourners to move on or disperse to make way, or rudely asked them to comply./Not many years ago, a pedestrian on a footpath was hit from behind by a motorcycle; luckily for him, he wasn't hurt. It goes without saying that a quarrel ensued, but one of the motorcyclist's comments was quite unexpected: You were not being watchful (Aap dekh kar naheen chal rahe the)./The victim's response to the taunt was a slap to the man's face. Heaven knows how many incidents of this kind take place on Karachi's roads and footpaths, going unreported because they didn't degenerate into violence more serious than slaps and fisticuffs./Still more frightening is a motorcyclist roaring past you in darkness on roads and footpaths alike, headlight and taillight off; doubly so when the surroundings are almost pitch dark during blackouts from power failures./A good one-third of our motorcyclists seem to have had their silencers removed, just for the heck of it. In which case, high-decibel sound pollution combines with air pollution when motorcyclists, as well as drivers of other poorly maintained vehicles, take to the road emitting smoke./Add to this the motorcyclists who are unlicensed, and those who are underage; some, from their face and height, as young as 15, 14?/And, unless you relish the thrill of having your heart in your mouth, beware the daredevils doing wheelies on roads!/Don't get me wrong. I am not some anti-motorcycle crusader. Four-wheel vehicles - cars, wagons, trucks, tankers and the rest - are driven just as rashly because of the rapidly receding respect for traffic rules, in a city once famed for its civilised traffic and strict adherence to these rules by drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike. None of these vehicles, though, is quite as capable of plowing into knots of people as a motorcycle is./To address its traffic chaos, Karachi has to start somewhere. Starting with its motorcycles couldn't be a bad idea. Any suggestions?"
Only half of all children sick with pneumonia receive proper medical care: Dr Tabish Hazir," Despite the availability of efficacious interventions, the reduction of pneumonia mortality remains a challenge in Pakistan, a country where only about half of all children sick with pneumonia receive appropriate medical care; where only less than 20 per cent receive antibiotics; and where only 1 in 5 caregivers knows the danger signs of pneumonia. Yet, despite the gravity of the situation, little attention is being paid to the disease./Talking to 'The News' here on Tuesday in connection with the forthcoming World Pneumonia Day, Dr. Tabish Hazir, head of pediatric medicine and principal investigator of the ARI Research Cell, Children's Hospital, PIMS, emphasised the need to find ways to integrate various approaches for pneumonia prevention and control into a national programme to maximize their impact. World Pneumonia Day is observed every year on November 12 to draw attention to the need to raise awareness of pneumonia, promote prevention and treatment, and generate action to fight the illness./Pakistan has an estimated 10 million cases of pneumonia every year. The illness accounts for 19 percent of all under-five deaths in the country. Ironically, this number has not changed in the last 20 years, which clearly demonstrates the absence of a determined collaborative effort to address the issue of children needlessly dying of pneumonia./According to Dr. Tabish, 7-13 per cent of the total cases of pneumonia in Pakistan require referral and hospitalisation. Estimates suggest that if antibiotic treatment were universally delivered to children with pneumonia, around 600,000 lives could be saved each year. The number of lives saved could more than double to 1.3 million if both prevention and treatment interventions to reduce pneumonia are implemented, Dr. Tabish maintained, referring to the over 2 million pneumonia-related child deaths worldwide./Yet, despite the gravity of the situation, little attention is being paid to the disease. Only about half of children sick with pneumonia receive appropriate medical care; only less than 20 per cent receive antibiotics. Moreover, only 1 in 5 caregivers knows the danger signs of pneumonia, Dr Tabish re-emphasised./The pediatrician recommended the need for improvement in care-seeking behaviour to promote ease in recognising the signs of pneumonia. Rapid or difficult breathing, cough and fever, wheezing; convulsions, unconsciousness, low body temperature, lethargy and feeding problems in young infants; and lower chest wall in-drawing (chests moving in or retracting during inhalation) are some of the key signs of pneumonia, he shared./Undernourished children, particularly those not exclusively breastfed or with inadequate zinc intake, are at higher risk of developing pneumonia, Dr. Tabish informed. Similarly, children and infants suffering from other illnesses such as AIDS or measles, those exposed to parental smoking or indoor pollution, and those living in crowded homes are also predisposed to the illness, he added./With reference to diagnosis, Dr. Tabish urged for simplifying the diagnosis of pneumonia for resource-constrained settings like those in Pakistan. Chest x-rays and laboratory tests are used to confirm the presence of pneumonia, but in resource-poor settings without access to these technologies, suspected cases of pneumonia are diagnosed by their clinical symptoms. Children and infants are presumed to have pneumonia if they exhibit a cough, and fast or difficult breathing, he pointed out./Asked to share three steps that can help reduce deaths among children under five with pneumonia, Dr. Tabish said, recognize that a child is sick; seek appropriate care, and treat appropriately with antibiotics./With reference to pneumonia prevention, Dr. Tabish spoke in favour of nutritional interventions such as breastfeeding, which is proven to have a preventive effect against pneumonia morbidity and mortality. He also recommended Zinc supplementation in Zinc deficient populations; this prevents about one-quarter of episodes of pneumonia, which may translate into modest reduction in pneumonia mortality, he added./Similarly, indoor air pollution is also a contributing factor. In Pakistan, commonly cheap solid fuels are used. Mostly cooking is undertaken indoors. While the health sector has an advocacy role, a broader approach extending beyond the mandate of health sector is required since it is closely related to poverty reduction, Dr. Tabish highlighted./If effectively implemented, community-based treatment, exclusive breastfeeding promotion, zinc supplementation, and immunization with Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines through existing programmes are the most cost-effective options. Other cost-effective interventions are upgrading of and increased access to facility-based case management of pneumonia of young children, particularly neonates. Effective global control of childhood pneumonia will require combinations of these interventions at country level, Dr. Tabish stated, showing the way forward./Innovations which are being considered globally and which can be used in Pakistan include respiratory rate timers that automatically count breaths, pulse oximeters that operate on cellphones, oxygen therapy delivered via a shampoo bottle, antibiotics that can be squeezed out of a tube and eaten like baby food, solar-powered cooking technology, and human milk banks where even the sickest newborns can get the protection of breast milk from donors./According to estimates of the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) founded by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001, of the 10.6 million annual deaths of children less than 5 years of age, 73% were attributed to 6 causes: pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, neonatal pneumonia or sepsis, preterm delivery, and asphyxia at birth. Pneumonia accounts for 19% of mortality in children aged less than 5 years, and pneumonia or sepsis causes one-fourth of the annual deaths in neonates./Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs, making breathing painful and limiting oxygen intake. It is encouraging to note that the ARI Research Cell/MNCHRN, in collaboration with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and the National Expanded Programme on Immunization, is also commemorating World Pneumonia Day today (Wednesday) by hosting a multi-stakeholder event at the Children's Hospital."
'6.9m Pakistanis COPD patients'," As the world observes the Global COPD Day (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), more than 2,410 million people are suffering from the COPD worldwide with Pakistan sharing the burden of 6.9 million people./Addressing a media briefing at a local hotel on Wednesday to mark this international day, doctors stressed that we must realise the deadly effects of the COPD as it will become the leading cause of death in future even ahead of diabetes and depression./The worst part is this that there is very superficial awareness about this killer disease and not much attention is paid to fight it./The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COLD) defines the COPD as a common preventable disease characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and lungs to noxious particles and gases./We have to realise that the COPD is a major threat. Being a chronic disease, once a man falls prey to it, there is no point of return. If not controlled, it increases with time./Difficulty in breathing will restrict him to perform any difficult job./He becomes a non-productive part of the family and society, said Prof. Dr. Kamran Cheema, President Pakistan Chest Society and Head of Pulmonalogy, Services Hospital./Talking about the signs and symptoms of the COPD, he said shortness of breath, persistent cough, coughing up mucus, wheezing, fatigue/tiredness, weight loss, morning headaches are alarming signs of the disease. It is more common in men as compared to women. The spread of the COPD increases with age and primarily affects the people of 40 years and above./He added that symptoms of the disease develop slowly and are ignored by most of the patients as 'old age' or 'smoker's cough' which is a dangerous attitude of patients and by the time it is realised they have often lost a significant amount of lung function. Dr. Ashraf Jamal, Joint Secretary PCS and Asst. Professor Pulmonalogy Services Hospital, while sharing a data on the COPD symptoms, said the spread rate of the COPD related symptoms is 18.5 percent and 26.7 percent patients come with co-morbidities. Similarly, around 33.3 per cent COPD patients were hospitalised for their condition and 26.7 per cent patients visited an emergency room due to their respiratory condition./He said smoking is the major contributor that accounts for up to 75% of all cases of the COPD. Not only smokers are at higher risk, but they also harm other people through passive smoking. Recent trends of 'Sheesha' and 'e-cigarettes' are also harmful and contributing heavily to the menace./People consider them a safe alternative, but they are gravely mistaken. He urged the people to stay away from smoking and other air pollutants./He stressed that patients have to take care of their routines and habits; they have to avoid triggers like cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes and dust. Once diagnosed with the COPD, daily medication is vital to fight with the COPD along with short-acting rescue inhalers./The COPD is a chronic disease and has no cure. The only way to counter this disease is to live and use prescribed therapies./Loose milk: The Department of Food Sciences and Human Nutrition of University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS) Lahore in collaboration with the Punjab Enabling Environment Project (PEEP) organised a one-day training workshop on Data Collection for Assessment of Loose Milk Supply to Lahore City on Wednesday./According to a press release, Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr Talat Naseer Pasha chaired the workshop while Punjab Food Authority Director Operations Ayesha Mumtaz, Dr Muhammad Nasir and researchers from academic institution, representatives from public and private dairy sector were also present./Speaking on the occasion, the vice-chancellor said that loose milk is causing serious food safety issues, so we need to develop and maintain a formal minimum-pasteurised milk supply chain. He said that under this PEEP project, the UVAS is going to focus on Lahore for proposing an implantable model for availability/supply of safe milk, which afterwards can be replicated in other districts of Punjab./Ayesha Mumtaz said it is our duty to ensure that the milk we purchase from market and milkmen is free from poisonous adulterants including chemicals, low quality oils, urea fertiliser and aflatoxin. She said these adulterants are hazardous and causing irreversible damage to human health./The workshop was a step towards development of a formal dairy sector to regulate the sale of milk, which is minimally pasteurised and safe for consumers throughout the Punjab province."
This air we breathe," Despite the fact that degradation of air quality in the country, in big cities in particular, has assumed alarming proportions, all air quality monitoring stations in the country have been lying shut down for the last six years except the one made functional in Peshawar last year./According to a report issued by the WHO in 2014, Karachi is the fifth most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution with toxic particulate matter (PM2.5) at 117 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air). Peshawar and Rawalpindi closely follow at 111 ug/m3 and 107 ug/m3 against the WHO's permissible limit of 25 ug/m3 for 24 hours./Particulate matter (PM2.5) consists of tiny inhalable particles, smaller than 2.5 microns, exposure to which can cause lung and heart diseases because they can get deep into human lungs, and some may even get into bloodstream. These particles are found near roadways, dusty industries and in smoke and haze./An ambient (outdoor) air quality monitoring survey carried out in Lahore by the Environment Protection Agency in January 2010 showed that particulate matter (2.5) in the Township area of the city reached 80ug/m3 in the non-rainy season. In June 2014, when EPA Punjab rehabilitated Lahore's two monitoring stations, they recorded particulate matter (2.5) in the city at 110ug/m3, which is more than four times the permissible limit./The World Health Organisation gathered data from more than 1,600 cities for the years 2008 to 2013. The air pollution of the Pakistani cities cited by the WHO is also based on old data produced in 2008-2010 when monitoring stations in five major cities including Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta were operational. It can be safely assumed that since then air pollution has worsened owing to an increase in the number of motor vehicles as well as growth in population./No latest figures of ambient air quality are available for cities because fixed and mobile stations for monitoring and measuring air quality installed in 2007 in five major cities shut down in 2010. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had provided Pakistan a grant of $1,233 million to set up these monitoring stations with a warning that sustainability of these stations depended upon uninterrupted maintenance and supply of kits for laboratory tests. However, this advice fell on deaf ears./In Karachi, Quetta and Islamabad, air monitoring stations are still non-functional. In Peshawar, the station has been restored last year. In Lahore, after having remained closed for three years, the two stations were made functional in 2014 but currently they are working at half their capacity for want of repair and maintenance; eight out of 18 analysers in these monitoring stations are out of order. The mobile station in Lahore does not even have a driver to run the vehicle./The Punjab government doles out billions on luxury projects but cannot spare a small amount of Rs2.5 million needed for annual repairs and maintenance to keep them fully functional. Compared to our dismal state, 320 air monitoring stations are working all over India, 70 in Iran and 26 in Dubai./The environment is quite low on the priority list of our provincial governments. For example, in FY2014-15, the Punjab government allocated an annual development budget of Rs190 million on environment projects but spent only Rs20 million (10.5 percent of the total). The same was the case in the preceding year 2013-14, when the Punjab government had spent only Rs47 million on the environment projects out of an original allocation of Rs164 million./In 2008, the Federal Ministry of Environment had formulated a Pakistan Clean Air Programme (PCAP) but it proved to be non-starter. Following the 18th Amendment in April 2010, the subject of environment was devolved to the provinces which put the clean air initiatives on the backburner./The rapidly increasing number of motor vehicles has increased the amount of nitrogen oxides whose value has been found to be four to six times more than the normal value in big cities like Lahore and Karachi. This can be checked by enforcing strict standards of emissions on motor vehicles. We need to adopt Euro-5 and Euro-6 emission standards if we need to save our future generations./One major reason of the high levels of sulphur oxides in ambient air of big cities and on highways is that sulphur content in diesel in our country is about one percent - which is much higher than the 0.03 percentage in Europe. The government needs to fix new standards for sulphur content in diesel being used in our country./Air pollution is not only contributing to increased respiratory and heart diseases but the haze and fog in winters in many parts of the country also bring life to a standstill. As the winter sets in, dense layers of fog envelopes most parts of Punjab for up to 16 hours a day./A study by the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) in 2007 pointed out that it is not only motor vehicles but coal-fired power stations in neighbouring Indian Punjab that are responsible for fog in our side of Punjab./In Indian Punjab, 14 thermal units of coal-fired plants burn 13.6 million tonne of coal annually, releasing huge quantities of flying ash and sulphur dioxide into ambient air. Because of proximity and wind factor, these coal plants are causing air pollution and dense fog./The long hours of fog have caused huge economic losses as it results in stunted growth of plants and reduced activity owing to low visibility on highways. But no government has ever bothered to take up this issue with the Indian authorities./The overall approach of the authorities and the civil society is to ignore environmental issues. We are paying a high price for this neglect in terms of massive spending on health problems, and will pay a still higher price in the days to come if this attitude does not change for the better./Email: /<a href=""mailto:adnanadilzaidi@gmail.com"">adnanadilzaidi@gmail.com</a>/  and lt;/<a href=""mailto:adnanadilzaidi@gmail.com"">adnanadilzaidi@gmail.com</a>/ and gt;"
"6.9m Pakistanis affected by COPD, of which smoking is the cardinal cause"," Smoking accounts for up to 75% of all cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which affects more than 6.9 million people in Pakistan, health experts told the media at a briefing arranged here on Tuesday to mark the COPD Awareness Campaign. Not only are smokers at higher risk; they also harm other people through passive smoking./Addressing on the occasion, the head of the pulmonology department at Shifa International Hospital Dr. Aftab Akhtar said, COPD is expected to become the third leading cause of death from chronic diseases worldwide by 2020. COPD is a common preventable disease characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs./Deaths, injuries and disability from COPD will rise in developing countries, primarily due to increased rate of smoking. Smoking remains a major public health issue which is growing in Pakistan at the rate of 18.7%; breathlessness is the most frequently reported symptom of COPD, Dr. Aftab maintained./Dr. Shazli Manzoor, head of pulmonology and medical director at Kalsoom International Hospital and Chest Clinic Islamabad said, treatment and awareness of COPD has become a challenge for the world as it is one of the most common respiratory disorders worldwide, affecting approximately 210 million people around the world./Dr. Shazli referred to a population-based study on COPD titled 'Breathe' when claiming that the disease is on the rise in Pakistan. The study, which was conducted in 11 countries including Pakistan, revealed very low awareness of COPD among smokers. Many patients are poorly informed about COPD and its management, and much can be done to improve disease education. Better patient education and more effective patient-physician communication are clearly required and the opening up of alternative information channels may complement the patient-physician dialogue, he added./Meanwhile, Dr. Shazli said, COPD prevalence is generally higher in men than women. Any patient above 40 who has dyspnea (increasing effort to breathe), chronic cough, chronic sputum production, history of smoking, embracing occupational dusts and chemicals, history of asthma, allergy, sinusitis, family history of COPD or other respiratory diseases, might become a victim of COPD./Experts urged patients to take care of their habits, and to avoid triggers like cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes and dust. Once diagnosed with COPD, daily medication is vital to fight the disease along with short-acting rescue inhalers./We have to realize that COPD is a chronic disease and has no point of return. The only way to counter this deadly killer is awareness, healthy living and use of prescribed therapies, the experts agreed in conclusion."
"Dry chill, pollution causing seasonal ailments"," With the setting in of dry chilly weather, the cases of cold, sore throat, cough, and flu have started getting on the rise and the seasonal infections may take shape of an epidemic in a few days if people do not take precautionary measures in time./Dry chill, accompanied with high pollution level in the air, causes spread of various seasonal infections, respiratory problems and complications for patients with asthma every year across the country./Health experts say that in winter, children suffer from cold, upper and lower respiratory tract infections ten times as often as all other diseases combined. Immediate rain as well as heavy wind is needed to cleanse the air quality, which seems to be engulfed by dusty clouds, toxic metals and vapours./Data collected by 'The News' reveals that the allied hospitals in town along with other public and private healthcare facilities have already started receiving significant number of patients with seasonal infections. The number of chronic patients reaching allied hospitals with complications due to fall in temperature has also increased, and according to health experts, it may put an extraordinary burden on healthcare infrastructure if people do not take proper preventive measures at the time./Public transport vehicles along with heavy traffic on almost all roads are a big source of air pollution and it is imperative to take precautions in order to minimize their effect. The on-going construction work on a number of roads in town creating huge clouds of dust mixed with hazardous chemicals is also adding fire to the fuel and causing greater health threat particularly for chronic patients of asthma and like ailments./It is important that common cold and flu (influenza) are very common infections of upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, ears and sinuses). Colds and flu are caused by viruses. Over 200 different viruses can cause colds. They can be lurking anywhere people have been. The virus hangs around the classroom, office, factory, the bus, or train in tiny droplets that are sneezed and coughed by infected people into the air. The flu is caused by influenza virus which is of major three types A, B and C."

The virus hangs around the classroom, office, factory, the bus, or train in tiny droplets that are sneezed and coughed by infected people into the air. The flu is caused by influenza virus which is of major three types A, B and C./Studies reveal that these infections are highly contagious, passed by tiny droplets produced during sneezing, coughing of infected persons and touching things with hands and tissues that others touch. Recent researches say if you are a smoker, or hang around with people who smoke, you are more likely to catch more colds and they can last longer. Smokers usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokers./Health experts say that a cold and the flu have many of the same symptoms. But a cold is generally mild, while the flu tends to be more severe. A stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, no or mild fever, lasting two to four days or a week, are usual signs of cold. Tiredness, high fever, chills, headache, and major aches and pains probably mean you have the flu./Like many other health experts, Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr Mohammad Ashraf Chaudhry belives that coughing can be a sign of either cold or the flu but a bad cough points to the flu. Tiredness from flu may continue for several weeks. There is no cure for the cold or the flu however, you can treat your symptoms only to feel better while your body fights off the virus, he said while talking to 'The News'./He explained that mostly colds and flu are self-limiting within a week or so, however, sometimes complications such as ear and sinus infections in case of colds and pneumonia in case of flu may occur which may be life-threatening./Be a good citizen. Do not spread your cold germs to others. You can give other your cold when you cough or sneeze in the air around them; or if the droplets from your nose or mouth falls onto something that they touch, or if your hands smear the droplets onto something that they then handle. Hands are the culprits in many of the colds that we get, said Dr. Ashraf./The patient of cold or flu should stay at home and avoid smoking. It is better for a patient to have plenty of fluids and fruit juices preferably orange juice, said Rawalpindi Medical College Principal Professor of Medicine Dr. Mohammad Umar while talking to 'The News'./He said patients along with healthy people should start drinking green tea or water with lemon and honey. Chicken soup can also help loosen the mucus. Gargle with warm saline water a few times a day to relieve sore throat. Throat spray lozenges may also help to relieve the pain, he suggested./He said a patient may have cough lozenges or take cough syrup to quiet a dry cough but nasal drops or sprays should not be used longer than three days. He believes that inhaling steam can help a blocked nose./It is important that the health experts do not suggest antibiotics as they do not work against viruses. However, in case of complications of cold and flu, these may be taken on the advice of qualified doctor, they said./Both experts say that overcrowded places like cinema halls should be avoided during outbreak of cold or flu and especially children should not be taken to overcrowded areas. Wearing properly warm clothes and a well balanced diet can help avoiding a number of seasonal infections, said Dr. Umar."
Climate change causing tens of thousands of deaths every year," Climate change is causing tens of thousands of deaths every year from shifting patterns of disease, from extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and severe storms, droughts, fires and from the degradation of air quality, food and water supplies, and sanitation. Inland nations will disappear due to surge in storm coastal areas. Uncounted species will become extinct./In 2012, WHO estimated seven million people died from air pollution-related diseases making air pollution the world's largest single environmental health risk. According to Unicef, 690 million children are at risk from climate change. A key concern is exposure to diseases that could become deadlier as a result of climate change rising temperatures, including malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and malnutrition./Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry expressed this while talking to 'The News' on health hazards becoming more and more damaging because of climate change./He added that heat waves, which have become more frequent, are causing more severe rashes, cramps, exhaustion and dehydration, which is common cause of hyperthermia and death among infants and young children./Over the years, human activities have greatly increased greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons, etc. The increase in quantity of greenhouse gas emissions has raised the temperature of the earth, the phenomenon commonly known as Global Warming, he said./To a query, he explained that Pakistan is ranked 16th in the Climatic Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) indicating that our country is highly susceptible to extreme climatic hazards; particularly recurring floods and droughts. No serious measures and policies have been adopted even after the recent floods and devastating drought in Thar even though these hydro meteorological hazards are badly harming Pakistan's economy due to destruction of crops and infrastructure and the displacement of affected people, he said./He added the impact of droughts on agriculture is leading to malnutrition and under-nutrition, which is responsible for half of worldwide deaths of children under five. A climate change makes existing inequalities worse. A poor child and a rich child do not stand the chances when a flood and a drought hits, said Dr. Ashraf./He said implementing proven interventions to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, like black carbon and methane, for example achieving higher vehicle emissions and efficiency standards, would be expected to save approximately 2.4 million lives a year and reduce global warming by about 0.5 degree centigrade by 2050./Human activities that produce greenhouse gases are increasing number of industrial processes, combustion of fossil fuels, emissions from power plants and transport vehicles. This effect has been made worse by cutting down trees and forests that help us by absorbing carbon dioxide, he said./People from all walks of life have expressed their concern about global warming. Although Pakistan itself has a little role to play in global warming phenomenon, it is one of the countries that are facing its adverse effects, said Dr. Ashraf./Climate change carries no passport; emissions released anywhere contribute to the problem everywhere. It is threat to lives and livelihoods everywhere. Economic stability and the security of nations are under threat. Projected global temperature rise of approximately 3 degree Celsius by the end of century is expected./Talking of the remedies, Professor Ashraf said actions to mitigate climate change, such as shifting to cleaner energy sources, public transport, walking and biking, can benefit health. The sooner we act, the greater the benefits for all: increased stability and security; stronger, more sustainable economic growth; enhanced resilience to shocks, cleaner air and water and improved health, he said./He added that Government of Pakistan approved the National Climate Policy in 2012, but there has been no visible progress on that front so far. If we do not take preventive measures, this problem is bound to devastate Pakistan, he said./He suggested that everybody can participate in the campaign against adverse effects of climate change by reducing the non-renewable sources of energy and increasing use of renewable sources. This will decrease the emission of greenhouse gases, he said./He said you can identify ways to reduce your energy use and improve your health through walking, cycling, using public transport, better waste management and choosing products with smaller carbon impact./When buying new appliances, not only fridges, but also washing machines and dishwashers etc, choose those with high energy ratings. Many of the steps needed to prevent climate change have positive health benefits. For example, increase use of bicycles, walking and public transport instead of personal cars will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will also improve air quality and lead to better respiratory health and fewer premature deaths. The increase in physical activity from cycling and walking will lead to less obesity and fewer obesity-related illnesses, concluded Dr. Ashraf."
Not even an odd idea," In a cold winter night last week, Nauman Ahmad was driving back home from his office in Lahore. He lives in Muridke, a town not too far from Lahore with industries on both sides of the GT Road. Passing by a large chemical factory he suddenly encountered thick and heavy fog. He had to apply the brakes of his car due to zero visibility. The stretch of road with very poor visibility was about two kilometers long./He didn't know that what he thought of as a strange kind of fog wasn't fog. In fact, it was smog - a combination of smoke and fog. It is a consequence of visible air pollution in urban and suburban areas./Smog is caused primarily by a high volume of road traffic, rubbish incineration and uncontrolled industrial emissions. In the winter season, with delayed rainfall, the cold and continuously dry conditions concentrate all the pollutants in the lower levels of the atmosphere, causing the smog to spread all over./Carbon emissions in any form cause smog in presence of moisture and drop in temperature between 0 and 6 degrees Celsius says Dr Ghulam Rasool, Director General (DG) of Pakistan Meteorology Department. During the process, carbon particles work as condensation nuclei and accumulate moisture over them. They soon get the form of low cloud as they grow fast in ideal conditions./Smog is a health hazard. It can cause asthma, lung tissue damage, bronchial infections and heart problems, he explains./DG Met was of the view that uncontrolled flow of vehicles on roads and violation of environmental laws by the industry are the main reasons behind the increasing smog in cities./Air pollution is one of Pakistan's leading environmental concerns at the moment. Karachi, Peshawer, Quetta, Rawlpindi and Lahore have been enlisted among the most polluted cities in the world in different surveys. Main reasons behind this phenomenon are vehicles, brick kilns and industrial emissions combined with rapid urbanisation. The situation is particularly bad in the country's second largest city. Lahore. The city has been listed amongst the top 10 worst cities for smog, according to a 2014 research of a German institute./Delhi, however, has taken a step by following the China Model to control its own environment problem. For 15 days from January 1, 2016, private cars are only allowed on the city's roads every other day to reduce pollutant levels. Cars with odd-numbered license plates will be allowed on roads on odd-numbered dates and those with even-numbered plates on the other days./While talking about Lahore, Director General EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Punjab, Dr Javed Iqbal, told TNS that the chief minister has constituted a committee to combat the smog issue in Punjab, particularly Lahore. This high powered committee, chaired by the provincial environment minister, had met once in the last month and the second meeting will be held soon, says Iqbal. We are taking success stories from other countries into consideration as well. The China Model being adopted in India can be a good step towards the solution./Transport is considered as one of the main reasons for increasing smog and measures regarding this key sector are necessary for solution of the problem. PAKSTRAN is a project that is giving technical support to the federal, Punjab and Sindh governments for sustainable and environment-friendly transport solutions./Dr Saleem Janjua, National Manager PAKSTRAN, says the increasing number of private vehicles on roads is one of the main reasons behind the problem and mass transits seem the best solution. Sustainable transport doesn't mean only deploying one or two metro lines in the city but an integrated system where feeder routes are also taken into account. Says Janjua. Increased reliance on public transport and lesser use of private vehicles will definitely provide solution for not only the smog problem but a number of other issues as well. We are also preparing Environmental Quality Standards for transport sector which will be implemented by provincial EPAs./While admiring the measures taken by Delhi to overcome the smog problem, Federal Secretary Climate Change, Arif Ahmad Khan doesn't think the issue has reached such a critical juncture in any Pakistani city. We are working to control carbon emission which is among the main causes of smog. We have taken many steps in the transport sector in this regard./An SRO has been issued for providing Euro-II compliant fuel and to ensure that a meeting with the Petroleum Ministry is being held onJanuary 14, says Khan. Motor vehicle industry will be asked to provide Euro-II compliant engines and heat exhaust system in the next step./Until the measures taken by different departments to reduce emissions come to the implementation stage and people start using more fuel efficient transportation, people are advised to wear masks especially while travelling on the city roads as breathing in these pollutants i.e. dust, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, is injurious for health."
Cancer remains a major public health threat in Pakistan," In last 25 years, Pakistan has witnessed a significant increase in number of cases of various kinds of cancers and the threat claimed not less than 100,000 lives in 2015./The number of deaths from cancers particularly from lung cancer in males and breast cancer among females is also on the rise in the country. Apart from many other factors, lack of awareness among public about various aspects of the problem is a leading cause of damages due to cancers./Studies reveal that every year, nearly 300,000 new cases of various kinds of cancers are reported from across the country that adds up to the existing pool of millions of patients of cancer undergoing treatment in Pakistan./According to health experts, there are number of reasons for the rise in number of cases of cancers though the four main causes include longer life expectancy, more accurate diagnosis, alarming prevalence of Hepatitis B and C and the rise in tobacco use./Pakistan lacks severely facilities for treatment of cancer patients and various studies have shown that less than 40 per cent of all cancer patients in the country are able to receive health care while diagnostic and treatment facilities are not available to over 60 per cent patients./Pakistan lacks facilities for even palliative care, the treatment to relieve symptoms caused by cancer. Palliative care can help cancer patients live more comfortably and it is particularly required in the country as a high proportion of patients are living here with advanced stages of cancers with little chance of cure./It is need of the time to work for establishment of new palliative care facilities at least in all cities of the country and to create sufficient awareness among public on how to minimise the losses caused by cancers in Pakistan, said Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry while talking to 'The News' in connection with World Cancer Day which is being observed on February 4 around the globe./The theme of World Cancer Day this year is We can. I can. The campaign will help raise awareness to show public that everyone can do a lot in fight against cancer. We can stop stigmatising cancer patients, can encourage schools to educate children on how to prevent cancers and can demand government to increase funding for establishing cancer treatment facilities. The campaign stresses on individuals to stop smoking, learn about preventive measures and the ways and means to fight cancer./Professor Ashraf said that cancer affects everyone -- the young and old, the rich and poor, men, women and children and represents a tremendous burden on families and societies. Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. It can affect almost any part of the body. The growth often invades surrounding tissue and can metastasize to distant sites. Lung, stomach, liver, colon, prostate and breast cancer cause the most cancer deaths each year, he said./He said that four basic components of cancer control are prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment and palliative care. At least one-third to 40 per cent of all cancer cases are preventable, mainly by not using tobacco, using healthy diet, rich in fresh, green vegetables, and being physically active with 30 minutes daily walk, avoiding alcohol, narcotics, and most importantly obesity and preventing infections that may cause cancer. Prevention offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for the control of cancer, he believes./To a query, he said aging is the fundamental factor for the development of cancer. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age. Life style and environmental factors the things we eat drink, whether we smoke or exercise, how much sun we get and where we live have a powerful effect on cancer risk, he said./He added that one possible promoter in food is fat, especially saturated fat from animal products like red meat. Tobacco use, 'pan', 'chalia', alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, exposure to occupational carcinogens like asbestos, radiation like ultraviolet and ionizing radiation and excessive X-Rays, low fruit and vegetable intake, excessive consumption of red and preserved meat, estrogens tablets, high fat diet, genetic factors, having unsafe sex, infections from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, human papilloma viruses, Helicobacter pylori, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels are major risk factors of cancer, said Professor Ashraf./He said everyone should be aware of cancer's seven warning signals which include change in bowel or bladder habit, a sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, thickening or lump in breast or elsewhere, indigestion or difficulty in swallowing, obvious change in wart or mole and nagging cough or hoarseness. Tobacco is the single largest preventable cause of cancer in the world today. It causes 70 per cent of all lung cancer deaths, and about 30 per cent of all cancer deaths in developing countries./He said dietary modification is an important approach to cancer control. Because there are many promoters and inhibitors in food, scientists believe that the food we eat is very important in the growth, or the prevention of cancer, he said./He said that vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus vaccination (HBV) can prevent cervical and liver cancer respectively. Avoiding excessive exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation, use of sunscreen, wide-brimmed hats, large sunglasses, and protective clothing are effective preventive measures against skin cancer, he said./He added that if prevention fails, catch it early. Unfortunately in Pakistan, a large number of cancer patients presents at an advanced stage due to lack of awareness. About one-third of the cancer burden could be decreased if cases were detected and treated early. Some of the most common cancers -- including breast, colorectal, oral cancer and cervical cancer -- have high cure rates when detected early and treated. The aim is to detect cancer when it is localised, he said./He said that there is a dire need for a clear national strategy to be formulated on urgent basis in Pakistan to control the spread of cancer. Media should also play its part to create awareness about cancer among the general public. Pakistan still has a long way to go before it can truly claim a breakthrough in its fight against cancer, he said."
CSOs welcome Rapid Transit Service plan for Peshawar," Various Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have lauded the announcement made by KP government about the direly needed Rapid Bus Service project to become operational by 2017./A press release issued by the Sarhad Conservation Network, Frontier Heritage Trust and Institute of Architects of Pakistan, Peshawar chapter, said the service should address the growing traffic congestion problem owing to expanding population and influx of Internally Displaced Persons which had rendered hazardous the traffic flow on overcrowded roads./The communique said the existing infrastructure of road network could not cope with traffic congestion arising out of ever increasing numbers of cars coming on roads each year./Constructing costly flyovers are a poor remedy to cater to a large section of population. More sustainable Mass Transit System is an ideal alternative, for which the KP government deserves credit, opined the CSOs./The organisations said like in all modern cities, the residents of Peshawar would greatly benefit from the proposed Rapid Transit System./Monorail along the existing railway lines could also be explored as another option to decrease the traffic load from the main arteries. Besides other problems, increased traffic congestion also contributes to physical and mental health problems with air pollution directly resulting in cardiovascular and chest diseases and other ailments, said the communique./The organisations said the KP government would greatly benefit by including an advisory council of experts and civil society members for prior consultation about the design and route of the proposed corridors of the project. This would ensure its long term sustainability and lacunas, if any, could be timely pointed out by experts./The CSOs said the KP government would do well to have a public hearing about the route and design of the proposed project to avoid likelihood of controversy as in the Lahore Metro and Orange line./They noted that the Walled City of Peshawar has already been disfigured by the ill planned flyovers, amongst others, obstructing view across the Qila Balahisar heritage monument and the Provincial Assembly building./The CSOs said utmost sensitivity is needed before embarking on the much-needed project with the blessing of the general public."
Soot in the air," As if emissions of hazardous gases and particles from vehicles and industries were not enough to poison the air we breathe, our state plans to load it with more pollutants by installing coal-fired power stations that will burn 36 million tonnes of coal a year. Air quality data collected by provincial Environmental Protection Agencies suggests that the millions of people living in our cities are already inhaling air with higher levels of particulate matter and sulphur dioxide than the limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO)./To make matters worse, the Punjab government plans to set up at least six coal-fired power stations in the province. Work is underway on a 1,320-megawatt plant in Sahiwal, while others are in the planning stage. All the proposed coal-based plants in Pakistan will use imported coal from the abroad, which will be transported via train from the ports in Sindh to south and central Punjab, sprinkling coal dust in agricultural fields and small towns along the way./Carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide are the two major by-products of burning coal to generate power that pollute air. Another by-product is toxic mercury, which leeches into the surface and ground water. According to Japanese climate expert Kimiko Hirata, the international director of the Kiko Network, even the most efficient coal-fired power stations emit a lot of CO2./Coal-fired power stations generate a large quantity of toxic coal ash, which contains more than 20 different kinds of heavy metals and chemical compounds. Dumping the ash in disposal sites causes the contamination of surface water and deeper well water, making them unfit for drinking. Breathing in sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter released to the air from burning coal, increases a person's risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including heart attacks and lung cancer./Although feasibility studies of such projects contain pollution-mitigation measures, mostly just to get clearance from environment departments, they are often not implemented in the absence of a strict enforcement mechanism. Evidence from other countries such as China and India, which are more advanced than us and have stronger institutions, shows that all such proposed mitigation steps are grossly inadequate even when implemented./The Chinese experience can give us a clue of the environmental implications of coal power plants. Owing to these plants, China's capital Beijing suffers severe pollution in the winter, triggering the second-highest alert levels, in which highways are closed, construction is halted or suspended and residents are warned to stay indoors. According to Sophie Lu, a Beijing-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the burning of one million tonnes of coal in power stations produces 2.2 million tonnes of carbon emissions in China./A small coal plant producing up to 200 megawatts of electricity, especially if it's using outmoded sub-critical combustion technology, is considered the worst polluter of air. During the last two years, China has closed down 2,000 such plants, according to Bloomberg. Unfortunately, now Pakistan plans to import the discarded equipment of those plants from China./Four of the proposed power stations in Punjab are smaller ones, which will use sub-critical combustion technology, with capacities of 150 megawatts. The provincial government, with assistance from China, plans to set up these stations near large cities including Lahore, Sialkot, Multan and Faisalabad. The air in these cities is already effected by emissions from industries, vehicles and the burning of solid waste./In Pakistan, dust storms constitute a major source of non-point air pollution, especially in the areas situated close to deserts. The Punjab government is installing a 650-megawatt coal-fired power station at Mehmood Kot in Muzaffargarh, adjacent to desert area. What lies in store for this city can be guessed from a 2011 Greenpeace report: 'The True Cost of Coal: Coal Dust Storms'. The report cites research from scholars in China, which shows that frequent dust storms in the country carry high amounts of potential toxins found in coal ash - such as arsenic, lead, and sulphur compounds./It is unfortunate that the government has decided to install coal-fired plants at a time when air pollution is already reaching alarming proportions in our country. Owing to dirty air, heavy fog envelops swathes of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and upper Sindh from November to February. None of our cities has met the official air quality standards, according to the statistics of provincial Environment Protection Agencies collected until 2011 with the assistance of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). For the last five years, all the laboratories in the country that monitor air quality are either non-functional or partially working. It is not believable that a state that does not have the capacity to monitor ambient air quality can make coal-fired plants observe pollution-mitigating measures./Now that the availability of natural gas in the country has substantially increased after a liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with Qatar, it makes little sense to use coal for power generation. The infrastructure to carry natural gas already exists, while the transportation of coal will require massive investment in the ramshackle railway network. Natural gas is a much cleaner fuel, as it has half the carbon footprint of coal at the point of combustion. Since work on all the proposed coal plants, except for one in Sahiwal, is yet to be initiated, it is time the government reviews its policy and re-designs these projects for natural gas. Furthermore, Punjab has over 317 low hydropower sites, most of which have the capacity to generate up to 50 megawatts with a cumulative potential of over 600 megawatts on canals and barrages. This cheaper and cleaner energy potential is yet to be exploited./The growing deterioration in air quality demands that the government take bold policy decisions to switch the transport system and industries to cleaner fuels and smarter technologies. Measures are also needed to prevent the burning of solid waste and sugarcane fields. If the public sector goes ahead with the burning of coal on a mass scale, what moral justification will the state have to enforce environmental regulations on the private sector?"
Sepa shuts down stone-crushing unit in Korangi," A stone-crushing unit adding to environmental pollution in Korangi has been shut down by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), while more than 150 other facilities including industries, hospitals and municipal corporations have been issued notices for creating environmental pollution and violating related laws, Sepa officials told The News on Monday./A stone-crushing unit has been closed down through an Environmental Protection Order (EPO) near Korangi Crossing after residents complained that the unit was producing dust and a lot of noise. At the same time, our teams have issued more than 150 notices under environmental laws to industrial units, major hospitals, municipal corporations and construction companies. They include District Municipal Corporations (DMCs), cantonment boards and even the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) who were issued notices for burning garbage in open spaces, causing air pollution, instead of shifting solid waste to proper landfill sites outside the city, Sepa director-general Naeem Mughal told The News./Moreover, he claimed, the environmental watchdog had also closed down 25 industrial units in Hyderabad, Kotri and Nooriabad industrial areas after it was found that the facilities were releasing hazardous, poisonous effluent in freshwater canals, especially the Phuleli Canal, from where citizens were supplied drinking and potable water./In Karachi, we have formed teams of environmental experts of the department and they are monitoring industries, factories, hospitals, construction companies and even municipal corporations and cantonment boards, said DG Mughal. During the past three days more than 150 such units and organisations have been issued notices to explain their position and stop creating environmental pollution./Under the provincial environmental protection laws, the SEPA has the authority to close down the operations of any industry or activity that caused pollution. The agency also has the authority to take violators to environmental tribunals for punishment, including fines for breaking environmental laws./Some major hospitals in the city, he said, both public and private were not only involved in improper disposal of medical waste but also disposed off wastewater without required treatment./Hence, said DG Mughal, these hospitals had been issued notices to stop their hazardous practices or be ready to face action./At the moment, we are not disclosing the names of hospitals but there are certain health facilities, which are involved in spreading diseases by improper disposal of hospital waste, both solid medical waste and used water, he said. Similarly, there are several construction companies that have not had Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) done for their projects. The assessments are mandatory for certain projects that impacted the lives of citizens and altered the environment and the ecosystem of a large area./The SEPA DG said scores of complaints had been received that municipal authorities and cantonment boards were openly burning garbage inside their jurisdictions, instead of shifting it to landfill sites and this hazardous practice was resulting in air pollution and emission of toxic compounds in the air and subsequent health problems among residents./We have decided to go for strict compliance of environmental laws as we feel that violation of the environmental laws is the biggest crime being carried out against people and our future generations. Nobody would be allowed to play with the future of our children anymore and violators would have to pay for what they have done to our environment, DG Mughal promised."
Dust pollution on the rise," High levels of dust particulates generated due to ongoing infrastructure development projects is resulting in warming the overall atmosphere, reduces visibility and causes various types of breathing problems./The worst affected areas are Thokar Niaz Beig Chowk, Mansoora Chowk, Yateem Khana, Moree Samanabad, Chahburji, Jain Mandir, Mcleod Road, Lakshami Chowk, Railway Road, Allama Iqbal Road, Borth Wala Chowk, Railway Station, Salamatpura, Baghbanpura, UET, Ghass Mandi and many other localities on the GT Road./Following the increased levels of dust, majority of commuters, travelling on the city roads especially on motorcycles, bicycles and on foot, are facing difficulty in breathing, eye-burning and nausea. Besides this, the residents of adjoining localities where construction work is going on are also suffering from this air- pollution, which has become a major source of asthma, lungs infection and blood pressure. Doctors said increased air-pollution and dust may cause several diseases of brain and heart./The major air-pollutants present in the air dust particulates are oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and breathing dust (PM2.5). A source at the EPD air testing unit claimed that presently the levels of PM2.5 are higher than the National Air Quality Index (AQI)./According to the AQI, pollution level from 0 to 25 is considered clean, 26 to 50 moderate, 51 to 100 unhealthy, 101 to 200 severe and 201 to 300 hazardous. The EPD source said at present the air quality is ranging between 201 to 300 around the areas where metro train project is being undertaken while 101 to 200 in most of other parts of the city./The EPD sources claimed that the increase in air-pollution is a result of dust particulates produced at the ongoing infrastructure development projects i.e. Orange Line Metro Train and Signal Free Jail Road. Sources said pollution level along the route of Metro Train is severe while at jail road it is moderate to severe./It is observed that contractors of the ongoing projects sprinkle water on the roads and its sides along the project area twice a day, which is not sufficient as water becomes dry and dust particulates start spreading due to traffic./As per rules and regulations, contractors should have constituted a proper environmental wing to tackle environmental issues and hazards, said a senior EPD official adding a proper water sprinkling system should be introduced along the route of the project to avoid release of dust-particulars in the air./Environmentalists believe that dust-particulates named as Particulate Matter (PM) is a key to monitoring air-pollution in every city and in Lahore this level has reach dangerous level recently./They said PM 2.5 is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets adding particle pollution is made up of a number of components including acids (such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals and soil or dust particles. They further said size of particles is directly linked with their potential for causing health problems as once inhaled these particles can affect the heart and lungs./Citizens said the Traffic Engineering and Planning Agency (TEPA) and the City District Government Lahore (CDGL) should take different measures to control the rising air-pollution in the city. They said departments concerned should start paving of the shoulders and plantation along the roads to ensure control in dust emission. Khwaja Awais, a resident of Kaporthala House, said his younger son is asthmatic and recently he shifted him to his brother's house in Islamabad because his condition aggravated due to dust. All of the windows of my house are closed but still it is full of dust, he said./Heer Malik, a resident of Baghbanpura, said she and her family are badly hit by the increased dust levels because her parents are old and can't bear this much dust. I have no resources to go outside the city and have to bear this torture, she maintained./Jamil Butt, a resident of Nisbat Road, said dust have ruined the life in his area. Every night I and my friends used to sit out of our homes but since the start of this Metro train project we are unable to sit out, he said adding a large number of children in his area are suffering from cough and other chest related diseases./Naseemur Rehman, Director EPD while talking with The News, said contractors of all projects were already directed to sprinkle water on the roads. He said other than this the department had already launched a crackdown on air-polluting industrial units operating in various city's localities./Director General EPA, talking with The News, said department has already directed the DO Lahore to ensure proper water sprinkling on the roads. He said the EPA will take strict action against the violators and has a zero tolerance policy in this regard."
"Pakistan, India should create single agro-produce centres"," Under an initiative of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), a dialogue between Indian and Pakistani delegates has proposed that there is a need to create a single market for agricultural produce, especially for perishable goods, to balance shortages and surpluses in both the countries./It was proposed that joint research centres should be established on the India-Pakistan border, spanning over 100 acres on each side to begin with, where researchers and students of agriculture universities and experts can carry out joint research on seeds, crops, and combating crop-related diseases./The second round of Pakistan-India legislators and public officials dialogue on sharing of experiences on governance and democracy was held at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), Chandigarh, India. From Pakistan side Senator Lt Gen (r) Abdul Qayyum, Senator Nauman Wazir Khattak, Senator Saud Majeed, MNA Muhammad Afzal Khan, Asad Qaisar speaker KP Assembly, Mahtab Akbar Rashdi MPA Sindh Assembly, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid PTI MPA and Dr Najma Afzal Khan, MPA, Punjab Assembly, participated in the dialogue. While Indian side included Dr Rashpal Malhotra Executive Vice Chairman-CRRID, Prem Singh Chandumajra MP Lok Sabha, Dr Kuldip Kaur Director General-CRRID, Dr GS Kalkat Chairman Punjab Farmers Commission, Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, Professr of Economics at Centre for Economic Change Punjabi University Patiala, Ambassador (r) PS Sahai principal research adviser-CRRID, Dr RS Ghuman Nehru SAIL Chair Professor-CRRID and others./The dialogue brought together members of parliament and state/provincial legislatures from Pakistan and India, practitioners and subject-experts from the two countries who raised key issues and reform ideas about agriculture. Participants acknowledged and appreciated the cooperation, facilitation and co-hosting of the dialogue in Chandigarh by the CRRID alongside PILDAT. Delegates also thanked Mani Shankar Aiyar, for facilitating this cooperation between CRRID and Pildat./The dialogue participants on both sides agreed that in agriculture, as in other areas, there is an enormous potential to learn from good practices and policies in both countries for each other. They demanded that barriers to communication and travel must be brought down in this regard. Participants from Pakistan noted with interest some of the key initiatives implemented in the Indian Punjab for promotion of improved agricultural practices. These included low-interest agricultural loans set at 8% interest with subvention of 4%, provision of duty free tractors to farmers and loans for tube-wells, water conservation by imposing restriction on plantation of rice before June 10 each year and time-limits of 15-days for government functionaries to take decisions on agricultural loans, which resulted in thousands of loans for tube-wells./Both sides acknowledged that agriculture remained a major area of potential cooperation for both India and Pakistan. Most challenges faced by the agricultural sectors in both the countries are similar. These included groundwater depletion, deteriorating quality of groundwater and soil degradation and air pollution due to excessive use of insecticides and pesticides, stagnation in cropping yields and last, but not the least, adverse impacts of climate change./It was also recognised that apart from these challenges, there is a critical need to improve the marketing of farming products. Participants stressed that governments may consider cooperating to address these challenges to avoid the threat of food security, high number of suicides of farmers with low-holdings and an adverse impact on the economy. Apart from these shared challenges, there are also challenges peculiar to each country. For Pakistan, these include low per acre yield, inefficient use of irrigation water, infrastructure deficiencies, deficient agricultural research, high input costs, absentee farmers, lack of robust and consistent price supporting mechanisms and low crop intensity./Some of the challenges peculiar to the Indian agricultural sector include lack of focus on horticulture, floriculture and livestock and subsidiary occupations like bee keeping and sericulture. It was recognized that both the countries have various areas for cooperation in the field of agriculture. These included sharing of research and development such as in seed quality, optimum irrigation practices, facing climate change, efficient agro-processing, recharging of groundwater, development of drought resistant crops, exploration of the horticulture, floriculture, livestock, fisheries, and organic farming sectors, use of technology and progressive agricultural practices./Participants from India, highlighting their experiences, shared that free electricity for farmers, or even electricity at flat rates, is, in the long run, harmful to the agriculture sector. Pakistan may consider keeping this in view in case it wishes to subsidise the electricity for the farmers, which the Indian scientists believe has been responsible for fast lowering water table in Indian Punjab."
Till the dust settles," The volume of dust in the air has hit an all-time high at different points in the city, particularly at places where the construction work, related to the Orange Line Metro Train project, is underway./Layers of dust seem to fill the air everywhere including roads, footpaths, shops, residential areas that happen to fall close to a construction site. The locals are totally helpless. They have no option but to inhale the polluted air, as they go about their everyday chores./This has affected the state of business also. As a shopkeeper at Singh Pura Morr on GT Road says, The buyers won't stop to indulge window shopping, when the air outside is so dusty./At home, our women get tired of cleaning the house, he adds. There's no end to dust./The owner of an optical shop tells TNS, The Orange Line project shall take another two years to complete. I don't see my business return to normal before that time./The polluted air is, above all, a health hazard, especially for patients of asthma. People can easily catch lungs and respiratory problems, says Ahmed Hassan, a resident of Naulakha Church where the construction work has been going on for the past some time now./I don't think it should be a problem for the government to get rid of dust. A single water tank would suffice for a five-kilometre stretch of land. There is a 50km long track which means 100 water tanks are required for at least twice a day to spray water so that the dust can settle./I know it [the OMT] is a public welfare project, and it should have long-term benefits for the Lahorites. But the arrangements should have been made in advance to prepare people to deal with the polluted air, Hassan continues./My house is not too far away from my office. It's a 15-minute walk. But this short journey has become troublesome for me lately. I have to change my shirt every time I reach the workplace; it becomes so dirty, especially inside the collar and around the cuffs. As for my shoes, I can't even begin to tell you what becomes of them!/Cases of flu and other allergies are on the rise, chiefly among the people living in the areas where the construction work is going on./Ali, who is based in Lakshmi Chowk, says he is not a smoker, but I cough like the smokers would./The problem has aggravated over time, as there is no respite from dust. My throat is constantly itchy and I have developed sinus issues too. The doctors have advised me to use a mask when I step out on the road./When quizzed, a medical practitioner says, The best way [to deal with the situation is that] to keep your home windows shut. Those out on the road must use a mask or keep a handkerchief./Tauqir Ahmed, Director, Monitoring Lab and Implementation (ML and I), in the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), Punjab says the Orange Line is not the only cause of air pollution./The problem is temporary. Dust particles remain in the air for a very short period of time, they are eventually diluted. Higher levels of air pollutants from vehicular emissions and industrialisation are the actual cause of ever-worsening air pollution./Pakistan is the most urbanised country in South Asia, and it is experiencing rapid motorisation and increasing use of energy, Ahmed adds. From 2007 to 2011, the reported levels of particulate matter (PM) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were many times higher than the air quality guidelines given by the World Health Organisation (WHO)./According to him, The number of vehicles in the province has jumped from approximately 3 million to 11.34 million in the last 10 years. Industrial facilities, particularly those consuming fossil fuels, emit significant amounts of pollutants in the air. Brick kilns, steel re-rolling, and plastic moulding contribute to urban air pollution through their use of waste fuels that includes old tires, paper, wood, and textile waste. Air quality is further deteriorated by the widespread use of small diesel electric generators in commercial and residential areas in response to the electricity outages./In order to help matters, Tauqir Ahmed has a few recommendations: We must reduce levels of sulphur in diesel and fuel oil, retrofit in-use diesel vehicles with PM emission-control technology, convert diesel-fuelled minibuses and vans to CNG, control PM emissions from motorcycles, convert three-wheelers (rickshaws) to CNG, and curtail burning of solid waste in the city./Also, control PM emissions from ferrous metal sources (steel re-rolling mills) and other industrial sources, improve street cleaning, and control construction related dust./As regards the monitoring of air quality, he says, Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is providing financial and technical assistance to the Punjab Environmental Protection Agency in designing and installing the relevant monitoring system through a network of measurement stations that includes fixed and mobile air monitoring stations, a data centre and a central laboratory./The EPA collects data from its two stations in Town Hall and Township./Talking to TNS, an inspector at Town Hall's ambient air quality monitoring station says, Dust pollution is increasing by the day. When you sprinkle too much water, the dust particles turn to mud that sticks to car tyres. And when it dries, it flies about in the air, polluting the environment. So, there should be a moderate sprinkling of water along the sides that are dug./Secondly, construction work always slows down the traffic. The longer the vehicles stay on the roads, the higher smoke they emit, which is mixed in dust in the air./The inspector who does not want to be named says that dust gathers where there are no greenbelts or a roadside is unpaved. The Park and Horticulture Authority (PHA) created many greenbelts along the city roads but in the areas where the train project is underway, these have been simply overlooked."
Poverty triggers poor urban health in Pakistan," It is widely recognised that about 3.5 billon human are urban settlers. One third these 3.5 billons are categorised as urban poor dwellers. This phenomenon of urban poverty is widely observed in developing and under developed nations especially, in Asia and Africa where poverty is thought to be one of the major reasons behind the catastrophic increase in these slum areas. Each year around 11 million refugees as well as 25 million persons migrate internally and externally, according to UNHCR, which is one of the most prominent factors playing its part in increasing the number of urban settlers and poverty chart. Pakistan is also facing this momentous challenge of rural-urban shifts an internal migration./Various prediction models and reports indicate clearly that till 2050 the number of urban settlers will reach to almost 6.2 billion. Poverty in urban regions is a prominent shareholder of global poverty. It is mostly thought that urban residents are far better than rural ones in terms of food, education, health care as well as various other opportunities leading towards a better successful life. For some people it may be true but keeping in mind the vast increase in number of residents along with increasing poverty level this so called Urban benefit is just a myth./Colossal disease burden among urban poor is an imminent challenge for governments all over the world. Surprisingly, top indicator of human well being the 'mental health' is observed negatively associated with urban poverty by epidemiologists in developing countries. Unfortunately, in Pakistan limited research on urban health issues has attributed for scanty data regarding big cities. Consequently, unaccounted cases of poverty-health are raising but growing population effects on poverty in urban areas, have certainly noticed. The most devastating effects, mostly ignored by our governments include poor living standards, food scarcity, unhygienic neighbourhood and bad health conditions due to increase in the poverty in urban areas. Many health problems and fatal diseases are the hallmark of poverty dominant spots in big cities primarily due to unsafe housing and poor sanitation./In this regard, it has been observed that tuberculosis is the most commonly emerging disease in poor nations. Although it is curable and the treatment is cost effective but still high prevalence of tuberculosis is accounted for over population, poor diet and lower socio-economic status. An important intervention to prevent tuberculosis is to provide better living conditions and ultimately by decreasing poverty./Undoubtedly, urban areas offer better employment opportunities owing to that rural population tend to migrate towards urban areas. Therefore rural to urban migration increases poverty and causes more air pollution affecting health of inhabitants. According to WHO, the overcrowded areas of developing countries have more chances of disease prevalence such as malaria, polio, diphtheria and tetanus. In urban environment, air pollution and poverty are affecting the cognitive functions both directly by the exposure of air pollutants to brain, immune dysregulation, neuroinflamation, oxidative stress and indirectly through overcrowding and loud noise. It is quite unfortunate that large cities in Pakistan have rarely been screened for poor areas of where public health risks are high and expected prevalence of asthma, malaria, dengue and other water-borne or air-borne disease is high. Many developed countries still face the problem of poverty. Few studies conducted by EcoHealth Research Group, working in the Department of Environmental Sciences, PMAS Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi has explicitly identified poor urban neighbourhoods in Rawalpindi city with high prevalence of water-borne diseases. Apart from that findings further reveal considerable level of heterogeneity of disease burden in relation to urban disparities among surveyed population. Some immediate intervention measures are required to improve urban health. The reason poverty became such an important topic in recent years is that more and more people now realise how important it is for peace, stability and healthy society./Ongoing instability of Pakistan is thought to be directly linked with prevailing poverty in both the rural and urban areas. Poverty, fast growing population, and economic instability are key determinants of poor urban health. Newspapers and media have repeatedly presented pictures of deteriorating livelihood conditions in different cities. However, in-depth research has not yet being conducted on urbanisation and health effects especially in Pothowar region. Health-related awareness programmes and research should be conducted to address cultural, economic and social dynamics of urban health./This year, International Society for Urban Health has organised its annual conference in San Francisco, USA from April 1 to 4 where researchers from EcoHealth group Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi are presenting their findings to share knowledge and gain from the experiences of leading urban health researchers. It is assumed that urban health scientists from Pakistan will gain enormous benefits from the conference platform and enable them to evolve appropriate intervention strategies to address the urbanisation and health challenges./Eco Health Research Group, Department of Environmental Sciences, PMAS Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi"
Garbage trucks during rush hours a nuisance for road users," Garbage trucks carrying solid waste plying on the roads of twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad during rush hours emit extremely unpleasant odour has become a cause of concern for the public particularly motorists./These garbage trucks not only pollute environment but also make further dirty to the already dusty roads by leaving trail of waste material behind them due to overload./It is a common sight that in a bid to lessen their workload sanitary workers mostly put the waste dumped in trolley on fire emitting hazardous smoke putting the health of area residents at risk./It has also been witnessed that garbage bins are mostly placed on main roads and streets of congested Mohallahs and the trucks being loaded in the middle of day cause traffic jams and congestion for the shopkeepers shoppers and passersby./Muhmmad Usman Zia, a resident of Shamsabad locality of Rawalpindi said garbage trucks roaming on the city roads early in the morning was an eye soaring sight for the people who wanted to travel to their workplaces with a fresh mind./It particularly becomes difficult for motorcyclists driving behind these odour emitting trucks which also dropped trail of garbage on the road he said./He said commuters in public transport and motorists felt difficulty in breathing because of obnoxious smell due to a loaded garbage truck moving at a snail s pace in heavy traffic or stationed at traffic signals./Tahir Dar, a resident of Sector I-12 said landfill site in the vicinity of the sector was a health hazard not only for the residents of capital area but also for the people residing across the IJ Principal Road in Rawalpindi due to stinking smell and pollution./He said his home was situated close to the site and his children occasionally suffered from diseases like asthma allergy etc./Ahmad Faiz, who resides in Media Town and travels to his office in Blue Area through Islamabad Expressway said the Capital Development Authority boasted of Capital terming it the beautiful but heaps of garbage all along the city's main artery at short distances spoke volume about its apathy./He said garbage loaded trucks were often seen running on the Islamabad Expressway which sometimes disposed of the load around Kak Bridge or in the Korang River instead of shifting the same to the landfill site.  A student, Nisam Ejaz, alleged that the civic authorities of the twin cities did not bother about the people who had to suffer because of the garbage trucks plying on the roads in daylight./Sometimes the smell emitting from the garbage trucks causes the commuters to vomit, she added./Doctor Saif, a pulmonologist at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) told this agency that air pollution was the main cause of respiratory diseases like asthma allergy and others./An official of Environmental Wing of the CDA on condition of anonymity told this agency that according to standard operating procedures (SOPS) the garbage was to be collected and disposed of during night time but the same were not being followed.  He lamented that this was an administrative lacunae that the garbage was collected during the day./The authority had received a number of complains and the department concerned was devising a mechanism to collect the garbage at night, he added."
"Pindi, Peshawar among world five top polluted cities: Report"," Rawalpindi and Peshawar have been named among the list of five most polluted cities in the world according to the latest air quality report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) released this month./Peshawar is surveyed second worst city for the third consecutive year with an annual average particulate matter (PM) 2.5 measurement of 540 (2016) 540 (2014) and 219 (2011) respectively./According to the WHO's 2016 report Onitsha, Nigeria, has the dirtiest air with an annual average PM2.5 measurement of 594 followed by Peshawar,Pakistan (540); Zabol, Iran (527); Rawalpindi, Pakistan (448); Kaduna, Nigeria (423); Aba, Nigeria (373); Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (368); Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia (359); Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan (334), and Gwalior, India (329)./WHO's database now covers 3,000 cities in 103 countries with more cities measuring air pollution levels and recognising the associated health impacts.The report says that more than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) limits. While all regions of the world are affected, populations in low income cities are the most impacted./The report says that as urban air quality declines, the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma, increases for the people who live in them./WHO says more than seven million premature deaths occur every year due to air pollution, three million of them due to outdoor air quality./Common causes of air pollution include too many cars, especially diesel fuelled vehicles, heating and cooling of big buildings, waste management agriculture and the use of coal or diesel generators for power."
Construction and care," Lahore's metro-train project is underway, raising several controversies regarding the displacement of people and threat to heritage. More than a dozen people have died in accidents owing to inadequate safety measures around the construction area. Also, complaints of increased air pollution and traffic congestion caused by the project's construction activities abound./The metro-train project has been divided into two parts which are being executed by two different bodies - one part relating to the civil works is being executed by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) by taking loans from the Bank of Punjab while the other which is working on the superstructure including rail line, rolling stocks etc will be undertaken by a Chinese contractor./Nespak prepared the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), Punjab approved it. The EIA estimates that after completion the metro train, to be run on electricity, will have positive impacts on the physical environment of the city, especially along its route as it will reduce the number of vehicles running on fossil fuels./However, the project's construction phase entails environmental pollution in the construction sites and the adjoining areas. During the last one year, it has caused enormous dust pollution due to digging, excavation and demolition of existing buildings and construction of pillars on the route of the rail line./A visit to the construction site along G T Road and Multan Road shows entire localities drowned in dust because removal of dirt and sprinkling of water had not been carried out at most places./The construction company has also set up two concrete mixing plants within the city close in densely populated areas. These plants should have been set up in the suburbs and the concrete-mix should be carried in trucks meant for this purpose, but this not has been done so as to save money./The environmental impact assessment report stipulates that pollution mitigation measures will be taken during the construction phase but in reality they are not being fully implemented. The money allocated for mitigation measures in the project's budget seem to exist only on paper./The people living in the vicinity of the construction site and commuting on this route are paying a heavy price, dealing with respiratory diseases and immense inconvenience. The project's civil works are scheduled to be completed by the middle of next year. Until then, for the people of the area the construction of the metro rail will remain a nightmare./A detailed Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been provided in the EIA, but this pollution mitigation plan is not being fully implemented. This is the weakest area of the project. Unfortunately, EPA Punjab - which is legally responsible for ensuring implementation of the environmental management plan - lacks the capacity to monitor and effectively enforce it./The EPA needs to institute a high-level committee for regular monitoring of the project during the project's construction phase so that health and safety hazards to the people are minimised./The project's environmental approval has obligated the project proponent to earmark one percent or more than Rs1.7 billion for tree plantation by the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), Lahore. In the first place, this is a huge amount for plantation in a stretch of 27 kilometres, which raises doubts of misuse of funds as has been a common practice in such mega projects./The EPA's advisory committee has asked the PHA to submit a plan for utilisation of these funds and make the plan public for the sake of transparency. Hopefully the LDA and the contractor will keep their promise on tree plantation unlike the broken promises on mitigating pollution during the construction phase."
Pollution in Punjab," Punjab's Environment Protection Department (EPD) has failed to counter vehicular pollution in the province, where it is became a serious threat to health. The sad news is that the metropolis of Lahore has been declared the second most polluted city in the world. Vehicles contribute to the city's air pollution through poisonous gases. These are causing airborne diseases, which are killing thousands of people in Punjab./Unfit vehicles are creating more problems for the people to survive. And yet the EDP has failed to launch any kind of campaign for controlling vehicular pollution. I would like to request the Punjab government to allow the police to strictly enforce steps that would keep a check on vehicular pollution in the province."
Sepa seals three restaurants in Clifton on residents' complaints," The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) sealed three eateries in Clifton on Monday following residents' complaint that they were causing air pollution./""Today with the help of police, we sealed three restaurants which were refusing to follow an environmental protection order issued by Sepa,"" Aashiq Langah, the environmental watchdog's director in Karachi, told The News./He said the residents of the apartment buildings in Clifton had complained to Sepa that the barbecue restaurants on the ground floor were polluting the air with smoke emitting from burning coals, creating health problems for them./Drawing the attention of the environmental watchdog officials towards court rulings, which had declared clean and clear air as one of the basic human rights, the residents of the apartments demanded that Sepa should take steps against the restaurants./Taking action on the complaints of the residents, Sepa officials first sent summoned the managements of the eateries to appear before them for a personal hearing and present their point of view, but they did not pay any heed to the notices./Sepa then issued an environmental protection order to the eateries for their immediate closure but they ignored that too, compelling the environmental watchdog to use force and shut down restaurants with the help of police./The three restaurants sealed by Sepa are Dua, Salateen and Khyber./""We have decided to send their cases to the environmental protection tribunal for a hearing under the Sindh Environmental Protection Act,"" Langah said./To a query, he said closing down running businesses on complaints was not an easy and they faced stiff resistance from the employees and managements of these eateries and police assistance was needed to carry out the task./Responding to another query, he said action would also be taken against factories and industries causing air and water pollution./The official urged citizens to lodge complaints with Sepa so that action could be initiated taken against those causing pollution./Langah said the main source of sea pollution was the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board which was dumping millions of gallons of polluted, untreated industrial and domestic waste into the sea./""We are unable to take action against the KWSB because of the sensitivity of the issue even though it is involved in gross violations of environmental laws."""
Drive to check restaurants' hygiene standards starts next week," One day after the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) sealed three eateries in Clifton area following residents' complaint that they were causing air pollution, the city administration has announced plans to initiate a drive from next week to inspect cleanliness and hygiene standards at all restaurants in the metropolis./The decision was taken in a meeting presided by Karachi Commissioner Ejaz Ahmed Khan on Tuesday./The commissioner said that it was an obligation of the owners of the restaurants to maintain cleanliness while preparing meals at the food outlets./He said the restaurant owners should design the kitchens in such a way that the customers could view the process of preparation of the meals./Khan said the restaurant owners would be given three months to redesign their kitchens; otherwise he warned them of taking strict action./The cooks, the waiters and other staff should be provided uniforms and gloves, he added./The commissioner warned that in case of any violations, heavy fines would be imposed on the law violators./The staff working in restaurants would have to obtain medical fitness certificate from the health department of the Karachi Municipal Corporation, he added./Earlier on Monday, Sepa had sealed three eateries in Clifton following residents' complaint that they were causing air pollution.

Climate change and health," According to a media report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that climate change is causing tens of thousands of deaths every year. These deaths arise from more frequent epidemics of diseases like cholera, the vastly expanded geographical distribution of diseases like dengue, and from extreme weather events, like heatwaves and floods. At the same time, each year nearly seven million people die from diseases caused by air pollution. Experts predict that, by 2030, climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths each year from malaria, diarrheal disease, heat stress and under nutrition alone./According to WHO, the heaviest burden will fall on children, women, older people and the poor, further widening existing health in-equalities between and within populations. COP21 held in proposed key actions for the implementation of the Paris agreement to reduce health risks linked to climate change. The conference highlighted the benefits of switching over to cleaner energy sources. These will help reduce levels of climate and air pollutants, as well as providing desperately needed power for health facilities in low-income countries. The health sector should themselves make a greater effort to promote low-carbon healthcare facilities and technologies; these can simultaneously improve service delivery and reduce costs as well as climate and environmental impacts. In view of the above, there is a dire need to move to more sustainable food production and healthier diets to improve the environment and reduce non-communicable diseases. There is a need to promote diets rich in fruits and vegetables. Also, a new approach is needed to link health economies assessment and climate change."
"According to Jaffar, ""heat enables us to cut stones easily with manual tools."""," For hundreds of stonemasons in Sindh, cutting stones out of hills for making roads and buildings is the only source of income. Several scenic hills, named after cities like Rohri, Kotdigi, Makli, Lakki (Jamshoro), and Karachi have either been wiped out completely or are defragmenting slowly due to the development pattern./However, the dismantling of the hills is affecting the environment negatively. Many of these hills with their shrubs and grass were grazing grounds for animals, especially during monsoon when they turned green, but now, the hills are disappearing and so are the seasonal meadows. Jaffar and his fellow stonemasons come from the village Ibrahim Jakhro. It is on the National Highway in Thatta District. Many of their families own small pieces of land in the Indus River catchment area. However, most of them follow the profession of stonemasonry, inherited from their ancestors. They claim their association with the profession has been for generations./Jaffar tells he was 12 when his father took him to a nearby quarry for the first time. ""I helped him with stone cutting, and since then have been doing the same job,"" he said./""It is only for a few days during the sowing season that I stay back on our agriculture land. The rest of the time I stay up in the hills, chipping away at the stones.""/They use traditional tools to cut stones that are as heavy as 10 kilograms or 50kg each. A truck collects the stones every week, usually on Fridays. The workers are paid Rs3,000 per group of three people. Though the wages are low, for these poverty stricken stonemasons, even then it is a blessing, they say. ""It is better than nothing and helps us cater to our family's needs,"" one of them said./Early each morning, the workers leave their makeshift abodes and head to the hills, where they work until after sunset. Jaffar said that the stones in the nearby hills were all quarried and now they had to travel long distances to find more stone to cut. ""It is a touch job as the stones are very heavy, and we only use manual tools, but it is the only way for us to earn a living,"" he said./Famous ecology/Sindh has a number of famous hills, and some of them are rich in minerals and known as ecologically sensitive areas. Gorakh hill is among the highest peaks in the Khirthar Mountains, and the Gorakh Hill Station, in Dadu district, is known for its pleasant weather even during summers. This place attracts a large number of tourists each season. Though the infrastructure is poor, including the road leading to the station and accommodation facilities, the site still attracts hundreds of local tourists the year round. Bado hills, also part of the Khirthar Range in Jamshoro district, also remain pleasant throughout the year./Mineral-rich Karoonjhar Hills in Nagarparkkar, Lakki hills in Jamshoro district, Manghopir hills in Karachi, Rohri and Kotdigi hills in upper Sindh are some other popular hilly areas./These highest hills of the range are not under any immediate threat, but the fertile small cliffs have been wiped out./Jaffar and his team work with manual tools, however there are contractors who are employing heavy machinery to quarry the stones at a much faster rate./An official from the mines and mineral department, on condition of anonymity, said, ""Department officials are only asked to deal with minerals. We have no concern with illegal erosion and environmental degradation.""/They claim ignorance as to the environmental degradation and claim no knowledge of the green slopes in many areas, which disappeared due to excessive commercial exploitation by certain contractors.  /Human toll/It is a fact that human presence in the rocky hills can be dated far back into the history. The mountain communities have always faced hardships due to the absence of even basic facilities. But with excessive exploitation of the hills, the locals residing on and around the hills have been forced to either flee, or to continue to live in deplorable conditions. There is no time table for mining, exploding and using heavy machinery near villages, which multiplies the hardships for them./Sami Memon, president Awami Press Club Malir, said community people from the hilly areas near the main Super Highway visited them frequently for help. He realised the fact that communities residing there for generations were being forced to migrate to safer places./The residents of a dozen villages around Karachi have sent joint letters to the Karachi Commissioner and other higher authorities, requesting them to stop the destruction of hills which spreads dust clouds that cause many diseases, especially among children./The residents of these suburban villages are threatened by various respiratory diseases, including tuberculosis and asthma. However, they have no access to any public health facility in their areas./Villagers also complain in their letter that the blasts on the mountains are often too close to their homes, and therefore the mud often slides onto their houses. Many katchi houses have even collapsed due to the heavy machine activity and frequent blasts./Nature disturbed/The elder residents still remember the old days, when they used to live amidst picturesque mountains, small ponds, rising peaks, and natural streams that formed during the monsoon rains./The streams kept the grass in the meadows alive, providing plenty of fodder and drinking water to their livestock. Many wild animals, birds, reptiles, insects, flora and fauna, also found refuge in the hilly areas, which are now under severe threat due to commercial quarrying./Many species have migrated to other areas due to the noise and air pollution caused by stone cutting and crushing activities. The water sources are also being contaminated due to these activities./Moreover, the subsoil water level has also gone down considerably resulting in dry wells./Mountainous communities in Sindh were already marginalised in terms of development, and now the disappearing natural resources have also compounded their problems. Their food and water security is under extreme stress, and they are also victims of environmental degradation./Instead of paying lip service, the government needs to initiate plans for poverty alleviation that link to environmental degradation. Their livelihoods need to be safeguarded. This might be the only way out for these poverty-stricken people, especially those dwelling in the hilly areas."
Coal and climate," When the whole world is moving towards renewable energy and working towards sustainable development goals, we are investing in coal power plants. Coal plants are the top source of carbon dioxide emissions and the primary cause of global warming. Burning coal is also a leading cause of smog and toxic air pollution./Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges that we are facing today. As a developing country, we are at a serious risk as a result of rising temperatures, including more heat waves and drought, severe floods and increase in the range of bugs and mosquitoes, which can spread disease such as Dengue and Congo virus. The displacement of people due to these intense natural calamities is hitting us in the form of climate refugees. Children and older people are the most vulnerable citizens and people living in poverty are most at risk from the health impacts of climate change./187 countries including Pakistan committed to reduce emissions and keep temperatures at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in the Paris Climate Change Conference COP21 last year. Pakistan's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) lacked substance and commitment goals, prior to the Paris Agreement. Neither did we give any specific target set to be achieved during the COP21. On the contrary, our PM is inaugurating coal power plants when we can install solar power plants and generate solar energy which can meet the demands of the whole country."
Victims of limestone,"y Adnan Adil/_: Exploitation of limestone in the Salt Range for the manufacturing of cement has become a nightmare for the local population. The fast depletion and pollution of underground water and intense dust and air pollution owing to cement factories have gone unregulated for more than one decade now./Four cement factories installed in the limestone-rich Chakwal district have been pumping out groundwater since the first plant was set up in this area in 2004. This illegal activity has rendered drinking water scarce for the old inhabitants of the region. The situation is worse in particular in the district's 30-km long, six-km wide Kahun Valley, where three factories are located as the underground water level has sunk by at least 300 feet during this period./To make matters worse for the locals, three more cement plants are in the pipeline in the same valley awaiting approval from the Punjab government. The Salt Range already houses eight out of the 12 cement factories in the Punjab. These plants have considerably enhanced their installed capacities from those that were originally approved, without obtaining fresh environmental approval./All the cement manufacturing units installed in the Chakwal district were granted environmental approval on the condition that they would bring water from nearby River Jhelum. The provincial environment department recently found out that these factories had instead been pumping out underground water through tubewells. An inspection by the environment department revealed that each factory had installed six to 12 tubewells./According to the investigations by the Punjab environment department, water quality in the area has also deteriorated due to disposal of untreated wastewater from the cement factories as the polluted water from the plants seeps into the ground. A recent analysis of drinking water by the department revealed that values of Totally Dissolved Solids (TDS) and chloride exceeded the World Health Organisation's guidelines in drinking water samples near one of the cement factories./Some surveys conducted by the environment department show that dust and smoke from cement plants are a major environmental concern in the Kahun Valley as they exceed national environmental quantity standards. As per official regulation, cement factories are required to install electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) for dust control since these plants emit very fine particles that can go deep inside human lungs. An ESP absorbs these fine particles before the dust goes out of chimneys. It is alleged that the factories have installed the equipment but do not run them in order to save on their electricity bills./Due to water scarcity and increased air pollution, the locals of the area are protesting against the installation of more cement factories in the valleys, which were once known for their orchards, wildlife and pleasant weather in summer days but now have become hazardous place to live. A total of 15 applications for the installation of cement plants in different areas of Punjab are lying with the provincial mines and minerals department. One of them has already received a mining lease in the Kahun valley from the mines department./A major reason behind the mushroom growth of cement plants is that businessmen get mining leases for limestone at throw-away rates, even lower than that of earth soil. The proximity of the motorway to the Salt Range has also made the Kallar Kahar and Kahun regions lucrative sites for setting up cement plants. Further, once cement plants are installed plant owners, in collusion with government officials, start acquiring vast tracts of the adjacent agricultural lands at the official rate - exploiting the Land Acquisition Act./The lease for limestone mines, like other minerals, is awarded to influential people with right connections. There is a need to introduce a bidding culture for award of leases for small- and large-scale mining operations so that this precious resource serves our requirements on a sustainable basis./It is the responsibility of the provincial government to create and notify negative areas where further industrial expansion is prohibited and this list should be revised periodically. In order to protect the environment and the interests of the local communities, not more than one cement factory ought to be allowed in a radius of 30 kilometres./Further, there is no legal instrument available to regulate the cement sector. The provincial mines and minerals department is authorised to grant leases for raw material; and afterwards it collects royalty on it. The existing mining legal framework is quite lax and has many loopholes that allow industrial units to get away scot-free with violating environment-related conditions./The government needs to introduce punitive clauses in the mining laws to ensure mining operations are efficient and comply with environmental standards. An appropriate regulatory regime needs to be put in place to prevent the tapping of underground water by cement plants and to control their emissions. The mere installation of ECPs at the plants is not enough. There must be a reliable mechanism to check that that they are regularly run to mitigate air pollution./The provincial environment department grants environment approval of the impact assessment report at the time of installation of a cement plant but it lacks the institutional capacity to monitor the compliance of pollution-litigation clauses and other conditions under which permission is granted. Institutional arrangements for the strict monitoring of the cement sector and other mining-related industrial sectors need to be improved./Urgent administrative interventions are needed in the districts of Chakwal, Jhelum, Khushab and Mianwali to address the depleting underground water levels and contamination of aquifers. In the meanwhile, in order to identify alternate solutions for safe water supply to the affected local people, the environment and mining departments must conduct a detailed survey of underground water levels in the Salt Range and prepare a hydrological model."
Rising number of vehicles - aggravating traffic problems in Gujranwala," With the growth of population and increasing number of vehicles, the people have been facing severe traffic problems throughout the city./Every one can see that a large number of two-stroke rickshaws and motorcycle-rickshaws are plying on all city roads, especially on GT Road from Pindi Bypass to Sialkot Bypass, Noshera Road, Jinnah Road and Circular Road. According to Section 15 of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, motor vehicles, which produce air pollutants and noise beyond the limits of national environmental quality standard, are not allowed to run on roads, but the Environment Protection Department has allegedly failed to counter vehicular pollution in the city, where it has become a threat to the people's health. The vehicles especially rickshaws are contributing air pollution through poisonous gases. The dilapidated roads and long queues of vehicles have become a common scene across the city, making the people's life miserable. Another cause of traffic jams is non-observance of the rules and lack of traffic sense on the part of the citizens, who often violate one-way signs and do not follow lane-management./The citizens have demanded the Transport Department and the Environment Protection Department work together to control the rising air and noise pollution in the city. They suggest that two-stroke rickshaws must be replaced with four-stroke rickshaws. The people say that the traffic police should also start a campaign against smoke-emitting vehicles."
"Rallies, vehicular pollution behind smog"," Protest demonstrations and rallies carried out in the provincial capital during the last three to four days have caused hours long traffic jams, which resulted in extraordinary increase in vehicular pollution and produced acid rain phenomenon in the provincial capital on Wednesday./An investigation done by Environment Protection Department (EPD), Punjab into the smog and acid rain incidents occurred in Lahore on Wednesday revealed that hours long traffic jams, use of substandard fuel by industrial units and burning of rice husk in the surrounding areas of Lahore were the main reasons behind this unnatural phenomenon./Naseem-ur-Rehman, director and spokesman for EPD, said during the last three to four days the provincial capital had witnessed very long hour traffic jams, which were caused by rallies and protests especially on The Mall and surrounding areas. He said the weather had already become wet and a blanket of particulate matter was present in the skies due to which the vehicular exhausts remained stagnant in the air. This has resulted in acid rain, he said, adding the phenomenon had already been witnessed in various metropolitan cities across the world. Another big reason of increased air pollution was use of substandard fuel used by steel furnaces in Lahore, EPD investigation said, adding out of over 300 steel furnaces some 125 were using substandard fuel, including rubber tyres, waste plastic and other similar items and smoke of these units had mixed with the vehicular pollution./Most of these furnaces are operating around GT Road and their smoke automatically spread in the surroundings of The Mall as well as major urban areas of Lahore like Railway Station, Davis Road, Anarkali, Walled City, Akbari Mandi, Garhi Shahu, Mcleod Road, Data Darbar, Chauburji and etc./Similarly, particulate matter (dust) raised from the ongoing construction work of orange line metro train project especially from the abandoned part of the project also played a major role in creating the outer blanket, which blocked all other gases in the air and didn't allow the vehicular pollution to escape in the air. Taking immediate measures, Provincial Secretary EPD Capt ® Saif Anjum has directed all field teams to strictly monitor industrial units especially steel furnaces on GT Road and ensure that no one should use substandard fuel. The secretary also directed the traffic police officials to ensure smooth traffic flow in the provincial capital. Naseem-ur-Rehman said that EPD secretary had also contacted representatives of industrial sector and requested them to ensure use of wet scrubbers in relevant industries. He said as the humidity had increased in the city, any kind of pollution would stay in the air and would put adverse effects on human population./He said the EPD had also requested the general public to minimise use of vehicles for two or three days while motorists were advised to use face masks. He said field teams in Gujranwala, Kasur, Faisalabad and Multan were also directed to remain vigilant and take strict action against polluters."
LHC moved against smog," Walid Iqbal, grandson of great thinker and National Poet Allama Dr Muhammad Iqbal, filed a writ petition in the Lahore High Court seeking directions for the Punjab government to take adequate measures to control smog and air pollution in the provincial capital./Walid Iqbal filed the petition through his counsel Advocate Sheraz Zaka and submitted that many ill-planned development programmes were initiated in the city./He said digging at several places in the city had caused a huge pollution. The petitioner said people had been getting ill due to smog which, he said, was mixture of dust and smoke in the air. Life had turned miserable due to this endemic air pollution. The government authorities, he said, did nothing to prevent the city from pollution which was increasing fast. He prayed to the court to direct the government for taking adequate measures to control smog and air pollution."
"Smog upsets Islooites, too"," Islooites woke up to smog on Friday morning complaining about breathing difficulty and eye irritation./Though not as heavy as it's reported in parts of Punjab, especially Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan and Bahawalpur, smoggy conditions slightly lowered visibility as well./The people used face masks and sunglasses as a precautionary measure against the phenomenon that environmentalists called smog./'It is smog, a kind of air pollution, which is the blend of smoke and fog in the air.

He said as precautionary measures against smoggy conditions, the people, especially children, should avoid stepping out unnecessarily and use face masks and avoid dust when outdoors."
Smoggy conditions upset twin-city residents," Residents of twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi woke up to smog on Friday morning complaining about breathing difficulty and eye irritation./Though not as heavy as it's reported in parts of Punjab, especially Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan and Bahawalpur, smoggy conditions slightly lowered visibility as well./The people used face masks and sunglasses as a precautionary measure against the phenomenon that environmentalists called smog./'It is smog, a kind of air pollution, which is the blend of smoke and fog in the air.

Foggy days," Winters traditionally begin with foggy days in the plains of Punjab but the fog that enveloped Lahore on November 2 was unprecedented. The smoky haze stayed all day, unlike the past when it would fritter away around noon. It was also quite smoky and irritating for the eyes, something that has not been experienced before./The electronic media coverage of this issue compelled the Punjab government to issue statements, although it was obvious that the fog or smog could not be removed through administrative measures./The plains of Punjab experience low visibility from October to April in the form of smoke, haze and fog. In Lahore and its adjoining areas, fog usually occurs from November to February with an average of 10 to 25 days. The fog's intensity, however, has amplified with each passing year./In central Punjab alluvial soil releases dust particles ('particulate matter' in scientific lingo) in the ambient air to form fog during low temperatures and dry spells of winter. The situation has deteriorated owing to higher levels of air pollutants coming from industries and emissions of motor vehicles. Gases from these two main sources, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone, mix with dust particles and smoke and get trapped in the atmosphere causing the kind of thick fog that invaded the city a few days back./The authorities are so indifferent to this issue that the provincial environment department does not even have an updated air pollution data for Punjab including for Lahore city, which is publicised as a model of development in the country. The half a dozen air-monitoring stations presented to the province by the Japanese government in 2006 have reportedly been lying idle for the last five years./As a result, there is little to no information that can help the environmental agency map the location of different sources of air pollution and assess the types and quantities of pollutants that are being discharged into the environment. A few months ago, the provincial government bought a new mobile air-monitoring station and installed it in Chakwal. The day fog descended on Lahore, this lone mobile station was moved to the city to gather fresh data in the town./The number of vehicles in the Punjab province has jumped from nearly three million to 11.50 million from 2003 to 2013, an average annual growth rate of nearly 28 percent. According to Punjab's official statistics for 2014, more than four million motor vehicles were registered in the Lahore district alone. The other cargo and passenger transport that enters the city daily from other parts of the country is in addition to this. No mechanism exists to enforce smoke-emission standards on these motor vehicles./Industrial units, particularly those consuming fossil fuels, emit significant amounts of air pollutants. A wide range of small-scale to medium-scale industries, including brick kilns, steel re-rolling and plastic moulding also contribute substantially to urban air pollution in the Lahore district through their use of waste fuels, including old tyres, paper, wood, and textile waste. Some factories in the city burn old tyres to produce a kind of oil which is used for mixing in diesel and as a cheap fuel in place of furnace oil./Around 1,100 major and 5,000 small industrial units are located in Lahore, according to the EPA. These units were installed in the city suburbs two or three decades ago but as the city expanded they are now surrounded by residential areas. The big units are major pollutants of the air and water and need to be relocated outside the city under a long-term plan. Under the law, industrial units are required to run pollution-mitigation equipment but they don't so as to save money on electricity. Laws exist but are not enforced owing to widespread corruption./There are 270 small steel mills in northern Lahore. According to a survey conducted at 120 steel mills and furnaces in the city by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Punjab in 2013, the amount of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide in air was more than ten times higher than the normal range in the vicinity of these units. Smoke levels were also found to be much too higher than normal. However, no action was taken against them. The factory-owners are usually politically connected and rich enough to influence the higher authorities. No effort has ever been made to relocate these factories outside the city./Shortage of electricity and, consequently, the use of electricity generators run on diesel and furnace oil have exacerbated air pollution in Lahore. The high sulphur content of furnace oil contributes significantly to particulate matter and sulphur dioxide emissions. In big cities, the government needs to reduce hours of loadshedding, keeping in view its adverse impact on the air and public health./More than a dozen coal-fired plants emitting smokes in neighbouring Indian Punjab have also caused air pollution in our areas, but the government has never taken up this matter with the Indian government. Now the provincial government is building coal-based power stations in different parts of central Punjab; these would worsen the fog issue in the coming years./Further, millions of tonnes of solid waste are generated in Lahore, most of which is either dumped in low-lying areas or burned. Similarly, as open rain nullahs have been turned into sewage-channels, they emit hydrogen sulphide gas which is a pollutant of the air. For long, the provincial government has been procrastinating over the building of covered sewage drains in the city./In short, there is no quick-fix solution to the problem of fog and smog in Punjab and in the city of Lahore. This is a complex issue arising from a host of factors. The severity of the smog/fog can decline only if the government takes genuine pollution-mitigation measures. It will not just dissipate through official statements and meetings which are mostly held to hoodwink the public."
Zero-tolerance for air polluters: DCO," City District Government Lahore (CDGL) has decided to strictly implement environmental laws and a zero-tolerance policy will be adopted in this regard./These views were expressed by Lahore DCO Captain (R) Muhammad Usman while chairing a meeting with factory owners at the DCO office here Wednesday. The meeting was also attended by EDO Sardar Naseer and DO Environment Riaz Anjum./The DCO said that spreading poisonous, unhygienic and untreated smoke in open air was a crime and this menace would be tackled with iron hands./""There would be strict implementation and zero-tolerance in this regard,"" he maintained. Factories/industrial units emitting poisonous smoke and gases in air by using carbon and reluctant to install Air Omission Control Device, would not be de-sealed at any cost, the DCO announced./He directed the district environment office to allow operations of only those factories, which will stop use of carbon and will give undertaking of installing Air Omission Control Device for treatment of poisonous smoke and gas within the period of two months and subject to present Air Omission Control Device construction work on weekly basis./He said the City District Government Lahore would strictly implement environmental laws at any cost. On this occasion, factory owners assured the DCO of their full cooperation to implement the environment laws and assured that their factories would follow all SOPs."
Combating smog," The Punjab Agriculture Department Wednesday urged farmers not to set rice stubble on fire to decrease smog./The Punjab Agriculture Information Department has predicted smog in southern Punjab districts./Talking to reporters, Agriculture Information Department Assistant Director Naveed Asmat Kahloon said setting rice stubble on fire caused air pollution./He said dry spell of winter season has also caused smog spread resulting in spread of chronic diseases and road accidents./The department appealed farmers to avoid setting rice stubble on fire instead use other modern methods to prepare land for next crop./The farmers are suggested to avoid trees cutting and plant more plants to avoid smog in future."
Extra care needed to minimise bad effects of dusty air," Dry cold accompanied with high pollution level in the air is causing spread of various seasonal ailments, especially colds, flu, throat infection, asthma and other respiratory tract infections almost all across the Punjab province and the problem has taken shape of an epidemic./The temperature has already started falling to a significant level and the winter season is about to set in yet without any rain spell due to which the atmosphere is filled with toxic dust causing a number of ailments among residents./The cases of colds, sore throat, cough, and flu are on the rise and according to health experts, it is time for individuals to take extra care to avoid damages that the dust and chemicals in the air can cause./It is important that at the time of setting in of winter, immediate rain as well as heavy wind is needed to cleanse the air quality, which is engulfed by dusty clouds, toxic metals and vapours containing a number of harmful chemicals./Health experts believe that apart from dust in the air, vehicles are also a big source of air pollution and it is imperative to take precautions in order to minimize their effect. The concerned government authorities have been doing almost nothing to control the increasing pollution level in the air./The infections including colds, sore throat, cough and flu are highly contagious, passed by tiny droplets produced during sneezing, coughing of infected persons and touching things with hands and tissues that others touch./Health experts say that in the existing situation when the air is filled with countless harmful chemicals, it is better for one to stay home and not to outside unnecessarily. One should cut down late nights and vigorous exercise for a few days and should stop smoking and avoid second hand smoke./To minimise the harmful effects of poisonous dust in the air, one should drink plenty of fluids, at least eight to 10 glasses of water and fruit juices preferably lemonade. Fluids will help loosen mucus. Drink hot tea or water with lemon and honey, said a medical specialist Dr. Sohail Tariq while talking to 'The News' on Thursday./He added that chicken soup can also help loosen the mucus. Gargle with warm saline water a few times a day to minimise the bad effects of dusty air and use cough lozenges or cough syrup if needed to quite a dry cough./He said it may be beneficial for one to use a humidifier for keeping extra moisture in the room. A well balanced diet including fish at least twice a week and seasonal fruits can help minimising the bad effects of dry weather, said Dr. Sohail."
Save your child," Still very weak and fragile, young Rehan doesn't look his age when his mother helped the doctor examine him. ""He had fever, was sweating and struggling for breath, literally heaving"", narrates Rehan's mother. That's when she decided to rush to the hospital./Dr Mulazim Khara, the doctor on duty at OPD at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Islamabad, wants him to be hospitalised. The little boy had pneumonia when he was two months old. Although he survived, the recovery is still very slow, rather negligible. Although the high season is winter, Pneumonia takes its toll, especially in the northern areas of Pakistan. But, according to Dr Khara, it is a problem all year round./According to a Johns Hopkins study, a projected 5.9 million children around the world will die in 2015, before reaching their fifth birthday. Together, these diseases claimed the lives of nearly 1.5 million children under the age of five in a single year. This report evaluates the progress using the most up-to-date information. Pakistan is one of the 15 countries, with the greatest number of deaths from pneumonia and diarrhea in children under the age of five years./Compared to 2013 (6.4 million), there has been a decrease in child deaths in 2015, nevertheless pneumonia and diarrhea have steadily contributed (pneumonia 16 per cent) to those deaths over the two years./In 2012, Pakistan became the first South Asian country to roll out Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV 10) with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, when it had already helped children in many other countries avoid pneumonia./""The vaccine has the potential to save thousands of lives in Pakistan's under-five children. Proved prohibitively expensive to an average Pakistani family, (around Rs12000 in open market) it is available free of cost in the government's immunization programme,"" informs Dr Saqlain Gilani, National Programme Manager, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)./Routine childhood immunisation is a set of scheduled inoculations, free of cost, given from birth to 15 months to protect the child from diseases like diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, pneumonia, tetanus, meningitis, polio, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B. Booster doses are later required for some vaccines./Although the vaccines are available for the entire cohort (6 million a year) of Pakistani children, due to the low immunisation coverage almost half the children remain unimmunised and vulnerable to pneumonia./The last Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS 2012-13) shows country's immunisation coverage around 54 per cent which means almost half the children are not receiving the vaccine. If the vaccines are available in the country, why don't they reach those in need?/""EPI vaccines, by the grace of God, are being provided for children absolutely free of cost. Even if a child belongs to the poorest of households in a community, he would have access to these costly vaccines from health centres. Not to take advantage of such a blessing is absurd,"" Dr Zulfiqar Bhutta, senior scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children's Research Institute./He believes that for health vaccines to prove effective, it is extremely important that they are provided to as many children as possible. Even if one child remains unvaccinated, he or she is also vulnerable to risk./A doctor working for UN agency believes ""polio has seriously affected the ability of vaccination staff and health workers to deliver routine immunisation services,"" giving reasons for low coverage./Justifying, she says, as door-to-door services have become commonplace during these campaigns, people have become accustomed to such service delivery and expect the same doorstep service for routine immunisation; a situation that consumes far too many resources and vaccinators' time./""It has also been observed that the programme performance of RI contrasts markedly with that of polio campaigns. This could perhaps be likely due to the performance-based incentives and other support structures including financial and technical support from donors for the Polio Eradication Initiative,"" added the doctor who did not want to be named./To initiate immunisation practices as a norm of the society, in April 2015, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq, Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio, took an unprecedented step in Pakistan's effort to eradicate vaccine preventable diseases by introducing a ""The Mandatory Vaccination and Protection of Health Workers Bill 2015"" in the Senate of Pakistan./This was to make the caregivers, health providers and heads of learning institutions of children, responsible to ensure that a child is fully protected against all diseases being covered under the country's immunisation programme./""In Pakistan, a large number of children die of diseases that can be prevented through vaccination. Access to immunisation is the right of every child and duty of the state to ensure the services reach every child. Any hindrance caused to provision of immunisation services causes grievous harm to a child and exposes him or her to highly infectious diseases that cause death or disability,"" said Senator Farooq while presenting the broad features of the bill at the occasion of the public hearing./Discussing the need of a uniform immunisation law across the country, Senator Farooq opined that advocacy and efforts are required at provincial level to introduce same legislation or authorise the Parliament to legislate for the entire country through Article 144 of the Constitution./Mortality due to childhood pneumonia is strongly linked to poverty-related factors such as malnutrition. This must be addressed where disease burden is still high and access to care is insufficient. Other factors include lack of safe water and sanitation, indoor air pollution and inadequate access to healthcare./""As a result children have a weakened immune system and therefore when faced with an infectious threat their system is poorly equipped to respond and defend the body. A vicious cycle of a vulnerable immune system and severe illness commences increasing the risk of mortality,"" adds Dr Khara./Dr Bhutta also believes that close attention should be given to the environment the children are being raised in. For instance, congestion in the household proves to be a problem in case the family size is large. In those cases, all kitchen and cooking-related activities should be carried out in the open./""The smoke and pollution also proves to be a risk and cause for children being infected with pneumonia. Then, smoking inside the house is synonymous to making the children smoke as well. This can lead to countless health issues for children regarding breathing and pneumonia as well,"" he adds./Immunisation saves lives and offers children a better chance of a healthier and more economically productive future. It is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions and can help give each child a chance of survival beyond their fifth birthday. Immunisation is also great value for money   every $1 investment is estimated to reap a $16 return in economic progress./There is no second opinion that improvements in immunisation coverage contributes to reduced child deaths. Dr Gilani believes, ""In order to improve equitable coverage, it is crucial to strengthen the supply side but at the same time we need to work on demand generation as well as too few parents know that the vaccine is necessary for child health, free-of-cost and available at immunization centers nationally."""
World Pneumonia day observed," World Pneumonia day observed across the globe including Pakistan on Saturday to raise awareness of pneumonia promote prevention and treatment and generate action to fight the illness./Different public and private health departments had organised seminars, conferences, discussion programmes and awareness campaigns to highlight this year's theme of World Pneumonia Day./News messages and events promoting World Pneumonia Day had publicised and made viral through social media networks online print and broadcast media and word of mouth./People asked to help fight the disease by participating in education programs voluntary work or contributing via donations./Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs making breathing painful and limiting oxygen intake. Pneumonia is the biggest killer of children under age 5worldwide. Nearly one in five global child deaths result from pneumonia every year. Moreover, this is a preventable and treatable illness via vaccines antibiotic treatment and improved sanitation./The United Nations (UN) first celebrated the day on November12, 2009. The WHO and Unicef integrated Global action plan for pneumonia and diarrhoea (GAPPD) aims to accelerate pneumonia control with a combination of interventions to protect prevent and treat pneumonia in children with actions to protect children from pneumonia including promoting exclusive breastfeeding and adequate complementary feeding prevent pneumonia with vaccinations, hand washing with soap and reducing household air pollution./Treatment of pneumonia focusing on making sure that every sick child has access to the right kind of care either from a community based health worker or in a health facility./A number of countries including Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia have developed district state and national plans to intensify actions for the control of pneumonia and diarrhoea./Many more have integrated diarrhoea and pneumonia specification into their national child health and child survival strategies. For many countries the post Millennium Development Goals agenda has explicitly included ending preventable diarrhoea and pneumonia deaths as a priority action."
Smog matters," Every year, dense fog covers the plains of Punjab, especially Lahore, with the onset of winters but this time around a different phenomenon has been observed: The areas in and around the city were fully covered with smog   a combination of smoke and fog  as early as in mid-October./Exposure to this thick layer of smog caused itchiness in people's eyes and made it hard for many to breathe properly. Road travel also became difficult, as visibility decreased to alarmingly low levels, prompting authorities to shut down the motorway for traffic. Thursday last saw a collision of 10 vehicles near Sukheki, which killed at least eight people right at the spot, while several others were injured and taken to the hospital./It is usual with the environment department officials to blame the coal power plants on the Indian side for generating a thick layer of smoke and for providing the ingredients to create smog on this side of the border. But this time, they are actually stating it as a fact. They say India has admitted to a similarly created mess in New Delhi. Well, if Delhi can be affected by these factors, why not Lahore, they ask./Media reports suggest that Delhi has seen one of the thickest smog in many years. India's Meteorological Department has termed it to be the worst in 17 years. Visibility at the Indira Gandhi International Airport is recorded to be as low as 300-400 metres./Scientists have an explanation. They say that lower level anticyclone   a weather phenomenon which prevents the dispersion of smog   developed where there was virtually no wind in the vertical column. The phenomenon could be observed in Lahore during this time./Muhammad Arif, 44, a resident of Township, says how when he steps out of his house in the morning he can barely see anything in the distance. He also complains of an unpleasant odour and itching in his eyes that force him to go back in./Little does he know that such conditions are caused by the presence of three ingredients   namely, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide   that are trapped together and form a blanket./Naseem-ur-Rehman, Director, Environment Protection Department (EPD), tells TNS that satellite images released by NASA have shown that incidences of paddy burning in Indian Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh increased after Diwali, which contributed to the creation of the smog in Delhi./The same activity may have affected the neighbouring Lahore and added to the other domestic factors./Rehman explains that modern machinery used to harvest paddy crop in Indian Punjab does not uproot the plant, so the farmers get rid of it by burning it. ""The vehicular emissions, caused during endless traffic jams; the burning of harmful fuel like rubber tyres by factories; the use of substandard fuel by vehicles, and the burning of solid waste by individuals are chief reasons for smog./""More than 100 steel furnaces are burning rubber tyres, plastic waste etc as cheap fuel,"" he adds./""The risks are high all over the city as atmospheric pollution generated in one area does not remain there and can spread all around.""/""The risks are high all over the city as atmospheric pollution generated in one area does not remain there and can spread all around.""/Sardar Asif Ali Sial, an environmental lawyer based in Lahore, says it is unfortunate that there is no proper system or equipment at the government's disposal whereby it could monitor air pollution. ""Lahore ranks among the world's top 10 cities for having the worst quality of air. Still, there is no sincere effort to bring the pollution levels down.""/Sial suggests contacting the industrial sector and asking it to use wet scrubbers that cleanse the emissions of harmful impurities before releasing them in the air. ""At the same time, the government must buy modern equipment to measure pollution levels in different areas of the city, and strive to bring it down to acceptable levels.""/An official of the Punjab government, who does not want to be named, believes the situation is owing to the criminal neglect of environmental issues on the part of the government. ""A large number of projects have been carried out without conducting proper Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), and countless trees have been cut for road expansion projects without thinking about the repercussions.""/The official calls the environmentally unfriendly industries as the major culprit, and says the concerned officers are told not to ""harass"" them in the name of compliance as this is tantamount to discouraging investment and economic growth./""There is hardly any concept of punishing the influential polluters and that is why a large number of industrial pollution cases are pending in tribunals,"" he reveals./The health hazards in inhaling the smog are simply unmistakable. Dr Muneeb Razaq, who practises at Razzaq Hospital in Baghbanpura, insists that people must take the required precautionary measures which include staying indoors, if possible, wearing dust masks and zero-number glasses, so that they can prevent damage to their eyes, respiratory tract, lungs and skins./""The risks are high all over the city as atmospheric pollution generated in one area does not remain there and can spread all around,"" he adds."
"Environmental pollution, smoking major causes of irreversible COPD"," Smoking, air pollution, burning of wood and coal for cooking and heating purposes, burning of garbage and use of Sheesha were identified among the major causes of irreversible lung disease, Compulsive Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), by pulmonologists on Wednesday./The health experts were speaking at an awareness seminar regarding COPD, jointly organised by the Chest Health and Education Society (CHES) and Pakistan Chest Society (PSC) at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC)./Commonly known as chronic bronchitis or emphysema, COPD was a serious disease which shrinks lungs, leading to a limited flow of air./A major cause of heart attacks, strokes and pneumonia, the disease was said to have affected over 340 million people worldwide - around seven million in Pakistan; however, the health experts opined that mostly people remained unaware of the conditions./Senior pulmonologist Prof Nadeem Rizvi stated that chronic cough (often called a smoker's cough) and shortness of breath after slightest of exertions were recognizable symptoms of COPD, but many remain undiagnosed owing to a lack of awareness./""Wheezing, and getting out of breath while walking and smoker's cough are also early signs of COPD,"" he said./Dr Rizvi stated that COPD was irreversible as breathlessness later transforms into chest infections the frequency of which renders a patient unable to perform simple tasks without oxygen supply./In the most advanced stages, a patient could also experience permanent disabilities owing to paralysis, the doctor stated, adding, that COPD was the fifth most prevalent cause of deaths across the world./""With the current rate of smokers not reducing anytime soon, COPD can become the third largest cause of death in the world by 2020,"" Dr Rizvi asserted. He said there was an urgent need to inform people of the hazards of smoking and respiratory diseases./An expert at the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS), Dr Nisar Rao, stressed the need for a clear communication between physicians and patients./""Most patients don't communicate their problems to physicians due to which the exact cause of illness or disease remains undiagnosed,"" he said./He discouraged the culture of not consulting doctors. ""Most COPD patients would rather excommunicate themselves from the society than consult their physicians.""/Dr Javed A Khan of the Aga Khan University Hospital said smoking was one of the major causes of COPD; however, environmental degradation was a cause of this chronic respiratory illness, such as air pollution./The rising trend of consuming Sheesha among the youth of Pakistan could also exponentially increase the number of COPD cases in the country, he warned./He also called for implementation of clean air laws in Pakistan, which prohibited smoking or use of Shisha at public places, including hotels and restaurants./Experts regretted that despite a Sindh Assembly resolution banning the use of Sheesha at restaurants it was still being served at all major eateries in the city."
PU to set up study group to tackle pollution in Punjab," Punjab University's Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr Mujahid Kamran Tuesday announced setting up pollution study group in order to combat environmental challenges faced by the province./He made this announcement while speaking at a national seminar ""Smog: Formation, Impacts and Mitigation"" organised by Punjab University College of Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) in collaboration with SEAL at Al Raazi Hall./Principal CEES Prof Dr Sajid Rashid, Head of Satellite Monitoring Group Suparco Shoaib Shafiq, renowned environmental law expert Ahmed Rafay Alam, Meteorological office's Duty Forecasting Officer Syed Pervaiz Hussain Shah, various environmentalists, faculty members and a large number of students were present on the occasion./Dr Mujahid Kamran said research on environment was being carried out at various departments of Punjab University and scientists and students from various departments would be included in this group. He said we had already set up dengue research group which made several predictions which helped the government and the people to curb dengue. He said according to various satellite pictures taken by Nasa, crops were burnt at large scale in Indian Punjab along with coal which created environmental hazard for Pakistan. He said if we gather relevant proofs in this regard, a case could be filed against India in international courts./Dr Sajid Rashid highlighted the history of smog. He said research work was being carried out at the college on various environmental changes. He said Lahore and surroundings had to face smog in December because India was creating environmental problems for Pakistan./Ahmed Rafay Alam, citing judgments and relevant laws, said courts had played role in environment protection. He said international environmental laws were very strict and we could file case against India's role in the recent smog if we had solid evidences./Shoaib Shafiq highlighted difference between smoke, cloud, fog and smog through satellite images and briefed about instruments being used by Suparco./Syed Pervaiz Hasan highlighted reasons and implications of smog. Aleem Butt said coal was being used for meeting most of Indian energy needs and India was behind the smog. Muhammad Sohaib Tahir gave presentation regarding types and elements of air pollution./LWMC drive: In collaboration with the students of a private university, Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) organised a massive drive titled Clean and Green Day on Tuesday./LWMC officials said the activity was organised to sensitise students about the need of environment-friendly Solid Waste Management System in the city and role of youth in its successful implementation. They said the university students were briefed in detail about their role to maintain cleanliness inside and outside campus emphasising the need for ensuring disposal of garbage into designated containers and bins by every citizen./Drive was comprised of interactive session with students in the university auditorium followed by plantation, camping, waste picking and machinery demonstration. While taking part in waste picking activity held both by university students and LWMC team, Ghazi Alam, professor Management Sciences Department, thanked communication department of LWMC for holding such a grand drive with Clean and Green theme and motivating his students on environmental and sanitation issue of very high importance and most importantly by setting good example in the field of waste management. Muhammad Umair Khan, deputy manager communication, termed the activity as highly fruitful as many university students prepared art pieces for highlighting need of three RS (reduce, reuse, recycle ) strategy, segregation at source and disposal of waste following standard instructions practices./bins: In order to maintain good sanitation conditions, Albayrak Waste Management Company started installation of waste bins in Shalamar Bagh here Tuesday./Officials said the drive was started in October 2016 and its first phase was completed on Tuesday. They said in the second phase, bins will be installed at the second terrace of garden named ""Faiz Bakhsh""./Shalamar Bagh administration appraised the efforts of Albayrak Waste Management and thanked the company for erecting awareness boards in the upper terrace of the garden. The activity aimed to create awareness among the visitors to keep the historical places neat and litter-free. The campaign will continue until the waste bin installation in whole garden is completed, the officials concluded."
"As cases of lung disease rising, doctors call for ban on cigarettes"," Chest specialists and pulmonologists while addressing a press conference recently called for a complete ban on cigarettes and implementation of anti-smoking laws in the country. They said smoking was causing high incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - an irreversible lung disease./Air pollution, burning of wood and coal for cooking and heating purposes, burning of garbage and use of Sheesha are among the major causes behind (COPD). The pulmonologists associated with Pakistan Chest Society said almost 90 percent of the smokers were likely to develop COPD./Around 18 percent population of Pakistan comprises smokers, which clearly indicates why there is such a large number of COPD patients in the country./The experts said being one of the major causes of heart attack, stroke and pneumonia, the disease was said to have affected over 340 million people worldwide - around seven million in Pakistan; however, most people remained unaware of the gravuity of the situation./Senior pulmonologist Prof Dr Nadeem Rizvi said chronic cough (often called smoker's cough) and shortness of breath after slightest of exertions were recognisable symptoms of COPD, but many remain undiagnosed because of a lack of awareness./""Wheezing, and getting out of breath while walking and smoker's cough are also early signs of COPD,"" he added./Dr Rizvi stated COPD was irreversible as breathlessness later transformed into chest infections, the frequency of which renders a patient unable to perform simple tasks without oxygen supply. ""In advanced stages, a patient can also experience permanent disabilities owing to paralysis,"" the doctor stated. ""COPD is the fifth most prevalent cause of deaths across the world.""/Dr Rizvi asserted that with the current rate of smokers not reducing anytime soon, COPD could become the third largest cause of death in the world by 2020. ""There is an urgent need to inform people of the hazards of smoking.""/Dr Nisar Rao, an expert at the Dow University of Health Sciences, stressed the need for a clear communication between physicians and patients./""Most patients don't communicate their problems to physicians due to which the exact cause of illness or disease remains undiagnosed,"" he added./He discouraged the culture of not consulting doctors. ""Most COPD patients would rather excommunicate themselves from the society than consult their physicians."" It is estimated by the WHO that close to 210 million cases of COPD could possibly be found worldwide, while some estimates put this number as high as 400-600 million./Dr Rao said in Pakistan, breathlessness alone was the most frequently reported symptom of COPD. ""It is known that almost 90 percent of COPD deaths occur in low and middle-income countries and cigarette smoking is the most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD.""/""In Pakistan, the prevalence rate of COPD related symptoms is 18.percent and COPD patients with co-morbidities stand at 26.7 percent, while 76.7 percent patients experience exacerbations.""/Dr Saifullah Baig, an assistant professor at Dow University's Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases and general secretary of the Pakistan Chest Society said COPD patients hospitalised for their condition are 33.3 percent and 26.7 percent patients visited an emergency room due to their respiratory condition."
Senate committee expresses concern about climate related issues," Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change on Monday expressed serious concern over steps taken by climate ministry after COP 22 and smog and fog issues in Lahore and surrounding areas./The committee was chaired by Mir Muhammad Yousaf Badini. Briefing the committee Federal Minister for Climate Change Zahid Hamid informed about the outcomes of COP 22 that includes Marrakech Action Proclamation for Climate Change and Sustainable Development parties set a rapid deadline of 2018 to complete the rule book for operationalising the Paris Agreement to ensure confidence cooperation progress across key areas of climate action./That include climate finance adaptation capacity building technology and gender responsiveness Roadmap for climate finance formulated and discussed How to get to the 100 billion mark adaptation Fund was able to survive despite extensive resistance from some developed parties and Warsaw Int. Mechanism (Loss and Damage) 5 year plan finalised./Minister said Pakistan has also developed a National Sustainable Development Strategy and 19th February 2016 Pakistan became perhaps the first country in the world whose National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution adopting the SDGs agenda as its own national development agenda./Pakistan Parliament is also the first Parliament in the world to become completely green by converting 100% to solar energy, he added./He further told The historic Pakistan Climate Change Bill which will establish a high level policy making Pakistan Climate Change Council along with the Pakistan Climate Change Authority to prepare and supervise implementation of adaptation and mitigation projects in various sectors./Farzana Altaf Shah (Director General) EPA brief that Mist and fog are caused by water droplets in the air and the only difference is how far one can see. Haze is the reflection of sunlight off air pollution while smog is what happens when pollution causes low lying ozone./Committee sought a report from Punjab government regarding fog and smog issue in the next meeting. An official from climate ministry also brief about Houbara Bustard and migratory birds that the fund will help conservation of habitat of migratory birds in Pakistan. Senator Gul Bushra, Senator Saleem Zia, Senator Ahmed Hassan and Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed also attended the meeting."
Dire Contact," The time was around 3 am on January 17 last year when the residents of Akbarabad area in Faisalabad woke up to the deafening noise of a blast. Many of them rushed out of their houses to find out what had actually happened while others started to recite the holy verses they knew by heart. There was fear in the air and apprehensions among the locals about some terrorist group attacking the area./It did not take them much time to discover that a huge boiler set up inside a house, right in the middle of a congested residential area had burst due to excessive heating and pressure and left four men dead and several injured. The owner of the house had installed this boiler secretly in contravention of the industrial safety laws and not shared this information with the locals./The workers he had employed would enter from the backdoor and spend long hours here dying yarn cones in a highly unsafe work environment. Later on, investigations into the incident revealed that the boiler had been manufactured locally and did not meet the prescribed standards. There was no meter to automatically gauge the pressure which would build up and it was on the discretion of workers when to shut it down./This one incident shows how the people of the industrial city of Faisalabad are exposed to risks like deaths and injuries in industrial accidents, mainly due to flaws in urban planning and non-implementation of land use laws in the past. Though, fortunately, the fatal accidents do not take place in quick succession, it does not mean the residents of these areas remain safe from harms to their health and life during the time in between such tragedies./In fact, it has been learnt, that they become victims of lethal diseases due to exposure to environmental pollutants, especially the toxic air they breathe, and die a slow death. The environmentally unfriendly industrial units in residential areas cause the major harm but hardly any action is taken by the responsible government functionaries. Occupational asthma, silicosis and asbestosis are some of the common diseases that are found in industrial workers in textile, battery manufacturing, cement production, and mineral processing units./Against this backdrop, there are calls about ridding the city of pollutants, making it an environment-friendly city with ample green areas, enforcing zoning rules and moving harmful industrial areas out of the residential areas. The good thing is that some initiatives have been launched and more are in the offing to tackle these challenges. Further delay in formulating and implementing healthy development plans cannot be afforded, as the city, its population, and industry are bound to grow exponentially in times to follow. If uncontrolled, this growth can turn the city into an urban hell./The alarming thing at the moment is that several studies, surveys and inspections have revealed that the overall environment and especially the air quality of Faisalabad are extremely poor. As one study puts it: ""Air pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, ozone, hydrocarbons and particulate matters, (both Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) and respirable particulate (PM10) and sulphur dioxide are at very high levels. These levels are in general, many times higher than WHO and international standards indicating serious issue of air pollution.""/According to Punjab government's portal, roughly, there are 512 large industrial units, out of which 328 are textile units, 92 engineering units, and 92 are chemicals and food processing units in Faisalabad, known as the Manchester of Pakistan. Other industries include hosiery, carpet and rugs, nawar and lace, printing and publishing, and pharmaceutical products. There are also some 12,000 household industries, which include some 60,000 power loom factories./A PricewaterhouseCoopers study published in 2009, surveying the 2008 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the top cities in the world, calculated Faisalabad's GDP at $35 billion at that time. The city was third in Pakistan behind Karachi ($78 billion) and Lahore ($40 billion). Faisalabad's GDP is projected to grow at the rate of 5.7 per cent, higher than the growth rates of 5.5 per cent and 5.6 per cent predicted for Karachi and Lahore./Tariq Awan, coordinator, Pakistan Institute for Labour Education and Research (PILER), elaborates the environmental challenges faced by the city. He cites cases of many labourers who are suffering from severe respiratory diseases due to inhalation of toxic air, both in industrial and residential areas. He says there is hardly any check on use of harmful and substandard fuels such as waste tyres, poultry waste (chicken droppings), rubber, wood and abandoned coarse cloth by the sizing industry, which is mostly concentrated in industrial area./Sizing, he says, is about providing protective cover/coating to thread etc and the processes need heating to a certain level. He recalls most of the unit owners opted for these fuels when there was an acute electricity and gas crisis a couple of years ago, but now when the situation is better they are still sticking to these mainly due to the cost factor./Tariq laments there are hundreds of sizing units established in areas such as Ghulam Muhammad Abad, Faizabad, Jhang Road, and Sargodha Road that are constantly polluting the air and adding to the pollution spread by hundreds of coal-fired brick kilns in and around the city./Similarly, Syeda Ghulam Fatima, secretary general, Bonded Labour Liberation Front (BLLF) Pakistan identifies use of low quality coal and poultry waste as major reasons for atmospheric pollution and the resulting diseases among workers and the residents of the localities in close vicinity. She says this issue has assumed alarming proportions, as the city remained engulfed in thick smog for many days in November, crippling normal routine life./Fatima suggests shifting to mechanised brick kilns to save brick-kiln workers from serious respiratory diseases and the city from environmental pollution caused by burning of coal. Though it appears to be an ambitious plan, she says, in the long run the dividends will be high./Yawar Hussain, director general, Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA), agrees there are challenges and narrates the government plans to tackle these. He says that under the Punjab Private Housing Schemes and Land Sub-division Rules 2010, all the private housing schemes have to allocate at least seven per cent of their land for plantation. This land shall be used to develop parks or green belts, he adds. He shares that FDA is ensuring that these rules are strictly followed and there is no violation in the city./Yawar agrees many residential areas in the city have industrial units amid them and that house residents are exposed to harmful pollutants present in the surrounding air, but he makes it clear that this will not be allowed anymore. He informed Money Matters that in the past, either such units were set up in residential areas or people started to dwell around industrial units as they hoped to find jobs there. In those times, he says, zoning rules were not so elaborate and neither were they enforced strictly but today it is the priority of the government to clearly define land use rules and separately earmark areas for housing, industry, and agriculture./On the environmental threats faced by residents, he says the Peri-Urban Structure Plan approved for Faisalabad in 2015 tries to balance the housing, social and business needs of residents and focuses on protecting land meant for agriculture. It aims at providing breathing space to the residents of different areas and help the city grow in a structural manner during the next 20 years. In addition to this, he points out, the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), has launched a move against pollution on a war footing and gone for linear plantation in the city. It is estimated that around 50,000 plants have been planted recently that will ultimately grow into full-fledged trees and help reduce pollution, he shares./When asked about the redressal of complaints by citizens against their exposure to toxic industrial emissions in their localities, he says the government has established industrial estates in the outskirts of Faisalabad where it intends to relocate the small-sized and cottage industries. ""Though it is not easy to uproot these businesses from there, the efforts are underway,"" he concludes./Environmental lawyer Sardar Asif Ali Sial has served as national consultant, Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PAK EPA), Ministry of Climate Change, Government of Pakistan and reviewed Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997 as consultant. He has also conducted more than 100 Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) including several in Faisalabad./He laments the fact that the industry does not take compliance with environmental laws seriously and ignores the fact that under the terms of GSP Plus status they have to follow the conditions of nine UN conventions/protocols on environmental compliance. He says EU inspectors are monitoring the situation and it is likely that shipments from Pakistan can be rejected if environmental concerns are not taken care of. ""We must devise proper strategies to fulfil these conditions if we do not want to lose this status,"" he stresses./The industry sources claim they are following environmental laws, especially the medium and large scale ones. Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI) members claimed that 90 percent industrial units which are their members have installed wet scrubbers and hence the smoke emitted from these factories is clean as compared to the smokes of other cities. The non-members and the undocumented units are the ones causing the damage, they point out./Nasim ur Rehman, director, Environment Protection Department (EPD), explains there are nine clusters in Faisalabad where industries and housing units coexist and are hubs of environmental issues. This problem is perennial and efforts are underway since 1997 to make the environment clean, he adds./He says that after efforts spread over years, a 4,500-acre industrial estate has been established outside the city. There was a plan to shift all industries to this place but this couldn't happen due to various reasons. Therefore, he says, ""Our focus is on making these environment-friendly and work till the time they phase out."" But no new industrial unit will be allowed to be set up in residential areas, he clarifies./Nasim claims atmospheric pollution has been controlled to an extent because the district government is very strict with those units consuming hazardous fuels and releasing untreated emissions in the air. The provincial government has announced a zero tolerance policy against polluters who have contributed a lot to the creation of smog this year, he shares."
Delegates call for accelerated joint efforts to achieve SDGs," Over 600 local and foreign delegates attending the 7th Annual Public Health Scientific conference here at the Health Services Academy on Wednesday resolved to accelerate efforts for achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The moot is being attended by delegates from China, Iran, the UK, and Sweden./This year's theme of the conference is 'Sustainable Development Goals for Health: Collaborating for Prosperity.' Pakistan adopted the SDGs in February 2016 through a parliamentary resolution that was passed unanimously./Speaking on the occasion, Secretary Health Muhammad Ayub Shaikh said, health is a contributor to sustainable development. ""Pakistan is fully committed to achieving the health-related SDGs,"" he said while emphasizing the need for synergies and partnerships for building collective commitment and harnessing local and international resources to achieve substantial outcomes./Ayub Sheikh referred to the National Health Insurance initiative, plus the turnaround achieved by the country in polio eradication. ""We have successfully dealt with peculiar challenges including militancy and inaccessibility, which stood in the way of progress towards eradicating polio,"" he added./Pakistan is cognizant of global health commitments such as the need to overcome Anti-Microbial Resistance. Under a comprehensive National AMR Containment policy, emphasis has been laid on the five strategic objectives of the WHO Global Action Plan for AMR. ""A national policy on AMR has been prepared and is ready for implementation,"" the Secretary shared. He also mentioned that the Health Policy and Analysis Unit is being linked with the Health Services Academy and a think tank is being established in the institution for policy advice by the best minds in the country./Speaking on the occasion, the executive director of HSA Professor Dr. Assad Hafeez maintained that public health has evolved over the years to include climate change, safe cities, empowering individuals, gender equality, equitable access to health, and sustainable development along with the traditional concepts of poverty eradication, food security, nutrition, sanitation, and education, whilst maintaining at the core, the social determinants of health. Highlighting the achievements of HSA, he said it will soon become an independent degree awarding institute./Dr. Hafeez said, Pakistan as a nation is facing challenges of ensuring health equality and equity for all citizens. ""The struggle remains to combat the detrimental health effects, especially on children, of air pollution, pneumonia and diarrhoea, and morbidity and mortality along the life course. We are determined to ensure that health is for all; and no one is left behind. But these obstacles can be overcome by ensuring health is a priority at all levels; by forming sustainable collaborations and partnerships; by encouraging sharing of ideas and working towards a common goal. Lessons we have learned from the MDGs are that if we want to attain the SDGs by 2030, what we require is dedication, commitment, and clarity of vision,"" he stated./Dr. Christian Munduate, deputy representative of Unicef also addressed the gathering. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, addressed the conference through video message./The Representative of the World Health Organization Dr. Michel Thieren chaired the first plenary session, with Dr. Arshad Ali, executive director of the Higher Education Commission, as co-chair. Dr. Duncan Selbie, chief executive, Public Health England, spoke on 'Sustainable Solutions for Sustainable Development,' while Dr. Zeba Sathar, country director of Population Council delivered a presentation on 'Gender, Health and Population Matters in achieving SDGs.' In the end, Dr. Mohammad Assai Ardakani, the coordinator of Integrated Service Delivery, WHO, expressed his views on 'Service Delivery Improvement for move towards Universal Health Coverage.'/The proceedings of the conference will inform the decision-making processes at the federal and provincial health departments in line with the National Health Vision 2016-2025."
Incidences of CVDs get higher in winter," The extreme fall in temperature not only causes serious and life threatening complications among patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) but also it is observed around the globe that the highest incidence of CVDs occurs during the colder winter months and the phenomenon contributes to greater number of deaths due to the CVDs in winter./The seasonal variation in morbidity and mortality due to the twelve cardiovascular diseases including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and rupture, stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation has been noted across the world with higher incidence rates during the winter than in the summer./Studies reveal that the variation is associated with a number of risk factors including temperature, physical activity, air pollution, infections, and dietary habits however the risk can be minimized by following precautionary measures in time. It is suggested that potentially important seasonal risk factors like the seasonal variation in the plasma level of fibrinogen, cholesterol, hormones and vasoactive substance including vasopressin (AVP), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and angiotensin II, aldosterone and catecholamine which tends to rise in the winter play an important role in the seasonal change of CVDs./Various studies carried out in the recent past have shown that both systolic and diastolic mean blood pressures exhibit a seasonal peak during winter and trough in summer among adults, the elderly, and children as well as healthy and hypertensive people./Also it is observed through a number of studies on seasonal variation in heart failure (HF) hospitalisation carried out in France, Spain, Japan, Scotland, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Turkey, Nigeria, Canada, and USA that admissions increase during the winter season and show decline in summer season./Cold weather, among other factors, increases peripheral vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels), which may lead to pulmonary oedema as a consequence of left ventricular failure and may also cause abnormal clotting./Health experts in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have repeatedly expressed to 'The News' that in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure, a progressive condition that affects the pumping power of the heart muscle, the cold exposure decreases exercise capacity and increases the already raised chances of vasoconstriction and it may cause serious complications in extreme cold weather./It is important that greater number of sudden cardiac deaths is reported in winter than in summer across the globe while an increase in mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the winter months has been recorded for the last many decades./Health experts are of the view that in both sexes, overall levels of physical activity are significantly higher in summer than in winter and physical inactivity is strongly positively associated with CVDs. Studies show that physical activities such as walking, cycling and gardening only protect against acute coronary events if undertaken throughout the year./Experts suggest that a number of simple precautions to reduce the risk of dying from CHD in winter should be taken that include adequate indoor heating, wearing protective clothing, especially outdoor protection of the face, and avoiding unaccustomed strenuous exercise. Also there is a need to change our lifestyles particularly in relation to diet and regular exercise while smoking should be avoided as it may cause more harm in winter."
Smoggy Beijing orders factories to shut or cut output," Beijing´s city government ordered 1,200 factories near the Chinese capital, including a major oil refinery run by state oil giant Sinopec, to shut or cut output on Saturday after authorities issued the highest possible air pollution alert./On Friday, China´s environmental watchdog issued a five-day warning about choking smog spreading across the north and ordered factories to shut, recommended residents stay indoors and curbed traffic and construction work./Red alerts are issued when the air quality index (AQI), a measure of pollutants in the air, is forecast to break 200 for more than four days in succession, surpass 300 for more than two days or overshoot 500 for at least 24 hours./The Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Centre showed an air quality reading of 297 by Saturday afternoon as haze started to envelop the capital, after an earlier reading of around 120./Levels in the 301-500 band are considered hazardous to health./Traffic on the city´s roads was lower than usual as residents complied with limits on car use and many of the city´s 22 million residents sat out the haze at home./""I´ll just take a rest and not go outside,"" said Wang Jianan, a 23-year-old Beijing resident and teaching assistant./With Christmas just a week away, others resorted to dark humour to help cope with the latest episode of toxic air./One Beijing resident posted a cartoon on WeChat, China´s mobile messaging platform, showing Santa Claus on his slay almost completely obscured by smog, saying: ""I can´t find China./""The city´s municipal government said in a statement Sinopec´s 10 million tonne-per-year Yanshan refinery, a Shougang Group steel product plant and a Cofco factory that makes instant noodles and crackers were among 500 companies it had ordered to limit output./The statement also listed 700 companies that had been ordered to suspend operations altogether. The national environmental watchdog was sending more than a dozen inspection teams to check that factories and heavy manufacturing plants were complying with the crackdown, it said./The hazardous air underscores the challenge facing the world´s second-largest economy as the government battles pollution caused by the coal-burning power industry and other heavy industry after decades of breakneck economic growth./The government´s colour-graded warning system was adopted as part of its crackdown on smog./More than 40 cities have issued warnings, with 22 on red alert, including top steelmaking city Tangshan in Hebei province around Beijing, and Jinan in coal-rich Shandong province./In Shijiazhuang, Hebei´s capital, the air quality reading was as high as 500. Steel plants there have been forced to cut output."
Whither public goods?," What happens when a society sets itself upon a course to self destruction without understanding the consequences of its actions or - in a situation that is more germane to the Pakistani context - its egregiously flawed inaction?/The human condition is captured in beautifully evocative prose by Lothar of Segni Pope Innocent III: ""Oh! The vile indignity of the human condition! Oh! The undeserving condition of the human cowardice! Go and inquire the grass and the trees. They from themselves produce flowers, leaves and fruits; you from yourself, you produce nits, lice, and worms.""/When we multiply like worms sans environmental empathy, the resulting degradation leads to a dystopian existence that devours the fruits of whatever little progress mankind has made so far. For the purpose of clarity, public goods can be divided in two broad categories - natural and manmade. The natural category includes air, water, forests, and soil whereas the manmade category includes health, education, communication infrastructure, and law and order./Public goods are non excludable and non-rivalrous. You have to provide these to everyone while tackling the challenge of equitable contribution by those who cannot afford to buy these goods such as the poor and the dispossessed. The non-rivalrous nature of these goods ensures that everyone is affected by these, regardless of their state of affluence or penury. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the roads we travel on, the oceans and rivers that we use, the soil we live on, and the trees we benefit from are all public goods. Once they are bestowed by nature, these public goods are controlled by mankind through consumption patterns and technologies differentiated by the priorities of respective nations. The industrialised economies having reaped the fruits of resource extraction through colonial enterprises that have reached a state where the sharing and utilisation of public goods has been brought in harmony with the environment./Through stringent regulations and sound strategies, developed countries have ensured that their air remains clean, their water drinkable, their forests untouched and their roads safe for travel. They have also ensured that the urban areas uncluttered, effectively warding off disease, squalor, climate risks, and urban chaos. Countries like Pakistan have been caught in a vortex of unplanned development due to lack of planning and vision, consigning future generations to the risks of disease, destitution, and conflicts. The notion of security that relied primarily upon a military dimension has bilked us of a true concept of security. It is time we securitised our natural as well as manmade public goods, such as air, water, forest cover, communication infrastructure, justice delivery, health and education./While the rich might buy their way to better manmade public goods - such as health, education, justice delivery and urban infrastructure - they just cannot buy their way out of air and water pollution that would haunt the poor and rich alike./It is time our predatorial elite realises the folly of living in a secure cocoon of gated comforts. The untenability of excluding the unexcludable has eluded the consciousness of our policymaking elite as they consign the impoverished multitude to a vicious cycle of exploitation. The disproportionate allocation of resources towards these islands of affluence denies the provision of public goods to the destitute majority. It is not difficult to imagine what happens to a society that buries its head in asphyxiating sands of cloying comforts, thinking that the gated communities and wealth would protect them from toxic air, contaminated water, and urban chaos. The inadequate allocation of resources for environmental protection and the efficient provision of public goods - such as justice, health care and education - results in an unplanned urban chaos that diminishes the overall quality of life./The skewed distribution of national wealth and lack of industrialisation has resulted in a self-perpetuating cycle of environmental degradation and poverty that feed off each other. Since 70% of Pakistan's population lives in the rural areas, where the lack of basic amenities forces people to over consume natural resources, the absence of conservation strategies exacerbates environmental degradation. The situation in cities is even worse as poor urban planning has resulted in the 'ghettoisation' of a vast majority of poor people. The urban, gated communities of affluence exist cheek by jowl with the ghettos rendering the overall quality of life subhuman. With no waste disposal and sewage treatment facilities available in our heavily populated cities, the ground water gets contaminated, resulting in water-borne diseases - a major cause of infant mortality./The air pollution in urban centres has reached dangerous levels. According to a World Bank study, the harmful particulate matter concentration in Pakistan is four times higher than the World Health Organization's safe limit. The high infant mortality and adult morbidity rates along with traffic accidents are a dangerous concomitant of the alarmingly poor air quality in Pakistan. This state of poor air quality is a direct result of lax regulatory structures that could enforce adherence to safe carbon emissions from automobiles as well as industrial activity. Rickety, old jalopies and smoke-belching auto rickshaws move about spreading mayhem on our roads. However, there is hardly a squeal of protest from environmental lobbies whose sights are set on more lucrative and attention-grabbing projects./The average noise pollution levels in the major cities of Pakistan stand at over 100 decibels - way above the internationally accepted standards of 70 decibels. The absence of legal enforcement and noise levels standards has let loose a cacophony of noise, resulting in sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders and endocrine imbalance among the affected population./The main question that arises is: For how long will our oligarchs remain immune to the pernicious effects of polluted air, toxic water, depleted forests, eroded soil, and clogged infrastructure? While they could buy manmade public goods - such as health, education, housing, communication infrastructure, and personal security - what would they do with the air, water, soil, noise, and the death traps passing off as roads in our country?/The elite simply cannot cocoon itself in gated islands of comfort and security. The rich will, at some hour of the day, have to come out to breathe or travel on the death traps passing off as roads in our country. Gated communities and bottled water is no permanent cure to the problem of a gross neglect in providing public goods to people. It is time that the empowered and rich decision-making elite realise that unless the deterioration of natural public goods is prevented through emergency measures, a mortal threat looms over the living conditions of the rich and poor alike./The writer is a PhD scholar at Nust./Email: /<a href=""mailto:rwjanj@hotmail.com"">rwjanj@hotmail.com</a>"
Clean the air," The recent thick fog in northern Punjab has been the prime cause of multiple accidents. The thick layer also referred to as winter's fog is noxious smog carrying serious health hazards. Smog is a mixture of smoke and fog, and it is caused by vehicular and industrial emissions. Toxic smog is only cleared by rain, but lack of rain in the country has aggravated the problem./Although industrial development in the country is commendable, the government must think about the precious lives of citizens which are being threatened by toxic industrial emissions. The government must establish industrial areas far away from residential areas. Those vehicles should be banned which produce toxic smoke causing air pollution. The government should install an air purifier also called 'the smog free tower' that will clean polluted air in the environment."
Lahore among most polluted cities of Pakistan," Inaction against polluters and ineffective public awareness campaigns turned the provincial capital into one of the most polluted cities across the country during the year 2016./Now the citizens can't find clean and pure air to breathe in anywhere in the city, once known for its gardens and fresh air. Besides the problem of polluted air, citizens are also facing increased levels of noise and water pollution./Untreated industrial and municipal waste water continues to affect the underground water aquifer but as usual the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) remained silent during the year and no concrete action was initiated against the polluters except taking eyewash measures./Experts said that unplanned expansion of urban areas, absence of public transport and mass transit services, tremendous increase in the number of privately owned vehicles, presence of industrial clusters in densly populated localities have resulted in high concentrations of pollutants such as carbondioxide, nitrousoxides (NoX) and sulphuroxide (SoX), which are seriously affecting the health of general public./Various government departments such as transport, environment and CDGL initiated several short-term campaigns against smoke emitting vehicles and two-stroke motorcycle-rickshaws during 2016./Presence of excessive Suspended Particulate Matter (PM10) in the ambient air remained the top reason behind increased air pollution in the city. Sources in EPD revealed that during the year 2016 average PM concentration in Lahore had exceeded many-fold from the international standards and WHO guidelines. Major sources of the PM10 in the city were lack of green patches around the roads, ongoing construction of different infrastructural development projects, including Orange Train project, burning of solid waste, brick kilns and natural dust./Ironically, the level of PM10 is far higher in less privileged localities because Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), which is responsible for maintaining green belts, has only performed its duties with dedication in posh localities and along big roads of the city./Scattered solid waste, non-implementation of Hospital Waste Management Rules, 2005, sale of hospital waste to the recycling industry in the city, manufacturing of underweight polythene bags, buring of plastic by industrial units especially in North Lahore, establishment of hazardous industrial units in residential areas are also some of the major issues, which contributed to the city's deteriorated environmental health./Recently, EPD launched a massive operation against hospital waste but citizens feared that this crackdown may end like the previous operations during which only notices were issued to the culprits instead of taking strict action against them./Presence of light and heavy industrial units operating in various residential city localities i.e. Misri Shah, Baghbanpura, Moghalpura, Daroghewala, Bhagatpura, Chah Miran, Shadbagh and others along the Bund Road and GT Road remained operational during the year 2016 despite claims of different government authorities regarding shifting of these industrial units outside Lahore. These industries include steel foundries, steel re-rolling mills, brick kilns, steel furnaces, scrap yards, plastic recycling industry, marble grinding, furniture making and several other kinds of cottage industries, and they are openly causing massive air and noise pollution besides generating untreated industrial water, vibration and heat./The city is already facing the impacts of global warming and the present situation of air, noise and water pollutions, if not controlled, may worsen the situation. Following the increased pollution levels, citizens are also facing various diseases. Citizens hope that in 2017 the Punjab government will launch indiscriminate drives against polluters besides launching massive public awareness drives to educate general public about different types of pollution and their impacts on human life."
Small Wonders," Since the age of modern man that began roughly 200,000 years ago, the world has seen a progression of innovation and invention. From primitive developments such as the wheel and paper to today's high-tech gadgets, there's certainly no shortage of impressive developments that have changed the way we live and work.

Quell can help with the pain relief. It is a 100% drug-free wearable chronic pain relief technology. As the Quell is worn on the upper calf, it stimulates sensory nerves, which carry neural pulses to your brain. These pulses tap into the body's natural pain relief response, thus blocking pain signals in your body for a widespread pain relief./Enabled by Bluetooth, the Quell Android, and iOS app lets you control therapy right from your smartphone. In addition to adjusting the intensity of the therapy, you can also start and stop the therapy sessions. However, Quell is not a cure and using it doesn't eliminate the cause of your pain. It can only turn down the volume of pain./Wynd - personal air purifier/According to World Health Organization, the number of deaths attributed to air pollution is 6.5 million a year. The fact is, no matter where you live and work, you're breathing in chemicals and pollutants. Wynd, a portable air filter, roughly the size of a water bottle, creates a clean climate bubble by sucking up pollutants, removing dust, allergens and smoke from your immediate vicinity, including ones that can contribute to cancer and heart disease./Smart Remote/Wouldn't it be cool if you could control every device at your home with a single remote? Smart Remote is a device that instantly adapts to anything you point at. It is a revolutionary product that lets you instantly control any device including TV, media player, speaker, lights, thermostats, sockets, smart hubs, blinds, fans, cams, locks and more, just with one single touch.

The capsule, which helps the Oombrella to perform the smart functions, can be easily connected to any umbrella. Thereby your own umbrella can be turned into a smart umbrella./Robotic spoons for disabled people:/These robotic spoons are for those who cannot move their hands easily. This device helps them eat food without moving their hands. These spoons come with hi-tech sensors, computer and motors fitted in them. They can be used after being attached with a regular spoon or fork. They are extremely helpful for those with affected vertebral columns, mental paralysis, Parkinson's disease or paralysis."
Textile mill in SITE sealed for using coal-fired power plant," The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency sealed a textile mill in SITE Industrial Area on Friday for causing air pollution as it was using a coal-fired power plant to generate its own electricity without environmental watchdog's permission./A Sepa official said the owners of two factories adjacent to the Liberty Mills had complained to the environmental watchdog that the textile mill was using a coal-fired power plant that was producing heavy smoke and poisonous gases./'If proper measures are not taken, a coal-fired power plant produces deadly gases including sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, ash and other hazardous material which can be deadly for the people living in its vicinity,' he told The News./Sepa wrote to the management of the Liberty Mills as to why it had not acquired permission before installing the coal-fired power plant. Then it sent a team to examine the plant but it was not allowed to enter the premises by the mill's administration./'Using air quality checking equipment, the visiting Sepa team found that smoke and particles from the textile factory were polluting the environment and making the air poisonous,' the official said./On the report of its inspection team, Sepa issued an Environmental Protection Order to the administration of the Liberty Mills and asked the management to appear for a personal hearing and justify if its action was as per law./However, the mill's administration replied that it was not creating any environmental pollution but provided no evidence or supportive material in this connection./Earlier this month, the environmental watchdog had issued another EPO to the Liberty Mills' administration, asking it to immediately close down its power production through coal./On Friday, a Sepa team led by deputy director Waris Gabol with the help of police sealed Liberty Mills. 'Unless proper measures are taken to ensure environmental protection, the textile mill will not be allowed to function,' the official said./He added that Sepa had also expedited action against factories, institutions, and hospitals creating environmental pollution and recently shut down several factories in Hyderabad./The Liberty Mills Limited is one of the largest textile processing units in Pakistan with a production capacity of 500,000 square metres of fabric per day."
Cancer upsurge in Pakistan," It is estimated that about 300,000 new individuals suffer from cancer every year in Pakistan that adds up to the existing pool of millions of cancer patients who are already under treatment./Globally over 14 million new cases of cancer are reported every year which are expected to rise about 70 per cent over the next two decades. Cancer kills about 100,000 people in Pakistan every year. Currently, 8.2 million people die from cancer worldwide every year; out of which 4 million die prematurely, aged 30 to 69 years./There are number of reasons for this increase, the four main ones being a longer life expectancy, more accurate diagnosis, alarming prevalence of Hepatitis B and C and the rise in cigarette smoking. Lack of awareness among public about various aspects of the problem is a leading cause of damages due to cancers./Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry expressed this while talking to 'The News' in connection with World Cancer Day which is observed on February 4 around the globe./He added that about one third of cancer deaths are due to five leading behavioural and dietary risks including high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use and alcohol use./Every cancer type requires a specific treatment regimen which encourages one or more modalities such as surgery, and or radiotherapy or chemotherapy, he said./It is important that Pakistan lacks severely facilities for treatment of cancer patients. Current facilities are merely providing health care to 40,000 patients, only leaving majority to wander in different corridors of hospitals. Diagnostic and treatment facilities are not accessible to around 60,000 of population every year, said Dr. Ashraf./Furthermore, there is a lack of facilities for even palliative care, the treatment to relieve symptoms caused by cancer. Palliative care can help people live more comfortably. It is particularly required in places like Pakistan with a high proportion of patients with advanced stages where there is little chance of cure. Thus there is a need to establish new palliative care facilities in the country, said Dr. Ashraf./Cancer affects everyone - the young and old, the rich and poor, men, women and children and represents a tremendous burden on families and societies. Cancer can be defined as the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. It can affect almost any part of the body. The growth often invades surrounding tissues and can metastasise to distant sites. Lung, stomach, liver, colon, prostate and breast cancer cause the most cancer deaths each year./Studies reveal that aging is the fundamental factor for the development of cancer. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age. More and more people around the world are exposed to cancer risk factors like smoking, poor diet and sedentary lifestyles./According to Dr. Ashraf, one possible promoter in food is fat, especially saturated fat from animal products like red meat. Tobacco use, pan, 'chalia', alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, exposure to occupational (for example asbestos) carcinogens, radiation (ultraviolet and ionising radiation, excessive X-Rays etc), low fruit and vegetable intake, excessive consumption of red and preserved meat, estrogens tablets, genetic factors, having unsafe sex, infections from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, human papiloma viruses, Helicobacter pylori, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels are major risk factors of cancer, he said./This year the theme of World Cancer Day is 'We can. I can.' World Cancer Day will explore how everyone- as a collective or as individuals-can do their part to reduce the global burden of cancer. Just as cancer affects everyone in different ways, all people have the power to take various actions to reduce the impact that cancer has on individuals, families and communities. World Cancer Day is a chance to reflect on what you can do, make a pledge and take action./To a query, Dr. Ashraf said at least one-third to 40 per cent of all cancer cases are preventable, mainly by not using tobacco, using healthy diet rich in fresh, green vegetables and fruits and being physically active (30 minutes daily walk), avoiding alcohol, narcotics, and most importantly obesity and preventing infections that may cause cancer./He added that prevention offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for the control of cancer. Vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus vaccination (HBV) will prevent cervical and liver cancer respectively, he said./He added that avoiding excessive exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation, use of sunscreen, wide-brimmed hats, large sunglasses, and protective clothing are effective preventive measures against skin cancer./If prevention fails, catch it early. Cancer's seven warning signals (CAUTION) are: change in bowel or bladder habit, a sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, thickening or lump in breast or elsewhere, indigestion or difficulty in swallowing, obvious change in wart or mole and nagging cough or hoarseness./Unfortunately in Pakistan, a large number of cancer patients present at an advanced stage due to lack of awareness, said Dr. Ashraf./About one-third of the cancer burden could be decreased if cases were detected and treated early. Some of the most common cancers - including breast, colorectal, oral cancer and cervical cancer - have high cure rates when detected early and treated. The aim is to detect cancer when it is localized, said Dr. Ashraf./Talking of prevention, he said educating and informing individuals and communities about the links between lifestyle and cancer risk is the first step in cancer prevention. Reducing tobacco use will significantly decrease the global burden of a large number of cancers. Individuals can limit their intake of red meat and avoid processed meat, he said./Special efforts are required to improve knowledge of cancer, counter misinformation and reduce stigma among all communities. Diagnosing cancer at its earlier stages and seeking timely care can save lives, concluded Dr. Ashraf."
"Climate change, environmental health risks becoming greater causes of death"," Climate change and environmental health risks associated with it are becoming greater causes of deaths around the globe claiming millions of lives every year for the last few years./Climate change is shifting patterns of disease causing extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, severe storms, droughts and fires while degradation of air quality is affecting food and water supplies and sanitation./According to estimates, well over 30 million deaths were caused by air pollution-related diseases in last five years around the globe making it the world's largest single environmental health risk./Millions of children are at risk of contracting deadlier diseases because of climate change including malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and malnutrition. Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry expressed this while talking to 'The News' on health threats becoming deadlier because of climate change./He said the heat waves, which have become more frequent, are causing more severe rashes, cramps, exhaustion and dehydration, which is common cause of hyperthermia and death among infants and young children./Experts say that over the years, human activities have greatly increased greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons, etc. The increase in quantity of greenhouse gas emissions has raised the temperature of the earth, the phenomenon commonly known as Global Warming./Human activities that produce greenhouse gases include increasing number of industrial processes, combustion of fossil fuels, emissions from power plants and vehicles. This effect has been made worse by cutting down trees and forests that help us by absorbing carbon dioxide./Dr. Ashraf said that Pakistan has a little role to play in global warming phenomenon yet it is one of the countries that are facing its adverse effects. Climate change carries no passport; emissions released anywhere contribute to the problem everywhere. It is threat to lives and livelihoods everywhere. Economic stability and the security of nations are under threat. Projected global temperature rise of approximately 3 degree Celsius by the end of century is expected, he said./He explained that the impact of droughts on agriculture is leading to malnutrition and under-nutrition, which is responsible for half of worldwide deaths of children under five years of age. He said implementing proven interventions to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, like black carbon and methane (Sui gas), for example achieving higher vehicle emissions and efficiency standards, would be expected to save approximately 2.4 million lives a year and reduce global warming by about 0.5 degree centigrade by 2050./Dr. Ashraf said that strengthening health resilience to climate risks, including measures such as early warning systems for more frequent and severe heat waves, and protection of water, sanitation, and hygiene services against floods and droughts, would ensure that recent progress against climate-sensitive diseases is not slowed or reversed./He suggested that shifting to cleaner energy sources and increase in use of public transport, walking and biking can benefit health. The sooner we act, the greater the benefits for all, he said./He added that for improving health, global warming issue should be our top priority. If we do not take preventive measures, this problem is bound to devastate Pakistan. Everybody can participate in the campaign against adverse effects of climate change by reducing the non-renewable sources of energy and increase use of renewable sources, he said./He said that one can identify ways to reduce energy use and improve health through walking, cycling, using public transport, better waste management and choosing products with smaller carbon impact. When buying new appliances not only fridges, but also washing machines and dishwashers etc., choose those with high energy ratings. Many of the steps needed to prevent climate change have positive health benefits. For example, increase use of bicycles/walking and public transport instead of personal cars and it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he added./He said it will also improve air quality and lead to better respiratory health and fewer premature deaths. The increase in physical activity will lead to less obesity and fewer obesity-related illnesses, said Dr. Ashraf."
Climate change greater cause of death," Climate change and environmental health risks associated with it are becoming greater causes of deaths around the globe claiming millions of lives every year for the last few years./Climate change is shifting patterns of disease causing extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, severe storms, droughts and fires while degradation of air quality is affecting food and water supplies and sanitation./According to estimates, well over 30 million deaths were caused by air pollution-related diseases in last five years around the globe making it the world's largest single environmental health risk./Millions of children are at risk of contracting deadlier diseases because of climate change including malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and malnutrition./Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry expressed this while talking to 'The News' on health threats becoming deadlier because of climate change."
Environmental risks take lives of 1.7m children every year: WHO," Every year, environmental risks such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, second-hand smoke, unsafe water, lack of sanitation, and inadequate hygiene take the lives of 1.7 million children under 5 years, reveal two new reports of the World Health Organisation (WHO)./Titled 'Inheriting a Sustainable World: Atlas on Children's Health and the Environment,' the first report reveals that a large portion of the most common causes of death among children aged 1 month to 5 years -- diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia -- are preventable by interventions known to reduce environmental risks, such as access to safe water and clean cooking fuels./The second report, which is titled 'Don't pollute my future! The impact of the environment on children's health,' provides an overview of the environment's impact on children's health, illustrating the scale of the challenge./According to this report, 570,000 children under 5 years die every year from respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution, and second-hand smoke; 361,000 children under 5 years die due to diarrhoea, as a result of poor access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene; 270,000 children die during their first month of life from conditions including prematurity, which could be prevented through access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene in health facilities as well as reducing air pollution; 200,000 deaths of children under 5 years from malaria could be prevented through environmental actions, such as reducing breeding sites of mosquitoes or covering drinking-water storage; and 200,000 children under 5 years die from unintentional injuries attributable to the environment, such as poisoning, falls, and drowning./Emerging environmental hazards such as electronic andelectrical waste (such as old mobile phones) that is improperly recycled, expose children to toxins which can lead to reduced intelligence, attention deficits, lung damage, and cancer. 'The generation of electronic and electrical waste is forecasted to increase by 19 per cent between 2014 and 2018, to 50 million metric tonnes by 2018,' the report stated./With climate change, temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide are rising, favouring pollen growth, which is associated with increased rates of asthma in children. Worldwide, 11-14% of children aged 5 years and older currently report asthma symptoms and an estimated 44% of these are related to environmental exposures. Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them, the reports emphasise./Reducing air pollution inside and outside households, improving safe water and sanitation and improving hygiene (including in health facilities where women give birth), protecting pregnant women from second-hand tobacco smoke, and building safer environments, can prevent children's deaths and diseases./Multiple government sectors can work together to improve the situation. The Housing Ministry, for instance, can ensure clean fuel for heating and cooking; schools can provide safe sanitation and hygiene, and promote good nutrition; health facilities can ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and reliable electricity; urban planners can create more green spaces, safe walking and cycling paths; the transportation ministry can reduce emissions; the agriculture ministry can reduce the use of hazardous pesticides; and the health sector can monitor health outcomes and educate about environmental health effects and prevention."
Price of pollution," What is the cost we are paying for the polluted environment we live in? According to the World Health Organisation, it is the lives of 1.7 million children every year. The organisation attributes one in four of these deaths to unhealthy environments. The factors include indoor and outdoor air pollution, second-hand smoke, unsafe water, poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene. All of these can be controlled by the reduction of environmental risks. The use of clean cooking fuels and safe drinking water are the simplest of the solutions. Air pollution is a much more difficult task but it has been managed in most developed countries. We know that children are among the most vulnerable to polluted environments. Harmful exposure can have an impact starting from the womb. Polluted environments also increase the risk of pneumonia and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. WHO reports have conclusively linked the top five causes for the death of children to environmental factors./There is a need to not only dispose of waste products in the right way, but to also reduce the amount of harmful waste that is produced. Improperly recycled electrical devices can also impair a child's development. It is reported that the amount of electronic waste is only scheduled to increase by 20 percent by 2018. Already, the world has understood the long-term damage that climate change will wreak on us and has pledged to fight it. The sheer number of children dying each year to avoidable causes confirms the need for similar agreements on everyday pollution - not just greenhouse gases. The use of pesticides has also polluted the water supply, which then makes its way into the food chain. The WHO asks governments to focus on creating safe household environments, ensuring the sanitisation of schools, creating more green spaces in cities, improving public transport and reducing the use of pesticides in agriculture. There is a need to stem the unnecessary loss of life of children. It is clear that our governments are paying scant attention. No official health figures pertaining to the recent smog that hit Punjab were announced. No emergency measures were announced. It seems that the government is glad it is over so that it can get on with its business without changing anything. This is not enough. We need to act now to protect our children."
Smoke on the Water," Though legal and regulatory framework for environmental control exists since long, the weak enforcement and ineffective management, compounded with high population growth, has not delivered results, and pollution and environmental degradation continues to grow with every passing day, impacting seriously on human health./Reports about polluted air, contaminated water and ongoing deforestation in major cities paint a gloomy picture and expose laxity on the part the institutions, lack of political commitment and insensitivity of the society to the issues./Pakistan therefore faces significant environmental challenges, at present and in future, particularly in the backdrop of the government's focus on developing coal-based power-generation, motorization, housing and infrastructure sectors, in particular the projects of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), but grossly neglecting the environmental governance. Every year, on April 7, the World Health Day, and, on June 5, the World Environment Day is observed in Pakistan, but without ever taking any concrete and effective measures to address the related issues./Pollution is the theme for 2017 United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA). In Pakistan, air pollution, water pollution and land pollution are the main causes for environmental pollution, which is costing over Rs 365 billion to national economy every year, according to official figures, and results in as many as 59,000 deaths annually./According to the Yale Environmental Performance Index 2016, Pakistan ranks 144 out of 180 countries. Pakistan's urban areas are, on average, the world's most polluted. World Health Organization (WHO) had, in 2015, listed Karachi at the 5th, Peshawar at the 6th and Rawalpindi at the 7th positions among the top twenty most-polluted cities the world over. Last November, Lahore had observed the worst smog in history, almost paralyzing the civic and trade activities for weeks./Sadly, environment has not been on the government's priority plans. A World Bank report 'Cleaning Pakistan's Air' published in 2014 had urged the government to make urban air quality improvement a priority in the national policy agenda, but to no avail. Today, Pakistan has become the fourth most air-polluted country, estimates the WHO./Lack of commitment from the government to tackle environment challenges is reflected in the fact that the share of expenditure on environment improvement remains hardly 0.04 per cent of total public sector development program in any year. Thus, the environmental plans, programs and projects are not adequately funded by the government./The current social and environmental indicators and other related figures are horrific and mind-boggling. Pakistan's carbon emissions are increasing manifold on year-on-year basis, currently estimated as 405 million tons that are projected to increase to 1,603 million tons by 2030. According to a recent report, over 27 million Pakistanis do not have access to clean drinking water, and some 40 million are deprived of sanitary facilities. Some 60,000 tons of solid waste is generated by urban population, whereas its disposal, collection and management system is poor, impoverished and inadequate. Total number of motor vehicles registered in the country is around ten million, and vehicular emissions account for almost 45 percent of pollution./Likewise, industrial pollutants are grossly responsible for widespread environmental degradation. Various industrial processes generate voluminous hazardous waste, chemical waste, toxic gaseous pollutants and other health-injurious emissions like smoke, dust and noise. Generally, industrial effluent including toxic waste is dumped and released to cleaner air or in water bodies without treatment, unchecked by the authorities or other stakeholders. The seawater of Karachi is considered the worst-affected because of the discharge of industrial waste from Korangi and Landhi industrial estates and Karachi Export Processing Zone. In the Korangi industrial area, about 3,500 industrial units, including 372 textile mills and 170 leather tanneries, dispose of untreated waste into the sea. Likewise, over 1,200 industrial units of steel, automobile, pharmaceuticals, refineries and engineering in Landhi pollute the atmosphere and seawater. Added to this environmental hazard are the significant oil-spills from ships and fishing trawlers transiting the seaports./Unfortunately, performance of the Ministry of Climate Change remains lackluster and leaves much to be desired. Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) has become a toothless organization, which has seen three chief executives (Director General) during the last three years, whereas three critical posts (out of total 12 posts), including Director and Deputy Director both of Legal  and  Enforcement Department, are vacant since long. It has failed to enforce PEPA-1997 rules and regulations, and its activities are simply focused to monitoring the baseline conditions of ambient air quality and implementation of energy-efficiency related projects. And so is the case with EPA Punjab, Sindh EPA, EPA Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, EPA Balochistan, AJK EPA and Gilgit-Baltistan EPA, as none of these agencies cover industrial, mining and infrastructure sectors, effectively and comprehensively./In compliance with the environmental protection act 1997, it is mandatory for the sponsors of all development projects, in any economic sector, to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA) study along with project feasibility study, and accordingly propose and implement mitigation and remedial measures to ensure clean environment. The apathetic attitude of a host of EPAs towards complying with the environmental rules and law on the part of project sponsors is symbolized in the case of CPEC power projects such as Sahiwal 1,320-MW coal-fired power plant and Port Qasim 1,320-MW coal-fired power project, and Lahore Orange Line Metro Train project. The EIA reports of these mega projects were cleared rather in haste by the provincial EPAs, whereas these reports lacked the essential details as well as public hearing required under the law."
We are running out of time," One of the most important advances in academic work in recent years has been the focus on ecology as a social, economic and political category. Society is no longer viewed as a set of complementary and conflictual relations between human beings. Social theory now acknowledges the material basis provided by nature as central to all human labour./Nature is no longer regarded as a serene background to be appreciated or intervened upon. Its entanglement with social production means that it is inextricably linked to the formation of society, and ultimately, to the production of life itself./This new 'ecological consciousness' has emerged as a result of the direct assault on the ecosystem by human activity, threatening to obliterate many species, including ourselves. Scientists are calling this a new geological age, 'the Anthropocene', in which human activity is transforming the very coordinates of life on the planet. It has deprived almost a billion people from access to safe drinking water globally, whereas air pollution and smog are becoming central features of modern urban life./If the contamination of the basic ingredients of human life were not enough to force a rethinking of our relationship to nature, then climate change - with its capacity to end society as we know it - should induce a thorough, collective introspection on where we are headed./Our planet is warming due to the emission of greenhouses gases like CO2 and methane gas into the atmosphere - primarily through industrial activities and agriculture - as well as dirty energy production. The warming temperatures have a number of deadly consequences, in particular rising sea-levels and changing rain patterns - which could result in unprecedented floods and the destruction of agriculture systems, respectively. What is bizarre is that our fossil fuel-driven global economy, with its insatiable desire for energy, is at the root of the ecological crisis. Why would we simply not transition to a green economy, instead of heading towards collective suicide?/John Bellamy Foster, one of the pivotal figures in political ecology today, argues against blaming the general category of 'human activity' for climate change and instead posits capitalism, with its particular organisation of social labour and resources, as the key to understanding the ecological crisis./Foster explains how the basis of capitalist production is a drive for profit, rather than one to meet basic human needs. The system presupposes endless growth as the only viable option for the economy, regardless of its consequences for society. For example, the growing homelessness in the major cities of the developed world has gone hand in hand with an exponential rise in empty apartments. For someone from another planet, this would appear as the most irrational and inefficient use of resources, if not outright cruelty. Yet, from the perspective of the capitalist system, allocation of resources to those in need is subordinated to the efficient procurement of profits, even if it means abandoning millions to homelessness - and in the case of famines - to starvation./This also implies that to remain part of the system, producers need to constantly secure markets for their products, even if the products are neither essential nor desired by the populace. The marketing industry worth trillions of dollars is today geared less towards informing the public of the choices available in the marketplace, and more towards manufacturing desire for certain products. The fusion of neurosciences and psychoanalysis with the marketing industry since the 1950s, with its attempts to occupy the deepest recesses of the human mind, is perhaps one of the most understudied and sinister aspects of this unending thirst for profits./Foster depicts the capitalist system as a 'treadmill of production', where competitors must keep on running, even accelerating, to maintain a place on the treadmill. The result is that 'negative externalities' remain a marginal problem, since the very logic of the system does not allow a focused debate on reorienting the relations of production if it creates obstacles in the pursuit of profit. For this reason, the fossil fuel industry, which has trillions of dollars at stake in the current energy regime, is able to lobby governments around the world to prevent the rapid transition to renewable sources needed to reduce GHG emissions./The result is that leaders of Western governments continue to shed crocodile tears for the expected victims of climate change while continuing to provide tax breaks and new infrastructure to the fossil fuel industry./We must remember that these are not 'first world' problems, as so many apologists of the energy lobby in Pakistan claim. In fact, the crises related to ecology have an uneven impact across the geographical space, with developing countries like ours most vulnerable to the effects of environmental degradation. For example, 84 percent of Pakistan's water is now contaminated, resulting in an astonishingly high number of Pakistanis (40 percent) dying of water-borne diseases. The economic costs of the water crisis (as well as air pollution) are alarming also because all projections of Pakistan's economic potential are based on the presence of a healthy workforce, something that is becoming increasingly unsustainable due to the degrading living conditions of a majority of the populace and a crumbling healthcare infrastructure./Furthermore, Pakistan is the seventh most vulnerable country to climate change - according to the Global Climate Change Index - and is predicted to lose $3.8 billion in the long-term. Apart from the destruction caused to our agriculture with its implications for food security in the midst of a rapidly growing population, the rising sea-levels pose an existential threat to the country's financial backbone, Karachi. The threat to Karachi, which is predicted to be under water by 2060, and its consequences for the entire region's geopolitics are so severe that in 2016 Foreign Policy magazine declared climate change as a much bigger threat to Pakistan's security than even terrorism./Yet, the country's leadership and intelligentsia pretend that it is business-as-usual, while ignoring this elephant in the room. How else can one explain the billions being spent to build 'world class' infrastructure in Lahore by diverting resources from the social sectors, including water sanitation, from the rest of Punjab? Or the construction of a train line that almost all experts agree will be an environmental catastrophe, substantially increasing the health costs in the city? Even more infuriating is the mad rush for coal in Pakistan, at a moment when the world is transitioning away from its use, and when it is a major contributor to climate change as well as source of pollution for our air and water./The latest example is of the coal mining in Thar, which is currently destroying the livelihoods and water resources of the region - not to mention contributing to climate change. Local activists have termed the Thar Coal Project as the beginning of 'coal cruelty' in Sindh -especially since Almas, a Sindhi poet, has been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for campaigning against the construction of pipelines in the region. The entanglement of mass destruction of livelihoods and authoritarianism is a dystopian future we all hoped would remain confined to popular cinema. It might now be turning into a reality within our present./Karl Marx explained how capitalism alienates humans from the labour they undertake. Today, we are not only alienated from work and from each other, but from the very conditions of life on the planet, helplessly witnessing the spectacle of our demise. By articulating a common vision of humanity and a new model of development, in which production and distribution takes place for meeting human needs rather than unbridled profit, we must demonstrate that the human adventure is not as yet exhausted. But we are running out of time./Email: /<a href=""mailto:ammarjan86@gmail.com"">ammarjan86@gmail.com</a>"
Environmental pollution," One of the biggest problems that the world is facing is environmental pollution. This includes air, water, soil and noise pollution. Water and air pollution are the most harmful for our environment. In Pakistan, factories are set up in residential areas. The smoke emitted from these factories pollutes the environment. In addition to this, the large number of vehicles on streets has further contributed to air pollution. The government needs to take immediate action to tackle the situation. The country has already witnessed the adverse effects of environmental pollution. Last year, the smog in Punjab created chaos. If proper steps are taken, air pollution can be reduced. No industry or a factory should be set up in a residential area. The number of vehicles on streets can be decreased, if the public transport system is well-developed./In the same way, steps should be taken to reduce water pollution. It is common practice among industries to release industrial leftovers into the sea. These leftovers contain harmful chemicals. Another cause of water pollution is dumping of garbage in the sea. Debris, including plastic, food and glass, that take hundreds and thousands of years to decompose, pollutes the water. In fact, the marine life consumes the debris believing it is food. The government should take serious measures to control environmental problems. The media should create awareness among the people about the effects of environmental pollution."
'Number of asthma patients increasing in Pakistan'," The number of asthma patients is increasing. Delay in treatment and diagnoses leads the patient to death. More than 300 million people are affected by it./These views were expressed by the speakers at a seminar on 'Clean Air, Breath Easy' jointly organised by Pakistan Chest Society Punjab, High Noon Labortreis and Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman Memorial Society (Jang Group of Newspapers)./The speakers were Dr Muhammad Asharf Jamal, head of Pumonology, Alama Iqbal Medical College and Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, Dr Kamran, head of Pumonology, Services Institute of Medical Sciences and Services Hospital, Dr Saulat Ullah Khan, Dr Khalid Waheed, head of Pulmonology, PGMI, Lahore./Dr Muhammad Asharf Jamal said prevention was better than cure. He said people should avoid allergic things and medicines that caused asthma. He said asthma stopped growth of height of children. The disease should be cured at the initial stage, he added./Dr Kamran said people did not pay heed to long-term cure. He said asthma could be controlled by long-term cure. Moreover, patients of asthma can live normal life and take part in activities of routine life./Dr Saulat Ullah Khan said that no one could get rid of the disease on permanent basis without continuous and complete cure. The patients should have contact with doctor. It is not necessary that the children of asthma parents would also suffer from it, he added./Dr Khalid Waheed said asthma could attack at any age. It should be controlled, otherwise, the patient's veins which inhale oxygen can be swollen, and during coughing, the patient's voice would sound like whistle. People should not feel shame if they are patients of asthma, he said./Health, education and current affairs senior editor of daily Jang Wasif Nagi said the ratio of asthma patients had increased because of air pollution. The ratio of patients can increase further in the coming years if air pollution is not controlled, he added."
Save the environment," Karachi is facing the following three environmental issues; lack of management of garbage. air pollution and contaminated water. The management of garbage is the most important issue, which requires the immediate attention of the authorities, since the non disposal of garbage doesn't only cause air pollution, but contaminates the water available for drinking purpose. To address these issues, we need to create awareness among people about the 'rescue, recycle and reuse' concept. People should be encouraged to use environment-friendly and biodegradable products. The excessive use of pesticides and fertilisers in plants should be reduced./Air pollution is mainly caused by transport and industries. The alarming effects of air pollution are respiratory and heart-related diseases, acid rain, adverse effects on the wild life and the depletion of the ozone. The following measures can be taken to reduce air pollution. Encourage people to use public transport to reduce the heavy flow of traffic on streets. People should use the car pooling service to save energy and money. Energy should be conserved by switching off unnecessary lights. The government and all quarters should concentrate on promoting clean energy resources like solar, wind and geothermal energy. Use energy efficient devices like CFL lights which consume less electricity and result in lower electricity bills. These also help reduce pollution and consuming less energy. It is also important that the media plays its role in creating awareness among people."
Air pollution," Air pollution poses a great threat since it damages the ozone layer. It is caused by smoke emitted from automobiles, industries, factories, refrigerants, etc. Air pollution has adverse effects on the environment. It also causes a number of respiratory diseases./It is the responsibility of the people to play their part in minimising air pollution. Public transport should be used to travel short distances. The excessive use of ACs and other cooling products should be discouraged. Our collective efforts can help minimise air pollution."
From waste to energy," After moving to Lahore from the US, one of the most disturbing sights I regularly witnessed were the plumes of smoke billowing from heaps of trash piled along the roadsides./The practice of burning trash to get rid of waste seems to be ingrained in the national psyche. No amount of education, cajoling or pleading on my part has convinced the neighbours' gardeners or the local employees of the horticulture department about the damaging impact of their actions on our health and environment./Although a vigorous waste management programme has been introduced by the Punjab government, the lack of public awareness and weak implementation of the initiative resulted last year in the worst smog that the city of Lahore has witnessed./Respiratory illnesses are on the rise, with lower respiratory infections accounting for eight percent of deaths nationwide. On a recent visit to Karachi, I was appalled to see that the situation is far more acute, with much of the city bearing an uncanny resemblance to a dump yard. As the population continues to rise at a steady pace, the amount of trash that we are producing seems to be increasing exponentially./At the same time, Pakistan is also facing another crisis in the form of an acute energy shortage. The federal government's promises of ending loadshedding by 2017 have turned out to be hollow as several rural areas face up to 15 hours of loadshedding during Ramazan./A variety of solutions have been propounded in recent years to resolve these problems. These solutions include exploring alternative sources of energy - such as wind and solar power - and handing over the contract for waste management in Karachi to a Chinese company. However, each of these options has their own limitations - financial or otherwise./After trying various conventional approaches, it is time to think outside the box. There is a simple solution to these problems: the use of waste-to-energy (WTE) technology. The basic idea behind this revolutionary concept is that trash collected from various parts of the city is burnt to generate heat and the resulting steam is used to turn turbines and generate electricity. Three tonnes of trash can produce as much energy as one tonne of fuel and 99 percent of the smoke emitted is non-toxic./WTE plants can not only resolve the problem of trash disposal, but also provide a cheap local source of energy generation. Compared to the use of fossil fuels for producing electricity, WTE plants can considerably reduce our import bill. Moreover, they are considered to be much more environmentally-friendly. After ignoring the emissions that are carbon-neutral and those which would have been given off in any case if the trash was to remain in landfills, the carbon dioxide given off is less than half of the amount released from producing the same amount of energy through burning coal./Sweden is one of the countries that are using WTE technology to its maximum advantage. Only one percent of its trash ends up in landfills. In fact, the demand is so high that Sweden is importing trash from other countries./China has also made plans to develop more than 300 WTE plants - including the largest of its kind in the world. In the backdrop of CPEC, a Pakistan-Chinese collaboration on WTE plants can be considered, with China providing assistance with funding and technical know-how./According to a World Bank report released in 2014 - titled 'Cleaning Pakistan's Air' -'Pakistan's urban air pollution is among the most severe in the world and it engenders significant damage to human health and the economy'. Instances of mortality related to air pollution exceed even those caused by traffic-related deaths. It is the need of the hour for the government to address the escalating health crisis. Setting up WTE plants is, no doubt, an expensive proposition. But, by the same token, constructing landfills in a country with an ever-increasing population also poses a major challenge./Using WTE technology can potentially reduce our landfill volume by up to 90 percent. If materials such as kitchen refuse and biowaste are used as fuel, the amount of carbon emissions can be reduced significantly. In terms of solving our pollution problem, waste-to-energy is admittedly not a zero-waste method. Instead, it provides a useful starting point for a country like Pakistan that continues to neglect its environment./Email: /<a href=""mailto:shadowdragon2020@gmail.com"">shadowdragon2020@gmail.com</a>"
PHC orders closure of KTH incinerator after EPA report," The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has directed the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) management to close incinerator till the next order after receiving Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s report that it was creating air pollution./A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Abdul Shakoor passed the direction after receiving report from the EPA about the steps taken by the hospitals for disposal of medical waste. On the previous hearing, the court had directed the EPA Director General, Dr Bashir Khan, to inspect all the government and private hospitals of the provincial metropolis and submit a detailed report about the steps taken for disposal of the waste./On Friday, the EPA chief submitted the report about the hospitals in the court. He submitted that the incinerators of the KTH and Rehman Medical Institution (RMI) were working in the worst condition as they were creating black smoke causing dangerous air pollution./The director general informed the court that he had sent several letters after inspecting the incinerators for closing it and installing other incinerators for hospitals waste disposal. He said he had also issued letters to Peshawar deputy commissioner to close down the incinerators of these hospitals, but no action was taken to date./However, in the report, it was stated that Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) procedure for disposal of waste was the best and the incinerator was working well. About the status of Lady Reading Hospital and North-West General Hospital, it was stated that their incinerators were normal but were asked to improve their position in the disposal of hospital waste./On the request of the KTH lawyer, Khalid Rehman, the court asked the PDA director general to again inspect the hospital incinerator and submit fresh report about it. However, the court again asked representatives of the hospitals of the province to install incinerators and fulfill all requirements for disposal of hospitals waste or else they would be proceeded against./On the previous hearing, Dr Ayub Roz from Health Department had submitted that the waste was being disposed of in the district headquarters and the system would be improved if it was found not working properly. However, he informed the court that the department would not be responsible for the private hospitals on this issue as they had to dispose of own waste./The court was hearing a writ petition filed by a Peshawar-based high court lawyer, Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel, seeking court directions for safe disposal of the waste of the government and private hospitals and doctors' clinics. The petitioner requested the court to direct the respondents to follow Standard Operating Procedures provided in the law and submit the waste management plan."
Guilt trip," Once a jewel in the crown of Kaghan Valley, Lake Saiful Malook has suffered immensely at the hands of unruly tourists and opposing clans who claim the ownership of the lake during the summer season to earn revenue. Although the feud of the opposing clans was settled through some settlement, littering and garbage disposal is still a pressing issue at the popular tourist spot. The lack of maintenance has robbed the lake of its beauty. The emerald green alpine grass and the flora that once blazed the perimeters of the lake have now perished without a trace. The air that once surrounded the lake used to be pure and clean. Now, a battalion of outdated diesel jeeps that are used to deliver tourists to lake emit grey smoke has contributed significant to air pollution./Groups of tourists swarm the lake with little or no regard for the cleanliness and preservation of the environment. A quick glance at the lake is enough to show all the waste that has accumulated over the years, especially since the rise of the tourism industry in Pakistan. The lake is a spectacle of deplorable tourist management and total unawareness and disregard for nature on the part of the government. It is time the concerned authorities implemented an organised administrative plan and restore the sight to its original state."
Reluctance to change," Now that the dust has finally settled over the Panama case verdict, we're perhaps in a better position to turn towards less urgent problems that we are facing. These include pollution, floods and the health issues that result from these problems./After watching the nerve-racking Panama case media coverage, it's simply refreshing to realise that we can now move - albeit momentarily - from the political to the not-so-political./But the poisonous dust that literally suspends in the air above our heads doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. The only hope is that somewhere, someone is thinking about it and thus setting an example for others to follow./While we were busy in our sacred duty of cleansing our political landscape from the pollution of corruption and deceit, people in some parts of the world are sweating their guts out to contain the levels of pollution in the environment./The UK is going to set an example for others to follow. To reduce nitrogen oxide (NO2) emissions in the environment, the UK government has recently announced that it will ban the sale of all petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040. This is, indeed, an ambitious target that has been contested mainly by their automobile industry and other stakeholders. But someone rightly said that it is still more important to set a target than fear whether a target could be achieved./One may ask why such an isolated endeavour to contain air pollution by a country of the developed world would matter to a developing country like ours. What's wrong with breathing poisonous air? Who complains of respiratory diseases? What's good in knowing the effects of a polluted environment on our mind and body and how they can be treated?/After all these years, rather decades, of running awareness campaigns about the deteriorating environment by climate change experts, journalists, and volunteers around the world - including our own country - one can hope that we value the centrality of a clean environment to a healthy life. At least we know today that mankind is living under one roof on a shared earth separated only by mountains and seas. So, what's our plan of action against a problem that we have created for ourselves?/The first question could be: are we Pakistanis ready to ask questions? Do we have a transparent mechanism to collect information about our environment? Do we have statistics in the first place? Do we have access to information on environment issues? Is there any plan of action at the government level to save our climate? Why is there such an alarmingly high level of apathy towards a matter of life and death?/While the combined efforts of the developed and the developing world at various forums give us some hope, the role of individual countries is no less significant. Questions about what we are doing as Pakistanis to bring down the levels of pollution in our environment is not difficult to answer: not much./This brings us to some critical environmental issues facing our country today that are linked to each other and ultimately translate into health hazards: the use of coal in producing energy, for example, produces industrial waste and contaminates drinking water. While the rest of the world - including China - is washing its hands off coal, we have no qualms about the plans to produce energy from coal./This is happening at a time when the situation is already not reassuring. Understandably, a report by the World Bank in 2014, titled 'Cleaning Pakistan's Air', states that Pakistan's urban air pollution 'is among the most severe in the world and it engenders significant damage to human health and the economy'./There's another way of looking at the issue: from the bottom. The traffic warden looking the other way while a vehicle or a rickshaw whizzes past him and billows thick clouds of smoke is equally complicit in adding to the pollution. When a government official, who is responsible for keeping an eye on the industrial waste and ensuring whether it has been treated or not, blindly accepts the version of the industry's owner, he or she is also a partner-in-crime./While the urban areas are engulfed by polluted air, rural areas are inundated by severe floods every year around this time - a stark manifestation that we are not treating nature gently and are being paid in the same coin./Flashfloods have claimed scores of lives during the last few years - such as in 2010 - due to the absence of an efficient and effective flood warning system. Experts say unchecked deforestation in Pakistan has also added to our vulnerability to floods./The situation leads us to a point where we cannot escape environmental degradation. We need an efficient system to be put in place. But how will things change? How will our approach to tackle critical issues change? At the moment, the signs do not appear to be positive./On the economic front, Pakistan's GSP Plus status to access the European markets is under the watchful eye of the EU over the implementation of seven conventions on environment out of 27 international conventions. Obviously, in today's world, a country's economy is so deeply dependent on its commitment to international environmental commitments. /There is so much more to be done. After the passage of the 18th Amendment, among other things, the provincial governments should be capable of facing the challenge of climate change. Then why is there so much reluctance?/The writer works at The News on Sunday./Email: /<a href=""mailto:athernaqvi@gmail.com"">athernaqvi@gmail.com</a>"
Pollution in the air," It is an undeniable fact that air pollution poses serious threats to the health of humans and other living beings. Vehicles exhaust fumes contribute immensely to air pollution in major cities. Air pollution also generates several diseases, including cancer and respiratory diseases. It also causes irritation in lungs, throat, nose and eyes. According to experts, frequent exposure to air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. People who exercise outdoors are vulnerable to the adverse effects of air pollution. Partly due to our actions, the ozone layer is damaged. This explains why the earth is witnessing a rise in global warming./With the development in the field of science and technology, we have become so dependent that we are unaware of the risks that hover over us. The people, in collaboration with governmental organisations, should avoid polluting the environment. Awareness campaigns should be launched to educate people about the irreversible consequences of air pollution. Before it is too late, let's take an oath to do our best in building a clean environment."
Garbage crisis," People love to keep their homes clean, but they don't think twice before polluting the city. People do not want heaps of garbage scattered in their homes so they take the trash out and dump it carelessly on streets. The improper disposal of garbage is the main reason for the persistent garbage crisis. Several other diseases including malaria, typhoid and various infectious diseases are caused by unattended heaps of garbage./In our country, one can easily observe the overflowing bins and heaps of garbage beside the roads and in markets. They are an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. On the other hand, exposure to hazardous waste can affect human health. A good example of city suffering from unhygienic condition was Surat in India, where a pneumonic plague epidemic broke out in 1994, leading to the death of 52./Disposing and dumping garbage carelessly not only contributes to land pollution, but also adds to air pollution. The harmful gases produced when garbage is burnt pollute the environment. This form of pollution is the main reason for bacterial diseases. The key solution to garbage pollution lies in proper management of solid waste. Awareness campaigns should be conducted regarding the hazards of garbage pollution and its adverse impacts on health and environment. The concerned authorities should ensure that the people responsible for cleaning the city are performing their duty honestly."
LWMC to launch new project for hospital waste disposal," To control illegal recycling of infectious hospital waste, Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) is going to launch a comprehensive IT-based storage, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal system of infectious waste from health care units of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare units and private healthcare units./Figures collected by LWMC revealed that total infectious waste generated in Lahore, including all healthcare units of SHC and ME Department, P and S health department and private sector is 17,537 kg per day. The LWMC officials said the project ultimately aims at improving overall existing situation of Hospital Waste Management System in tertiary care hospitals, healthcare units of Primary  and  Secondary Health Department as well as private healthcare units by providing state-of-the-art infectious waste treatment facility along with awareness and training to implement Punjab Hospital Waste Management Rules 2014 for preventing the environment and the public health in most feasible manners./Figures revealed that with a capacity of 1,500 beds, Jinnah Hospital is generating 1,287 per kg infectious waste per day, Mayo Hospital with 2,081 beds generates 1,733 per kg infectious waste per day, Services Hospital has 1,196 beds and its daily waste generation is 1,336 kg./With 1,000 beds, Lahore General Hospital generates 1,105kg infectious waste daily, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has 862 beds and its daily generation of infectious waste is 814kg, Punjab Institute of Cardiology has 347 beds and it daily generates 321kg infectious waste and Children Hospital  and  Inst. of Child Health has 684 beds and it generates 444kg infectious waste, figures revealed./Mian Munshi DHQ-1 Teaching Hospital has 149 beds and it generates 563 per kg infectious waste per day, Lady Aitchison Hospital with 200 beds generates 168 per kg infectious waste per day, Government Shahdara Hospital has 300 beds and it generates 586kg infectious waste daily, Government Muhammad Nawaz Sharif Hospital has 200 beds and it generates 425kg infectious waste daily, Lady Willingdon Hospital has 235 beds and it generates 157kg infectious waste daily./Figures disclosed that the 100-bed Said Mitha Hospital generates 247kg infectious waste daily, Government Kot Khawaja Saeed Teaching Hospital has 150 beds and it generates 564kg infectious waste daily, Government Mozang Teaching Hospital has 100 beds and it generates 247kg infectious waste daily, Punjab Institute of Mental Health has 1,400 beds and it generates 751kg infectious waste daily and Punjab Dental Hospital with 30 beds it generates 36kg infectious waste daily./Figures also suggested that there are 199 major private hospitals in Lahore having approximately 10,584 beds. It can be evaluated that 5,477kg infectious waste is estimated to be generated on daily basis, figures revealed and added that there are around about 58 major laboratories in Lahore and the average daily infectious waste generation at each of these labs is about 7.5kg/lab producing a total of about 435kg per day./There are about 1,096 beds of all Basic Health Units/ dispensaries/ hospitals in Lahore under Primary  and  Secondary Healthcare Department and it is estimated that infectious waste generation is about 340kg/day./Besides this, infectious waste is also generated in the consulting clinics, maternity homes, dispensaries, veterinary hospitals of Lahore and no authentic data about their numbers and the daily waste generation is available. It is roughly estimated that about 500kg/day infectious waste generates on daily basis from consulting clinics, maternity homes, dispensaries and veterinary hospitals. So, it is estimated that total infectious waste generation rate from private healthcare units of Lahore is about 6,500kg/day./Sources in LWMC revealed that majority of untreated infectious waste was going to plastic recycling units, where it is turned into plastic granule, which was used in manufacturing of various plastic items, including baby feeders, toys, plastic furniture, plates, dishes and etc./They said infectious waste, if disposed of along with municipal waste, ultimately makes all municipal waste as infectious, consequently the volume of the infectious waste increases which may be the source of spreading infectious diseases./This waste if treated inappropriately may cause adverse environmental impacts such as air pollution, soil contamination, underground water contamination and spread of infection in food chain, spread of contagious diseases e.g. Hepatitis-C, AIDS etc, said Rehan Paracha, a senior official of LWMC./He said the major objectives of the new project are IT-based storage, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal system of the infectious waste from healthcare units of primary, secondary  and  tertiary healthcare units and private healthcare units. He said repair, operation and maintenance of the incinerator installed at Children's Hospital, Lahore, is also a part of this project while installation of three autoclaves having treatment capacity of 05ton/day each will be constructed soon. LWMC will also organise capacity building training and awareness programmes under this project and will ensure safe burial of treated/untreated infectious waste./Paracha said the project will cover all aspects of healthcare waste management starting from central storage facilities until its final disposal. He said construction of central storage facilities named as Yellow Rooms for infectious waste storage for Tertiary Care Hospitals is part of this project and land identification has already been done./The project has been proposed to mitigate/overcome the environmental problems associated with open dumping or inappropriate treatment of infectious waste, Paracha said and concluded that the project will be completed during current financial year 2017-18."
Govt yet to bridle smog-related risk,"Thick smog continues to engulf the provincial metropolis causing serious health hazards whereas the Punjab government has failed to introduce any short-term radical measures to bring the situation under control./For the past several years, the phenomenon of smog started to appear and there are many reasons behind it, which included execution of mega projects, cutting of trees, increase in vehicular and industrial pollution and etc. Despite the visible deterioration of air quality, the Punjab government is going to establish coal power projects, which will increase air pollution. However, there has not been a single official description of the root cause of this health hazard or any policy intervention to take any short-term or long-term measures to solve this problem. Environmental experts said international practices of short-term solutions for such environmental issues included banning of all kind of vehicular movement at points of concentration, closing down smoke-emitting industrial units and educating farmers and garbage disposal companies to stop burning./Experts believed that Environmental Protection Department (EPD), Punjab which is supposed to handle environmental issues in the province, did nothing except to issue NOCs for government's mega projects without considering their environmental impacts over the period of time./The seriousness of the Punjab government towards environmental protection can be gauged from the fact that in 2008-09, the annual development budget for environment protection was Rs1 billion; in 2009-10, the budget was cut down to Rs500 million, in 2010-11, it was further reduced to Rs335 million, in 2011-12, it was Rs350 million and in 2012-13, it remained Rs350 million. During the year 2013-14, the budgetary allocations for environment were further slashed to Rs164 million while in 2014-15, it was revised a little and increased to Rs190 million; in 2015-16, it was further slashed to Rs50 million and in 2017-18, it was raised to Rs540 million./A recent report of World Health Organisation stated that 30 most polluted cities of the world also included Lahore, Rawalpindi and Peshawar while other cities are Zabol (Iran), Allahabad (India), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), Al Jubail (Saudi Arabia), Patna (India), Raipur (India), Bamenda (Cameroon), Xingtai (China), Baoding (China), Delhi (India), Ludhiana (India), Dammam (Saudi Arabia), Shijiazhuang (China), Shijiazhuang (China), Kanpur (India), Khanna (India), Firozabad (India), Lucknow (India), Handan (China), Amritsar (India), Mandi Gobindgarh (India), Hengshui (China), Narayangong (Bangladesh), Bushehr (Iran), Agra (India), Kampala (Uganda), Tangshan (China) and Jodhpur (India)./The report said the air in the above-mentioned cities contains high levels of dangerous particulate matter, small enough to enter the human bloodstream through the lungs-a problem that contributes to an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year./Provincial Minister for Environment Zakiya Shahnawaz while talking with The News said the Punjab government is very serious in improving air quality in the province and for this several measures have been taken. She said recently over 150 industrial units were closed down while over 10,000 smoke-emitting vehicles were fined and many were impounded. Over a question that the Punjab government is going for coal power projects, she said state-of-the-art technology was introduced in those projects and all international standards were followed./The minister said the poisonous effects present in the recent smog were reduced and it will gradually eliminate with one rain. She said the government has improved city life through development projects. Over a question of reducing budget for environment, she said the government has agreed to provide huge funds to the department for various projects."
Dusty and toxicair poses serioushealth hazards," Dry and cold air having high pollution level is causing spread of a number of seasonal ailments including colds, flu, throat infection and other respiratory tract infections along with posing serious health threats to asthmatics and other chronic patients almost all across the Punjab province./In thickly populated cities of the Punjab province including Rawalpindi, the health threats have already taken shape of epidemic while population in cities having greater number of industrial units like Lahore has been worst hit by dusty and toxic air./The temperature has already started falling to a significant level in this region of the country and the winter season is about to set in however, there has not been rain for weeks due to which the atmosphere is filled with toxic dust./The number of patients reaching allied hospitals and private healthcare facilities in town with colds, sore throat, cough, and flu is continuously on the rise. Many health experts are of the view that individuals, in the existing conditions, must have to take extra care to avoid damages that the dust and chemicals in the air can cause./It is important that at the time of setting in of winter, immediate rain as well as heavy wind is needed to cleanse the air quality, which is engulfed by dusty clouds, toxic metals and vapours containing a number of harmful chemicals./Experts are of the opinion that apart from dust in the air, vehicles and industrial units are major source of air pollution and it is imperative to take precautions in order to minimize their effect./The concerned government authorities have been doing almost nothing to control the increasing pollution level in the air. The infections including colds, sore throat, cough and flu are highly contagious, passed by tiny droplets produced during sneezing, coughing of infected persons and touching things with hands and tissues that others touch./Experts suggest that in the existing situation one should stay home and should not go outside unnecessarily as the air is filled with countless harmful chemicals. Also one should cut down late night activities and vigorous exercise for a few days and should avoid second hand smoke./Doctors suggest that one should drink plenty of fluids, at least eight to 10 glasses of water per day and fruit juices preferably lemonade to minimize the harmful effects of poisonous dust in the air because fluids help loosen mucus./Drink hot tea or water with lemon and honey and take chicken soup as these can help loosen the mucus, said Senior Registrar at Holy Family Hospital Dr. Zahid Minhas while talking to 'The News' on Sunday. Gargle with warm saline water a few times a day to minimize the bad effects of dusty air and use cough lozenges or cough syrup if needed to quite a dry cough, he said."
Smog crosses global benchmarks," Smog in the provincial capital has crossed all the international benchmarks as PM2.5 level, which is termed the most dangerous pollutant in the air across the world, remained between 450ug/m3 and 500ug/m3 against the notified standards of 35ug/m3 per day./As per World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, the daily average level of PM2.5 should not be more than 10ug/m3 and aggregated annual mean 25ug/m3 in a day whereas as per a gazette notification of the Punjab government, the daily limit of PM2.5 is 15ug/m3 and aggregated annual mean 35ug/m3 per day./It is pertinent to mention that Environmental Protection Department (EPD) is concealing data about air quality and pollutants present in it whereas the above-mentioned scary data was revealed by air monitoring laboratories established by private sector./As per Section 6 (O) of Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997, the department is bound to 'provide information and guidance to the public about environmental matters,' but for the past several years EPD had not released any kind of data about different kinds of pollution, especially air quality, in the provincial metropolis as well as rest of the Punjab./Around 2004-05, EPD had installed digital screens at various points of the city where levels of air pollutants were displayed while data about air pollutants was also released to media on a daily basis but after sometime they suddenly removed those digital screens and stopped issuance of data to media. Since then, data about pollution was kept in lock and key and no one was allowed to share it with anyone./According to Section 6 (d) of Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997, the department should have published Punjab Environment Report on an annual basis to describe the state of the environment but ironically this report was not issued in the year 2016 as well as no homework has so far been done to issue this report in the present year./Abid Omar, founder of Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, a Karachi-based organisation, said his company has installed two ambient air quality monitors in Lahore, one in the Lahore Cantt near airport and the other one on Upper Mall. 'For the past one week, level of PM2.5 in Lahore remained between 450 and 500ug/m3, which is considered to be extraordinary high and needs a state of emergency to handle this situation, 'he claimed. Pakistan Air Quality Initiative provides community-driven air quality reports to increase social awareness, he said, adding he himself is monitoring the situation and ambient air quality of Lahore is made public on twitter after every hour with a hash tag of #LahoreSmog for the information of the general public./Aleem Butt, owner of a private environmental testing laboratory in Lahore, said he had tested the air quality of Lahore on October 31, 2017, and the results were shocking. He said as per the report, the average level of PM2.5 was 211.78ug/m3. He said his testing machine was the same as of EPD but he can't test ambient air quality on a daily basis because of its high cost. 'It is the statutory duty of EPD to test and notify results of ambient air,' he maintained./As per WHO's report, 98 percent of cities in low- and middle income countries with more than 100,000 inhabitants do not meet WHO air quality guidelines. As urban air quality declines, the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma, increases for the people who live in these polluted cities, the report warned./Dr Tariq Chishti, a family physician, said air pollution is a major cause of disease and death. He said PM2.5 includes pollutants such as sulfate, nitrate and black carbon that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, posing a greater risk to human health. He said it is crucial for the city and governments to make urban air quality a health and development priority because when air quality improves, health cost from air pollution-related diseases shrinks, worker productivity expands and life expectancy grows. Environmental experts said if such a situation had happened in any developed country, they should have declared a national emergency. Rafy Alam, an environmental expert, said the government needs to take immediate and radical short-term solutions, including closing of schools, banning of all kinds of vehicular movement at points of concentration, closing down smoke-emitting industrial units and educating farmers and garbage disposal companies on hazards of trash burning./When contacted, Provincial Minister for Environment Zakiya Shahnawaz admitted the fact that EPD lacks on various counts. She, however, didn't give any data about air pollution to the scribe and asked him to come to her office and then she will see what kind of data she can give./The scribe repeatedly tried to contact the EPD secretary EPD to get official data about ambient air but he didn't come online. A detailed SMS regarding the issue was also sent to the secretary but he didn't reply."
In the air," The level of air pollution in Pakistan's major cities like Lahore and Karachi is 20 times higher than World Health Organization standards. There are layers of dust and smoke that exist over Karachi. There is also a prominent smell of gasoline that infiltrates air./Islamabad, the beautiful capital city of Pakistan, is covered with a thick layer of smog that actually hides views of the Margalla Hills. Air pollution is leading to serious health problems among people. The production and trade of items, including motor vehicles, that contribute to polluting the environment should be banned."
'Plantation of trees to help check smog'," Department of Environmental Sciences of University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS), Lahore arranged a national workshop on 'Air Pollution  and  Smog: From Science to Solution' here on Wednesday./According to a press release issued here Wednesday, Punjab Minister for Environment Protection Ms Zakia Shahnawaz Khan presided over the inaugural session of the workshop while Vice-Chancellor Meritorious Prof Dr Talat Naseer Pasha, Chief Meteorologist Flood Forecasting Division Lahore Muhammad Riaz, Dean Faculty of Bio-sciences Prof Dr Habib-ur-Rehman, Chairman Department of Environmental Sciences Dr Saif-ur-Rehman Kashif and a number of students, researchers, environmental experts and faculty members attended./Speaking on the occasion, the minister said air pollution and smog are a serious challenge and the Punjab government is actively working to address it. She said clean air and water are basic needs for a healthy life and the government with private partnership is taking steps to ensure safe air and clean water for its citizens./Speaking about the causes of smog in Punjab, she said that India burnt residue of paddy crop and the rising smoke from across the border has penetrated into Punjab and is causing smog./Emissions from industries and vehicles are also one of the causes of smog and various diseases. Lauding the services of the university, the minister said that veterinarians are working for the noble cause of treating and caring of animals./Prof Dr Talat Naseer Pasha said it is direly needed to plant more trees, which is a cost-effective way to tackle air pollution and smog. He described the history of University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences , its five faculties, campuses, undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes, development projects, including establishment of Cholistan Veterinary University Bahawalpur, Khan Bahadar Choudhry Mushtaq Ahmed College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Narowal and running research projects won by faculty members from national and international funding agencies./Earlier, Dr Saif-ur-Rehman Kashif said air pollution is one of the prime slayers in the world. He said that according to 2014 World Bank report on air quality in Pakistan, the air quality in Lahore gets worse in winter due to delayed rainfall and cold and continuously dry conditions concentrate all the pollutants in the lower levels of the atmosphere causing the smog to spread all over the Punjab./The was aimed to discuss causes of smog formation and meteorological conditions leading to smog formation, mitigation measures for the air pollution problems, make information about air quality available to public and suggest recommendations for improving air quality in Lahore./Anti-smog: Postgraduate Medical Institute/Lahore General Hospital (PGMI/LGH) Principal Prof Ghias-un-Nabi Tayyab has said that zero period has been started for the Allied Health Sciences School and Nursing students Lahore General Hospital under the aegis of Health Education Programme of Postgraduate Medical Institute, while directing maximum steps to create awareness among masses about fog./According to a press release issued here on Wednesday, the Principal, while talking to media here at Lahore General Hospital, said that new generation should fully aware about the repercussions of smog issue and prepare themselves to meet this challenge."
"Smog situation not very scary, claims EPD"," Smog, which has enveloped the provincial capital for the past several days, has now turned into a nightmare for Lahorites, as the level of PM2.5 as per private air quality monitors crossed 1,000 ug/m3 per hour against the safe limits of 10 ug/m3 per hour here on Wednesday./However, Environmental Protection Department (EPD) declared these figures as false and exaggerated and said that till Nov 5, 2017, the level of PM2.5 had gone higher to the maximum seven times of the permissible limit. Tauqeer Qureshi, EPD lab director, said that collection and analysis of air quality data were a complex process and could not be done accurately privately. He said five air quality monitoring units installed in the city at the Met Office building on Jail Road, Qaddafi Stadium, Agriculture Academy at Thokar Niaz Beg, UET and Lakhodair and one mobile unit were working properly./On the other hand, EPD continued to hide data about air pollution from public as well as government departments. Lahore Chief Met Riaz Khan said that since the start of smog, his office was asking EPD to share data of air quality so that Met Office could carry out a research on it. 'So far we have not got any data from the EPD,' he said, adding that may be EPD's machinery was facing some calibration issues./Tauqeer Qureshi while responding to the issue said that the data collected by EPD was in raw shape and could not be given to anyone. He said EPD would share the data about air quality with Met Office in proper shape and way./Answering to a question about the calibration issue of machines, he said no such issue existed. However, Met Office predicted rain for Nov 13, 2017, which might wash out smog, Tauqeer said, adding that the situation was under control and not very scary./Environmental experts, however, said if such a situation had happened in a developed country, they would have declared a national emergency. Rafy Alam, an environmental expert, said the government needed to find an immediate and radical short-term solution, including closure of schools, banning of all kind of vehicular movement at points of concentration, closing down smoke-emitting industrial units and educating farmers and garbage disposal companies on hazards of trash burning./Shahid Bhatti, an environmentalist, said that nowadays Delhi was also facing the same situation and PM2.5 level in Delhi's smong was around 500 to 950 ug/m3 per day. He said health experts in Delhi had called for declaration of a medical emergency while government had banned entry of heavy wheels to the city./Ahmed Ali, a resident of Faisal Town, said that the government should announce closure of schools till rain. He said his 10-year-old daughter fell ill due to smog. He said he came to know that dozens of children studying in his daughter's school had fallen ill./Dr Hafeez, a family physician, urged people to stay indoors. He said children should be kept inside and people should avoid unnecessary outdoor activity. He also advised people to cover their faces while going out."
Deadly smog," Smog has disturbed the everyday life of people of Punjab. Residents are not able to breathe fresh air. This smog is highly dangerous for one's health. There are poisonous particles and gases in this smog that can cause serious diseases, including lungs infection, eyes infection and lungs cancer. According to the experts if a person works outside and he breathes this polluted air, it means he has smoked about 50 cigarettes in a day. This problem is not limited to Punjab. The thick blanket of smog has also engulfed Delhi. The Delhi government has shut down schools to save children from this poisonous gas. The Punjab government has also decided to change school timings./There are many reasons behind this air pollution and the authorities need to sit down and figure out what should be done to deal with the situation. Farmers burning leftover crop is said to be the primary cause of air pollution. Car emissions and industrial dust also contribute to air pollution. Smog should not be taken lightly. People in Punjab must wear masks and glasses in order to be safe from this pollution."
Medical facilities for smog-affected people," Post Graduate Medical Institute Principal Prof Ghias un Nabi Tayyab has said that changing weather and smog are increasing diseases, and, in the light of the directions of the Punjab government, Lahore General Hospital has made arrangements to provide best medical care to the patients./Prof Ghias un Nabi Tayyab said this while addressing a seminar held in connection with creating awareness about smog at Lahore General Hospital (LGH) on Thursday. Medical experts, including Prof Khalid Waheed, Dr Junaid Mirza and Dr Muhammad Arfan Malik, also addressed on the occasion. Lahore General Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Ghulam Sabir briefed the participants on the arrangements made in the hospital for the people affected by smog./Prof Ghias un Nabi Tayyab said that apart from government, every citizen should perform his/her duties towards making the environment human friendly. He called for preservation of greenery and plantation of trees./He said, ""To avoid smog in future, we should go for short and long-term planning."" He said that sulphate, monoxide and other elements produced smog and it was more dangerous for heart and lung patients and such patients should immediately visit hospital for better and proper treatment./Other speakers said that air pollution was the main cause of smog which started since the use of coal as fuel. They stressed upon the citizens to refrain from going outside without necessarily. Motorcyclists should use masks while widows of houses should not be open/walk: With a view to creating awareness among the people regarding prevention against smog, an walk was organised at the Allama Iqbal Medical College/Jinnah Hospital on Thursday. According to a handout issued here, Principal Prof Dr Rashid Zia and Medical Superintendent Dr Sohail Saqlain led the walk while a large number of medical students, doctors, nurses and paramedical staff participated in it./Prof Dr Rashid Zia, MS Dr Sohail Saqlain and other clinicians advised the citizens that they should not go outside unnecessarily and always use face mask while going out. The participants also distributed masks and awareness literature among motorcyclists and drivers of others vehicles in front of the hospital."
Old EPD machines can't measure pollutant," Three out of five air quality monitoring machines of Environmental Protection Department (EPD), Punjab, do not  have the capability to measure PM2.5 levels, which is the most dangerous air pollutant and one of the major causes of present smog in the provincial capital./On Friday, thick smog turned the city into a gas chamber causing serious health problems for the citizens whereas EPD officials termed the smog fog. Environment experts said higher levels of PM2.5 have serious impacts on human health. Had such a situation happened in any developed country a health emergency would have been declared there, they said, adding that consistency in smog is the result of EPD's failure in enforcing the Punjab government's directive of immediate stoppage to crop burning, operations of kilns across the province./Following the grave situation, Lahore Development Authority (LDA) should have stopped construction work on all projects, including Orange Train and Chaubacha Phattak Underpass, but nothing was stopped while no special arrangement was taken to stop rise of dust at these sites./While travelling on Motorway, one can witness smoke-emitting kilns as well as burning of stubble in fields, which also showed that EPD is a toothless tiger while Provincial Minister for Environment Zakiya Shahnawaz said the government can't control pollution by 100 percent. She admitted that EPD is short of field staff and can't enforce government's writ in letter and spirit./As per private air quality monitors, the PM2.5 levels in city on Friday was around 444 ug/m3 at 3pm, 503.2 ug/m3 at 4pm and 507.8 ug/m3 at 5pm and it was 511 ug/m3 at 6pm. When the scribe contacted EPD's director laboratories toget data about PM2.5 levels, he told the scribe to contact EPD's director administration./The issue was also brought before the EPD provincial secretary who said he will sort out this problem. Sources in Environmental Protection Department claimed that the department is hiding AQI data because all their five air quality monitors are not operating as per standards and their reading is not accurate./Sources also said that recently CMIT conducted an inquiry into the EPD affairs and a 45-page report was submitted to the chief minister, action on which is still pending. Sources said the report alleged that monitoring machinery of Environmental Protection Department is not up to the mark and low quality equipment was purchased on higher rates./Chief Meteorologist Muhammad Riaz said that EPD's machinery installed at the Met office was facing some calibration issues and was not working properly. The scribe asked these questions from Environmental Protection Department secretary but he didn't respond. Later, Environmental Protection Department Lab Director Tauqeer Qureshi, while talking with The News admitted that three out of five air monitoring units installed at the Thokar, UET and Lakhodair areas didn't have the capability to monitor PM2.5 levels. He said PM2.5 levels at the Gaddafi Stadium area was 118 and at Jail Road it was 279. He said if compared, these levels are much lower than present levels in Delhi, India./Answering the question about CMIT inquiry and its findings, Tauqeer said the inquiry was conducted by two members who were civil engineers and didn't have any know-how about environmental studies and machinery.  Environmental expert Rafay Alam said the situation is very grave and needed to be addressed on top priority. He said the chief minister held meetings in last two days but no action has so far been taken./He said EPD was declaring the data about private air monitors exaggerated but not releasing any official data about air pollution. Environmentalists said that the government should close down schools immediately, ban all kind of vehicular movement at points of concentration or introduce car rotation system, close down all smoke-emitting industrial units and dust-raising development projects besides enforcing a ban on burning the garbage and stubble in farms.

Prevention is better," World Pneumonia Day is celebrated on November 12 across the world. But only a few people are aware of this and it looks as if our government is on the top of that list. Nowadays the government is focusing on urban development and has chosen to completely ignore the problems caused by pollution./Uncontrolled pollution due to industries, vehicles, deforestation and agricultural wastes lead to many serious respiratory diseases like pneumonia, asthma and TB. These diseases have claimed the lives of so many people. In order to avoid contracting these diseases, people should wear masks before going outside. The government must keep an eye on air polluters and take remedial measures to tackle pollution."
Breathe life into cities," In December of 1952, a period of cold weather in London, coupled with burning of coal for heat, no rain and windless conditions led to pollution accumulating in the environment and forming a blanket of smog smothering the city. Most of the pollutants came from the burning of coal, which was used to heat homes and power factories. The official mortality once the fog dissipated after 5 days was 4,000 at that time, however more recent reports rank the death toll at 12,000. Majority of deaths were caused by exacerbation of existing respiratory conditions especially among the elderly. The crisis resulted in great rethink of the dangers of air pollution./Peering through the mists of time, everyone is well aware of the cataclysmic events that follow Mr Churchill's young assistant being run down by the bus due to zero visibility on the roads. This was followed by the famous speech on air pollution by Winston Churchill which led to the environmental legislation like the City of London act of 1954 and Clean Air Act of 1956./Lahore and its adjacent cities are no different. The thick smog is gradually encompassing the rest of the country. Due to no visibility on the roads, schools, colleges and offices have been closed. Airports are either shut down or airplanes are being redirected to land in other cities. Daily life is on a stand still. The number of fatal road side accidents and hospital admissions due to respiratory complaints and eye infections is on a rise. It is pertinent to understand here that this is not an 'Act of God' but the causes are anthropogenic in nature. Lahore is now considered among the most polluted cities in Asia, hence air pollution is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed./New estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project and the World Health Organization states that between 5.5-7 million people die from air pollution every year. That's more than those that die from malaria and HIV/Aids put together. Air pollution is the fourth-highest risk factor for death globally and by far the leading environmental risk factor for disease. Air pollution contributes to heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, bronchitis, emphysema and acute infections./6% of all global deaths occur due to prevalent air pollution with 7 million deaths occurring every year. Around 1.4 million deaths occur in China, followed by India with 645,000 deaths occurring annually, due to their dependence on coal as a fuel and their fast growing economies./Following these two most polluted countries in the world is Pakistan, with 111,000 total deaths every year due to pollution. Pakistan ranks 3rd for most premature deaths due to air pollution. Karachi is rated as the fifth most polluted city in the world/According to a World Bank report on Pakistan, outdoor air pollution alone causes more than 80,000 hospital admissions per year; nearly 8,000 cases of chronic bronchitis, and almost five million cases of upper respiratory infections in children under the age of five. The fragile health system of Pakistan is ill-equipped in dealing with this additional burden of disease due to air pollution. The losses attributed to air pollution, in terms of health care costs, are around 500 million dollars a year./Highly inefficient energy use, accelerated growth in vehicle population and vehicle kilometers traveled, increasing industrial activity without adequate air emission treatment or control, open burning of solid waste including plastic, and use of ozone depleting substances (ODSs) are some of the major causes of deterioration of ambient air quality./The household sector is the largest single energy-consuming sector in Pakistan. Biomass fuel, wood, crop residue and dung account for 95% of energy consumed by households in rural areas, with the share dropping to 56% in urban areas. Biomass combustion is a major source of indoor air pollution./For a developing country like Pakistan, urbanization has been one of the significant factors contributing to environmental degradation in general and air pollution in particular./The beautiful city of Lahore is choking under a thick veil of soot, dust and carbon particles. The smog in Lahore has crossed the international benchmarks. The levels of PM 2.5, which is a hazardous particle in air most damaging to health has reached 450-500ug/m3, against the standard measure of 35ug/m3 per day. In any other developed city in the world, this would be declared an emergency and remedial actions and legislations would be announced by the government. However, the silence of the concerned authorities to implement remedial action plans to tackle this emergency does not bode well for the future of the country. Worldwide there are a growing network of cities committed to cleaning the air and protecting the health of their citizens from air pollution by becoming a part of the Breathelife city Network. For becoming a part of the beathelife cities network, local governments in the respective cities pledge to putting their city on the journey to meet the WHO air quality guidelines by 2030./Air pollution is one of those complex environmental problems where control through point source reduction is considered most desirable, and the only way to prevent adverse health and other damaging impacts. Once emitted into the atmosphere, unlike other matrix/media, the recycling or re-use of the emitted products from the atmosphere is almost impossible. We have the relevant laws to divert such emergencies, however we lack the will and capacity to implement and enforce these laws./It is encouraging to know that the Lahore High Court, on directives of the chief justice has sought to declare a public health emergency over the issue of smog. However, the reluctance of the provincial environment department to find remedial measures to tackle the situation is baffling. A reliable and robust air quality monitoring system, weather forecasting system are essential to chalk out policies in order to combat the public health hazards of smog. In addition, there's a need for health system strengthening and data sharing between relevant authorities and ministries to gain wide dissemination of information to people for them to take preventive actions./The writer is a freelance consultant on environmental health issues."

Karachi is rated as the fifth most polluted city in the world./According to a World Bank report on Pakistan, outdoor air pollution alone causes more than 80,000 hospital admissions per year, nearly 8,000 cases of chronic bronchitis and almost five million cases of upper respiratory infections in children under the age of five. The fragile health system of the Pakistan is ill-equipped to deal with this additional burden of diseases due to air pollution. The losses attributed to air pollution in terms of health care costs amount to around $500 million a year./Highly inefficient energy use, the accelerated growth in vehicle population and vehicle kilometres travelled, increasing industrial activity without adequate air emission treatment or control, the open burning of solid waste including plastic and the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are some of the major causes of deterioration of ambient air quality./The household sector is the largest single energy-consuming sector in Pakistan. Biomass fuel, wood, crop residue and dung account for 95 percent of the energy consumed by households in rural areas, with the share dropping to 56 percent in urban areas. Biomass combustion is a major source of indoor air pollution./For a developing country like Pakistan, urbanisation has been a significant factor contributing to environmental degradation, especially through air pollution.  The city of Lahore is choking under a thick veil of soot, dust and carbon particles. The smog in Lahore has crossed the international benchmarks. The level of PM 2.5, which is a hazardous particle in air that is injurious to health, has reached 450-500ug/m3 against the standard measure of 35ug/m3 per day. In any other developed city in the world, this would be declared an emergency situation and remedial action and legislation would be introduced by the government. However, the silence of the concerned authorities to implement remedial action plans to tackle this emergency does not bode well for the future of the country./Across the world, there are a growing network of cities committed to cleaning the air and protecting the health of their citizens from air pollution by becoming a part of the BreatheLife Cities Network. In order to become part of this network, local governments in the respective cities have pledged to put their city on the journey to meet the WHO's air quality guidelines by 2030./Air pollution is one of those complex environmental problems where control through point-source reduction is considered to be the most desirable solution and the only way to prevent adverse health and other damaging impacts. Once emitted into the atmosphere, unlike other matrix/media, the recycling or re-use of the emitted products from the atmosphere is almost impossible. We have the relevant laws to divert such emergencies. However, we lack the will and capacity to implement and enforce these laws./It is encouraging to know that the Lahore High Court has, on the directives of the chief justice, sought to declare a public health emergency over the smog. However, the reluctance of the provincial environment department to find remedial measures to tackle the situation is baffling. A reliable and robust air quality monitoring system and a weather forecasting system are essential to chalk out policies to combat the public health hazards that could arise from the smog. In addition, there's a pressing need for strengthening the health system and sharing data among the relevant authorities and ministries to widely disseminate information to people and take preventive actions."
LHC issues its own plan on smog," The Punjab government's failure to devise a comprehensive action plan to cope with the alarming situation caused by dense smog in Lahore and other cities compelled Lahore High Court to issue its own plan for enforcement by the government to protect people's lives./According to the plan issued by LHC Chief Justice Mansoor Ali Shah through a nine page order in the smog case, the situation would become worst if the air quality index (AQI) crossed the limit of 300. It may put respiratory impact even on healthy people, and serious health impacts on people with lung/heart diseases./The health impacts may be experienced even during light physical activity. So, in order to handle the situation, the government would suspended all outdoor activities and evacuate the people to the safe places as for as practicable. If the AQI reaches the level of 300, the government should shut down all educational institutions and direct everyone to wear mask when outdoor./Distribution of face masks and closing down parks would also be mandatory. Moreover, in case the AQI remains up to the level of 140, the government should issue public warnings for children and the elderly to remain indoors in clean air especially during peak times. Primary schools would also be shut down as this situation may cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure, and discomfort to people with heart disease./The CJ further directed that in case AQI remained up to 105 level, the government would shut down high air pollution-generating industrial units, impose restrictions on use of motor vehicles. Such situation, according to the CJ, may cause breathing discomfort to people with lung diseases such as asthma, and discomfort to people with heart diseases./In case the AQI touches 70, it may cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. The government should immediately restrict air pollution-generating industrial units and construction activities in the affected area. In case AQI does not cross the level of 35, no action has been suggested by the court. Chief Justice Mansoor Ali Shah observed that the government departments had no desire, capacity or mutual coordination to deal with the Smog Emergency in the city./The smog levels having touched the highest levels according to their own smog policy, no tangible steps were taken by the Environment Protection Department, Health Department or the School Education Department for the protection of the health or safety of the residents of Lahore, including children, pregnant women and persons of old age. This is most disconcerting and disappointing. Dense smog is physically visible in the city and the air monitoring record shows that it has gone above 300, the highest level. Doctors have confirmed that the smog levels are seriously hazardous to health of the residents. Inspite of this, no preventive measures to protect the life and health of the people have been put in place./This court is bound to protect the fundamental rights of the people, therefore, relying on Article 9 of the constitution, i.e., right to life, read with the internationally recognised precautionary principle, till such time that the government proposes a detailed action plan, keeping in view the nature of the current crises, this court issued its own 'Smog Health Emergency Action Plan'./Government and its respective departments shall immediately act according to the directions given in the plan. The action of the government should be monitored by the chief secretary. Furthermore, daily readings of the air quality monitoring would be uploaded on the website of the Environment Protection Department and efforts shall be made to put real time data on the website at the earliest./This data should be station-wise. The Smog Emergency Health Action Plan would come into motion on the basis of highest reading of any one of the air monitoring stations out of the five stations, the CJ added."
Poisoned air," Several days after the chief justice of the Lahore High Court ordered the provincial EPD and health department to chalk out an emergency plan to be implemented stringently each time air pollution in northern Punjab reached hazardous levels, there is no evidence this is happening. The orders were issued as Justice Mansoor Ali Shah heard a petition brought forward by citizens under Article 9 of the constitution, seeking protection of life and security. After air quality readings using monitors brought to the courtroom were presented to the judge he held that an emergency existed and should not be ignored. The monitors recorded levels for the dangerous PM2.5 particulates to be over 500 outside the courtroom and over 300 within it. Levels over 300 are considered dangerous for health. Other air toxins also showed high levels./Among other measures the court had ordered daily publication of data from official air monitors. This has not happened yet. Nor have the concerned departments stated if they are working on other proposals that came up during the court hearing as possible components of a holistic action plan. These included steps to restrict smoke emitting vehicles, control emissions from factories and brick kilns, eliminate crop burning and possibly close schools when air quality warranted such a measure both to protect children and to reduce cars on the roads. One possible reason for the general inaction despite the LHC ruling is the complacency that has set in after recent rains in Lahore. While these have, for now, driven away smog the most obvious sign of air pollution experts point out that levels of dangerous particulate matter remain high and continue to rise steadily. These levels are still not out in the public domain, with the media too having lost interest. Few studies exist on the longer-term impact of air pollution. But the air quality for Lahore and other cities in the province remain among the worst in the world, making it imperative that the LHC orders be acted on and a plan for both short and long-term action put in place without further delay. On a national level too, we need to treat climate change issues with the seriousness they deserve."
Air pollution," The number of patients suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is increasing at a fast pace. The disease makes it difficult for patients to breathe. The outbreak of this diseases is mainly due to tobacco consumption and air pollution. According to some healthcare experts, the disease is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and is projected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020.More than three million people die of the disease every year and up to 10 percent of adults over age 40 worldwide may have it. According to WHO statistics, the estimated COPD death rate in Pakistan was 71 death per 100,000 people, which was the fourth highest death rate among the 25 most populous nations in the world./A simple, painless breath test called spirometery can confirm whether a person possesses COPD or not. But, unfortunately, this test is not available in most hospitals in the country. Because of late diagnosis, chances of survival of patients are minimum. The treatment is more effective when the disease is diagnosed early. The government and the healthcare department must take measures not only for implementation of anti-smoking laws, but also for the control of atmospheric pollution."
"SC summons CM Murad, former city nazim in Karachi water case"," The Supreme Court on Monday summoned Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah and former city nazim Mustafa Kamal in Karachi drinking water case./While hearing the case, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar observed that that provision of clean drinking water and pollution free environment are the responsibilities of state and it should fulfill its duties in this regard./Petitioner Shahab Usto informed the court that the citizens were being provided unfiltered and hazardous water. He added that people of Sindh's 29 districts were compelled to drink polluted water./On this, the CJ remarked that air pollution is making life miserable for the masses and deadly diseases like cancer are spreading./We will ask from the provincial chief executive what his administration is doing in this regard, he said adding that human lives are at stake and we cannot ignore this issue. The bench then  directed the chief minister to appear before the bench on Dec 06./The bench also summoned Mustafa Kamal on Dec 05, during whose tenure the land reserved for Mehmoodabad water treatment plant was illegally allotted."
