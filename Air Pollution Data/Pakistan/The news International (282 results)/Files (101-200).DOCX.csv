Photo: Geo.TV/KARACHI: Sindh  Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and former Karachi Mayor Mustafa Kamal on Wednesday arrived at the Supreme Court Registry in connection with drinking water case./They were summoned by a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Saqib Nisar. /The chief justice had remarked during the last hearing that those who make tall claims before people have been unable to provide clear drinking water ./He had said life was being affected in Sindh and Punjab due to pollution caused by factories, adding that  the court would not compromise on the issue of water and air pollution./The chief justice said court has to interfere when government fails to fulfill its responsibilities./Petitioner Shahab Usto had informed the court that the citizens were being provided unfiltered and hazardous water. /He added that people of Sindh's 29 districts were compelled to drink polluted water./The chief justice remarked that air pollution is making life miserable for the masses and deadly diseases like cancer are spreading."
"Toxic air can damage child's brain for good, says Unicef"," The latest United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) report has observed that air pollution can damage a child's brain forever; and should Pakistan's health experts wish to pay heed to these most recent findings, this new study under review should certainly serve as a food for thought for both policy makers and inhabitants of a country, many parts of which are now regularly engulfed by a phenomenon called the ""smog,"" which is a type of air pollution that is caused when smoke combines with fog./While referring to this December 2017 Unicef report, the ""Times of India"" has stated: ""The link between air pollution and respiratory diseases is well-established, but the United Nations Children's Fund, in a report on Tuesday, said there is a growing body of scientific research which shows that air pollution canpermanently damage a child's brain./The findings come at a time when India, particularly in the north, is facing a serious crisis due to rising levels of pollution. Last month, Delhi schools had to be shut temporarily to reduce children's exposure to pollutants that had enveloped the capital.""/The top Indian newspaper maintained on December 6: ""The Unicef report also said that South Asia had the largest proportion of babies living in areas where air pollution is at least six times higher than international limits (10 micrograms per cubic metre). The Unicef report, titled ""Danger in the air"", explains that brain damage can happen through several mechanisms. First, it stated, particulate matters can cause neuro-inflammation by damaging the blood-brain barrier - a thin, delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances.""/The ""Times of India"" has gone on to write: ""Second, exposure to specific air pollutant particles, such as magnetite, can lead to oxidative stress which is often the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. Quoting multiple studies, the UN body said polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons commonly found in areas of high automobile traffic contribute to a loss of or damage to white matter in the brain. White matter is important for continued learning and development. ""Pollutants can permanently damage their developing brains,"" Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said. ""The latest analysis of multiple researches states that pollutants can cross the placenta and affect the developing brain of a foetus (fetus).""/The Indian media house has further discussed the report: ""A young child's brain is especially vulnerable because it can be damaged by a smaller dose of toxic chemicals. Children are also highly vulnerable to air pollution because their physical defences and immunities are 'not fully developed', UNICEF said. It advised parents to reduce children's exposure to pollutants by making it feasible for them to travel during times of the day when air pollution is lower.""/AIR POLLUTION AND ITS EFFECTS IN PAKISTAN/According to the ""New York Times,"" smog in Lahore during November 2017 had made levels of the dangerous particulates known as PM2.5, small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, reach 1,077 micrograms per cubic meter-- more than 30 times what Pakistan's government considered the safe limit./The November 10, 2017 report of the ""New York Times"" had held that in 2015, according to a World Health Organization estimate, almost 60,000 Pakistanis had perished from the high level of fine particles in the air, one of the world's highest death tolls from air pollution./Quoting a Pakistani meteorologist, the ""USA Today"" had also highlighted this grave issue and its adverse effects in November 2017:""Pollution, caused by dust, the burning of crops, and emissions from factories and brick kilns in Pakistan and neighbouring India, was expected to linger until the middle of the month. He advised people to wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory ailments. Smog has enveloped much of Pakistan and neighboring India, causing highway accidents and respiratory problems, and forcing many residents to stay home.""/SMOG AND INDIA/The American newspaper had viewed: ""Similar problems have been reported in the Indian capital, New Delhi, where air quality was rated ""very poor."" India's Supreme Court has banned the sale of firecrackers in New Delhi ahead of last month's Hindu Diwali festival to try to curb air pollution in the notoriously smoggy city. Though reports said air quality was better than last year, pollution levels in the capital hit 18 times the healthy limit the night after the festival, as many dodged the ban.""/HOW IS SMOG FORMED?/An ""Al-Jazeera"" Television report of November 5, 2017 had mentioned: ""Smog results when photochemical reaction takes place between air pollutants from crop burning, vehicles and others sources, and sunlight and heat. The resulting thick haze - also known as ground level ozone - gets trapped near the earth due to warm air in atmosphere.""/WHAT CAUSED SMOG IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN?/The afore-cited ""Al-Jazeera"" Television report had asserted: ""The recent burning of crops in northern India, combined with fog, dust and air pollution from vehicles and factories, has resulted in a thick layer of smog covering several cities in India and Pakistan.""/AROUND 300 MILLION WORLD CHILDREN BREATHE TOXIC AIR/In October 2016, UNICEF had pointed out that around 300 million children lived in areas where the air was toxic, exceeding international limits by at least six times!!/About 14 months ago, the UNICEF had stated: ""Children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution, breathing faster than adults on average and taking in more air relative to their body weight. The report also notes that air pollution is a major contributing factor in the deaths of around 0.6 million children under age 5 every year and threatens the health, lives and futures of millions more. It concludes with a set of concrete steps to take so that children can breathe clean, safe air.""/Lead in paint alone causes brain damage in more than half-a-million children every year./The UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) on Wednesday adopted a dozen pollution-curbing resolutions -- urging governments to ban the use of lead in paint, step up ""actions"" to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds by 2025, and urging member states to set ambitious air quality standards./The president of the UNEA meeting, Costa Rica´s environment minister Edgar Gutierrez, lamented Wednesday that humans ""haven´t done a good job"" managing Earth´s natural bounty./""The room we have for making more mistakes is very narrow,"" he warned. ""Whilst leaders talk, the tide of plastic, chemicals and air pollution keeps growing,"" Greenpeace East Asia campaigner Cheng Qian said in a statement.   ""The decisions made here must be actioned, implemented and accelerated if we are to stand a chance of restoring the health of our planet."""
"'Innovations, changing ecosystems creating opportunities to improve human health'"," Even though we are living in a world marked by profound health challenges, technology's boundless healthcare applications make it entirely possible for governments to join the dots, layer things up, and reimagine health to address issues of equity, quality, cost, and efficiency./Heartfile President Dr. Sania Nishtar made these remarks while sharing her vision about the future of health as keynote speaker at the opening of the 8th Annual Public Health Conference organised by the Health Services Academy (HSA). Dr. Sania wears many hats, but relevant to the subject of 'future of health,' is her position as Chair of the 'World Economic Forum's Global Agenda think tank on the Future of Health,' which is a great honour for Pakistan./In her visionary keynote speech, Dr. Sania set out the context by referring to the challenges that the world faces today. 'Conflicts, one of the largest migration waves in history, humanitarian crises, demographic challenges, epidemiological shifts and the threats of climate change, loom large. In such a context, there are also profound health challenges -- rising costs, the demands of an ageing population, and widening inequities. In fact, some of the global health challenges threaten to wipe out the development gains of the last century -- threats such as a potential pandemic, antimicrobial resistance and the rising burden of non-communicable diseases,' she stated./Dr. Sania then moved on to highlight how technology and digitisation are revolutionising everything. 'The future of health is being shaped by many transformative forces -- innovations and changing ecosystems are creating an unprecedented opportunity to improve human health and wellbeing,' she pointed out./Elaborating her viewpoint, Dr. Sania said, 'Today, predictive analytics could provide a solution for developing a pandemic reporting system. Billions of people are connected with mobile devices -- where the combination of processing power, knowledge access and data portability converge and could open myriad opportunities for improving health. Artificial intelligence can overcome constraints posed by critical workers shortages in many parts of the world. Block chain can help overcome interoperability challenges in health IT systems and enable us to address clinical errors, wastage and fraud. With machine learning capabilities -- and with recent watershed events in tabular learning, and algorithmic breakthroughs as evidenced by the launch of AlphaGo Zero, most recently, technology's healthcare applications are potentially boundless. It is entirely possible to join the dots, layer things up and reimagine health to address issues of equity, quality, cost and efficiency.'/Dr. Sania then emphasised that in order to 'tap the potential of these emerging transformations, they have to be deployed in systems, with the right incentives structures. This requires another layer of expertise or complex systems experts. Governments have an important normative role to play here. They need capacity and vision to develop standards and create new regulatory systems. For the health sector, where human knowledge and intervention matters deeply, this has huge implications in terms of realigning education training and capacity building.' As with all of her speeches, she stressed the importance of transparency and accountability as being central tenets of governance effectiveness./Dr. Sania believes that the Sustainable Development (SDG) agenda has ushered in a new era compared to what was the norm in the past. The emphasis is now on strengthening country institutions, she said, so that international actors can focus on areas where they have a comparative advantage. 'The systemic interlinkages between the economic, social and environmental determinants of sustainable development require a profound change from the existing sectorial view of health,' she added. Dr. Sania stressed that health is a multi-sectoral responsibility. As examples, she cited that 'over 9 million people die annually due to the effects of air pollution; millions live with the consequences of obesity; road traffic accidents are the greatest burden of mortality in the younger generation; and income and female education are the strongest determinants of health status achievement.'/Speaking on the occasion, Minister for Health Services Saira Afzal Tarar said Pakistan is fully committed to achieving the health-related SDGs. She then shared Pakistan's achievement in various health domains including polio eradication, drug pricing, and the national health insurance programme -- a social protection initiative providing financial protection to families against out-of-pocket expenditure on health. 'Thousands of poor patients have benefitted from treatment facilities including deliveries, cardiac surgeries, cancer and other major diseases in the best private and government hospitals in their districts, without spending a single rupee. After the success of phase 1, the government will launch the second phase of this programme in order to expand this safety net. We are committed to expand this programme till every poor citizen of this country is benefitted,' she stated. The minister thanked the provincial health ministers and Departments for their commitment to health sector interventions."
Smog damage," For many, the dangers of the toxic smog that descended on upper Punjab the last two months are not clear. The issue made headlines again when Sri Lankan cricketers in Delhi were reported to have fallen ill and been unable to continue to take to the field. That the issue could affect an international sporting event brought home the debilitating everyday impact of the smog on local residents of Delhi, Lahore and other smog affected regions. But is there a short- and long-term impact of the smog? The short-term impact, according to the WHO, is around 60,000 deaths in Pakistan caused by the weeks of smog in November. This is not a small number. It is certainly higher than the number of deaths caused by dengue fever when it became an epidemic in Punjab. Whatever the limits of the strategies adopted to combat dengue fever, we know that the disease is taken to be a public health priority./The impact of smog on respiratory illnesses is well-known and experienced by all. However, Unicef has revealed another disturbing fact. According to a report, air pollution can damage a child's brain forever. It has even impaired the development of a foetus. The South Asia region has the largest proportion of babies living in an area where air pollution is at least six times higher than international limits. We know that schools had to be shut in Delhi last month and probably should have been shut in our part of Punjab. But the damage prevention cannot be focused on keeping children inside homes. In Lahore, smog pollution had hit an alarming 1,077 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre which is over 30 times what the government considers safe. How many children will have suffered permanent to semi-permanent brain damage due to these alarmingly high levels will likely never be calculated. We know that over 300 million children in the world breathe toxic air every day. This is why the world's decision to adopt a pollution-free plan is another important landmark. The gathering at the UN Environmental Assembly accepted the need for a complete overhaul of the way goods are produced and consumed. This is a big task and there have been very few concrete developments on this front. But this is a task that must be completed on an emergency footing. Millions of children and adults are at risk."
CVDs cause more deaths in winter," Patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may face serious and life threatening complications due to extreme fall in mercury while the extreme cold weather may also increase the risk of incidence of CVDs./Various studies have revealed that the highest incidence of CVDs occurs during the colder winter months and the phenomenon contributes to greater number of deaths due to the CVDs in winter./The morbidity and mortality due to CVDs, 12 in number, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and rupture, stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation have higher rates during the winter than in summer./According to health experts, the variation in incidence of CVDs is associated with a number of risk factors including temperature, physical activity, air pollution, infections, and dietary habits however the risk can be minimized by following precautionary measures specifically in colder winter months./Potentially important seasonal risk factors like the seasonal variation in the plasma level of fibrinogen, cholesterol, hormones and vasoactive substance including vasopressin (AVP), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and angiotensin II, aldosterone and catecholamine which tends to rise in the winter play an important role in the seasonal change of CVDs./Cold weather increases peripheral vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels), which may lead to pulmonary oedema as a consequence of left ventricular failure and may also cause abnormal clotting./It is worth mention here that both systolic and diastolic mean blood pressures exhibit a seasonal peak during winter and trough in summer among adults, the elderly, and children. The extreme cold affects blood pressure of both the healthy and hypertensive people./A number of studies on seasonal variation in heart failure (HF) hospitalisation carried out in France, Spain, Japan, Scotland, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Turkey, Nigeria, Canada, and USA have revealed that admissions increase during the winter season and show decline in summer season./Health experts in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have repeatedly expressed to 'The News' that exposure to extreme cold increases the chances of vasoconstriction and affects the pumping power of the heart muscle in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. The exercise capacity among heart patients gets decreased in the colder winter months and it may cause serious complications./Studies reveal that in both sexes, overall levels of physical activity are significantly higher in summer than in winter and physical inactivity is strongly positively associated with CVDs. Physical activities such as walking, cycling and gardening only protect against acute coronary events if undertaken throughout the year./Experts say that patients suffering from CVDs should involve themselves in some physical activity like walk in daytime when the weather gets little warmer. It is observed around the globe that greater number of sudden cardiac deaths is reported in winter than in summer while an increase in mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has also been recorded in the winter months./Experts suggest that adequate indoor heating, wearing protective clothing and avoiding unaccustomed strenuous exercise in extreme cold weather are some of the precautionary measures that should be followed religiously by patients suffering from CVDs to reduce the risk of dying from the disease."
Incidences of cough and cold take shape of epidemic," Both the public and private healthcare facilities including the three teaching hospitals in town are receiving heavy influx of patients with colds, sore throat, cough and flu that have adopted shape of epidemic./Dry chill accompanied with high pollution level in the air are targeting citizens who are falling prey to various seasonal ailments, especially colds, flu, throat infection, asthma and other respiratory problems./According to many health experts, in winter both the children and adults suffer from cold and upper and lower respiratory tract infections ten times as often as all the other diseases combined mainly because of poor quality of air that is engulfed by dusty clouds, toxic metals and vapours. Public transport vehicles are a big source of air pollution./Majority of population has misconceptions about colds and flu and take them as two names of one disease whereas actually both are caused by different germs. Mostly these infections are self-limiting within a week or so. However, sometimes complications such as ear and sinus infections in case of colds and pneumonia in case of flu may occur which may be life-threatening./Studies reveal that common cold and flu (influenza) are very common infections of upper respiratory tract involving nose, throat, ears and sinuses. Colds and flu are caused by viruses. Over 200 different viruses can cause colds that can be lurking anywhere people have been./These infections are highly contagious, passed by tiny droplets produced during sneezing, coughing of infected persons and touching things with hands and tissues that others touch./Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry expressed this while talking to 'The News'./He added that to check spread of colds, flu and like infections, there is a need to make public aware of various aspects of these seasonal ailments./Recent research says that if you are smoker, or hang around with people who smoke, you are more likely to catch more colds and they can last longer. Smokers usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokers, he said./Dr. Ashraf explained that a cold and the flu have many of the same symptoms but a cold is generally mild, while the flu tends to be more severe. A stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, no or mild fever, lasting two to four days or a week, are usual signs of cold. Tiredness, high fever, chills, headache, and major aches and pains probably mean you have the flu, he said./He said coughing can be a sign of either cold or the flu but a bad cough points to the flu. There is no cure for the cold or the flu however to feel better, you can treat your symptoms, while your body fights off the virus, he said./Talking of the remedy, he said if one has cold or flu, one should stay home and rest in the bed and cut down late nights and vigorous exercise for a few days. Drink plenty of fluids, at least 8 to 10 glasses of water and fruit juices preferably orange juice. Drink hot tea or water with lemon and honey. Chicken and vegetable soups can also help loosen the mucus. Gargle with warm saline water a few times a day to relieve sore throat. Throat spray lozenges may also help relieve the pain./He added that to quiet a dry cough, suck on cough lozenges or take cough syrup and use saline nasal drops to help loosen mucus. However, nasal drops or sprays should not be used longer than three days. Inhaling steam can help a blocked nose. Wash your nose frequently, he said./The most important thing however is that self-medication must be avoided and one should consult a qualified physician in case of any complications, he said./To a query, Dr. Ashraf said antibiotics should not be taken as they do not work against viruses. However, in case of complications of cold and flu they may be taken on the advice of qualified doctor. Avoid coffee or cola drinks and also avoid any drinks than contain alcohol, he suggested./Colds are extremely difficult to prevent entirely, however, a few precautionary measures may prevent a cold. Avoid close contact with people who have a cold. Overcrowded places like cinema halls should be avoided during outbreak of colds or flu and especially children should not be taken to overcrowded areas. Get vaccinated for influenza. Wear appropriate warm outdoor clothes, said Dr. Ashraf."
Science under Trump," Somehow, some way, we have made it to the end of 2017.And what a long year it's been./Looking back, it is almost unbelievable how much damage the Trump administration has done since the inauguration. From straining international relations to enriching corporations at the expense of poor Americans, the policies the president has championed have impacted every aspect of society./The scientific community is no exception, as scientists have felt the repercussions of foreign, fiscal, and other policies in their work and lives./For starters, health and science departments and programmes took a significant financial hit, notably through steep budget cuts like the $12.6bn cut to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a 16.2 percent decrease from 2017. The impact on healthcare services could be tragic, as HHS is tasked with administering Medicare, Medicaid, and enforcing the provisions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)./Some $5.8bn of the HHS budget cut is taken from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which funds vital biomedical research at universities and medical facilities across the US, as well as at foreign research institutions. This will hamper scientists' ability to continue research, much of which is necessary for protecting human health./At a time when antibiotic resistance is increasing and climate change is expanding areas of the globe where tropical diseases are endemic, decreasing federal funding for scientific research will only make us more vulnerable to diseases that we cannot treat./Medical researchers and health care professionals were not the only ones to see budget cuts; environmental and climate scientists are arguably faring far worse./The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, faced a proposed $2.5bn cut(31 percent of its budget). Instead, Congress voted for a decrease $528m. Though this cut is less severe, important programmes for conducting toxicity research and setting water and air pollution standards will be eliminated and the EPA's ability to enforce environmental standards will be constrained. All of this is a recipe for a public health disaster./Elsewhere, initiatives such as the Water and Wastewater loan and the grant programme of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as well as climate change and clean energy-related programmes have completely lost funding./These budget cuts are but the tip of the (melting) iceberg. Federal programmes and agencies tasked with protecting the environment and natural resources have been targeted since the beginning of Trump's presidency, starting with an order to the EPA to remove its climate change page./In January, employees at the EPA and USDA were reportedly banned from providing the public updates via press releases or social media without prior screening and approval. More recently, staff at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention were advised against using seven words, such as 'transgender' and 'science-based'. Reports are unclear whether this was an outright ban or merely a suggestion for avoiding overtly 'political' language, but concerns about censorship have arisen anew./Scientists have swiftly responded to these gag orders and censorship attempts by creating 'alt' Twitter accounts for various agencies, writing an open letterto the president on climate change, and organising the March for Science./Any national and international efforts to safeguard natural resources and curb climate change have been thwarted by this administration. In the past year, Trump has reversed former President Barack Obama's decision to halt construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, planned to scrap a ban on uranium mining near the Grand Canyon, decreased the size of national parks, and withdrew from the Paris Agreement./The consequences of these policies are not trivial, as we saw in November when the Keystone pipeline leaked 795,000 litres of oil in South Dakota./Importantly, we are seeing the effects of climate change today, most notably in the increased frequency and severity of hurricanes this year alone. Hurricane Harvey resulted in an estimated $198bn in property damage, with thousands of Houston residents still displaced months later./The extensive devastation left in Hurricane Maria's wake has included an increasing death toll in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as the islands still remain without electricity and suffer limited access to needed medical supplies./Scientists were also inevitably affected by Trump's harmful social policies. In the past year, we saw how the infamous 'Muslim ban' blocked scientists from entering the country and undoubtedly discouraged many more from considering educational and career opportunities such as medical residency in the US./A Congress plan to tax graduate students' tuition waivers would have effectively forced poor and underrepresented minorities out of school, many of whom are currently in STEM fields. The financial repercussions of the new tax law and this administration's persistent attempts to repeal the ACA will take a toll on academics struggling with educational debt, on researchers with disabilities or chronic illnesses, and on families who depend on graduate school stipends or grant funding./For many, 2017 was a year of disbelief - disbelief in how a country that has produced many scientific breakthroughs and new technologies is now clamping down on science, scientists and their ability to promote human wellbeing. But for those of us who were keenly aware of the threat that a Trump presidency would pose to our day-to-day lives, the devastation of this year was unsurprising. We knew that Trump made promises to the Republican Party base that threatened our health and safety./For researchers whose race, religion, or disability was mocked by Trump during his candidacy, the threat of losing funding for research that protects human life was hardly shocking. We saw how little he valued our lives on the campaign trail./And for scientists who come from marginalised communities and live in neighbourhoods that have been destroyed by policies favouring the rich, the removal of environmental protections was not unexpected. We saw how business and profit drive Trump and the Republican Party, even at the expense of the planet that sustains us."
"Air pollution in Sindh has lessened, claims minister"," The protection of the environment is an important component of mega development projects being built in Sindh with the federal government's assistance, said Governor Mohammad Zubair on Friday./In a meeting the Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Mushahidullah Khan at his office, Governor Zubair said that to protect the environment, green belts will be developed alongside the infrastructure of mega development projects that the federal government is helping build in the province./Observing that less attention is being paid toward initiating plantation drives in urban centres, the governor said that while tree cover in mega cities like Karachi has declined significantly, the population has increased in tandem, stated a press release issued from Governor House./'People have been suffering from fatal diseases owing to serious degradation of the environment,' he said. The governor further added that the federal govt had been providing assistance for implementing special schemes in the province to improve environment on a concrete basis./Economic, social, commercial and trading activities in the province have been on the rise in Sindh with improvement in the law and order situation, Zubair claimed. Mushahidullah said that Pakistan has been affected much by climate change and environmental degradation./He added that the effects of climate change could get worse in Pakistan but claimed that the federal govt had taking steps to reverse some effects and improve the environment across the country./Mushahidullah further claimed that the federal government has been taking steps to lessen the occurrence of air pollution in Sindh, adding that it had been controlled to a large extent owing to those steps."
Generators operating without precautionary measures cause pollution," Unregulated installation and operations of heavy generators, especially by the business concerns in commercial localities is causing serious health hazards for the citizens who have recently encountered smog./As the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) is continuously hiding data of air and noise pollution from the media and the citizens, one can't say how much these generators are contributing to air and noise pollution, besides causing vibration./The irony of the situation is that the EPD's wing of City Govt Lahore (CGL), which is supposed to protect citizens from rising pollution and its effects, is only acting as an observant. It is pertinent to mention here that during the year 2017 no major campaign was launched against this major cause of pollution and only individual raids were conducted to increase volumes of progress files./Muhammad Anjum, District Officer (Environment), said around 15 complaints regarding this issue were solved in the year 2017. He said the department's action against polluters was linked with complaints and in case of no complaint, he can't take any action./To a question why not the department carries out routine survey for such issues, he said he only has a force of six inspectors who mainly check industrial units and complete tasks coming from head office. 'With such a small force, it is not possible for us to carry out surveys or monitoring of city on daily basis,' he concluded./Environmental experts said the city is already facing increased levels of noise and air pollution and residents are suffering a lot. They said use of high power diesel generators installed outside business outlets in commercial localities in almost every nook and corner of the city have added poison to the atmosphere. They said majority of the generators were installed and operated without any precautionary measures to contain discharge of air pollutants and noise./These generators, in most of the cases, were placed outside shops and offices as well as on footpaths, which have become a major encroachment, snatching pedestrians' right to walk. Sources in EPD said rules and regulations of Environmental Protection Department only cover industrial sector and these consumers are bound to get an NOC from the department for installation of a heavy generator./'Sustained noise over a period of time can engender deafness in the form of gradual losses in hearing. This is the most common loss in teenagers today listening to loud music,' said Dr Hamza Imran, a ENT specialist. He said rising level of noise pollution is one of the major sources of heart, mental and ear diseases among the Lahorites, he said, adding voice unit beyond 75 decibel becomes injurious to human health./He said hospitals and educational institutions are among the places badly affected by noise pollution and now unchecked installation of generators in residential localities will prove fatal for people."
Reduce air pollution," Winter in Punjab brings smog, which has a negative impact on the lives of people. The atmospheric pollutants or gases that form smog are released in the air when fuels are burnt. When sunlight reacts with these gases and fine particles in the atmosphere, smog is formed. Air pollution, especially smoke emitted by vehicles, causes smog. We can take a few measures to reduce air pollution./Since traditional cars and trucks produce a significant amount of nitrogen dioxide emissions, an easy way to cut back these emissions is to drive less. People should take public transport so that there is a fewer number of cars on roads. The lack of trees is also a primary cause of air pollution. More trees should be planted so that the air can be purified. It is the responsibility of both the government and citizens to contribute towards air pollution."
EPA cracks down on housing societies over breach of environmental laws," Springing into action against violators of environmental laws, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday issued notices to 26 housing societies of Islamabad to explain their respective positions for not complying with the conditions contained in their environmental approvals./According to Pak-EPA Director General Farzana Altaf Shah, the conditions laid down in environmental approvals include proper disposal of solid waste, liquid waste, chemical waste, hazardous materials, construction of sewage treatment plants, rainwater harvesting, ground water recharging etc, and submission of quarterly or monthly progress reports of the projects./""We've observed that the proponents of these projects and developers are neither attending the conditions contained in their environmental approval nor are they submitting compliance and progress reports to us. All this is causing serious environmental problems like air pollution, polluted water bodies, different diseases, solid and liquid waste issues and cutting of trees in the capital city,"" she told reporters here./The Pak-EPA director general said her organisation working under the administrative control of the Ministry of Climate Change was responsible for the implementation of the Pakistan Environmental Act, 1997, as well as the rules and regulations made under it./She said all development projects located in the limits of Islamabad Capital Territory were required by the law to obtain environmental approval before commencement by submitting initial Environmental Examination and Environmental Impact Assessment reports to the Pak-EPA. Farzana Altaf Shah said the agency had taken a serious notice of the violation of environmental laws and decided to issue notices to the managements of all housing societies and called upon for personal hearing under Section 16 of the Act to ascertain the reasons for non- compliance of the environmental conditions laid down in environmental approvals of each project. ""Until now, the managements of nine such housing societies have been heard by the Pak-EPA and four housing societies have been given the Environmental Protection Orders for violation of environmental conditions. They include Zaraj Housing Group, Margalla View Housing Scheme, Soan Garden Housing Societies and Park view Enclave City, who have been directed to immediately install sewage treatment plants, form environmental managements committees, ensure rainwater harvesting as well as ground water recharging and proper collection and disposal of solid waste,"" she said./The Pak-EPA director general said the housing societies had been directed to stop constructions on their projects until the compliance of the Environmental Protection Orders. She said the Pak-EPA had further decided to file complaints or cases against violators of the laws in the environmental tribunal./The Environmental Tribunal has powers to impose fine and order imprisonments and cancellation of environmental approvals over the continuous violation of environmental laws. Farzana Altaf Shah said the Pak-EPA would take necessary legal action for the protection of the environment in the capital city."
No smoke without fire," The irreversible effects of climate change can be observed throughout the country. It is, therefore, important to take measures to protect the environment from further damage. In this regard, we must identify the factors that are responsible for environmental pollution. One of the primary causes of air pollution in our country is the smoke that is emitted from vehicles./Punjab Environment Protection Minister Begum Zakia Shah Nawaz Khan believes that the environmental protection department and the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHCP) should work together to increase awareness among drivers regarding air pollution and how their vehicles contribute towards it. All drivers and vehicle owners should be informed about the importance of tuning vehicles. It is heartening to note that the two departments will now work jointly to deal with the problem. Such small but meaningful steps will definitely help protect the environment."
EPD restarts issuing warning to industrial units for pollution," In a bid to control air pollution, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has restarted issuing warnings to industrial units including steel industries operating without taking measures to reduce noise and air pollution across the city./Sources in the EPD said that the drive was earlier started after smog had engulfed the city some two months back. Notices and warnings were given to all smoky industrial units and they were directed to introduce wet scrubbers or other mitigating measures at their workplaces to reduce air pollution in two months. Dozens of industrial units were also sealed at the time but later were desealed on the request of the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) that they would follow the environmental rules and regulations in the next two months./'The time has lapsed and now we have restarted inspection of industrial units especially steel mills, furnaces and those who use boilers in their factories to see what they have done to end air pollution,' said Naseemur Rehman, focal person of EPD. He said two units were sealed on Sunday for not installing wet scrubbers to control air pollution. Light and heavy steel industry is developed in northern localities such as Misri Shah, Baghbanpura, Mughalpura, Daroghawala, Bhagatpura, Chah Miran, Shadbagh and other areas along the Bund Road and GT Road while boiler-related industries are mostly established along the Hadyara drain (Ferozpur Road), Sundar Industrial Estate and the Kot Lakhpat Industrial area. The industries included steel foundries, re-rolling mills, furnaces, textile mills, scrap yards. The industries are spreading different types of pollution especially air, noise, vibration and heat. Besides the residential areas, a good number of steel mills and other industrial units are also operating around the historical monuments including the Shalimar Gardens, Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque and the environment department of CDGL has already served notices on 48 mills. A majority of the industries use tyres and substandard rubber products to keep their furnaces alive, said a senior official of EPD while talking to The News. He said air pollution was a key environmental issue of the steel industry which the residents were facing. A major source of air pollution is furnace, which releases pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur oxides and toxic metals. The principal air pollutant in smoke is particulate matter (PM) that includes toxic metal dusts and fumes of lead, chromium, cadmium and zinc, said Dr Nusrat Hashmi. Uncontrolled emissions result in deterioration of air quality, he said, adding that air pollutants restrict photosynthesis, increase respiratory infections, birth defects, acid rains, and lung damage. He said lead and cadmium were also present in the fumes released by furnaces that cause collapse of the central nervous system and degeneration of joints, lung and kidney diseases. On the other hand, hundreds of thousands of residents of north Lahore are facing the threat directly or indirectly and they are approaching different forums to get relief. They said different types of diseases are spreading in the localities with asthma and skin diseases are on top. Sources in EPD said as per the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997, all industrial units i.e. cottage or large industries were supposed to obtain an NOC from the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) but over 90 per cent industrial units were operating without fulfilling the legal formality./Naseemur Rehman said the Punjab government had constituted a dedicated team comprising officers of the industries department and EPD to work on the issue round the clock. He said the government's first priority was to shift the industrial units and in case of failure the department would ensure that the industry concerned should take measures to prevent pollution. He warned that strict action would be taken against those who failed to follow the rules and regulations of EPD while appreciation certificates would be awarded to those who abide by the rules."
"'Climate change, environmental health risks causing deadlier health threats'"," Climate change and environmental health risks associated with it are becoming deadlier, causing millions of deaths every year around the globe yet no serious measures and policies have ever been adopted even after the recent floods and devastating droughts in Thar to minimise the bad effects of the phenomenon./Climate change is posing serious threats from shifting patterns of diseases, from extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and severe storms, droughts and from the degradation of air quality, food and water supplies, and sanitation./According to estimates, in the last few years, millions of people have died of air pollution-related diseases making air pollution the world's largest single environmental health risk. According to various international organizations, over 700 million children are at risk from climate change and a key concern is exposure to diseases that could become deadlier as a result of climate change rising temperatures, including malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition./According to Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry, the health hazards caused by climate change are becoming more and more damaging. He said that human activities have greatly increased greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons, etc that have raised the temperature of the earth, the phenomenon commonly known as Global Warming./Studies reveal that Pakistan is highly susceptible to extreme climatic hazards; particularly recurring floods and droughts. The impact of droughts on agriculture is leading to malnutrition and under-nutrition, which is responsible for half of worldwide deaths of children under five. It is important that human activities that produce greenhouse gases include increasing number of industrial units, combustion of fossil fuels, emissions from power plants and transport vehicles. The effect is becoming worst because of cutting down trees and forests that help us by absorbing carbon dioxide./Dr. Ashraf said Pakistan is one of the countries that are facing adverse effects of climate change particularly global warming. Actions to mitigate climate change, such as shifting to cleaner energy sources, public transport, walking and biking can benefit health./Health experts believe that everybody can participate in the campaign against adverse effects of climate change by reducing the non-renewable sources of energy and increasing use of renewable sources. This will decrease the emission of greenhouse gases./It is believed that everyone can identify ways to reduce energy use and improve health through walking, cycling, using public transport, better waste management and choosing products with smaller carbon impact. Dr. Ashraf said that by walking and using bicycles and public transport instead of personal cars will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and as well improve air quality leading to better respiratory health and fewer premature deaths."
Striking the right balance," In the late 1980s, conservation organisations and practitioners began to realise the benefits of improving the quality of life for people by managing biodiversity and natural resources./These projects were initially referred to as integrated conservation and development projects (ICDP) and addressed a wide variety of community development needs. As the 1990s drew to a close, it was widely believed that the ICDPs were not achieving conservation or development goals as successfully as anticipated. This was because the scope of these projects was often too broad. One of the lessons learned from these attempts was that the success of ICDPs largely depended on the ability to focus on key interventions and avoid excessive complexity. Through the lessons learned from earlier initiatives, the conservation sector decided to adopt the 'population, health and the environment' approach, with a new generation of integrated projects./Programme designers began to realise that efforts to conserve biodiversity in developing countries were far more successful when locals perceived their efforts as serving their economic and cultural interests. This culminated in the integrated development approach. In order to achieve success, these projects had to consider the link between conservation and development objectives in every unique sphere that they were implemented./It is believed that humans and the environment are inextricably linked. Factors such as population size and age; fertility; mobility; settlement patterns; and resource availability and consumption determine the impact that humans have on the environment. Dealing with the complex challenges that we face today demands a better understanding of how these elements impact the environment. We must also recognise how environmental change impacts our health and wellbeing and what can be done to address these issues./Population, health and the environment (PHE) is an approach to human development that integrates family planning and health with conservation efforts to seek synergistic successes for stronger conservation and human welfare outcomes. Issues pertaining to population, health and the environment are interconnected. These challenges are not only related to each other but are also linked to other important concerns./Climate change has affected the people and the environment of Pakistan in different ways. Although Pakistan is a relatively small emitter of greenhouse gases as compared with other countries, the country will, however, be greatly affected by the negative impacts of climate change. According to the Pakistan Economic Survey of 2016-17, the 'increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events coupled with erratic monsoon rains' are the most prominent problems that Pakistan will face due to climate change. The survey concluded that the change in weather patterns has destroyed infrastructure, taken many lives and produced devastating impacts on the agricultural sector. This has, in turn, affected Pakistan's economy./A majority of Pakistan's industrial sectors such as fishing and agriculture that account for more than one-fourth of the output and two-fifths of employment in Pakistan are heavily dependent on the country's natural resources. In order to sustain economic growth, there is a high demand on already scarce natural resources. However, it is ironic that what the country depends on for its growth is also what threatens the future welfare and success of the country./According to the World Bank, 70 percent of Pakistan's population live in rural areas and are already stricken by high poverty levels. These people depend on natural resources to provide income and tend to overuse these resources. This leads to the further degradation of the environment and subsequently increases poverty. This has led to what the World Bank refers to as a 'vicious downward spiral of impoverishment and environmental degradation'./According to the BBC Climate Asia report, a majority of Pakistanis who were surveyed claimed that climate change has adversely impacted their lives as floods and droughts have become frequent occurrences. More importantly, climate change has affected the availability of resources, such as energy and water. Around 53 percent of Pakistanis felt that their lives had become far more challenging than they were five years ago. Although the effects of climate change are evident, the survey found that a majority of the people were unaware of the implications of climate change and 'ascribed changes in climate and extreme weather events to the will of God'./Pakistan's diverse land and climatic conditions is prone to different forms of natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, droughts, cyclones and hurricanes. A disaster management report claims that Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), Balochistan and AJK are vulnerable seismic regions and are highly susceptible to earthquakes. Meanwhile, Sindh and Punjab constantly suffer from floods because they are low-lying areas./Other environmental issues in Pakistan include deforestation, air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, pesticide misuse, soil erosion, natural disasters and desertification. These are serious environmental problems and there is a strong likelihood that they will be exacerbated as the country's economy expands and the population grows./However, little is being done to tackle these issues because the goals of achieving economic growth and tackling terrorism within the country supersede the goals of environmental preservation. Although NGOs and government departments have taken initiatives to stop environmental degradation, Pakistan's environmental issues still remain./The environment in which we live strongly impacts our health. Household, workplace, outdoor and transportation environments all pose health risks in a number of ways. The poor quality of air, which many people breathe, coupled with the hazards related to unsafe water, poor sanitation and hygiene. It is estimated that 24 percent of the global disease burden and 23 percent of all deaths can be attributed to environmental factors. About 36 percent of this burden affects people who are below the age of 14./According to estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory, about 200 deaths per 100,000 population are attributable to environmental factors in Pakistan. The World Bank estimates that Pakistan's annual burden of disease due to outdoor air pollution accounts for 22 000 premature adult deaths. Meanwhile, indoor pollution accounts for 40 million cases of acute respiratory infections and results in 28 000 deaths per year. The WHO Global Health Observatory estimates that about 30 deaths per 100,000 population can be attributed to indoor air pollution while about 25 deaths per 100,000 are an outcome of outdoor air pollution./There is a dire need to increase awareness among decision-makers and professionals about population, health and environmental issues as well as the need to find integrated solutions to these problems. We should strengthen our leadership and capacity to work on and communicate about population, health and the environment. Regional networks should be developed to share information and focus on collaborative ventures. There is a strong need to strengthen reportage on population, health and environmental issues./Improving evidence-based policies will result in greater protection from environmental changes. Such policies will also raise awareness about how people can adapt to environment changes and specify mitigation measures they should adopt. We need technical support to strengthen our institutional capacities and promote the engagement of locals by enhancing their capacities to effectively monitor the quality of water sources that are affected by climate-related extreme events./It is critical to build the institutional capacity of the health sector (at the provincial, district and local levels) in relation to environmental hazards to reinforce surveillance as well as the early detection of infectious diseases. It is equally important to ensure that the provincial authorities are capable of generating and gathering intelligence, establishing early warning systems for environmentally-sensitive diseases and integrating such intelligence into the existing health information management systems."
Fresh air," It is a common saying that big cities have bigger problems. This holds true for Karachi. Although the city has to deal with numerous challenges, tackling air pollution is the one which needs immediate attention. An aerial view of the city will show hundreds of vehicles lined up at a signal. This excessive number of transport on roads is significantly contributing to air pollution. This air pollution is also the primary cause of serious lung diseases. The higher authorities have to come up with a plan to deal with this issue./There is sufficient evidence available to support the fact that the use of public transport reduces air pollution. This is because public transport replaces many emissions-producing private vehicles with few transit vehicles. The relevant department must take steps to improve transportation system of the city to make the environment cleaner and safer."
Harmful factory," The installation of a cement factory in the vicinity of the Margalla Hills was halted after residents took prompt action and approached the Supreme Court to register their complaints. The residents are of the view that waste from the factory will lead to adverse environmental impacts. However, it is incomprehensible how the same factory is now being set up in a village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The authorities haven't considered the adverse environmental impacts of the cement manufacturing industry. The emission of harmful gases and the release of other harmful matter have taken a toll on the health of people. These pollutants are causing serious diseases such as uncontrollable respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal tract infection by inhaling dust, vision complications and asthma attack. These harmful emissions from cement factory are not only hazardous to human health, but also cause acid rains and reduce crop productivity./Harmful emissions from the factory will pollute the atmosphere of villages: Zormandi, Sherkhana, Khurkai, Ghazibaba, Kohi and Sarobi. It must be mentioned that the Swat Expressway will also pass through the village and around 15,000 to 20,000 vehicles will be using it on a daily basis. This will further increase the level of air pollution and the people will have no other choice except to adopt preventive measures such as wearing masks, vaccination against pneumonia and other respiratory ailments and certainly which are beyond the reach of these poor people. These people desperately need a tehsil level hospital where minor surgeries could be done. Does the Imran Khan-led PTI government in KP know the problems that the people of remote villages face on a daily basis? It is hoped that the authorities concerned will look into this matter and ensure that the factory is not established near residential areas."
Pollution onrise in Khanpur due to stone crushing plants," Contrary to the claims made by the provincial environmental protection authorities, air and noise pollution are increasing in Khanpur where stone crushing plants continue to operate contributing to pollution and spreading asthmatic and lungs diseases./The district administration of Haripur has further facilitated the crush owners by removing the speed bumps from Khanpur town, which has increased the dust pollution spreading by the dumpers, but also threatened the life of their children for continuous movement of heavy dumpers and trucks throughout the day and night./The Communication  and  Works Department has removed all seven speed breakers in Khanpur town a few days ago, which was irritating the crush and dumper owners in their mobility. But locals say the speed bumps should not have been removed./Asthma and other respiratory diseases are on the rise in the area. More than 15 stone plants have been blasting and crushing stones in Khanpur, the town once known for citrus fruits. Clouds of dust can be seen hovering over the area where the plants are operating - a proof of lack of adoption of environment-friendly measures by the plants' operators./Malik Muhammad Iqbal, who has lodged his complaint before director general, Environmental Protecting Agency, told The News that due to stone crushing plants in Khanpur, heavy traffic plies the town's roads, not only causing traffic accidents but also spreading lungs diseases. He further said that the government authorities were least bothered to take action against the influential mine owners./Similarly, residents of Khanpur have repeatedly lodged complaints against the illegal movement of heavy and loaded dumpers from 3pm to 7am daily in the residential area of Khanpur town, but the district administration seems to be powerless to take any action. A number of people while requesting anonymity told this correspondent that the movement of dumpers in the residential area created noise and air pollution and also created life threat to the movement of their children./The Industries Department should develop an alternate road if they fail to close the stone crushing units instead of using thickly populated town road for the purpose, they argued. They alleged that local police has been patronising Afghan nationals who run multiple businesses under the banner of stone crushing machines./A pulmonologist, Dr Nisar Khan, said that long-term exposure to polluted air can have bad effects on lungs and causes diseases like asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. High air pollution levels can cause immediate health problems including aggravated cardiovascular and respiratory illness and damaged cells in the respiratory system, he added./Secretary Environment Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Syed Nazar Shah, when contacted by the phone, assured to take up the matter with director general, Environment Protection Agency."
"9 out of 10 people breathe highly polluted air, informs WHO"," New data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants, and an alarming 7 million people die every year from ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution./Through data released on Thursday, WHO has revealed that ambient air pollution alone caused some 4.2 million deaths in 2016, while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused an estimated 3.8 million deaths in the same period./Overall, around 7 million people die every year from exposure to fine particles in polluted air that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections, including pneumonia. More than 90% of air pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, followed by low- and middle-income countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region, Europe and the Americas./The WHO press release informs that around 3 billion people more than 40% of the world's population still do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies in their homes, the main source of household air pollution. WHO has been monitoring household air pollution for more than a decade and, while the rate of access to clean fuels and technologies is increasing everywhere, improvements are not even keeping pace with population growth in many parts of the world./Air pollution is a critical risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), causing an estimated one-quarter (24%) of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25% from stroke, 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29% from lung cancer./More than 4,300 cities in 108 countries are now included in WHO's ambient air quality database, making this the world's most comprehensive database on ambient air pollution. Since 2016, more than 1000 additional cities have been added to WHO's database which shows that more countries are measuring and taking action to reduce air pollution than ever before./Many of the world's megacities exceed WHO's guideline levels for air quality by more than 5 times, representing a major risk to people's health. However, while the latest data show ambient air pollution levels are still dangerously high in most parts of the world, they also show some positive progress. Countries are taking measures to tackle and reduce air pollution from particulate matter. For example, Mexico City has committed to cleaner vehicle standards, including a move to soot-free buses and a ban on private diesel cars by 2025./Major sources of air pollution from particulate matter include the inefficient use of energy by households, industry, the agriculture and transport sectors, and coal-fired power plants. In some regions, sand and desert dust, waste burning and deforestation are additional sources of air pollution./Air pollution does not recognize borders. Improving air quality, WHO believes, demands sustained government action at all levels. Countries need to work together on solutions for sustainable transport, more efficient and renewable energy production and use and waste management./This year, WHO will convene the first Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health (October 30- November 1, 2018) to bring governments and partners together in a global effort to improve air quality and combat climate change."
Death in the air," The cost of pollution in human lives is often abstract due to the long-term nature of such deaths. The cost, however, is quite concrete: A new report estimates that 4.1 million people died as a result of ambient air pollution in 2016. And that's a conservative estimate./Globally, only five causes of death took a higher toll. (High blood pressure and smoking were the leading causes.)/That sobering report was issued this month by teams of researchers at the Health Effects Institute and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Their report, State of Global Air 2018, sought to analyze worldwide air pollution exposures and health impacts; data for 2016 is used because that is the most recent data available. The report states:/'Worldwide exposure to PM2.5 contributed to 4.1 million deaths from heart disease and stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections in 2016. PM2.5 was responsible for a substantially larger number of attributable deaths than other more well-known risk factors (such as alcohol use, physical inactivity, or high sodium intake) and for an equivalent number of attributable deaths as high cholesterol and high body mass index. Ozone, another important component of outdoor air pollution, whose levels are on the rise around the world, contributed to 234,000 [additional] deaths from chronic lung disease.'/'PM2.5' refers to particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter. Because particle pollution can travel deep into the lungs and cause or aggravate heart and lung diseases, there are numerous health hazards associated with it, including reduced lung function, development of respiratory diseases in children, aggravation of existing lung diseases and premature death of people with lung diseases, according to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency overview that the Trump administration appears to not have gotten around to censoring. Sources include incomplete combustion, automobile emissions, dust and industrial activity./This pollution is a global problem the State of Global Air 2018 report notes that 95 percent of the world's population lives in areas exceeding World Health Organization guidelines for healthy air, and almost 60% live in areas that do not meet even the WHO's least-stringent air quality target. That widespread pollution adds up. The report states that 'In 2016, long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 contributed to 4.1 million deaths and to a loss of 106 million [disability-adjusted life-years], making PM 2.5 exposure responsible for 7.5% of all global deaths and 4.4% of all global DALYs.' (The term 'DALY' refers to losses of healthy life and are calculated as the sum of the years of life lost from a premature death and the years lived with disability.)/Different countries have different source characteristics. In China, for example, industrial coal, transportation and residential biomass burning are the major sources of deaths attributable to air pollution, accounting for more than 400,000 deaths. In India, residential biomass burning is by far the single biggest culprit, responsible for an estimated 268,000 deaths. China has recently begun to slowly reverse an earlier rise in air-pollution deaths, but these remain on the increase in India. The report estimates that India could avoid up to 1.2 million deaths in 2050 through instituting more aggressive measures rather than simply keeping current practices in place./The actual global total of 4.1 million might actually be an under-estimate. The report says its calculation does not include causes of death and disability for which evidence for a causal relationship with exposure to ambient PM2.5 is growing, such as the development of asthma in children, low birth weight and pre-term birth, type 2 diabetes and neurological disorders."
A vote for the environment," The next general elections in Pakistan are right round the corner; they are most likely to be held sometime in July 2018. Starting from the sitting governments in the centre and provinces and going back to the mid-1980s, our experience tells that almost all the previously elected civilian and military governments have shown complete indifference towards the daily environmental challenges that over 200 million Pakistanis face./A pretty much similar attitude has been of our concerned organisations, elected representatives, local government officials, media, and the general public. This has been largely so due to our ignorance towards the devastating consequences and implications environmental challenges pose to not only human health, but also to animals and the rest of the ecosystem. Lets briefly describe some of the environmental issues which threaten human health, cause discomfort and disruption in our daily lives, and at times even death./Clean air, for one, is an absolute essential requirement for a healthy life. Does the quality of air in most of our major urban centres and their suburban, peri-urban areas meet international standards? As per the World Health Organisation, the answer is negative. WHO maintains that in Pakistan the mean annual concentration of fine dust particles (PM2.5) is 60 micro-grams per cubic metre of air, against the permitted level of 15 micro-grams per cubic metre, which means it is four times higher than the set standard. The Pakistan Air Quality Initiative's (PAQI) 2018 report has revealed that the PM2.5 concentration in Peshawar is 111, Rawalpindi 107, Karachi 88, Lahore 68 and Islamabad 66 micro-grams per cubic metre of air./The report further states that every year 59,241 deaths are caused by air pollution in Pakistan. WHO surveyed 1,600 cities of the world in 2013 to monitor their air quality data. Three Pakistani cities, Karachi, Peshawar and Rawalpindi, were placed as the 5th, 6th, and 7th most polluted cities of the world respectively. Ironically, in WHO's 2016 report air quality survey conducted in 3,000 cities Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Karachi were declared the 2nd, 4th, and the 14th most polluted cities among the world respectively. This is not all, because apart from the particulate matter (PM2.5  and  PM10), gases like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and lead are also, to a great deal, responsible for affecting the health of humans and animals, and the ecosystem./Besides air pollution, water, noise and plastic pollution, solid waste mismanagement, impacts of climate change, untenable economic development, deforestation, urbanisation, scarcity of drinking water, and excessive emission of greenhouse gases, are all responsible for the direct and indirect negative impacts on human beings. Like in most developing nations, in Pakistan too environmental degradation and its unpleasant, uncomfortable and unhealthy consequences are never considered a high priority issue. It is left on the nature to correct itself over time./After clean air, the second most essential requirement for human survival is clean drinking water. According to a review article published by Daud and 11 others in 2017, in a biomedical research journal, safe drinking water is available to just about 20 percent of Pakistan's entire population, while the remaining 80 percent are constrained to consuming unsafe drinking water. People in Pakistan consume drinking water from both surface and underground sources. The sources of contamination include sewage, toxic chemicals from industrial effluents, pesticides and fertilisers discharged into drinking water sources./Resultantly, waterborne diseases such as typhoid, hepatitis, giardiasis, diarrhoea, worms, gastroenteritis and other communicable infectious diseases constitute 80 percent of all diseases and 30 percent deaths. A 2010 World Bank publication titled 'The Cost of Environmental Degradation' made this horrific revelation that Pakistan spends Rs1 billion every day as the cost for ignoring and neglecting environmental degradation./Providing safe and nutritious food at affordable costs to people of all social classes is the responsibility of the governments, but both raw and processed food, beverages, dairy products, cooking oil, spices, tea leaves, and vegetables etc, are more often than not adulterated. Thus, unfit for human use. Besides, in none of Pakistan's major cities, including in the federal and provincial capitals, does a proper solid waste management system exist to date. According to the Pakistan Renewable Energy Society, about 20 million tons of solid waste is generated each year across the country. But only 50 to 60 percent is collected and disposed of in open dumping sites. The waste is not even segregated into recyclable, reusable and compostable materials. Almost half of the waste is left on the site to rot, resulting in stench and diseases which are spread through flying insects./Small and large manufacturing units related to the textile and leather industry, cement factories, brick kilns, stone crushing factories, mining activities, construction and demolition, car-wash facilities, smoke and noise from vehicular traffic, toxic and hazardous waste from hospitals and maternity homes, changes in status of lands from agriculture or forest land to housing societies, all need to be regulated by governments through their line departments or other organisation. The 70-year history of Pakistan and the role of its various governments has made it amply evident that not enough has been done about environmental hazards, and people continue to suffer./Perhaps now is the time to tell our political parties, leaders and opinion-makers to 'do more'. It is an appeal to the electorate to carefully evaluate how many political parties incorporate and prioritise such environmental issues in their election manifestos, and what strategies do they formulate to overcome human miseries instead of their rhetorical narratives. We wish to see a clean, green, healthy and environment friendly and prosperous Pakistan at the turn of this decade."
Seminar on climate advocacy held at NUML," The climate awareness among university youth would help develop vibrant corps of sensitised citizens, said Munir Ahmed, environmentalist and climate advocacy expert, Devcom-Pakistan Director at a seminar organised by the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) on Friday./He said according to a study conducted by the Devcom-Pakistan recently 95.4 per cent residents of Islamabad have seen radical changes in the city over a period of three decades. The changes included the loss of vegetation and green belts, shortage of water, increase in environment unfriendly housing units, increase in traffic on the roads that have created a mess and leaving no space in the parking lots, increase air pollution that has led to several diseases including breathing, inhaling and eye infections./The Director Devcom said the increase in temperature has changed the life style of the residents. The use of electric home appliances and room-cooling machines has immensely enhanced the emission of the Greenhouse Gases while on the other hand the loss of green cover has enhanced the impact of the increased local temperature./Referring to the study, he said the rise of the diseases in the city of Islamabad is also one of the worse effects of the climate change. The shortage of public medical hospitals has multiplied the miseries of the locals. The unavailability of clean drinking water has further deteriorated the health of the poor and marginalised living in the suburbs of the federal capital./The residents said that now the frequency of their illness has increased to 4-5 times over the period of two decades. While the availability of clean drinking water has decreased up to three-time less than what they had been getting 10-20 years back."
Air pollution causing 9m deaths worldwide," In recent times, the effects of air pollution on health has attracted increasing interest ,with international institutions providing growing mortality and morbidity data. The latest annual estimation of deaths attributable to air pollution worldwide is 9 million deaths./'These deaths are related to cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, neurological events such as stroke, lung diseases and cancer,' Prof. Dr. Arsalan Ahmad, Consultant Neurologist at Shifa International Hospital (SIH) stated while quoting the World Federation of Neurology on the occasion of this year's World Brain Day (WBD). The topic of this year's WBD is 'Clean Air for Healthy Brain,' and the objective is to raise awareness on the influence of air pollution on neurological diseases./SIH, together with the Pakistan Society of Neurology (PSN) Saturday organized an awareness campaign to mark World Brain Day here on Saturday. Addressing the participants, Dr. Arsalan said, long-term exposure to relatively high levels of certain chemicals in workplace air has resulted in many examples of nervous system damage over the past century. In addition to air pollution, occupational and residential air pollution and water pollution may also be an emerging issue./Dr. Arsalan discussed the impacts of air pollution on brain health. He said recent publications have shown evidence for air pollution as a stroke risk. The recent Global Burden of Disease study, for example, has investigated data from 1990 to 2013 in 188 countries. It demonstrated that air pollution contributes to up to 30% to the burden of stroke. The adverse effects of air pollution are most important in low and medium-income countries and for vulnerable patients with other vascular risk factors or a prior history of stroke. Stroke is the leading cause of disability, the second cause of death in people older than 60 years, one of the main reasons for hospitalization, and a risk factor for dementia as well./The list of possible air pollution and environmental pollution adverse effects is increasing. Neuro-developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, possibly also neuroinflammatory diseases, are discussed among others as having a potential association with polluted air, he added./Dr. Arsalan, in his concluding remarks, said that air pollution and environmental pollution is a potentially modifiable risk factor for some cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases."
Call to check rising lethal pollution," Pollution is rapidly increasing across the globe, as a result of which, mortality rate has significantly gone up./According to a research, around nine million people die due to air pollution. There are different kinds of pollution which cause various diseases. We all have to keep the environment clean, and individual efforts are required in this regard./These views were expressed by the speakers at a seminar on ""Clean Air for Brain Health"" jointly organised by Pakistan Society of Neurology and Research Laboratories and Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman Memorial Society (Jang Group of Newspapers)./The speakers were King Edward Medical University Professor Dr Muhammad Nasrullah, Pakistan Society of Neurology President Dr Muhammad Athar Javaid, Professor Dr Ahsan Numan, Pakistan Society of Neurology General Secretary Dr Muhammad Nasrullah./Dr Nasrullah said, 'Almighty Allah has blessed us with various gifts, including sunlight, fresh air and pure water.' He said people were sufferings from skin diseases and lethal diseases. Treatment of diseases is very costly. Everyone is affected by pollution, he said./Prof Dr Muhammad Athar Javaid said that harmful particles in the air polluted the environment. There are two types of pollution; one is indoor pollution and the other is outdoor pollution. Carpet, paint, etc, are major sources of pollution. According to a study, 50 percent children die because of pneumonia which is because of indoor pollution. It is observed that majority of mothers work in kitchens while carrying their children, which is not good for the health of the children, said Athar./There are two types of environmental pollution; one is natural and the other is caused by humans. When a forest catches fire, it causes natural pollution while the pollution caused by humans is the smoke emitting from industrial units, power plants and vehicles, he said./A research revealed that 4.3 million people died of household pollution in 2012 and 3.7 million people died because of outdoor pollution, shared Athar. Dr Nasrullah said that, according to report of 2016, 99 per cent deaths were caused by household pollution and 89 per cent died by air pollution. Physical and brain health is affected by air pollution, said Nasrullah. Air pollution causes the diseases of Parkinson's, paralysis and memory loss./Dr Ahsan Numan said, 'We should wear mask while going out of home. We should avoid bio-mass fuel. We should grow more plants in the country.' All stakeholders, including civil society and journalists, should come forward to reduce pollution in the country, he said./Jang Senior Editor, Health, Education and Current Affairs Wasif Nagi said clean air was necessary for human health. Lahore's environment was clean in the Mughal Era, shared Wasif Nagi. As the population of Lahore increased, the environment of the city got polluted. The media should do programmes on health rather than giving coverage to politics all the time./He said that it was alarming that people burn tires during protests which increased pollution. It is harmful for the health of people. He said the buildings constructed in the era of British were still durable and airy./He said the environment was no more human-friendly. The government needs to devise new policy for the health of people in the country, he concluded. Dr Kashif Haidar Rizvi and Muhammad Ahmad Gulzar also spoke on the occasion."
Harmful crackers," To celebrate every occasion, people use firecrackers without realising the ramifications of this practice. Firecrackers do not have a bad impact on the environment, but they also damage the hearing ability of living beings. In almost every house, there are aged people and young infants and the massive amount of crackers can cause serious health problems to them including lung diseases. Firecrackers also disturb birds and other animals, startling them and forcing them to go someplace else. It is important to mention that firecrackers comprise toxic material including lead and copper. Therefore, when these chemicals are burnt, they emit harmful fumes that cause air pollution./It is hoped that the government and the authorities concerned will have look into this issue and take appropriate decision to ban firecrackers in the country."
Chemical manufacturing firms urged to follow precautionary measures," A large number of people die due to the unsafe use of chemicals in agriculture, electronics, textile and other industries. Chemical manufacturing firms should strictly follow precautionary measures introduced by the government./These views were expressed by experts at an awareness seminar on safe handling and disposal of dyes organised by the Department of Chemistry at the University of Karachi (KU). The keynote speakers included sustainability consultant Nazish Shekha, textile consultant Dr Sitara Rashid, World Health Organization consultant Dr Farhana Abdul Rauf, dermatologist Dr Qaisra Mansoor and Dr Iffat Zehra./In her address, Professor Dr Shazia Nisar informed the participants that the Chemistry department has started a project to document the use of dyes in products that result in increased allergies, skin lacerations and metal imbalances as well as dyes that are carcinogenic./She said that the faculty and experts will train students to enable them to identify such dyes that cause dangerous diseases. The students will use a questionnaire for research that is focused on how vendors use dyes in local communities, she added./Other speakers emphasised that there is a dire need to implement safety measures to counter dangerous side effects and consequences of chemicals on our health as well as the environment. When different chemical products are burnt, this emits dangerous smoke which causes air pollution and harmful effects on human health, they said."
Complete text of Imran Khan's maiden speech," Prime Minister Imran Khan Sunday shared his vision for the 'Naya Pakistan' that focuses on rooting out corruption, providing swift justice, reviving economy and supremacy of the law, to materialize his dream of a welfare state like that of Madina./In his maiden 70-minute long address to the nation, aired by all national news channels, the prime minister spelt out at length his plans for the reformation of the country, that has been mired in over Rs 28,000 billion loans in the past decade./Imran Khan while giving a brief outline about the current dismal state of things, where the national economy was in a shambles, and all sectors were in decline, said instead of begging foreign countries for loans, the people of Pakistan needed to sacrifice and stand on their own feet. He made an impassioned appeal to the overseas Pakistanis to send in their remittances through banking channels and have their US dollar accounts in Pakistani banks to bolster the country's forex reserves./Complete text of Imran Khan's speech:/""First of all, I want to thank all my workers who started with me in this movement and jihad 22 years ago. There are two types of politics one in which one would do his pursue his career, and the second, my role model, Qa'eda-e-Azam, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who conducted politics for a mission, that our prophet Hazrat Muhammad brought revolution in the world's history by creating state of Madinah. I never thought of this politics as a career and profession. 22 years ago I joined politics with the mission to make my country, that way made as an Islamic welfare state envisioned by Allama Muhammad Iqbal which have been showcased in the comity of nations that what is real Islam. I am remembering those colleagues, especially those two who started with me, Ahsan Rasheed, and Saloni Bukhari, they joined me in this mission at the beginning and are no more in this world.I pay tributes to the workers, who walked with me even during difficult times, who were teased , people used to argue with them that which tonga party they are associated with. Thanks to all these workers. Without all these people I could not reach here today. First of all, I put it in front of my people that where we stand today and what challenges we are facing as a nation. I will also give solution of these challenges. In the history of Pakistan economic conditions were not as bad as are today. Presently, Pakistan is burdened with a loan of Rs 28000 billion, while 10 years ago, the loan of Pakistan was Rs. 6 thousand billion, that our debt in the 60 years history. Rs. 6 thousand billion increased up to Rs 15,000 billion in 2013. And today this loan has reached Rs 28,000 billion. Debt of 60 years of domestic history is on one side and the last 10 years loan is on the other. /InshaAllah, we will bring facts before you where that money has gone. What have been done with that money? Secondly, today we are borrowing money to pay the interest n those loans. In the last year of the previous PPP government foreign debt was $ 2 billion, in the past one year, we are borrowing $ 2 billion each month and when the Pakistan People's Party government ended in 2013 our foreign debt went to 60 billion, which is $ 95 billion today and that is the real problem of our country that our overseas debt has increased so much and the main reason for the highest pressure on rupees is that ours Foreign loans grew so fast and we have reached today that we are facing difficulty to return back those loans. I will also come up with the solution as to how to resolve this issue. No need to be afraid of this situation. The second thing I want to tell you is that there are so many loans on us and second I want to tell you that on the other hand there exists a society around us that spends on humans and now I want t ell you what is the condition of human beings here and this is not ( juts being said by)Imran Khan, but it is a report of ""UNDP"" . According to this report Pakistan is among those 5 countries in which most of our children die before the age of 5 due to diseases caused by contaminated water . Pakistan is also included in top 5 countries of the world where rate of female mortality is very high . unfortunately, we are among the top 5 countries in the world where children Die because of mal nutrition resulted in stunted growth. /I have been telling people till today, but people have not understood. Today I show you a picture that shows a 2-year-old child on one side who is is getting nourishing food, and has normal mental healthl and on the other hand, a child of 2 years has been shown with insufficient diet. His brain has not been growing completely .We are talking about 45 percent of Pakistan's children, that is, almost every other Pakistani child, suffers from this disease. I am worried because we are not able to give them food completely and they are not getting nutrition too, and thus they have left behind in the race of life. They can not compete.They can not move forward in the 21st century . what were feelings of parents of those children I am telling you just to make you realize that where are we standing in this regard and how we will change our way Insha ALLaha . The Prime Minister stated that there are two paths in front of us, one which we have been following and reached here, nation in debt, which has no money to spend on its children, to raise the standard of living of its people, to help its farmers, which cannot provide clean drinking water to its citizens even children. We cannot give jobs, debts are on the rise, on the other hand is the path of which I will tell you how to reach. Another shameful thing for us is that on the one hand are these conditions and on the other, is the life style of those in power. Pakistan's Prime Minister has 524 workers, 80 cars, of which 33 are bullet proof. /The price of each is more than Rs.5 crore; helicopters, aeroplanes; the Prime Minister House is spread over 1100 canals, we have Governor Houses, Rest Houses, Chief Ministers' Houses they have cars, Secretaries 100 have 2/3 cars. Our D.Cs, Commissioners reside in large residences. On one hand is the nation in debt which cannot spend on its citizens and on the other hand are those in power who live as the Britishers lived during their rule. They, like our rulers, built huge Governor Houses. We were (their) slaves then, but now that we are free we continue to live in the same manner. We are not worried that we cannot meet the basic needs of our people, look at our life style. Just consider that the Prime Minister spent 65 crores on his foreign tours. Why do they go abroad? Where does this money go? The budget of Speaker National Assembly was 16 crores; what do they do? are they going to conquer some country. Today I am presenting all these things in front of you, because I want you to realize that if we continue thus, we are heading towards disaster. Allah also says in the Quran that he does not change the condition of a nation if it does not make an effort itself We will have to change our thinking. we will have to invoke kindness in our hearts as half our population cannot even get 2 times meals. /We cannot feed 45% of Pakistan's children. If we do not change our way of thinking what will become of our 2.5 billion out of school children. If our population continues to increase and we cannot educate our children then obviously they will not be able to get livelihood, if conditions remain so, who will solve the water issue. We are faced with another problem that is environmental change. Pakistan is 7th among countries affected by this phenomenon. I will again ask you to change. There is only one role model who we all Muslims follow and Allah in the Quran too asks us to learn from his life. Prophet Mohammad united the pagan Arabs Tribes who used to fight with each other They had 2 super powers on either side Romans and Persians. This great leader brought together these warring tribes and within the span of few years transformed them into a great nation. What were those elements? I would like to share with you which ever nation follows those principles rises. These are the principles adopted by the West rule of law, protects weak against the powerful A civilization that adopts these principles rises (among nations). The Prophet said that he would punish even his daughter, if she broke the law. Hazrat Ali lost a case to a Jewish citizen, in the Court. This shows that all are equal in the eyes of law and minorities have equal rights. /The Prime Minister mentioned Zakat money paid according to position. The concept of progressive taxation is present even in the West Norway, Sweden, Denmark. Provision of education to poor, justice are principles which were present in the State of Madina. Hazrat Umar one said that he would be responsible even if a dog went to sleep hungry. A leader should be Sadiq and Ameen. This is in America and Britian The American President was ousted for lying. In Madina, all Khulfa were honest and trustful. They presented themselves for accountability. Once Hazrat Umar was asked about his clothes, which means that even rulers were accountable to public. When Hazrat Abu Bakr become Khalifa, he closed down his clothes' shop as he realized that his being in thatposition will be disadvantageous for his counterparts. Such laws are present in the West but have we can compare what those who come to power had and what they have. These people come only to make money. But this is not so in the West. Those democracies which have progressed do not allow such practices i.e to mint money when in power. This was the law in practice in the State of Madina, 1400 years ago. After war of Badr, the Prophet gave emphasis on education. When he said that every slave who would educate 10 salves would be set free. Telling the world that without education nations cannot progress. But look at us, our 2.5 billion children are out of school. /The West is spending a lot on education, the principles which were made 1400 years ago in Madina are in practice in the West but not by us. We are not following any of the principles for which this country was made. It was not established for the reason that hindus were moneyed or now Muslims have a lot, but it was the vision of Allama Iqbal who I consider to be the greatest Muslim in 500 years, we will put into practice the principles on which the Prophet built his State. Let me show you what we will do now. I was told that I cannot become Captain or a bowler, hospital cannot be made, and University cannot be established in private sector in rural area, there cannot be a third party in the two-party system. I have been hearing this throughout my life, but I have learnt to fight such challenges. You all will be my team; I will fight against these things,I will not live in PM house but in these two the 3 bedroom Military Secretary's House. Will use 2 servants and 2 vehicles two on account of security considerations. I had wanted to stay in my own house to cut government expenses but am going to reside here as there are threats to my life according to security agencies We will auction the vehicles. Businessmen will be invited to purchase these expensive vehicles. /The money will be deposited in the national treasury. I plan to introduce simplicity in all Governor and Chief Minister Houses. We will reduce expenditure and inform public accordingly. No Governor will stay in Governor Houses. A Committee of has been formed to decide their fate. I intend to convert Prime Minister House into a Research University where reputable scholars will be called. A Task Force under guidance of Dr. Ishrat Hussain which will ensure austerity in every department. I want to state that we have this habit of asking foreign countries for loans, wish any qualms. Our leaders ask for money from one or the other, IMF No country can proper in this way. Loans are for a short time. Germany and Japan after world war took loan for a particular time and eventually were able to stand on their own felt. We have to stand on our own feet. Things cannot continue like this anymore, besides others are not willing to provide loans. I asked for money for Shaukat Khannum from my countrymen. /It will be shameful for me and you if I ask some other country for money. A nation which has self respected is respected by others. Pakistanis are after made to one while other nationals easily pass (through immigration at airports). It is unfortunate. It is our own fault not others. He said it was unfortunate that only 800,000 people of 200 million pay taxes and resolved to revive the public trust in the Federal Board of Revenue to ensure spending of people's tax money on their own. The Prime Minister advised the people to pay taxes religiously as tax evaders did nothing but to hurt the country and burden the poor. He announced to constitute a high-powered task force to ensure the repatriation of money stashed abroad through money laundering or other illegal means. He quoted a US State Department's report saying the black money worth Rs 1,000 billion was transferred abroad annually from Pakistan. He urged the masses not to elect a leader running businesses abroad and questioned as to how a person could be loyal to Pakistan and his people while having his own interests in other countries. PM announced that his government would take all-out measures to uplift national industry to boost exports, besides facilitating the SME sector and investors through one-widow operations. He said he would direct the embassies to find out Pakistani expatriates languishing in jails abroad and reasons behind their imprisonment so that they could be helped out. /He urged the overseas Pakistanis to invest their money in Pakistan or deposit in US dollar accounts as the country direly needed the same to address the imbalance of payment. He also urged them to send their remittances through banks to help the country in the trying time. To cleanse the country of corruption, he said the National Accountability Bureau would be strengthened by extending all-out assistance and funding. Moreover, the government would also introduce whistleblowers act across the country as it had done in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to award the informers of any embezzlement of public money. The prime minister said he would keep the portfolio of Interior ministry with him to deal with the issues of money laundering and those related to the Federal Investigation Agency. He said following the crackdown by the government, those involved in corrupt practices would make hue and cry, and propaganda of imperiling the democracy. 'But you should stand by me. Either the country will survive or the corrupt people,' he resolved. Imran said in order to reform the judicial system and ensure speedy disposal of civil cases within a year, the government would amend the law and requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan to hear the cases involving widows on priority. He said the government would also send lawyers' teams to prisons to know about the ordeals of poor prisoners as in some cases the poor people languished in jails just for not affording to hire counsel. /The prime minister said his government was keen and committed to bring about police reforms in other provinces with the help of respective provincial governments just like the PTI-led government had introduced in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the PTI registered triumph in the general election in KP due to the reason that its government had made the police force to function on professional lines. He credited former inspector general of police Nasir Durrani for making the reforms feasible in the province. He said Durrani had agreed to accept an advisory role for bringing about the much needed reforms in the Punjab police. The federal government would also work with the Sindh government in that regard. He stated with regret about the rise in the child-abuse cases and referred to the heinous incident in Kasur. He dropped a hint that his government would take strict action over such cases while the Ministry of Human Rights would focus on it. About reforms in the education sector, Imran Khan said efforts would be made to improve the education standards in the government schools where the situation was not satisfactory. He said he knew how salaried people managed to send their children to private institutions to get quality education with their meager resources and by doing dual jobs. Prime Minister Imran stressed that they would have to raise standard of education in the government schools and deal with the issue of 22.5 million children out of school. /The proposal for running the dual shifts in the government schools was also under consideration, he added. He said the children studying in Madaris should also get the quality education and should be afforded opportunities to excel in different fields of life. About his other priority, he said a task force would be formed to improve the conditions in government-run hospitals. He acknowledged that in the government hospitals, bringing about swift reforms was a difficult task, however, the government was determined to take drastic steps in other provinces as it had taken in the KP. All the countrymen would be given the facility of Sehat Insaf Card in the shape of free medical services of up to Rs 500,000 at government and private health institutions like the one already introduced in the KP. He noted that the country was facing the water scarcity issues, which were impacting the rural areas and the agriculture sector. He underscored the importance of imparting proper and adequate knowledge to farmers about the use of the latest agriculture technologies, so that their crop yield could be increased without burdening them financially. He also highlighted the importance of agri-research, besides proper water rationalizing by the famers' community. The prime minister maintained that the construction of Bhasha Dam was must to face the emerging water related problems. He also lauded the Chief Justice of Pakistan for taking the initiative in that regard./The government, he said, would support all efforts to collect funds for the construction of dam with the help of expatriates. Regarding the role of civil servants in running the government affairs and accomplishment of its policies, the prime minister hinted that he would re-introduce the merit policy. He regretted that the political interferences and lack of merit policy had impinged upon the functioning of the civil service, which was once regarded as the backbone of the country. The civil service required reformation, he said and assured that there would be no interference from the PTI government. The honest and dedicated people would be accorded due respect and protection no matter whatsoever they had the political affiliations, he added. The prime minister reiterated that ordinary man should be treated equally in the society and given the due rights. He referred to Right to Public Service Act of KP, where bonuses were announced for the departments who delivered on time whereas the others, who failed to achieve the targets, were penalized. Imran said the local government system introduced in the KP had transferred powers to the grassroots level and the same would now be would be strengthened across the country. /He said plans were afoot in which the district nazims would be elected directly, so that there should be checks and balances. Giving an example of the Punjab province, he said in the past, all resources were accumulated in office of chief minister, and the MNAs and MPAs were given the development funds. The prime minister also unveiled his plans to construct five million low cost housing units which would create immense job opportunities for the youth as at least 50 industries would be directly benefitted from such investment. He said energies would be devoted on skill development of the youth, besides, provision of interest free loans so that they could set up their personal businesses. About the role of games in the lives of youth, the prime minister said sports facilities with proper playgrounds would be constructed for the youth across the country. For the families' recreation, parks with all facilities would be provided. The prime minister also noted with concern the issue of global warming which was affecting the country. /The government would kick-start a massive tree plantation campaign all over the country to turn Pakistan green, and in that campaign, the youth would be involved. He also enumerated the environmental challenges posed by air and water pollution. He mentioned Karachi and Lahore which were affected with air pollution, besides facing the recurring issue of garbage dunes. He said campaigns would be launched to clean sea and environment which was one of his major targets. The prime minister expressed the confidence that after five years, there would be a different Pakistan. He said Pakistan was bestowed with huge tourism potential as he was one among few Pakistanis who had toured the country thoroughly. He announced that every year, four new tourist resorts would be opened to promote tourism industry. He especially mentioned the tourism potential of sea beaches and said Karachi and Gwadar beaches would be developed. The prime minister said the government would fast track the merger of tribal areas with the KP to improve the living conditions in those areas which were hard hit by the militancy and terrorism in the past. /He said the local government elections would be arranged in those areas though it was not an easy task but there was no other way. He also emphasized to develop the Balochistan province by bringing back all the estranged elements in the mainstream of life. About the South Punjab province, he said it should be created. He also linked the country's progress with the economic activities in Karachi and said for maintaining law and order there, the police reforms would be introduced with the support of the provincial government. The prime minister said the 20-point National Action Plan as agreed upon by all the political parties would be fully implemented. There would be no national progress without peace and tranquility, he added. The prime minister maintained they would strive to improve relations with all the neighbouring countries. He said it was his vision to make Pakistan 'a real welfare state' with full attention paid to pathetic conditions of street children, widows and the handicapped. Imran Khan said they had to differentiate between the human society and the life led by animals. It was the human compassion, pity and sympathy which made it distinct from the animal world, he added. /The prime minister laid stress upon emulating the principles as laid down by Hazrat Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in the creation of Madina state. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) paid full attention to lift the conditions of his people, he added. The prime minister resolved to lead a simple life marked with austerity and to fully safeguard the public money. He said he would not do any business while in office and called upon the people to identify and discourage those who stole away the public money. He said the elements, who stashed away the public money, were also his enemies though he had no personal grudge against them. It was their collective responsibility to halt such elements, he said and referred to efficacy of the social media in that regard. The prime minister said they had to save the country by giving it a top priority. He said it was his vision that one day would dawn upon the country when there would be no person to avail the Zakat money and it would be in a position to lend financial support to other deserving countries. /The prime minister at the outset thanked all the workers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), who had stood with him during the last 22 years of his political struggle. He also paid rich tribute to late PTI workers Ahsan Rasheed and Saloni Bukhari, who, he said, stood with him in the struggle even at a time when some people used to ridicule and call the PTI a 'Tanga' party. Imran Khan said his struggle was not aimed at achieving a political career but was a mission as the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was his role model. His 22-year struggle was aimed at turning Pakistan into a state like Madina created by Hazrat Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). The Holy Prophet (PBUH) brought a revolution and led the world. He said the country at present was facing multiple challenges, particularly economic problems. Pakistan today owed a huge debt of Rs 28,000 billion as against Rs 6,000 billion ten years back. The he country's debt reached from Rs 6,000 billion in 2008 to Rs 13,000 billion and Rs 28,000 billion, respectively, in 2013 and 2018. /He vowed to tell the nation why this huge amount of loans was taken during the last ten years and how it was spent. 'Today, we are in a situation, when we have to borrow even for debt-servicing.' The prime minister said the PPP during its first year of government took loans worth $ 2 billion. Now the country required $ 2 billion a month for debt-servicing as the foreign debt had reached to US $ 95 billion in 2018 from US $ 60 billion in 2013, causing depreciation of rupee against dollar. Imran Khan said at one hand there was huge debt and on the other, there was a poor Human Development Index (HDI). He said according to a UNDP report, Pakistan was among the five countries with the highest rate of infant mortality due to contaminated water intake; women mortality during pregnancy and delivery, stunted growth of children due to malnutrition. The prime minister said with 45% stunted growth every second child in two years of age in Pakistan was facing malnutrition. With a country owing heavy debt, he made a comparison of two classes of society including the ones who did not have resources to spend on their children and were deprived of basic facilities, and the second ones were the ruling elite who were leading luxury lives. /Imran Khan said that there were 524 persons to serve the prime minister at the 1100-Kanal PM House, coupled with 80 cars, including 33 bulletproof ones having price of Rs 50 million each, besides helicopters and an aeroplane. He also mentioned the huge and luxurious state buildings like governor houses, CM houses, rest houses, residences of secretaries, commissioners, DCs etc. 'At one hand the nation was burdened with debt and on the other, we have the elite. This system was created by the British during the colonial era to rule the masses, but even after independence the same practice was being followed,' Imran Khan remarked. He said the former Prime Minister (Nawaz Sharif) spent Rs 650 million on foreign trips and the Speaker National Assembly out of Rs 160 million budget spent Rs 80 million on foreign visits. 'If we did not mend our ways, then we will be heading towards a disaster. We have to be compassionate, as there are people (in our country) who struggle hard for two meals a day; and 45% children are facing malnutrition,' he said and added, 'We will have to review our thinking.' /The prime minister said with 22.5 million out-of-school children, water scarcity and global warming issues, the country required serious efforts to tackle the challenges. Imran Khan said Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) was a role model as he, at a time when there were two super powers of Roman and Persian empires, succeeded in uniting those Arabs who used to live in tribes and often fought with one another and turned them into a great nation in a few years. He said the principles of a welfare state introduced by Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) were being followed and implemented by the West. He said the rule of law was the first principle without which no nation could move forward, adding, ""Our Holy Prophet had declared that even if her daughter broke the law she would be punished."" Similarly, Hazrat Umar (RA) and Hazrat Ali (RA) presented themselves for accountability, he added. The prime minister said the system of Zakat (in Islam) was a progressive taxation. The Scandinavian countries, including Norway, Sweden and Denmark, were following a system in which the richer paid more and that money was used for the welfare of the poor and the provision of basic facilities for the masses."
"As Karachi deals with unsanitary conditions, Sepa DG says mayor and DMCs responsible for cleanliness"," As the smell of decomposing offal dumped in the open over the Eid break and burning garbage filled the air on Friday, the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) stated that it had 'no role and responsibility' in improving the city's environment as the disposal of animal remains, lifting garbage and ensuring sanitation was the responsibility of the city government./'We can only do studies and issue advisories on overall environment, but these advisories and studies are not limited to poor hygienic conditions in the city,' Muhammad Saleem Raza, the newly-appointed director general of Sepa, told The News when asked about the deterioration of the environment due to poor hygienic conditions in Karachi./'The deterioration of environment due to lack of cleanliness is the responsibility of the Mayor and District Municipal Corporations. We [Sepa] cannot be held responsible for that,' he said. SEPA is an environmental watchdog and a regulatory body created with the objective to curb air, water, soil and marine pollution, keep an eye over various authorities and industries and prosecute those who are responsible for creating pollution in the province./The DG said Sepa officials were 'having an off' over the Eid break and the Karachi mayor and the DMCs should be asked about the unsanitary conditions./However, public health experts and environmentalists held Sepa responsible for the poor air quality, the potential outbreak of diseases, including gastroenteritis and diarrhoea, and added that had the environmental watchdog performed its responsibilities fairly and properly, Karachi would have been a lot better place to live than many other cities of the country./'Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) are monitoring, regulatory and advisory bodies and they are definitely responsible for the improvement of environment and taking those to courts which are causing environmental pollution, including municipal authorities,' said environmental expert and engineer Shahid Lutfi, while speaking to The News./According to Lutfi, Sepa was to act as an advisory body and should have foreseen the issue of unhygienic conditions in the city on the occasion of Eidul Azha, but it failed to perform its role and responsibilities./He said Sepa should realise its potential and regulatory role as per the Sindh Environmental Protection Act and grill all those people and authorities which were causing public health issues by open dumping of offal and blood of sacrificial animals on the roads./Prominent environmental journalist Amar Guriro was of the opinion that said SEPA could have issued prior directives to the DMCs and even the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) about cleanliness in the city on Eidul Azha./'If garbage is being burnt by the municipal authorities and it is causing air pollution, it is the responsibility of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency to prosecute those authorities,' he said. 'If offal is being dumped and not being lifted from roads and streets, the environmental watchdog is responsible to take action or issue notices to the municipal authorities concerned.'/Dr Shahid Ahmed, a consultant physician was of the opinion that Karachi had become an 'unliveable place' due to public health threats where all kinds of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms were thriving due to poor environmental conditions./He said Karachi had become notorious for infectious diseases due to unhygienic conditions. 'We are expecting a sharp rise in infectious diseases including gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, water-borne hepatitis as well as other bacterial and viral diseases due to extremely unhealthy environmental conditions because there is not regulatory body to keep the environment clean and healthy for citizens in Karachi,' Dr Ahmed said."
"Anti-polio campaign kicks off in Sukkur, Larkana"," The five-day polio eradication campaign kicked off on Monday focusing over 3.7 million children in Sukkur, Khairpur, Shikarpur, Ghotki, Nausharoferoz and other cities of the Larkana and Sukkur districts./The Divisional Commissioner, Sukkur, Manzoor Ali Shaikh, presided over a meeting of the Task Force for Polio attended by the deputy commissioners, DHOs, representatives of UNICEF and other stake holders. Shaikh directed them to ensure meeting the 100 per cent target of polio vaccination. He directed the field officers to inform the respective deputy commissioners in case families refuse polio vaccination to their children. The commissioner also directed all the stake holders, officials of the district and health management to supervise and monitor the vaccination. The SSPs of respective districts assured the vaccination teams of foolproof security./In 2017, eight polio cases were reported from Sindh rattling the authorities. But, so far fortunately no case has surfaced in the province in 2018.Meanwhile, the villagers of Hond Ali Shar of Thari-Mirwah town in Khairpur refused to get their children vaccinated./The villagers Munir Ahmed Shar, Mansoor Ahmed, Abdul Karim Shar and others protested that they had repeatedly complained to the district authorities against massive air pollution caused by Hyder Shah and Al-Madina Cotton Factory but they were ignored. Abdul Karim Shar charged that the aerial discharge from both the factories is so harmful that it is causing asthma and other respiratory ailments besides severe lungs infection. The villagers accused the mill owners of refusing to install appropriate filters to prevent harmful discharge from polluting the environment and causing disease./Munir Ahmed Shar said they are not against vaccination but were forced to take action against the vaccination team to attract the attention of the district management to pay attention to their complaints against the cotton factories. The Assistant Commissioner told the villagers that he visited the factories and directed the mangement of the mills to take necessary action and warned of sealing their units in case of failure to do so."
Smog alert," This refers to the news report 'Punjab govt to establish body to control pollution' (Sep 23). The smoke emitted by the chimneys of brick kilns and through the burning of crop waste is a major contributor to air pollution. However, the recent restrictions that are imposed on the operations of brick kilns during a specific period (October 20 to December 31) can render many workers jobless. Either the Punjab government or owners of brick kilns provide monthly stipend during the period of closure. The authorities concerned should also consider buying air-monitoring equipment for Punjab's most affected districts. The chief minister of Punjab is also requested to ensure the availability of serviceable air monitoring equipment so that the safety of citizens can be ensured."
SC approached for completion of OLMT," A constitutional petition has been moved in the Supreme Court against the environmental pollution being caused due to non-completion of Orange Line Metro Train project in the provincial metropolis./Watan Party's Barrister Zafarullah Khan has filed the petition at SC Lahore Registry, pleading that Pakistan is already at stands higher at the list of the environmentally polluted countries. He pointed out that the Punjab government has halted construction work at the sites of project which is adding miseries to the inhabitants of Lahore. He said citizens are facing different skin and respiratory diseases like irritation and asthma etc. due to heavy air pollution. He requested the court to direct the Punjab government to complete the project as soon as possible."
Felling of trees in full swing across city," Municipal and other authorities have started cutting fully grown trees at greenbelts and parks in the city in the garb of creating space for plantation drives though the plantation season that usually lasts from July to September is over and the scorching heat of October would not let new saplings thrive./Trees are being felled from Sohrab Goth to Clifton, from Sharea Faisal to Malir and from Saddar to Gulistan-e-Jauhar by district municipal and other authorities, and no heed is paid to protests by concerned citizens./'We have been asked to cut these trees in such a manner that they don't grow again. Please talk to our officers instead of giving us lectures on the importance of trees,' said an employee of the District Municipal Corporation DMC (South) said near Do Talwar in Clifton when some citizens and traffic police officials tried to stop him and his co-workers from cutting down trees./Traffic constable Aijaz said he used to take shelter under the trees brought down by the municipal employees. Residents of Federal B Area also complained that district municipal authorities were felling trees near and around the Sohrab Goth Flyover, and, despite their protests, truckloads of tree trunks and leafs were being transported to unknown locations./'Green trees are being cut and garbage is being burnt under flyovers. There is nobody to stop this practice and I wonder what kind of city I'm living in these days,' said Dr Atif Hafeez, an ENT specialist and president of the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association./Criticising the Sindh Environmental Protecting Agency (Sepa) and Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani, he said he would try to mobilise people against this 'anti-Karachi' activity, as people were already suffering due to dust allergy, smoke from the burning of garbage and air pollution./Complaints were also made by residents of Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Gulshan-e-Iqbal and Malir that trees were being chopped down in their areas from footpaths, greenbelts and parks./Despite repeated attempts, Sepa officials refused to talk on the issue, saying if municipal authorities were behind the felling of trees, the local government department should be approached for comment."
Poisoned cities," As the yearly smog season approaches once again, the government has ordered the closure of all 19,000 brick kilns in Pakistan from October 20 to the end of December. The purpose is to limit dangerous carbon emissions from the kilns and improve air quality. However, brick-kiln owners and those who work at these kilns ask how they are to survive during this period. The average brick kiln worker, often employed alongside his whole family earns a few thousands rupees a month. The PTI government has recommended all brick kilns be altered to incorporate an internal zigzag structure along with air blowers. This will naturally take time. It is also unclear how many owners will be willing and able to make the expenditure required./There is another dimension to this. Brick kilns are not the only source of air pollution in Lahore - which is usually the worst affected - or the rest of the country. According to the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, a group set up by citizens to monitor air quality. Lahore's air quality exceeds the danger level set by the country's own official standards by 9 times. While we associate the greatest danger with the season between October and January, when moisture hangs in the air, PAQI which has used air monitors to measure air quality across Lahore notes that in 2017 there were two days when air was safe to breathe according to World Safety Standards. Other major cities in Pakistan - including Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Karachi - also suffer air pollution. According to experts, the reasons for this are the burning of crops to clear land, carbon emissions from vehicles, smoke released by factories, the burning of garbage and a variety of other factors. While brick kilns are indeed a problem, they are certainly not the sole culprits./Air pollution is a leading cause of death and disease in the country. Children and the elderly are often most badly affected with hospitals reporting an insurge of patients on days when air quality is particularly poor. There has also been a dramatic rise in asthma in the country, notably among infants and children and during the smog season that now approaches once again people have been advised by authorities to remain indoors while PE lessons in schools are now routinely suspended. The problem is so severe that it requires a broad national policy to correct it. The lack of air quality monitors adds to the issue. This leaves us dependent on web-based apps and private monitors to know what we are breathing in. High levels of dangerous particulate matter affecting the lungs and respiratory system are the worst problem. Masks can help filter out some of this matter but not all of it. We need to understand that no human being can live without air. This is a national crisis which needs to be addressed at all levels with both short- and long-term measures put in place."
Smog building up over Lahore," With the drop in minimum temperature, increase in humidity level and lack of water sprinkling on ongoing development projects where construction work has stopped have contributed to building up of smog over the provincial metropolis skies, which will thicken with the coming days./Met officials said that continental air is prevailing over most parts of the country. They predicted that mainly dry weather is expected in most parts of the country. On the buildup of smog, they said the humidity level is over 65 percent in the city while minimum temperature was dropping every day resulting in buildup of smog over the provincial capital. Air pollution caused by industries, traffic, crop burning and brick kilns are major contributors of smog, said environmentalists who believed that the layer of smog will thicken in the coming days./No rainfall was reported in any part of the country on Sunday. Met officials said Sunday's minimum temperature was recorded at Skardu where mercury dropped to -04°C while in Lahore, minimum temperature was 15.5°C, maximum was 24°C and humidity level was 67 percent./Environmental Protection Department (EPD) Punjab took several pre-smog measures to minimise its impact, but it seemed that none of the steps taken had worked and the citizens will have to face the similar smog situation, which they had faced in previous years./Environmental and weather experts believed that the present layer of smog was the result of dust particles raised from several abandoned development projects such as Metro Orange Line Train Project, Shaukat Khanam Flyover, Aik Moriya Bridge and etc. All of these projects are waiting for release of funds by the new government./Sources said the contractors of all of the ongoing development projects, where construction work had stopped due to lack of funds, have stopped water sprinkling due to which dust particles are continuously rising in the air./Smog containing the pollutants may cause eye/throat irritation as well as difficulty in breathing and due to this public may exercise precautionary measures, experts said, adding that no government department is taking this issue seriously while in developed countries pre-smog health warnings were issued and citizens especially children were directed to stay indoors because this may result in serious health hazard especially diseases relating to eyes, lungs and skin./Environment experts said smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in the atmosphere, which leave airborne particles (called particulate matter) and ground-level ozone. They said Ozone (O3) is a gas that can form and react under the action of light and that is present in two layers of the atmosphere i.e first high in the atmosphere, which forms a layer that shields the Earth from ultraviolet rays and second at the ground level./This ground level layer of Ozone is formed from other pollutants and can react with other substances, in both cases under the action of light, they explained, adding it is a secondary pollutant formed when precursor pollutants such as Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compounds react under the action of light. They said that Ozone is also transported long distances in the atmosphere and is therefore considered a trans-boundary problem. Dr Tariq Chishti, a family physician said smog formed by ground-level ozone, Sulfur dioxide, Nitrogen dioxide, Carbon monoxide and PM10 are especially harmful for senior citizens and children./'People with heart and lungs problems such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma,' should avoid going out in smog. Smog can also inflame breathing passages, decreasing the lungs' working capacity and causing shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing, he maintained./Long-term exposure to smog at low levels can affect lungs elasticity and the ability to resist disease, effectively aging lungs prematurely. Children, the elderly, asthmatics, and sufferers of other chronic lungs diseases are more susceptible to smog effects than the general population, he concluded./Naseemur Rehman, a senior official of EPD, said that the department has taken several measures to minimise effects of smog. He said none of the steps have failed and efforts of the department didn't mean that smog will not build up over the city. He said the department is keenly watching the situation and will take appropriate measures."
Over 90% of world's children breathe toxic air every day: WHO," Every day, around 93% of the world's children under the age of 15 years (1.8 billion children) breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk. Tragically, many of them die: WHO estimates that in 2016, as many as 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air./A new WHO report on 'Air pollution and child health: Prescribing clean air,' examines the heavy toll of both ambient (outside) and household air pollution on the health of the world's children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The report was launched on the eve of WHO's first-ever Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health, which opened in Geneva on October 30./The report states that when pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, and have small, low birth-weight children. Air pollution also impacts neurodevelopment and cognitive ability and can trigger asthma, and childhood cancer. Children who have been exposed to high levels of air pollution may be at greater risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life./One reason why children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution is that they breathe more rapidly than adults and so absorb more pollutants. They also live closer to the ground, where some pollutants reach peak concentrations - at a time when their brains and bodies are still developing./Newborns and young children are also more susceptible to household air pollution in homes that regularly use polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting./According to the report, air pollution affects neurodevelopment, leading to lower cognitive test outcomes, negatively affecting mental and motor development. It also damages children's lung function, even at lower levels of exposures./Globally, 93% of the world's children under 15 years of age are exposed to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels above WHO air quality guidelines, which include the 630 million of children under 5 years of age, and 1.8 billion of children under 15 years, the report informs./In low- and middle-income countries around the world, 98% of all children under 5 are exposed to PM2.5 levels above WHO air quality guidelines. In comparison, in high-income countries, 52% of children under 5 are exposed to levels above WHO air quality guidelines. More than 40% of the world's population - which includes 1 billion children under 15 - is exposed to high levels of household air pollution from mainly cooking with polluting technologies and fuels. About 600,000 deaths in children under 15 years of age were attributed to the joint effects of ambient and household air pollution in 2016.Together, household air pollution from cooking and ambient (outside) air pollution cause more than 50% of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries./Air pollution is one of the leading threats to child health, accounting for almost 1 in 10 deaths in children under five years of age, the report states."
FAO to release research findings on causes of smog in Punjab this month," Responding to a request from Punjab government, Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) under its project Remote Sensing for Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Smog (R-SMOG) has completed a first of its kind evidence based geospatial research which will contribute to findings on emissions and drivers of smog./Pakistan suffered one of the highest death tolls in the world from air pollution in 2015, when according to UN estimates thousands lost their lives because of the high level of fine particles in the air. This phenomenon engulfs several cities in Punjab province particularly Lahore during the winter months and has evolved into a public health and economic emergency./Satellite data of atmospheric pollutants are being widely used globally in the decision-making and environmental management activities of public, private sector and non-profit organisations. The research findings to be released later this month in Lahore were reviewed by the FAO global technical experts on information with a geographical component, methods and tools and were validated by a wide array of Pakistani experts and institutions. Welcoming participants at the workshop to validate the study key findings with representatives of the Ministry of Climate Change and Punjab department of agriculture, Minà Dowlatchahi, FAO representative in Pakistan said that they remain committed to support government efforts to help devise appropriate strategies and action plans to tackle smog in Pakistan./""The findings of R-SMOG study provide scientific evidence of the causes of smog, and the relationship between smog and crop residue burning. The study will be instrumental in helping reduce the contribution of the agriculture sector towards the formation of Smog'./Smog is one of the several forms of air pollutants that cause harm to human functioning. It is normally a combination of several types of pollutants (nitrogen oxides, Sulphur oxides, aerosols, smoke or particulates, etc.) with fog. Industrial and vehicular emissions, and forest and crop burning are some of the common sources of these pollutants./Formation of smog, however, is not dependent only on the presence or increase of these pollutants, but certain meteorological and weather conditions also help these pollutants suspend in the lower atmosphere because of which the pollutants form a dense visible layer of smog./Using satellite based measurements to monitor and identify the causes of increased levels of smog the findings identify the relationship between smog and the practice of rice residue burning practices by farmers in the rice belt of Punjab. RSMOG not only includes the Spatio-temporal mapping of pollutants but also integrates the detailed climatological modelling to asses seasonal dynamics of smog related to sectoral inventory of pollutants in Punjab."
"PKLI seminar: Pneumonia dangerous for all age groups, say experts"," Pneumonia is dangerous for all age groups worldwide with being the biggest killer of children under age 5 worldwide, Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute and Research Centre's physicians said at a seminar conducted on World Pneumonia Day 2018 at PKLI Hospital Auditorium. The seminar was attended by PKLI's Clinical HODs, consultants, senior registrars, registrars, medical officers and nursing staff here on Monday./PKLI physicians Dr Javed Hayat Khan, Consultant Pulmonologist, Dr Naveed Rashid, Consultant Infectious Diseases, Dr Mazhar Abbas Butt, Consultant Paediatric, gave detailed talks on various aspects of the disease, saying that nearly one in six global child deaths result from pneumonia every year. They explained that pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs, making breathing painful and limiting oxygen intake./The doctors explained that pneumonia symptoms often resolve naturally in 4 to 7 days; however, primary influenza pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia may create complications during the course of recovery. An elderly person who develops pneumonia is likely to take longer compared to a younger one to recover from this illness. The seminar speakers pointed out some of major symptoms of pneumonia: headache, temperature, weakness, dry cough, expectoration, chest pain, breathing difficulty and muscle aches. They vividly mentioned that pneumonia could pose a serious threat to human life, so it is vitally important to take appropriate measures to prevent the disease. They added that it is preventable at first instance via certain vaccines and by avoiding polluted environment, especially exposure to smoking, smog and bio-fuel mass gasses./The doctors advised everyone to get vaccinated, take adequate hygiene measures and quit smoking. They emphasised upon the need for measures to avoid smog, regular hand wash and elimination of air pollution. They said once pneumonia develops it is treatable and can be cured without developing complications especially if it is diagnosed at an early stage. This early detection is only possible by raising awareness among masses particularly on such occasions like World Pneumonia Day./Besides providing advanced treatment facilities including transplantation, PKLI is focused on its mission of creating awareness about disease prevention in order to eliminate kidney, liver and other diseases including pneumonia from Pakistan. The hospital management is determined that it would arrange more such events in the future to involve community in health awareness and health improvement activities."

Secretary Primary and Secondary Healthcare Muhammad Khan Ranjha was also present during the CEOs conference./The minister said the Health Department was taking every necessary step to cater the shortage of anesthesia experts and teaching institutions have been directed to increase seats for anesthetist cadre. She also expressed her displeasure on continue trend of unnecessary referral of patients to major hospitals without solid reasons. 'No patient should be referred without written statement of specialist because traveling of such patient to far flung area could be dangerous for his or her life', said the minister. 'Lack of health facilities does not mean that we could not achieve certain targets,' she said. The minister said after appointment of medical officers recruited through Punjab Public Service Commission, doctors working on ad-hoc basis might be adjusted on vacant posts./Meanwhile, a delegation of Unicef led by Chief Field Office Dr Zeba Bukhari called on the minister and discussed with her breastfeeding and Nutrition Programme."
"'Pollution, climate change big issues'"," Principal Ameer Uddin Medical College Prof Muhammad Tayyab has said that environmental pollution and climate change are the big threats to the human lives and 'we all should perform our duties in this regard and take preventive measures'./He added that from the last some years another threat has occurred in the shape of smog which also needs 'our immediate attention and people should opt short and long term measures to meet this challenge'./While addressing a seminar at Lahore General Hospital for creating awareness among masses, Prof Tayyab said that steps like burning garbage and waste and fireworks also add up the air pollution and after sometimes this pollution turns into pollution zone in the air. He said if people decide to remain careful they can easily avoid that threat like smog and for this purpose, practical steps would be needed. Principal Ameer Uddin Medical College also asked the doctors of Lahore General Hospital to convey such positive messages through patients so that they can keep their environment clean and healthy for themselves. Addressing the seminar, Prof Ghias un Nabi Tayyab, Prof Agha Shabbir Ali, Prof Muhammad Moin and Dr Irfan Malik said in fact smog is the merger of fog and smoke and this air pollution started from the use of coal as fuel. They called upon the citizens to use maximum water in a day and avoid coming out of the house unnecessarily./Similarly, motorcyclists and cyclist should also use mask and women should also keep doors and windows closed at their houses. Medical Superintendent of Lahore General Hospital Dr Mahmud Salah Uddin also addressed the seminar and highlighted its aims and objectives. At the end masks were also distributed among the participants from the management."
Smog envelops cities of Sindh," With the advent of winter, smog has begun to grip several towns and cities across Sindh leading to respiratory allergies and diseases./A thick layer of smog enveloped Sukkur, Khairpur, Shikarpur, Ghotki and other cities of Sindh due to dust, burning crop residue, emissions from brick kilns and factories, higher sulpur content of petrol and diesel. The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned of increasing intensity of smog in the forthcoming winters unless urgent mitigatory action is taken./In order to check air pollution, the Sindh government is propagating zig zag brick kiln technology in the province. The Director Technical Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, Waqar Ahmed Phulpoto, said the zig zag brick kiln technology reduces fuel consumption by as much as 30 per cent. He said the new technology not only improves the quality of bricks but also cuts down air pollution."
Something in the air," Miasmas, itching eyes, irritated throats and wheezing are the new normal of the atmosphere in the major cities of Pakistan, which have a large number of private vehicles running on dirty fuel, discharging the witch's brew of particulate matter, toxic sulphur compounds, and greenhouse gases (GHGs)./The presence of particulate matter rings alarm bells for environmentalists and health practitioners, underlining the gravity of the danger to our environment and health. There are two type of particulate matter: PM2.5 and PM10. PM10 is around 10 micrometres or less and PM2.5 is 2.5 micrometres, the smallest and most dangerous particulate matter./The single largest source of particulate matter is the fuel-guzzling road transport that is fed on dirty petrol and Euro-II diesel with high sulphur content. The coal-fired power plants and the burning of solid waste in the open also disperse dangerous aerosol. There are a couple of particulate precursors such as nitrogen oxides and ozone that give cities a dystopian, smoky look throughout the year./The pungent air of busy traffic lanes and the itching eyes are characteristic of the ubiquitous toxic sulphur dioxide that casts a dark shadow on our health and, consequently, the economy./According to a report published in 2015 by the medical journal Lancet, 22 percent annual deaths in Pakistan are the result of air pollution. The percentage of these deaths is increasing at an alarmingly rate. In 2015, environmental pollution was responsible for over nine million deaths across the globe./Air pollution-induced diseases are mainly caused by ozone and PM2·5 that lodges deep in the lungs, causing varying degrees of bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. These aerosols are also responsible for 2.5 million premature global deaths and increase the risk of ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and impaired cognitive functions./Lahore, Peshawar, Islamabad and Karachi have some of the highest levels of particulate pollutants globally. This comes at a harrowing cost: serious disease incurs a high medical cost and a reduction in labour productivity. But the ring of fire that hangs over us is the World Bank's observation that alarmingly high pollution levels and low living standards across the major cities has compelled 'expatriate executive managers [to] shy away from hiring from the Pakistan job market'./Confronted with stark climate-change episodes, we need to adopt a better fuel mix comprising cleaner fossil fuels, eco-friendly CNG, LPG and renewables to harness the safe air around us./We also need to cut down on the high sulphur content in fuel and shift towards using cleaner petrol and Euro-V grade diesel that gives off only 10ppm of sulphur as compared with the current Euro-II grade diesel, releasing 500ppm of the deadly poison. With 15 million vehicles plying the roads of Pakistan's cities and with this number growing rapidly every day, the decision to remove subsidies from a BRT project is perhaps not a wise option. Many European countries are incentivising public transport projects to cut down on air pollution and road congestion./Governance is the biggest bane of our political systems and state institutions don't act until push comes to a shove. This happened earlier this year Chief Justice Saqib Nisar ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to install air-quality monitors across the country and enforce laws about excess emissions from factories, brick kilns, and vehicles./The CJ also recently snubbed PSO for importing a highly contaminated fuel when cleaner options are available. An opportunity is on the horizon. The Kuwait Petroleum Company has asked PSO to phase out Euro-II diesel as it is switching to the ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD) by 2020. This is a critical decision-making time. However, the proposal is being debated on grounds of an additional dollar per barrel cost for the cleaner product./A cost-benefit analysis establishes the terrible consequences of continuing on the road of high-sulphur fuel. A cleaner fuel will not only reduce the particulate matter escaping into the surrounding air, but will also lower the amount of sulphur dioxide gas. Isn't the provision of a cleaner and safer environment that guarantees health worth more than having inexpensive fuel? Many countries have switched to ULSD and are installing catalytic converters in road transport to keep people from harm's way./It seems that we are eons away from countries struggling to keep the air clean, as environmental issues don't drive electoral politics. While the ULSD decision is one manifestation, the other example is the uncalled-for increase in CNG prices by up to Rs20, which is an outright health and environmental scandal./The CNG-LPG doesn't emit particulate matter and emits very little carbon dioxide and GHGs. Tax policies must also be structured to promote cleaner fuels to wean people away from toxic compounds. Introducing toxicity charges on diesel cars will also ensure cleaner air by making poisonous emissions expensive./We also need to convert two-stroke rickshaws to four-stroke CNG engines. Many countries have introduced four-stroke motorcycles, which will substantially reduce the emission of particulate material. With fewer trees and a perpetual haze, cities are gasping for clean air.

City cloaked in smog as sea breeze halts at winter's start," A suspension of the sea breeze on Wednesday morning at the start of winter exposed Karachi's vulnerability to atmospheric and environmental pollution when fog, coupled with smoke emitted from millions of vehicles, resulted in low visibility and breathing problems for citizens./'The suspension of the sea breeze and the cold temperature of the earth were the cause of this smog as moisture in the air condensed very close to the ground and smoke emitted by vehicles and chimneys was trapped in it,' Met Office regional director Shahid Abbas told The News./The sea breeze is cut off towards Karachi by the start or the mid of November and remains suspended till March due to temperature variations, while in December cold air from plains moves towards the sea and brings the cold weather to the coastal city, experts said./'This smog is Karachi's indigenous phenomenon and became evident due to the suspension of the sea breeze as smoke emitted in Karachi mingled with fog and mist and resulted in low visibility and irritation of nose, throat, lungs and eyes,' the Met official said and added that the smog was expected to remain for the next two days, after which it would be cleared by the winds./After a couple of days, the weather in Karachi is expected to get a bit colder and the temperature is likely to drop three to four degrees Celsius in the morning under the influence of Siberian or Kandahari winds./To a query, he said air quality had not worsened in Karachi in a day or two as carbon emissions had been a constant for the last many years, but in the absence of the sea breeze and due to the cold weather, air pollution became evident and caused inconvenience for the Karachiites./On the other hand, health experts, including chest and eye specialists, asked the people to take precautionary measures to prevent themselves and their children from the environmental conditions as air containing suspended particles, smoke and high humidity could result in breathing problems, and irritation of throat, lungs and eyes./'Thousands of people use motorbikes in Karachi to travel and this condition is very hazardous for their health. They should use masks and protective eye to prevent themselves from the smoke-filled air,' advised Dr Khurram Shahzad./Other experts asked the people to take precautionary measures while venturing out of their homes, wash their eyes regularly with clean water to get rid of dust and other particulate matter and use masks to avoid breathing problems."
Climate grief," Millions of children die every year as a result of environment-related diseases. Their deaths could be prevented by using low-cost and sustainable tools and strategies for improving the environment. In some countries, more than one-third of the disease burden could be prevented by environmental changes. According to a WHO study carried out in 23 countries, more than 10 percent of deaths are due to unsafe water and indoor air pollution, particularly from solid fuel used for cooking./Children make up almost half the population of developing countries. Most of the deaths are among children under five and are attributable mainly to intestinal and respiratory infections. People living in industrialized countries are also affected by environmental factors such as pollution, occupational factors, ultraviolet radiation, and climate and ecosystem changes./The integrity of the global environment is being increasingly compromised by the deterioration of the atmospheric ozone layer and an ever-higher concentration of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect. To the degree that these factors intensify, the health of populations will be seriously affected./Environmental factors affect children's health from the time of conception and intra-uterine development through infancy and adolescence. These factors can even exert an influence prior to conception since both ovules and sperm can be damaged by radiation and chemical contaminants./It has been widely demonstrated that children are more susceptible than adults to environmental factors because, among other reasons, they are still growing and their immune systems and detoxification mechanisms are not yet fully developed./Interventions both at the community and the national level can significantly improve the environment, including the promotion of safe-water treatment and storage, and the reduction of air pollution. The last measure by itself could save almost a million lives a year./A series of measures being taken at the local level are having a significant impact on improving the environment. For example, in an overcrowded and unsanitary inner-city building housing several hundred people in South Africa, conventional environmental health control measures had failed. So, a democratically elected tenants committee initiated a series of measures to deal with the main problems affecting the building and its inhabitants. This project has laid the foundation for a participatory way of dealing with environmental problems in inner-city buildings./In Cairo, Egypt, Dr. Laila Iskandar Kamel has implemented innovative social and environmental projects working with garbage collectors or Zabbaleen. These projects have helped garbage collectors break the cycle of exploitation and receive proper compensation for their work. In addition, she has organized girls from the community in reviving the most ancient of Egyptian crafts, weaving on a handloom using discarded cotton remnants and using the profits for improving their education and providing them with a livelihood./In Qatar, fewer natural resources, climate change and the quality of the air are serious challenges faced by the authorities. The Ministry of Environment has taken a series of measures to improve the environment. Among those measures, creating awareness in the population, particularly among the mothers, is an important task. At the same time, a new school curriculum has been completed, placing emphasis on environmental issues./In the countries in the Americas, an outstanding series of environmental activities are carried out by Ecoclubs, nongovernmental organizations made up basically of children and adolescents who coordinate their activities through several community institutions."
IKEA wants to fix India's pollution by reusing what farmers burn each winter," The initiative ""Better Air Now"" by the global furniture giant IKEA, will provide Indian farmers with a use for unwanted rice straw, which is often burned and smoke from the fire contributes to pollution crisis in northern India./IKEA wants to turn rice straw into household wares in a move that could end up reducing a major source of pollution in India. The global furniture giant will start making products out of agricultural waste in India, meaning farmers no longer have to burn it./'Starting off in India, IKEA wants to turn rice straw into a new renewable material source for IKEA products. The ambition is to create a model for how to reduce air pollution that could be replicated in other mega cities,' said Helene Davidson, sustainability manager at IKEA Purchasing south Asia./Currently, the leftover straw is burnt which essentially means that it goes to waste. Farmers say recycling devices cost way too much and expect their respective state governments to offer more incentives for them not to resort to burning them. There is a ban on burning straw but there have been reports which claim farmers find it more economical to pay the penalty than invest in recycling machines./IKEA, which opened its first stores in India earlier this year, The Swedish company said its first product prototypes based on rice straw will be ready by the end of 2018. It hopes to start selling them in India by 2019-20 before offering them in other markets./With a reputation built over decades for mass production of cheap furniture, IKEA is re-branding itself as a champion of the environment as customers increasingly demand greener products. It plans to stop using all single-use plastics in its products by 2020."
Experts warn of respiratory diseases due to changing weather," Changes in the weather have exacerbated the conditions of people afflicted with respiratory diseases, especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), said leading pulmonologists, or chest specialists, on Monday./They said the patients' conditions can be controlled by creating awareness, right management and long-term treatment, adding that the patients must ensure compliance and adherence to their prescribed medications./Dr Javaid A Khan, chair of the National Alliance for Tobacco Control and professor of pulmonology at the Aga Khan University Hospital, said: 'Asthma and COPD are two of the most common respiratory diseases in Pakistan, posing a serious challenge.'/Talking about the disease burden, Dr Khan said that according to the World Health Organisation's estimates, 235 million people worldwide are afflicted with asthma while COPD affects 210 million people around the globe./In Pakistan over 6.9 million people are afflicted with COPD, which is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world and is projected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020. More than three million people died of COPD last year alone./Globally, the COPD burden is projected to increase in the coming decades because of continued exposure to risk factors and the aging of the population. Dr Khan said: 'Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.'/He added that COPD is characterised by 'persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs'./Identifying the causes, Dr Nadeem Ahmed Rizvi, professor and head of pulmonology at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College, said: 'There is a difference between the causes of asthma and COPD. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways. On the other hand, smoking is the biggest cause of COPD.'/Allergens that trigger asthma include indoor allergens, house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander and outdoor allergens such as pollens and moulds, tobacco smoke, chemical irritants in the workplace, urbanisation and air pollution./Dr Rizvi suggested that appropriate management can control the disease and enable people to enjoy good quality of life. He urged patients for compliance to controller medications and relievers for the best possible outcomes./'Factors such as education and skills in order to effectively manage asthma and COPD are crucial. It can be achieved through a partnership between the patient and their health care providers. Similarly, written action plans on how to recognise and respond to these diseases along with regular review by a health care professional is vital to fight them.'"
Greenwich University organises walk for greener Pakistan," A walk to raise awareness about clean environment was organised by Greenwich University, Karachi, from the university campus to Sea view. A large number of students, faculty and a cross section of people participated in the walk./The participants of the walk were carrying banners in which hazards of environment were highlighted./The banners also mentioned the sea, smoke and air pollution and its impact on human health. After reaching Sea View, the participants cleaned a portion of the Clifton beach./The students gathered rubbish and wastage from the beach./Around 20kg of garbage was collected by the students and faculty during the beach-cleaning activity./On the occasion, Student Counselor Ahmed Kamran planted a sapling of neem on behalf of Greenwich University./Addressing the gathering, he said that we should make our country greener and by planting trees. People who were at Sea View appreciated the efforts of the students and joined them in the beach-cleaning process."
Respiratory diseases on the rise as burning of garbage continues in city," A sizeable amount of around 14,000 tons of garbage produced in Karachi is being burnt on a daily basis at the banks of two rivers, Lyari and Malir, as well as under dozens of flyovers and bridges, causing immense air pollution and resulting in serious health hazards for the citizens, experts said on Friday./Several residential areas and roads constructed along the banks of Lyari and Malir rivers remain engulfed in thick black smoke billowing from burning garbage piles, making the lives of people miserable./'Every Sunday, garbage dumped under Ayesha Manzil and Water Pump flyovers is set on fire, which results in immense problems for us as it makes breathing immensely difficult. For quite some time, we leave our home on Sunday morning before the burning of garbage starts and get back home in the night, but smoke is felt in the air for the next day also,' said Ahmed Ali, a resident of Federal B Area./But Ahmed Ali is not alone in complaining about thick plumes of smoke their residential area as there are several localities from where many people have migrated to other places due to regular burning of garbage adjacent to their homes, which resulted in severe health issues for them and compelled them to relocate themselves to other places./Nazimuddin, who once was a resident of Defence View near Korangi Causeway, recently moved to Gulistan-e-Jauhar's Block-15 due to regular burning of garbage in the Lyari river./'Hundreds of trucks and dumpers bring thousands of tons of garbage from the entire city and dump it in the Malir river on a daily basis. This garbage remains burning most of the time, making room for the dumping of more garbage, and this vicious cycle continues,' he said, adding that due to inhaling smoke, he and his entire family had caught irreversible respiratory diseases and now they were under treatment to get rid of the harms done to their lungs by the hazardous smoke./Irreversible damage/Air pollution is not a new thing for Karachi due to its faulty transport system, but the burning of thousands of tons of garbage has worsened the environmental issue and now a number of patients affected by chronic respiratory issues, including upper respiratory tract infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are on the rise, pulmonologists or chest specialists say./'Unfortunately, air pollution is not being considered as an unhealthy, illegal or immoral activity, so people have accepted it willingly or unwillingly,' eminent pulmonologist Prof Sohail Akhtar said, adding that Karachi was now among the 20 most polluted cities of the world but nobody was really concerned about it./He said that in addition to upper respiratory tract infections, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, air pollution was also resulting in causing heart disease to the residents of Karachi./He added that health and performance of children, adults and elderly people was adversely being affected due to immensely polluted air in Karachi. Fortunately, the sea breeze, which regularly blows towards Karachi, cleans the air of the city; otherwise, the burning of such a large number of garbage could result in the destruction of the city and people would be forced to migrate to other places because of environmental pollution, Nasar Usmani, an environmentalist claimed./What Sepa does/In response to the burning of garbage in the city, the Sindh environment minister and the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) have once again issued statements and warnings to those who are dumping and burning garbage, saying 'stern action' will be taken against the perpetrators of the criminal act, but so far no such action has been visible against any person or authority./Despite issuing notices and even environmental protection orders (EPOs) against district municipal authorities (DMCs), cantonment boards and residential societies, none of them were ever prosecuted, fined or sent behind bars, giving a clean chit to everybody in Karachi to create environmental and public health problems for millions of people./'The Sindh environment minister has taken serious notice of the burning of garbage within the city limits and ordered stern action against violators. In this context, this matter will be assigned topmost priority. Authorities have sought a regular report in this regard on a weekly basis,' the additional secretary of the environment department said in a letter to Sepa on Friday."
Where has Karachi's winter gone?," Pushcarts laden with nuts, dried fruit and roasted peanuts have been seen everywhere in Karachi for the last two weeks, shops in malls have started selling winter clothes, and parents of school-going children have been intimated of winter vacations from mid-December, but everybody in the city is wondering where the winter will begin as the maximum temperature remains upto 33 degrees Celsius, while at nights, one cannot sleep without starting a fan./So where has Karachi's winter gone when our peaks in the northern areas are covered with snow, temperatures have dropped to below zero degrees Celsius in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan as well as in many parts of the interior of Sindh./Pakistan's top environmental scientist and former director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Dr Ghulam Rasool, blames the Karachiites for the elimination of the winter season from their calendar, saying nobody else except for the people Karachi are responsible for the hot weather in the month of December when people in the rest of Pakistan are enjoying snowfalls and cold winds, and sipping steamy soups and coffee./'Environmental degradation in Karachi, which has been caused by none other than the people of this city themselves, is to blame for the hot weather in the winter season and this degradation is worsening due to lack of trees, alarming levels of air pollution, a multifold increase in the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gasses from cars, smoke and other gasses released in the air by local industries and growing construction.'/How is it happening?/An inversion layer has been formed in the atmosphere over Karachi which is composed of suspended particles and particulate matter, aerosols, and this layer is getting thick in winters, preventing heat from being released in the atmosphere, Prof Ghulam Rasool says, adding that when the heat is not released from a larger area in the nights, its temperature remains higher as compared to surrounding areas where there is no such layer of suspended particles in the air./He further explains that as sea breeze comes to a halt in the winter season due to climatic conditions, this inversion layers is getting thick with each passing day as Karachiites are not willing to reduce their carbon emissions. There is no tree cover to absorb carbon from the air, dust is everywhere which is getting trapped in the inversion layer so the temperature is not dropping even in the night as heat is not radiating back to the atmosphere. 'And everybody knows that concrete traps heat in the day and release it in the night so this heat is keeping you warm in the otherwise cold winter nights at Karachi.'/Director Met Karachi Abdur Rashid blames the climate change, saying that due to global warming and climate change, warmer days in the city are increasing; it is a man-made phenomenon and people will have to bear it. 'We are not expecting the temperature to drop below 10 degrees Celsius in the night in Karachi and that too would happen by the end of December, start of January in this season. Western wave is expected to grip Karachi in the end of this month and dry wind may result in drop in the temperature but that too not below 10 degrees Celsius.'/What is the solution?/Environmentalists say rocket science is not required to improve environmental conditions as everybody in the world, including Karachi, knows about steps they should take to reduce carbon emissions, keep air pollution under control and keep their city or area free from environmental pollution./'Despite knowing the importance of trees, at least five trees are being cut in this city on a daily basis. There is a ban on the construction of high-rises but they are being constructed without any checks and control everywhere in the city. So, how would you keep the city clean and environmental friendly?' questions Nasar Usmani./Due to lack of public transport and a mass transit project, he says, millions of people are using their own cars and motorbikes, nobody believes in using bicycles like people in other parts of world, contribution of clean energy is negligible and industries are emitting hazardous gasses into the air. Karachi's environmental conditions will continue worsening in the days to come, as result./'A mass moment is required to change the mindset of common people in Karachi. They know things but are not concerned about the environment, air which they are breathing in and not willing to play their own role and compel the authorities to take steps for the improvement of the environment.'"
"Global climate change inducing seasonal respiratory, skin complications"," For years, scientists and medical professionals have been working hard to rule out the accurate cause behind idiopathic seasonal respiratory diseases and skin allergies as their specific root cause has never been highlighted by anyone due to lack of knowledge and resources./Talking to APP, Professor Dr Ishaq Khan said there was need to develop general awareness in our society regarding the relationship between global climate change, allergic and respiratory diseases. After extensive research, Dr Ishaq and his team had concluded that there was massive impact of weather, pollens and airborne pollutants over these allergies. Over the past 3 decades global temperature has been rising markedly./This temperature increase has been resulted in warming ocean temperatures, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, retreating sea ice and diminished snow cover in the northern hemisphere, he said./During the heat waves of 2003, 2012 and 2013, temperatures of above 35°C resulted in several thousand deaths throughout Europe, most of the observed rise in global average temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the documented rise in environmental pollution and green house gas concentrations, he added. This aggressive climatic change is associated with respiratory and allergic disorders./The increased length and severity of the pollen season, the higher occurrence of heavy precipitation events and the increasing frequency of urban population are resulting in major environmental hazards that are lethal to human life, he maintained./In order to reduce the burden of allergic and respiratory symptoms, we must act to control environmental factors that worsen these conditions. The incidence and intensity of allergic rhinitis (also known as coryza, is irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose./Common symptoms are a stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing, and post-nasal drip) and asthma varies with atmospheric conditions. Air pollution consisting of particulate matter i.e. (dust mite, organic dust substances, diesel exhaust and organic salts) and atmospheric pollens blunts individual's immune system that eventually results in enhancement of allergic and respiratory diseases for instance particulate matter resulting from the burning of fuel or organic matter increases allergen specific [Immunoglobulin E (IgE) (a type of antibody)] IgE levels that causes airway inflammation and hypersensitivity, Dr Ishaq Khan said./Global warming, he said has a tremendous economic and health care impact in the form of loss of working hours and increased need for care among privileged populations. Thunderstorm is another environmental hazard that induces severe asthma attacks in allergy-sensitive patients, subsequent to thunderstorm pollen grains may release part of their cytoplasmic contents including inhalable allergen particles./In addition to enhanced pollen production massive climatic change alters the amount of fungal allergens in the atmosphere. These fungal spores cause allergic rhinitis and worsen asthmatic attack in patients./Increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere resulting from excessive production of black smoke, CCF's and coal favors production of fungal spores. These environmental pollutants are extremely hazardous to human life./Increased rainfall during extremes of weather promotes mold production both indoors and outdoors that in return worsens allergic diseases in allergy sensitive individuals, he added. Air-pollution related asthma exacerbation is due to climactic factors that favors the accumulation of air pollutants at soil level."
Extreme cold wave hits region," Patients suffering from any of the 12 cardiovascular diseases are at higher risk of contracting serious and life threatening complications in extreme cold weather conditions while according to health experts, the extreme fall in mercury may increase the risk of incidence of the CVDs./Various studies have revealed that the morbidity and mortality due to CVDs including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and rupture, stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation have higher rates during the colder months as compared to summer season./A number of studies conducted all around the globe have also revealed that the highest incidence of CVDs occurs during the colder winter months and the phenomenon contributes to greater number of deaths due to the CVDs in winter./Winter particularly the extreme cold weather conditions is the time for patients with CVDs and those at risk of CVDs to take extra care in diet and adopt a lifestyle that may reduce their risk of having complications, said Head of Cardiac Centre at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Professor Dr Naeem Malik while talking to 'The News' on Saturday./He added in winter, the chances of heart attack increase especially in late hours of night while the chances of complications also get higher among patients suffering from CVDs./He said exposure to extreme cold causes peripheral vasoconstriction, the narrowing of blood vessels that may lead to pulmonary oedema as a consequence of left ventricular failure and may also cause abnormal clotting./Studies reveal that variation in incidence of CVDs is associated with a number of risk factors including temperature, physical activity, air pollution, infections, and dietary habits however the risk can be minimised by following precautionary measures specifically in colder winter months./According to Professor Malik, the risk factors like the seasonal variation in the plasma level of fibrinogen, cholesterol, hormones and vasoactive substance including vasopressin (AVP), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and angiotensin II, aldosterone and catecholamine tends to rise in winter and may cause serious complications./A number of studies on seasonal variation in heart failure (HF) hospitalization carried out in France, Spain, Japan, Scotland, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Turkey, Nigeria, Canada, and USA have revealed that admissions increase during the winter season and show decline in summer season./It is important that both systolic and diastolic mean blood pressures exhibit a seasonal peak during winter and trough in summer among adults, the elderly, and children. The extreme cold affects blood pressure of both the healthy and hypertensive people./Professor Malik said the most critical time for heart patients is night and in winter, the night get longer and colder making it more serious for heart patients till 10 O'clock in the morning. 'Most of the deaths related to heart disease are reported from late night till morning,' he added./He, like other health experts in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi said the patients suffering from CVDs must avoid exposure to extreme cold in winter as it affects the pumping power of the heart muscle in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure."

Polluted air," One of the serious problems faced by Pakistan has been air pollution. Emissions from fossil-fuelled power plants, unregulated industrial units, usage of vehicles and machinery with old internal combustion engines and uncontrolled burning of crop leftover are some of known causes of pollution. During the last five years, Karachi and Central Punjab suffered severe smog. After 2016 it became apparent that Lahore had a substantially increasing air pollution index with most of the district covered in heavy smog after the dual annual harvest season. In 2018, Lahore didn't have a single good air day./Air pollution in Pakistan is a form of particulate contamination which can essentially be defined as solid and vapor particles suspended in air and unable to be transferred due to a lack of airflow owing to temperature inversion./The resulting smog is similar in nature, albeit a little less toxic, to coal dust and has severe health implications especially on children and the elderly. Its inhalation is said to equivalent to smoking 50 plus cigarettes daily. Lahore currently faces only one type of smog (winter smog) which is also common in New Delhi. However, the ever increasing carbon footprint from unregulated automobile emissions and domestic heating has a strong potential to cause photochemical (summer) smog in Lahore in the near future."
"World Cancer Day : Pakistan lacks diagnostic, treatment and palliative care facilities"," Cancer that has emerged as a major health threat in Pakistan has never been given due attention by the concerned government authorities as the facilities of screening and early detection of cancers along with treatment and even palliative care are not available in public sector healthcare facilities almost all across the country./Pakistan does not have National Cancer Registry in the absence of which it is hardly possible to assess the true nature of problem though according to estimates, well over 300,000 new individuals suffer from cancer every year in the country and the disease claims well over 50,000 lives every year. Data available at teaching hospitals show the existing pool of cancer patients is on the rise sharply. The most alarming fact is that in Pakistan, only minority of cancer patients are able to get treatment and that too in five to eight major cities of the country while population in smaller cities and peripheries do not have any screening or treatment facilities./It is also alarming that majority of cancer patients in the country are refused treatment due to limited capacity of cancer beds even in major cities and also there is a lack of facilities for even palliative care, the treatment to relieve symptoms and reduce pains caused by cancers./According to health experts, palliative care is particularly required in places like Pakistan that has high proportion of patients with advanced stages with little chance of cure. There is a dire need to establish new cancer facilities in the country./A large proportion of cancers present at an advanced stage mainly because of lack of awareness about cancers and if we want to combat cancer, there is a dire need of running awareness and education campaigns for masses, said Medical Superintendent at Benazir Bhutto Hospital Dr. Tariq Niazi while talking to 'The News' in connection with World Cancer Day being observed on February 4 around the globe with a three-year campaign 'I Am and I Will' from 2019 to 2021./Tobacco use, pan, chalia, alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, exposure to occupational for example asbestos carcinogens, radiation including ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, excessive X-Rays, low fruit and vegetable intake, excessive consumption of red and preserved meat, estrogens tablets, high fat diet, genetic factors, having unsafe sex, infections from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, human papiloma viruses, Helicobacter pylori, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels are major risk factors for cancer development, said Dr. Niazi./According to WHO, cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and is estimated to account for 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervix and thyroid cancer are the most common among women./According to Deputy Director at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr. Wasim Khawaja, cancer's seven warning signals are change in bowel or bladder habit, a sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, thickening or lump in breast or elsewhere, indigestion or difficulty in swallowing, obvious change in wart or mole and nagging cough or hoarseness./The four basic components of cancer control are prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, and palliative care, he said. According to WHO, between 30% and 50% of cancer deaths can be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors, including avoiding tobacco products, reducing alcohol consumption, maintaining a healthy body weight, exercising regularly and addressing infection-related risk factors./Health experts say that dietary modification is another important approach to cancer control. Diets high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pistachios, peanuts, walnuts, soybean, tomatoes, beans, pulses and legumes and avoiding processed foods high in fat, salt and or sugar and sugary drinks, bakery items have a protective effect against many cancers."

Some of the most common cancers - including breast, colorectal and cervical cancer- are curable if detected early."
Of gas and other demons," is now a luxury in Pakistan. The new gas tariff is hurting not only consumers but the government as well. The media is asking tough questions from the government and the government is visibly disturbed. Like always, the elephant of seventy percent less well-off Pakistanis remains invisible and a government is being attacked for finally doing something right./No government has ever been hurt by the fact that piped gas has been made available to less than one third citizens, favouring the most prosperous sections of society and geographical areas. The remaining seventy percent cook using open fires or simple stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and firewood./According to WHO, each year close to four million people die worldwide prematurely from illness attributable to household air pollution from inefficient cooking practices. We can safely assume that thousands of such deaths occur in Pakistan. Pneumonia is a major killer of children under five years of age. Close to half of these deaths are caused by particulate matter (soot) inhaled from household air pollution./Household air pollution causes a number of diseases including stroke, heart disease and lung cancer. Again, we can safely assume that hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis get these medical problems each year because no clean fuel is available to them./The government has ended some subsidy on natural gas and is perhaps also forcing consumers to pay for the gas stolen by other consumers. These steps have been taken without a well-thought-out policy about government subsidies. In the same breath, the government has allowed CNG, fertilizer and textiles, three crony sectors of Pakistan's economy to gobble up Rs200 billion of gas infrastructure development cess, duly paid by consumers and collected by these sectors./The real scandal is not lifting subsidies to some extent, but how natural gas has been susbsidised in Pakistan for the last seven decades since the Sui gas field became operational in the mid-1950s. The Sui gas field in the Bugti tribal area meets approximately 45 percent of the country's total gas production. The Dera Bugti district, where the gas fields are located, is amongst the least developed areas in the country. Balochistan itself did not benefit much from its natural treasures. The royalty fixed for gas drawn from the field area is based on 'wellhead value', which remained extremely low till recently./Though natural gas was discovered in Balochistan in 1952, many districts of the province remain deprived of gas transmission facilities. It was only in 1976 that the province got liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in Quetta. Later, gas through pipelines was made available in the city. The situation in Sindh's gas-producing districts is not much different either./While laying pipelines for distributing gas, the less well-off areas were discriminated everywhere For example, almost every village in central Punjab has piped gas, while in southern Punjab most secondary cities are without this facility. In fact, many large cities in the region were connected with gas pipelines very recently./These huge subsidies mean that resources were transferred from the gas-producing regions - which happen to be the poorest in the country - to the gas-consuming regions, which are the most well-off./Let the short months of winter pass by and every gas consumer, few of them below the poverty line, will spend less on gas for cooking than their domestic workers pay for their firewood. The current system of subsidy assumes that those who consume less gas are poor and need to be subsidised while those who consume more are rich and should pay more. It ignores the fact that people with less income often have large families or live in combined families while well-off people often live in nuclear families with a smaller number of children. It is a very lazy style of providing subsidy on a precious natural resource./While acting to lower subsidies on natural gas, the government has failed to plug leakages in the system of distribution of utilities, particularly gas and electricity. The theft of these two utilities remains rampant. Since both utilities belong to the federation, provinces show little interest in cooperating with distributing companies to stop the theft. In some cases, like the PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the last tenure at least, the provincial government actively supports theft of utilities./It has been estimated that total energy system losses amount to $2,168 million per year, of which electrical system losses are $1,400 million and gas system losses are $768 million. A good part of these losses are related to theft and corruption. Such theft is hurting the national economy hard as is clear from the fast piling up circular debt. It also makes a mockery of lifting subsidies and forcing honest consumers to pay the full cost of utilities./The government should rethink and revamp the whole system of subsidies and stop supporting the rich at the cost of the poor. Such support becomes ridiculous when it is done in the name of the poor./Take the example of the Utility Stores Corporation through which the government subsidises selected food items. Almost all of the stores are located in well-off areas of cities and are mostly frequented by middle-class consumers to make some savings. Instead of keeping this charade of subsiding food for people, the government should either close them down or redefine their role. It will be more suitable to use these resources to support charities that try to feed the hungry and provide food support to the poor./Hassan Khawar, a public policy expert, has calculated that out of the total development spending of Rs1.7 trillion in Punjab during the last five years, a massive 50 percent or Rs853 billion were spent in Lahore. On a per capita basis, the province spent 25-30 times more on a citizen of Lahore than a citizen of Layyah, Pakpattan or Chiniot./Something similar, though less in scale, was done by the KP government during the same period. According to research done by the Omar Asghar Khan Foundation, a leading civil society organisation working in KP, the sum allocated to three districts of Nowshehra, Swat and Swabi was Rs58.13 billion, 47 percent more than the total development funds of Rs30.78 billion given to the province's seven chronically poor southern districts. The six districts of Hazara received Rs33.26 billion or 42 percent less than amounts given to the three favourite districts./The bias towards tertiary education and tertiary healthcare system is another way of supporting the rich at the cost of the poor. The government either subsidises or fully pays for the higher education of middle-class children while ignoring primary education for poor children. It keeps distributing laptops to middle-class students while primary schools have been deprived of very basic necessities like drinking water and toilets./After years, I have become alert to the gas burning in my wasteful geyser. I have also learnt that a cold shower can be great for health. However, Naya Pakistan must be more than the magic of a cold bath."
Killer in the air," Air pollution is called a silent killer that gradually affects people's respiratory tract and causes dangerous diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This silent killer is hovering over two big cities of Pakistan, Faisalabad and Lahore. The two cities have been listed in the world's top 10 most polluted cities. This ranking has raised a serious concern over the health of millions of people living in these cities. The government, which is going through some rough time, should consider this as a serious threat and take some measures to tackle the issue. It can follow the example of China which, to tackle air pollution, closed coal-fired power stations and banned people from burning coal for heat. As a result, it pulled its cities out of the Top 10 list./The Pakistani people, especially from Faisalabad and Lahore, should also adopt safety measures like using a surgical mask to cover their mouth and nose. The healthcare authorities should conduct public awareness campaigns to inform others how bad air pollution can be and so on."
Causes of cancer explained at seminar," A daylong seminar was held at the Khushal Khan Khattak University Karak on Tuesday to create awareness among the people about the causes of cancer./The seminar was held with the collaboration of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). Director, Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicines (IRNUM) Peshawar, Dr Abdur Rauf Khattak, described the different causes of the cancer spread./He described the major causes of cancer like air pollution created by industries, viruses, bacteria and radiations. The director said cancer was on the rise worldwide./He mentioned that smoking was the major cause of lung cancer. He added that non-sterilization of equipment used in different surgical operations in hospitals were also causing hepatitis which later turned into cancer./The director said that the government was providing a cancer treatment facility on the subsidized rate to the poor segment of society./Director of the Bannu Institute of Nuclear Medicines Oncology and Radiotherapy Dr Muhammad Rauf said different treatment facilities of cancer available in the hospital and said the people of the southern districts could get the facility at a low cost./Director General Safety of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission Dr Hussain Majid apprised the participants about the safety measures in the exploration of the radioactive substances. There was no danger of radiation from the local Uranium extraction in Karak, he explained./On the occasion, the spokesperson of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission Shahid Riaz Khan highlighted the efforts of the commission for creating awareness among the people about the causes of cancer./Dr Inamul Haq, head of the department of Bio-Informatics and Computer Science, thanked the officials of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and doctors on behalf of Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Mirza Jan for arranging the seminar and called for more such useful activities."
NA speaker stresses tackling air pollution at all levels," Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser said that air pollution has become a serious issue which needs to be tackled at national, provincial and local level./'The role of Parliaments and Parliamentarians are crucial as they are policymakers and they scrutinize policies at the implementation level. Pakistan being the signatory of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) should accomplish its responsibility of fulfilling the targets of pollution-free Pakistan,' he expressed these views while inaugurating the 2nd Conference on 'Parliamentary Campaign to implement the Clean Air SDG's and the Paris Agreement', organised by Air Quality Asia in the Parliament House on Tuesday./The Speaker National Assembly said that major cities in Pakistan like Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi suffer from fog every year which indicates the poor air quality and ever increasing air pollution. He mentioned the present government's initiative of 'Clean and Green Pakistan' and 'Billion Tsunami Trees' is the right step to make air clean and fresh in Pakistan./He wished that this movement should not be limited just to forests and it should be made compulsory for all Housing Societies to have a green belt and each home to plant trees in its courtyard./Asad Qaiser mentioned about the government plan to sprinkle the seeds on non-accessible forest land. He expressed his fear that agriculture land is being used by Housing Societies and industries carelessly. 'There is a dire need to demarcate the agriculture land, he added. He expressed his resolve that both the National Assembly and Senate will cooperate in enacting the laws for controlling this menace,' he said./He assured participants the support of National Assembly Secretariat and both Houses for making Pakistan pollution-free. He expressed the dire need of mass awareness campaign as our religion Islam also stresses a lot on cleanliness./Riaz Fatyana Convener SDG's and Chairman Standing Committee of Law and Justice welcomed the Speaker for inaugurating the 2nd Conference. He said that economic and health impact of pollution and climate change is very severe. He also said that it is their duty to make air clean and fresh for the future generation./Ms. Shazia Z. Rafi, the President Air Quality Asia briefed the house regarding statistic and implications of air pollution in the region. She said that parliamentarians being the policymakers and policy actors can play a crucial role in implementing the clean air initiative in Pakistan. She said the impact of polluted air on human health is worse than the impact of diseases./The conference was attended by Senators, Members of the National Assembly and various experts on climate changes."
Killer air," With clouds of smog hovering over parts of Pakistan, it is clear that the damage that air pollution does to public health in Pakistan is significant. One must wonder if providing numbers of how much damage it does would do much to shift government inaction on the matter. One can only try. The latest report on the 'State of Global Air' - released by the US-based organisation Health Effects Institute (HEI) - has put Pakistan second in the list of countries with the highest mortality rate due to air pollution. Our neighbours, India and China, are tied for first place in a list that no one should be proud to be on. A total of 1.2 million die each year of air pollution in China and India. The numbers from India suggest that more people die of air pollution than smoking. In Pakistan, 128,000 deaths can be attributed to air pollution. India and Pakistan both rank higher than China in terms of household air pollution, which means the air is not safe in over half of the households in our countries. Overall, the report finds air pollution to be the fifth leading cause of early death worldwide./There is little doubt that improving air quality alone would result in a much better and longer life for Pakistanis. Not only would everyday diseases related to the air tract be lower, average life spans would improve by around one year. Air pollution is considered the third leading risk factor for Type 2 diabetes deaths in the world. In the case of children in South Asia, air pollution cuts their lives short by 30 months, since young children absorb more pollutants which impair their development. All parents like to claim that they care for the long life of their children, but it is hard to believe this in face of the inaction over air pollution. Cumulated together, the report concludes that 147 million years of healthy life were lost in 2017 due to air pollution. The report concludes that just breathing air in our cities is equivalent to being a heavy smoker. This is a serious issue. And the fact is that those in power know this. Warnings have been delivered over and over again. And it does not need a research group sitting in the US to warn that drastic action needs to be taken. We will need to wait to see if it mobilises our government into action."
"Govt urged to give health cards to senior citizens, Parkinson's disease patients"," Instead of using public money for political mileage, the government should provide health cards to all the senior citizens at the age of 65 as the majority of elderly people in Pakistan are suffering from multiple, lifelong health conditions and need continuous medical support in later days of their lives./'There are around one million patients in Pakistan who are living with Parkinson's disease and they need medicines worth several thousand rupees monthly to live a normal life./The majority of these patients cannot afford these medicines, so they should be given priority in giving health cards,' demanded an eminent neurologist and president of the Neurology Awareness and Research Foundation (NARF), Prof Muhammad Wasey Shakir, while speaking at a seminar on Thursday./The awareness session on Parkinson's disease was organised by the NARF at a local hotel, which was addressed by senior neurologists and patients, who highlighted different aspects of the neurodegenerative disorder, which causes serious difficulties in performing day-to-day activities for the patients./Prof Wasey said that although nobody knows the actual causes of Parkinson's disease, new studies have revealed that the onset of this neurodegenerative disorder is linked with air pollution. He deplored that Pakistan's four cities, including Karachi and Lahore, were among the 10 most polluted cities of the world./'Air pollution is not only causing Parkinson's disease but it is also a major cause of many other serious health conditions, including cancers in our population. Unfortunately, the majority of our population is unaware of the hazards of air pollution and openly burns garbage around their homes and in the city.'/He claimed that scientific studies also proved that air pollution was also responsible for 30 per cent of the stroke cases and called for steps to minimise air pollution by putting a ban on garbage burning, vehicular emissions, burning of fossil fuel for energy production and other sources so that people could be prevented from serious ailments./Another renowned neurologist and expert, Prof Nadir Ali Syed, said Parkinson's disease was the only neurodegenerative disorder which was treated through medicines. He added that patients started feeling well soon after taking medicines, which was not the case in many other neurological disorders./He said that although Parkinson's disease was not curable, it was treatment, and urged patients with tremors, stiffness of body, constipation and other symptoms to see a trained and qualified neurologist so that patients could be diagnosed at the earliest and given proper medicines for the treatment of the Parkinson's disease./According to the expert, a healthy lifestyle, daily exercise, having a balanced diet and sleeping properly are some of the good habits that not only prevent people from Parkinson's but also from many other non-communicable diseases./Aziz Hussain, a patient living with Parkinson's disease, told the patients that they should not consider themselves as incurable and wasted persons and try to perform all their daily chores without seeking help from others./The seminar was also addressed by Secretary NARF Dr Abdul Malik, Abdur Rasheed Dal and Irshad Jan. Patients were also given the chance to ask questions about their condition and management."
Aamer calls for assessment of air quality in Islamabad," Federal Minister for National Health Services Aamer Mehmood Kiani has requested the Adviser to the Prime Minister on Climate Change to carry out an assessment of air quality in Islamabad so that necessary measures can be taken to protect the health of the city's residents./'Global climate change and deteriorating quality of urban air are affecting human health in a major way. The health effects of air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, asthma and aggravation of respiratory and cardiac conditions. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory and cardiovascular systems./Declining air quality is a huge environmental issue in Islamabad; evidence indicates that air pollutants contribute to serious, even fatal, damage to the cardiovascular system - and air pollution is a factor that you can't control just through healthy lifestyle,' the Minister states in a letter written to the PM's adviser./To address the situation, a rapid assessment of Particulate Matter 10 and 2.5 may be measured in different locations in high industrial zones of I-9 and I-10, Aamer has suggested. The particulate matter in industries will be measured through Haz-dust EPAM (Environmental Particulate Air Monitor-5000), available with Environmental Protection Agency, Ministry of Climate Change. EPAM-5000 is a portable instrument for measuring indoor environmental and ambient air monitoring. ""Your kind support for this assessment project is required to help us in measurement of the PM level in different areas of Islamabad,' the letter states, ending with a request to direct the EPA to extend its full support to investigators of the Health Services Academy, Islamabad./The declining quality of air is the biggest environmental issue in Islamabad. Particulate matter in smoke causes respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Urban air pollution in terms of particulate matter is estimated to cause around 22,000 premature deaths among adults and 700 deaths among young children annually. Indoor air pollution causes deaths of more than 30,000 children per year."

Battling pollution," The worsening pollution in Pakistan had caused in 2015 at least 135,000 premature deaths among adults and around five million cases of illness, according to another study on global air pollution. The World Bank estimates that Pakistan's annual burden to disease due to outdoor air pollution accounts for about 22,000 premature adult deaths each year, and indoor (household) pollution accounts for 40 million cases of acute respiratory infections resulting in another 28,000 deaths annually. These are highly alarming figures. According to experts, the national economy suffers Rs 365 billion every year on this account, adversely affecting GDP growth. The World Bank estimates that three to five percent GDP of Pakistan is lost on this account. The 2018 global Environment Performance Index (EPI) has ranked Pakistan at 169 among 180 countries on 24 performance indicators. In recent years, environmental pollution has increased to disproportionate levels./Though legal and regulatory framework for environmental control exists since long, weak enforcement and ineffective management, compounded with high population growth and rapid urbanization, have not delivered results -- despite generous economic and technical assistance from international donor agencies. Consequently, pollution and environmental degradation continue to accelerate unabated. The share of expenditure on environmental improvement is a nominal 0.12 percent of the total Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) as reflected inthe 2018-19 allocation for the Ministry of Climate Change. The nation therefore faces serious environmental challenges, particularly in the backdrop of the government's renewed focus on developing the industrial, housing, transport, energy and infrastructure sectors. It is indeed critical to address pollution, whether air pollution, lead exposure, noise pollution or inadequate sanitation and hygiene. The Ministry of Climate Change needs to realize that the economic growth of a country is conversely proportional to environmental degradation, and should adopt solutions for mitigating pollution. Time is of the essence."
"Tobacco harmful in all its forms, disguise: WHO"," On the eve of this year's World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is calling on people to protect their lungs by not only quitting tobacco smoking but also saying no to secondhand smoke./Enough scientific evidence is available to prove that tobacco is harmful in all its forms and disguise. It kills over eight million people every year. Tobacco smoking and secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and tuberculosis. Tobacco smoke in itself is a very dangerous form of air pollution. Tobacco smoking is the primary cause for lung cancer, responsible for over two thirds of lung cancer deaths globally./Tobacco smoke contains over 7000 chemicals, at least 69 of which are known to cause cancer. Second-hand smoke exposure at home or in the workplace also increases the risk of lung cancer./Additionally, tobacco smoking is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a condition where the build-up of pus-filled mucus in the lungs results in a painful cough and agonising breathing difficulties./The risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases particularly high among individuals who start smoking at a young age, as tobacco smoke significantly slows lung development./Tobacco also aggravates asthma, which restricts activity and contributes to disability. Furthermore, tuberculosis damages the lungs and reduces lung function, which is further exacerbated by tobacco smoking./Around 38pc of men and 4pc of women are smokers. In some countries, 57pc of men and 29pc of women smoke. There is huge burden of tobacco use in Pakistan. As many as 19.1 pc adults use tobacco in any form, men 31.8 pc and women 5.8pc and among the youth (13-15 years of age) the prevalence is 13.3 and 6.6 pc among boys and girls respectively./As per Global Adult Tobacco Survey that was conducted in Pakistan in 2014, the current adult tobacco smokers and smokeless tobacco users were 12.4 pc and 7.7 pc respectively and exposure to secondhand smoke was 48.3pc./On the conservative estimates keeping in view the increase in population, tobacco attributable deaths may amount to 227,000 per year./'Smoking among young people is particularly worrying,' says Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, World Health Organisation Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. 'It has reached 42pc in boys and 31pc in girls'. This includes smoking Shisha, which is more popular among young people than cigarettes./'By 2025, smoking is expected to rise in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, contrary to the trend in the rest of the world,' explains Dr Al-Mandhari. 'This will lead to an escalating epidemic of lung disease regionally'./People must quit smoking to reduce the risk of lung cancer; slow the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and improve asthma symptoms; raise awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure; discourage the use of tobacco in any form; advocate for your rights, and let things other than tobacco take your breath away./Governments made commitments to reduce tobacco use by 30pc by 2025. It's time to accelerate tobacco control legislation and the implementation of FCTC and MPOWER measures to reduce demand for this deadly product./'Policies are in place to help achieve this target,' says Dr Al-Mandhari. 'The World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the MPOWER measures to reduce demand for this deadly product can help us beat tobacco and save lives,' he said./'Stop tobacco from taking your breath away. Tobacco kills one person every 4 seconds. Do not be that person and do not contribute to the death toll,' says Dr. Palitha Mahipal, World Health Organisation Head of Pakistan. He said tobacco is deadly in any form or disguise. Tobacco killed 100 million during the last century and if current trends persist, tobacco, by the end of this century, will kill a billion people or more unless urgent action is taken./Dr Palitha said that a recent high level World Health Organisation mission on tobacco taxation has held extensive technical discussions with the Federal Bureau of Revenue, met with high-ups and advocated for an immediate elimination of the third-tier and enhanced tobacco taxation and we would see it happening. Dr Palitha advocated for strict Tobacco Control laws; large-sized pictorial health warning on tobacco packs; implementation of 'Plain Packaging'; comprehensive ban on Tobacco Advertising Promotion and Sponsorship; enhanced Tobacco Taxation and implementation of 'Health Tax' on tobacco products; and continued Health awareness campaigns."
Air pollution biggest threat to life on earth," Air pollution is the contamination of the air, irrespective of indoors or outside. It occurs when any harmful gases, dust, smoke enter the atmosphere and makes it difficult for plants, animals and humans to survive. Air pollution can further be classified into visible and invisible air pollution./Primarily air pollutants can be caused by primary source or secondary resources. The pollutants that are a direct result of the process can be called primary pollutants. A classic example of a primary pollutant is sulfur dioxide emitted from factories. The secondary pollutants are caused by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants. The smog created by interactions of several primary pollutants is known to be as, a secondary pollutants. Sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and other factory combustibles are one of the major causes of air pollution. The pollution emitting from vehicles including trucks, jeeps, cars, trains, airplanes cause an immense amount of pollution. We rely on them to fulfill our daily needs of transportation. But their overuse is killing our environment as dangerous gases are polluting the environment. carbon monoxide caused by improper or incomplete combustion and generally emitted from vehicles is another major pollutant along with nitrogen oxides, that is produced from both natural and manmade process. Ammonia is a very common bi-product from agricultural related activities and one of the most hazardous gases in the atmosphere. Use of insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities has grown quite a lot. They emit harmful chemicals into the air and can also cause water pollution./Manufacturing companies release a large amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, organic compounds and chemicals into the air, thereby depleting the quality of air. Manufacturing industries can be found at every corner of the earth and there is no area that has not been affected by it. Petroleum refineries also release hydrocarbons and various other chemicals that pollute the air and also cause land pollution. During mining, dust and chemicals are released in the air causing massive air pollution. This is one of the reasons which is responsible for the deteriorating health conditions of workers and nearby residents. The effects of air pollution are alarming. They are known to create several respiratory and heart conditions, along with various cancers. Among other dangers, several millions are known to have died due to direct or indirect effects of air pollution. Children in areas exposed to air pollutants are said to commonly suffer from pneumonia and asthma. Another direct effect is the global warming. With increasing temperatures worldwide, increase in sea levels and melting of ice and icebergs, displacements and loss of habitat have already signaled an impending disaster if actions for preservation and normalization are not undertaken soon./Harmful gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere during the burning of fossil fuels. When it rains, the water droplets combines with these air pollutants become acidic and fall in the form of acid rain. Acid rain can cause great damage to humans, animals and crops./Eutrophication is a condition where a large amount of nitrogen present in some pollutants triggers abundant growth of algae on the surface of the sea, lakes and ponds adversely affecting fish, plants and animal species. The algae are present due to the presence of chemicals. Like humans, animals also face some devastating effect of air pollution. Toxic chemicals present in the air can force birds and animal species to migrate to a new place and change their habitat. The toxic pollutants deposited over the surface of the water and can also affect sea animals./Ozone exists in the earth's stratosphere and is responsible for protecting humans from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays. Earth's ozone layer is depleting due to the presence of chlorofluorocarbons, hydro chlorofluorocarbons. As the ozone layer depletes, it will emit harmful rays back to the earth and can cause skin and eye related problems. The UV rays are also affecting crops badly./Air pollution can be reduced by encouraging people to use more and more public modes of public transportation to reduce pollution. Also, try to make use of car pooling to save energy and money. Switch off fans and lights while going out. Understand the concept of reduce, reuse and recycle. Do not throw away items that are of no use. In-fact reuse them for some other purpose, e.g old jars can be used to store cereals or pulses. Clean energy technologies like solar, wind and geothermal are on a globally high demand these days. Governments across the world are providing grants to consumers interested in installing solar panels for their homes. This will go a long way to curb air pollution. Compact florescent lights consume less electricity as against their counterparts. They live longer, consume less electricity, lower electricity bills and also help in to reduce pollution by consuming less energy. Planting more trees can be helpful in providing a clean and pure air to breathe in./Several attempts are being made worldwide on personal, industrial and governmental levels to reduce the air pollution. Pakistan Navy, in line with the Government of Pakistan's vision of 'Clean and Green Pakistan' launched a Tree Plantation campaign which includes planting of mangroves along the coastal belt of Sindh and Balochistan and pine on Margalla Hills. It will serve as an impetus to not only reduce global warming as well as air pollution. Moreover, a series of innovations and experiments aimed at alternate and non-conventional options to reduce pollutants must be put to use at a larger scale to make the impact felt. Air pollution is one of the larger mirrors of man's follies, and a challenge, we need to overcome to see a bright tomorrow."
'Navy playing role in promoting safe use of ocean resources'," Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi said that on 8th of June 2019, we celebrate 'World Oceans Day' to reflect on the value of oceans to our planet. According to a Pakistan Navy press release he said this in a message on the occasion of the World Oceans Day./Oceans; the primary source of sustenance of life on earth, act as lungs to our planet as they provide most of the oxygen we breathe. They are also major absorbers of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide. Thus, human activity on land is directly affecting the oceans and the life that flourishes within./He said the purpose of World Oceans Day, celebrated globally under the ambit of UN, is to enlighten the world community regarding the impact of human actions on the oceans and to explore ways and means for their sustainable use and the marine resources we derive from them./The theme selected for 'World Ocean Day-2019' by UN is `Gender and the Oceans'. This offers an opportunity to explore the gender dimension of human relationship with the oceans. While women constitute half of the work force, they only comprise 2% of the seafarers' work force and 38% of the overall marine scientists. They earn only 64% of men's wages and have less access to the decision making positions. The theme aims to raise gender literacy and promote gender equality, in ocean related activities such as marine scientific research, fisheries. labour at sea, as well as policy making./On the eve of World Oceans Day, we acknowledge the challenges that are eroding the integrity of our waters - pollution, marine invasive species, extreme climatic changes and threats to survival of marine species. We also acknowledge the need for greater participation of women to address these challenges in a more sustainable manner./To commemorate significance of the World Oceans Day, Pakistan Navy is playing a lead role in promoting safe and sustainable use of ocean resources. Some of the major PN initiatives include; beach cleaning, construction of harbour debris collection barges, intensified Mangroves plantation, banning use of destructive fishing nets, tackling oil pollution at sea and coordination with industrial community to reduce waste dumping into the sea. Another focal area being pursued by PN is the promotion of formal Maritime Education, especially for the women. Bahria University, under PN auspices has commenced Graduate and Masters programmes for both male as well as female students./On this Day, let us re-affirm our commitment and resolve for preserving sustainable use of oceans and marine resources, while making conscious efforts to empower women in various economic activities related to the oceans. Only together, we can protect Earth's ultimate source of life./Meanwhile in his another message on the World Environment Day the Naval Chief said that with an aim to accentuate the significance of Clean Air and to promote awareness for protection and preservation of the environment, Pakistan Navy observed World Environment Day with full enthusiasm./World Environment Day is observed internationally on June 5 every year under the auspices of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The purpose of the day is to bring worldwide focus on importance of clean environment and stimulate attention and actions for its preservation focusing on a specific aspect of environment every year under a certain theme./The theme selected for this year's World Environment Day is 'Air Pollution' which is a major source of concern for mankind. Air borne pollutants are responsible for about one third of deaths from strokes, chronic respiratory diseases and lungs cancer as well as one quarter of deaths from heart attacks./Pakistan Navy also observes World Environment Day regularly. To mark importance of the day, numerous activities are arranged by Pakistan Navy to highlight significance of environment and promote awareness amongst public, concerned agencies and departments. The aim of these activities is to come together and explore renewable energy alternatives and application of green technologies to keep our atmosphere clean and to improve the quality of air that we breathe./These activities include tree plantation and beach cleaning campaigns, environment awareness walks, lectures  and  seminars on significance of the day and social media campaigns. Such events play a pivotal role in enhancing awareness about importance of environment amongst the general populace./Chief of the Naval Staff in his message on the day, reaffirmed Pakistan Navy's commitment to ensure a cleaner and safer environment especially against air pollution which directly affects our quality of life. Naval Chief emphasized that our conduct in all walks of life should be in line with the principles for conservation of environment./Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi reiterated that Pakistan Navy will continue to play its due role in this noble cause."
With every breath," Though we do not realize it, every breath we take could be bringing us a little closer to death. According to international monitors in December last year, Lahore in Pakistan recorded the worst air quality anywhere in the world, followed by New Delhi, India and Pristina in Kosovo. Figures from the WHO state that there are thousands of deaths in the country each year due to diseases directly related to pollutants in the air. Somewhat surprisingly, most of them die as a result of indoor pollution. The fact that each year we are asked to keep doors and windows closed and avoid outdoor places to guard against Lahore's now annual winter smog suggests we understand air pollution very little. Air quality in Lahore and other cities in Pakistan, especially those located away from coastal areas, is not always better in months outside the winter season either./The failure to provide people with a guarantee of a safe environment pledged to them under the constitution of Pakistan has been raised in the Senate by former information minister Nisar A Memon. The country urgently requires an air quality policy aimed at cutting down particulate matter in the air; particulate matter comprises minute pieces of solid or liquid materials which are suspended in the air and cause damage when inhaled. Gases and emissions from factories and brick kilns contribute to their number. According to the senator, it is time for parliament to consider means to provide people a safer setting in which to live. As we all know, it is also probable that the death toll from air pollution is higher than official estimates given that many deaths are not reported and their causes not always known. The burden of disease caused by air pollution is also extremely high in Pakistan and will continue to rise unless we are able to control air quality./Despite promises by successive governments, we have not so far succeeded in this. Because of limited equipment available with the meteorological department, problems have been reported over the years even in recording air quality. It is only in the most recent years that people have begun to recognize that winter fog is in fact highly dangerous smog which can cause irreversible damage. Efforts to close down brick kilns in Punjab have so far floundered, with owners protesting such moves. It is obvious a longer-term policy has to be devised to make essential manufacturing safer while protecting people, particularly the elderly and the children, from the harmful effects of air pollution in a situation where we can literally no longer breathe safely."
40pc of deaths in Pakistan occur due to poor water quality'," Around 135,000 deaths per year are attributed to ambient air pollution, making it the leading cause of sickness and death in Pakistan while about $48 billion is the estimated economic burden of air pollution in the country./Air pollution and lack of proper waste management infrastructure are the major environmental issues in Karachi. The year 2025 has been marked as the year when Pakistan if it doesn't mend its ways soon will turn from a 'water-stressed' country to a 'water-scarce' country. In Pakistan, it is estimated that about 30 percent of all diseases and 40 percent of all deaths are due to poor water quality./Muhammad Waseem Vohra, convener of the FPCCI Central Committee on Industry Academia Collaboration on Water Resources, shared these disturbing figures at the 52nd Public Awareness Seminar on 'Saving Water and Environmental Sustainability', held at Dr Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD), University of Karachi on Wednesday./Dr Panjwani Center and Virtual Education Project Pakistan (VEPP) jointly organised the seminar. Vohra said that the government must focus on legislation, advanced technology development and public participation to conserve the country's water resources, and provide every Pakistani sustainable access to safe water supply./The most water is used in the irrigation of agriculture lands, stressing the particular significance of the country's agriculture sector, which contributes about 25 percent of Pakistan's GNP, he said./He informed the seminar that it was estimated that, in Pakistan, 30 percent of all diseases and 40 percent of all deaths are due to poor water quality. The poor water supply was caused by the lack of water availability, he said, and pointed out that water pollution was mainly caused by heavy utilisation of water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes./He lamented that the various forms of pollution had increased in the country, as Karachi was facing extensive environmental and health problems. Air pollution, lack of proper waste management infrastructure and degradation of water bodies were the major environmental issues in Karachi, he added./Therefore, saving water in all areas domestic, agriculture and industrial sectors would be followed on modern lines and legislation should be made as per flaws found by experts in our society, he said./Pakistan has major dams with a storage capacity of water of 102 million cubic feet, while the availability is 140 million, which shows that a considerable amount of water is being wasted or it flows into the sea, he pointed out./Our agriculture is using 95 percent of water available from the Indus River system, he said, adding that this system based on Stone Age irrigation techniques needed to be changed with a modern system."
Vehicular emissions exacerbate air pollution," The Vehicular emissions have marred the ambient air pollution of the federal capital where the particulate matter 2.5 microns (particle pollution) has been recorded at the highest ratio of 41.63 micrograms per meter cube./Vehicular emissions comprise 43 per cent of the total ambient air pollution in the country whereas the federal capital's air quality is deteriorating with increasing number of vehicles spewing dark smoke./Talking to this agency, Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Director General Farzana Altaf Shah said there were two main sources of air pollution in the federal capital namely industrial and automobile emissions./'The air quality recorded during Ramazan and summer vacation in the capital has ideal level of declined pollutants, but with the reopening of schools and colleges, it has again attained dangerous level of pollutants with their smoke emitting buses and vans,' she added./The EPA DG said the agency was issuing notices to all the private and public institutions, particularly schools, colleges and universities, ministries, and motels to properly maintain their fleets of buses and vans./'Our teams equipped with proper gadgets visit the institutions at random to check emissions of vehicular fleet,"" she added./Farzana, however, admitted that all the buses, whether running on intercity routes or on city roads, were using non-compliant diesel fuel containing high ratio of hazardous sulphur dioxide./Contrary to the EPA''s claims, smoke emitting vehicles in large number, including buses of educational institutions, can be seen running across the twin cities polluting the air without any check and balance./""What to talk of other departments when even the Capital Development Authority(CDA) and the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation(IMC), which were responsible to keep the capital clean and pollution-free, themselves have large fleets of garbage collecting vehicles, buses, van and jeeps, emitting clouds of dark smoke on the city roads,"" Hassan Jan, who daily travels on Kashmir Highway to reach his office, said./Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) spokesperson Dr Khawaja Waseem said the dark vehicular emissions had serious impact on human health./It causes allergy, infection and irritation in the respiratory track which could further develop into cancerous health complications having effects on the nervous system, he added./'The people, especially motorcyclists, should wear pollution masks, some of them have inbuilt air filters, which stop dust particles entering mouths and nostrils,"" he said./Dr Khawaja said everyone traveling on the road was at risk of air pollution and masks could help them avoid direct contact with the dark smoke and dust./Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul told this agency that it was imperative to initiate an action against the vehicular pollution./Like the government's drive against plastic bags, which was initially started from the Prime Minister's Office and federal secretariat, measures would have to be taken to do away the smoke emitting vehicles of the official departments for setting an example for the masses to follow suit, she added./Some positive initiatives would be taken by the government in that regard soon, she said. However, despite realising the severity of the issue and it''s consequent outcomes leaving public health at serious risk, no measure could be seen to control dark smoke emitting vehicles. The authorities concerned had merely restricted themselves to notices and warnings."
World Lungs Day: Smoking major cause of lungs diseases," Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in Pakistani men and it is preventable if smoking is avoided./In Pakistan 10 per cent population is suffering from asthma and about 5pc above the age of 40 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This was stated in a handout issued by the Pakistan Chest Society which is striving for pulmonary care of the people./Respiratory diseases impose an immense worldwide health burden. The facts are shocking: 384 million people suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 3 million die from it each year, making it the third leading cause of death worldwide./Around 10 million people catch tuberculosis and 1.6 million die from it each year, making it the most common lethal infectious disease; 1.76 million people die of lungs cancer each year, making it the deadliest cancer while 334 million people suffer from asthma, making it the most common chronic disease of childhood. It affects 14 percent of children globally and it is on the rise./Pneumonia kills millions of people each year making it a leading cause of death in very young and very old person. Ninety percent of the world's population lives in places where poor air quality exceeds the WHO guidelines. Air quality of many Pakistani cities has become worse over time./National Alliance for Tobacco Control and Pakistan Chest Society joined global organisations in call for healthy lungs for all on the occasion of World Lungs Day (WLD), December 25. Smoking is by far the most important risk factor responsible for chronic lung diseases, said Professor Javaid Khan of Aga Khan University (AKU) and chair of National Alliance for Tobacco Control. Rising atmospheric pollution in Pakistan in recent years could result in exponential increase in the number of cases with COPD in the country, warned Prof Khan./Prof Ali Zubairi, president of PCS, Sindh chapter, said use of biomass fuel like wood and coal for cooking was another important cause for COPD especially in women living in the rural areas. Prof Zubairi urged the government to take measures for the implementation of clean air laws in the country as COPD could also occur due to exposure to secondhand smoke./Quoting AKU research work, Prof Zubairi said tobacco smoke pollution in Pakistani restaurants was one of the worst in the world. He demanded strict implementation of smoking ban at public places in the country./National Alliance for Tobacco Control and Pakistan Chest Society passed a resolution, demanding creating awareness among the public and policymakers that respiratory health is a major component of global health. It was demanded reduce the use of all tobacco products through universal enforcement of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; adopt and require World Health Organisation air quality standards to reduce ambient, indoor, and occupational air pollution for all countries; promote universal access to quality health care, essential medicines, and immunisation; improve early diagnosis of respiratory diseases through increasing public awareness of lung health and disease; increase training of health professionals in the country in respiratory disease; standardise the monitoring and management of respiratory diseases with evidence-based national and international strategies; increase research to prevent and treat respiratory diseases./'We hope World Lungs Day will provide an opportunity for action, conversation, and awareness. A unified voice of all dedicated to respiratory health will be a powerful force,' said Professor Javaid Khan./Meanwhile, a handout was also issued by the Institute of TB and Chest Medicine of Mayo Hospital. It said this year's World Lung Day theme is 'healthy lungs for all,' calling for universal health coverage (UHC) where all people receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship./Universal coverage is particularly important to persons with respiratory disease. For example, a break in the supply of medicine for patient with tuberculosis could cause the development of drug resistance, which carries serious consequences. Abrupt unavailability of asthma medicine could cause severe suffering and even death. Lack of health care provider availability usually means delay in diagnosis, which could be fatal to lung cancer patients./The global spotlight on UHC represents an opportunity for substantial progress in fight against lung disease around the world. 'On World Lungs Day, we are asking the lung health community to raise awareness of the burden of respiratory disease, while advocating for UHC,' said the handout. It said, 'World Lungs Day is a day for lung health advocacy and action, an opportunity for us all to unite and promote better lung health globally.'"
Inspection of smoky industrial units ordered," Environment Protection Department (EPD), Punjab has directed all its field formations to start inspections of all smoky industrial units, including brick-kilns, steel re-rolling mills and etc and seal those who have failed to adopt the Punjab government's anti-smog measures./The department issued these directions as preemptive measures to successfully encounter the upcoming smog season, which starts after mid October and continues until December every year./Director EPD Naseemur Rehman said main factors behind smog included smoke emitted by brick-kilns, industrial units and stubble burning across the provincial metropolis. He said there are more than 10,000 brick kilns in Punjab and only 300 to 500 have converted themselves to zigzag technology. He said the government had given them a grace period of one year to convert to this technology and all those who have not done this will be sealed./Talking about zigzag technology, he said that with this new technology, brick-kilns would be 40 percent more fuel efficient and their emissions would be reduced by 60pc. He revealed that the first brick-kiln on this model was constructed in Raiwind last year./Similarly the industrial units in Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad were directed to convert to dry scrubber technology and the field formations were asked to inspect all the industrial units in these three cities. He said those who didn't comply would be closed down until the smog season ends. To stop stubble burning in the provincial capital, the government has already imposed Section 144 through Agriculture department and respective district government and EPD's field formations were also directed to register cases against violators, he maintained./He said that smog would cause severe health problems besides causing road accidents due to poor visibility. Highly populated cities and agricultural areas of Punjab usually witnessed smog during winter when air pollution from vehicular emission, solid waste burning and stubble burning reacted with calm air to form smog./Meanwhile, EPD provincial secretary held a meeting with traffic police authorities and transport department to control traffic congestion and vehicular pollution during the smog season. In the meeting, EPD secretary requested the local government department to improve solid waste management practices and impose a complete ban on burning of solid waste across the province./Naseem said the EPD was requesting the people to minimise use of vehicles during the smog season. He concluded that these measures would help in combating the smog situation."
Smog emerges as major air pollutant in Lahore," Smog emerged as a major air pollutant in the provincial metropolis on Wednesday resulting in serious health hazards especially diseases relating to eyes, lungs and skin./According to the experts, smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NO) and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles, called particulate matter, and ground-level ozone. This ground level layer of ozone is formed from other pollutants and can react with other substances, in both cases under the action of light./Environmentalists term ozone (O3) the most important photochemical oxidant. They say it is a secondary pollutant formed when precursor pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO) and volatile organic compounds react under the action of light. They say that ozone is also transported long distances in the atmosphere and is, therefore, considered a trans-boundary problem./Smog is a problem in a number of cities and continues to harm human health. Ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. It can inflame breathing passages, decreasing the lungs' working capacity, and causing shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing./On the other hand, Met officials said that very severe cyclonic storm KYARR is active in the Arabian Sea. Under the influence of this storm, moist currents are penetrating coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan. A westerly wave is present in upper parts of the country and is likely to affect north-western parts in next 24-36 hours./They predicted that mainly dry weather is expected in most parts of the country, while cold in northern areas. However, cloudy weather condition with rain and dust storm is expected in districts of Sindh and Balochistan./Cloudy weather conditions with rain (snowfall over high mountains) are also expected at isolated places in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan. On Wednesday, rain was recorded in Mithi, Tharparkar, Mirkhani, Dir and Drosh. Lowest temperature was recorded at Skardu where the mercury dropped to 0°C while in Lahore it maximum temperature was 31°C and minimum 17.7°C./Meanwhile, Environment Protection Authority DG held a press conference here and said the department had imposed a complete ban on smoke emitting industrial units, brick kilns and other such units. He said the smoke due to burning of remains of crop at the Indian side is contributing heavily in building up smog./Naseemur Rehman, a senior EPD official, said that during the month of October, the department inspected 3,277 air polluting units, 1,696 notices were issued to various air polluting industries, 288 brick kilns and air polluting industries were sealed and 129 FIRs were registered."
Smog follows dengue to haunt Lahorites," Smog emerged as a major air pollutant in the provincial metropolis on Wednesday already facing dengue crisis. The smog is posing serious health hazards especially diseases relating to eyes, lungs and skin to Lahorites./According to the experts, smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NO) and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles, called particulate matter, and ground-level ozone.

Smog enters hazardous category,"  The level of smog, presently engulfing the provincial metropolis, has entered into the category of 'hazardous' with 391 Air Quality Index (AQI) points with increased level of PM2.5 posing serious health issues for the citizens but the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), Punjab has no intention to aware the general public about it./In our neighbourhood Delhi, the government is distributing face masks among the citizens especially school children to save them from smog whereas in Lahore, no such campaign was launched or even crafted. 'Such drives creates panic among the citizens and the present situation is not such bad where we need to distribute face masks among the citizens,' said Naseemur Rehman, senior officials and spokesperson for EPD./According to the figures of US Embassy in Lahore, real time AQI in Lahore on Friday noon was 391, which was in hazardous category. As per another site airvisual.com, the AQI in Lahore on Friday was 319 whereas as per EPD figure the AQI was 185./Environment experts said that 0-50 AQI is considered 'good' in which air quality is satisfactory and poses little or no health risk, 51-100 AQI is considered 'moderate' in which air quality is acceptable and poses little health risk. Sensitive individuals should avoid outdoor activity as they may experience respiratory symptoms./The AQI between 101 to 150 is termed 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups' in which the general public and sensitive individuals in particular are at risk to experience irritation and respiratory problems. Environmental experts said that the general public should greatly reduce outdoor exertion. Sensitive people should avoid outdoor activity and should take care to wear a pollution mask outdoors. Ventilation is discouraged. Air purifiers should be turned on if indoor air quality is unhealthy./The AQI between 151-200 is termed 'Unhealthy', which increased likelihood of adverse effects and aggravation to the heart and lungs among the general public - particularly for sensitive groups. Everyone should avoid outdoor exercise and take care to wear a pollution mask outdoors. Ventilation is discouraged. Air purifiers should be turned on./The AQI between 201-300 is termed 'Very Unhealthy,' which warned that the general public would be noticeably affected. Sensitive groups will experience reduced endurance in activities. These individuals should remain indoors and restrict activities. Everyone should avoid outdoor exercise and take care to wear a pollution mask outdoors./The experts said AQI between 301-500+ is called 'Hazardous,' which warned that the people and sensitive groups are at high risk to experience strong irritations and adverse health effects that could trigger other illnesses. Everyone should avoid exercise and remain indoors. Experts said everyone should avoid outdoor exercise and take care to wear a pollution mask outdoors. Ventilation is discouraged. Air purifiers should be turned on./It is pertinent to mention that the EPD has also failed to take any practical measures against the factors contributing towards the smog, which included around 30 percent vehicular pollution, 30 to 35 percent brick kilns and 35 percent industrial pollution. The department's senior hierarchy presented 'All is Well' report to the chief minister while sitting in air-conditioned offices holding press conferences, meetings and meaningless workshops. In actual, over 3,000 kilns are emitting hazardous smoke into the sky in the province. Out of these 3,000 kilns only 495 have installed zigzag technology but interestingly only four to five percent of these are operating the kilns with this technology. Ironically no practical training for kiln workers is available./Similarly, steel furnaces, steel re-rolling mills and other smoke-emitting industrial units operating in Lahore, Sheikhupura and Gujranwala are openly using rubber, plastic and other material for burning purposes, which is very harmful to human lives. And this is going on right under the nose of the EPD teams. This can be proved with the fact that in Gujranwala over 70 Steel Furnaces are working out of which only One has installed scrubbers; in Lahore, 20 mills out of 34 have installed scrubbers and in Sheikhupura, 23 mills out of 32 installed scrubbers to control air pollution./Vehicular traffic is the third major cause of smog but no practical measure has been taken to minimise pollution emitted by vehicles./In New Delhi, all construction has been halted for a week and fireworks banned but in Lahore, patchwork and road construction works are going on. LDA contractors are not sprinkling water on under-construction roads properly due to which the level of pm 2.5 is increasing every day./Dr Tariq Chishti, a general physician said that the levels of tiny particulate matter (known as PM2.5) that enter deep into the lungs are over 268 micrograms per cubic metre in the city. He said as per the WHO recommends that the PM2.5 levels should not be more than 25 micrograms per cubic metre on average in 24 hours./Naseemur Rehman, EPD Director while talking with The News said that presently wind direction is towards India; therefore, comparing Lahore with Delhi is not accurate and situation in Delhi was much grave than Lahore. He said the department has started pre-Smog activities in September by issuing notices to all smoke emitting vehicles and conducting extensive meetings with brick kiln and other government departments./He admitted that Gujranwala was a trouble area but the department has already started working to control smoke emitted by industrial units there. He said under the Punjab government's smog action plan, EPD was assigned to take measures against the smoke-emitting kilns and industrial units. Over a question that why the department has not started an extensive public awareness campaign so that the citizens could take appropriate measures to save themselves from negative effects of smog, he said the department had carried out many educational drives. Over a question of distributing face masks, he said this may create panic so the district governments were assigned to be prepared so the masks will be distributed at appropriate time."
Powerful states' lust for power diverts focus from health issues: president,"  President Dr Arif Alvi has lamented that powerful countries' lust for power through occupation of lands diverted the focus from real issues of health, human development and poverty reduction./'India has occupied Jammu  and  Kashmir through illegal annexation and pushed the region into conflict, that deviated the actual priorities for the worse,' he said while addressing the '1st PNDS International Conference on Non-Communicable Diseases' organised by Pakistan Nutrition and Dietetic Society in collaboration with The Nutrition Society, UK, at a local hotel Friday./He said Prime Minister Imran Khan also laid out a policy of normalising relations with India from day one, saying that Pakistan and India had more or less similar challenges to tackle issues of health and poverty for human development for progress and prosperity of the region. 'Any political tension, internal or external, changes the focus from real issues,' he added./During his recent visits for coronation ceremony in Japan and then Baku, the president observed that Pakistan's respect had increase in the comity of nations, especially in the last few years - thanks mainly to recent developments such as a befitting response to India's misadventure in Balakot, mediating role between warring countries, speaking at global forums to combat Islamophobia and xenophobia./While talking about Non-Communicable Diseases, president said Pakistan needed to shift focus from curative to preventive policy, which would not just improve public health but also relieve strain on the economy. 'We need to create role models to improve public health. Former US president Barrack Obama used to walk five kilometres daily that inspired American people to adopt such healthy habits,' he said, adding that Prime Minister Imran Khan's imagery of an athlete needed to be promoted to inspire people to adopt exercise as a way of life./'I, myself, prefer climbing stairs than using the elevator,' he said, adding that exercise was a way of life rather than an activity in the clubs. 'We must shun artificial image of exercise, where people must spare time for an additional activity. Exercise must be a part of our lives,' he said, adding that abandoning exercise, when it's not part of our lives but an additional activity, causes muscle wasting. Therefore, he said, it is all the more important to make exercise a part of routine activities. 'Pakistan Nutrition and Dietetic Society should add another word in its title to make it Pakistan Nutrition, Dietetic and Exercise Society,' he advised./He said women secured up to 70 to 80 percent of admissions in medical colleges every year, and after graduation, they engage themselves in rearing their children. 'As much as it is important to do good upbringing of next generation, it is equally as bigger a responsibility to return the favour to the nation by practicing medicine after acquiring graduation degrees to serve the ailing humanity,' he added./However, he said the system does not welcome those who want to join the medical profession after a long break. He assured of removing hurdles for helping such female doctors for rejoining the profession./Moreover, he also urged the PG trainees to serve one year of their specialisation in the periphery in order to serve the ailing humanity at the grassroots level./'The nutrition must be utilised as the first aid intervention to help prevent stunting and other diseases,' he said, however, he added that whenever there was any attempt to change people's habits or lifestyles, there comes resistance from within the society./'It is like if a government tries to root out corruption, it faces resistance from within the society,' he further added. He said anything whose import was banned in Pakistan was easily available everywhere, adding for instance, the import of betel nuts was banned in country but it was easily available in markets. Same is the case with drugs and alcohol./'The developed countries have imposed 'sin tax' on tobacco and sugary drinks to discourage their use and prevent diseases, but any such initiative in Pakistan becomes controversial,' he regretted./Therefore, he said, it is of paramount importance to focus on awareness to achieve the desired results. He said non-communicable diseases caused mortality earlier in Pakistan than some of the developed countries, adding that Pakistan must also move towards achieving the longevity in life attained by advanced nations by bringing health and happiness in lives of the people. Although it is yet too far to run electric vehicles, the president emphasised to shift towards non-polluting vehicles for combating air pollution in the country. He advised Pakistan Nutrition and Dietetic Society and all such organisations to visit schools and review children's syllabus with a view to incorporating subjects or topics for healthy living. 'We must move towards the goal of healthy and happy Pakistan,' he added./The Nutrition Society, UK, president Prof Julie Lovegrove said the global life expectancy had doubled in the last 150 years, adding that non-communicable diseases had increased as compared to infectious diseases, which had actually reduced. Globally, she said, the physical activity has reduced and availability of junk food has increased resulting in malnutrition and obesity. 'There are approximately two billion obese people in the world,' she added./She said The Nutrition Society, UK, had embarked on creating centres of excellence in low and middle income countries in order to improve people's health by combating malnutrition. 'That's why we are here and taking action in Pakistan,' she added. Dr Romaina Iqbal, a nutrition expert from Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi, highlighted 4x4 - four NCDs and four shared modifiable risk factors. Besides, founder and honorary life president of PNDS Dr Salma Badruddin, president Ms Faiza Khan and Prof Ghazala Zaman also spoke on the occasion."
Air pollution forces New Delhi to close schools till November 5," Schools in the Indian capital will be shut until November 5, the city government said on Friday, as residents breathed the season's worst air for a third straight day./As farm fires from New Delhi's neighboring states sent swathes of smoke into the capital, the city's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered schools to be closed, the minister said in a tweet he posted in Hindi./Earlier on Friday, a government-appointed environment panel declared Delhi's air pollution a public health emergency, according to report that quoted a letter from the Environment Pollution Control Authority./'This is a public health emergency as air pollution is now hazardous and will have adverse health impacts on all particularly the children.' Government-monitored indices that track air pollution hit 500 in several parts of the capital, the maximum recorded by the government's Central Pollution Control Board. The index measures the levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that goes deep into the lungs. Levels above 400 indicate severe conditions that put people with healthy lungs as well as those with respiratory illnesses at risk. The government will also restrict the number of private vehicles in the city."
Lahore smog: City among worst places on air quality index," A thick blanket of toxic black smog engulfed the entire metropolitan of Lahore around 9PM Wednesday night, forcing many residents to either literally gasp for breath or complain about sore throats and watery eyes./More: Schools to remain closed on Thursday/Caused predominantly by car fumes, industrial emissions, smoke coming out of hundreds brick kilns around the city, burning of rubbish and crop residue in nearby fields, and dust flying from the building sites, the smog in Lahore has forced Punjab government to announce the closure of all schools tomorrow (Thursday) despite earlier paying a deaf ear to the extremely hazardous situation./Television reports had revealed that in Lahore's posh Zaman Park - the otherwise clean and green locality where Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan lives - an Air Quality Index (AQI) of around 640 was recorded late Wednesday evening, comfortably crossing the threshold for 'hazardous' level of air quality, which is 300. Despite having an AQI of Level 6, life in Lahore was on the move./And if a much cleaner Zaman Park crossed the 600 mark, one can imagine the level of air quality in dirty low-lying areas and congested localities with a lot of traffic rush all the day round./Smog, together with a gusty storm, had made driving any kind of vehicle virtually impossible. While it was a Herculean task for the drivers to look forward through the wind screens of their vehicles, their wipers lacked the capacity to clear smog./By the way, as the experience of the last two or three years tells many living in Lahore, car wipers can wipe off heavy rain water or a layer of mud or dust, but cannot clear smog./An AQI is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become in near future./Air pollution is expected to cause around seven million premature deaths globally this year and have a major economic impact, according to a report, but Environment protection agencies in Pakistan have visibly not done enough to counter this threat./Just a day ago, on November 5, 2019, an eminent British newspaper "" The Telegraph"" had written that the highest AQI reading anywhere in London was currently 65./The reputed media outlet had added: ""The recommended World Health Organization safe daily maximum is 25, and anything above 300 is considered ""hazardous.""/About New Delhi, it had viewed: ""Every winter, the megacity of 20 million people is blanketed by car fumes, industrial emissions and smoke from stubble burning at farms in neighbouring states.""/Interestingly, this media house had published the list of world's 20 most polluted cities with their current AQI status and Lahore was 19th on the list less than 24 hours ago, although according to rankings released by the World AQI, Lahore was ranked the second most polluted city on October 29./Indian capital New Delhi ranked first with an average concentration of fine particulate matter at 373 AQI, followed by Lahore at 188 AQI in cubic metre of air. Earlier, the Punjab provincial capital was briefly ranked first in the list of most polluted cities./Karachi, on the other hand, was ranked seventh with an average of 153 AQI./Air pollution is expected to cause over seven million premature deaths around the world this year and have a major impact on the global economy in the future./Lahore's air pollution is caused largely by vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke of burning garbage and crop residue and dust from construction sites./According to The Telegraph, these are the world's 20 most polluted cities as well as their current AQI: Peshawar (540), Rawalpindi (448), Kanpur, India (319), Hamad Town, Bahrain (318), Faridabad, India (316), Delhi, India (292), Karachi (290), Gaya, India (275), Patna, India (266), Varanasi, India (260), Ma'ameer, Bahrain (257), Lucknow, India (255), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (251), Ras Hayan, Bahrain (250), Nabih Saleh, Bahrain (244), Muzaffarpur, India (221), Islamabad (217), Narayangonj, Bangladesh (205), Lahore (198), and Ulaanbaatar (197)./The Telegraph had added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks air quality at more than 1,600 locations in nearly 100 countries - but all are urban areas. So while Pakistan, Egypt and Mongolia are among the most polluted countries according to the 2018 World Air Quality Report, this only refers to pollution in cities./""Air quality in the Karakoram mountain range or the Gobi Desert will, of course, be pristine. Bangladesh's urban areas are, on average, the world's most polluted, followed by Pakistan and India. Europe's most polluted cities are found in Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Kosovo.""/The 20 countries with the most polluted urban areas include: Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Mongolia, Kuwait, Nepal, UAE, Nigeria, Indonesia, China, Uganda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Kosovo, and Kazakhstan./The 20 countries with the least polluted urban areas include: Iceland, Finland, Australia, Estonia, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, Canada, USA, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, UK, Malta, Luxembourg, Russia, Switzerland, Netherlands, Japan, and Germany./The AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the more serious the health concern./Research shows that according to the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection, an AQI of 300 and beyond (Level 6) means the air quality of a particular locality is severely polluted. Healthy people will experience reduced endurance in activities and may also show noticeably strong symptoms. Other illnesses may be triggered in healthy people. Elders and the sick should remain indoors and avoid exercise. Healthy individuals should avoid outdoor activities./Children, seniors and the sick should stay indoors and avoid physical exertion. General population should avoid outdoor activities/Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standard./Computation of the AQI requires an air pollutant concentration over a specified averaging period, obtained from an air monitor. Taken together, concentration and time represent the dose of the air pollutant. Health effects corresponding to a given dose are established by epidemiological research/An AQI of 0-50 (Level 1) is deemed excellent as there are no health implications. Everyone can continue their outdoor activities normally./An AQI of 51-100 (Level 2) is considered good as some pollutants may slightly affect very few hypersensitive individuals. Only very few hypersensitive people should reduce outdoor activities./An AQI of 101-150 (Level 3) is considered slightly polluted and healthy people may experience light irritations. However, sensitive individuals will be slightly affected to a larger extent. Children, seniors and individuals with respiratory or heart diseases should reduce sustained and high-intensity outdoor exercises./An AQI of 151-200 (Level 4) is a case of moderate pollution. Sensitive individuals will experience more serious conditions. The hearts and respiratory systems of healthy people may be affected. In these circumstances, children, elderly and individuals with respiratory or heart diseases should avoid sustained and high-intensity outdoor exercises. General population should moderately reduce outdoor activities/An AQI of 201-300 (Level 5) is deemed to be a case of heavy pollution. Healthy people will commonly show symptoms. People with respiratory or heart diseases will be significantly affected and will experience reduced endurance in activities. Children, seniors and individuals with heart or lung diseases should stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities. General population should reduce outdoor activities./An AQI of 300 and beyond (Level 6) means the air quality of a particular locality is severely polluted. Healthy people will experience reduced endurance in activities and may also show noticeably strong symptoms. Other illnesses may be triggered in healthy people. Elders and the sick should remain indoors and avoid exercise. Healthy individuals should avoid outdoor activities./Children, seniors and the sick should stay indoors and avoid physical exertion. General population should avoid outdoor activities./It is imperative to note that in October 2019, relevant Pakistani departments had organisation noted that the AQI in Lahore had reached 484./And just a couple of days ago, while admitting that smog was a big issue, Adviser to Prime Minister on Climate Change, Malik Amin Aslam, had said Pakistan had taken measures to stop crops stubble burning, a major cause of the phenomenon, and other countries should also come forward to address it./The adviser had said the AQI of Lahore was much better than that of New Delhi."
"Smog control measures being taken, says Punjab finance minister","  Provincial Minister for Finance Makhdoom Hashim Jawan Bakht has said the present situation of air pollution in Lahore is not the result of smog but smoke as according to the latest NASA report the real centres of smoke are certain places in India where crops' residue is being burnt for disposal./Change in air direction is resulting in the inclusion of additional quantity of smoke in the air of Lahore and if this situation continued, there are strong chances of smog in fog season. In this regard, the Punjab government has started precautionary measures and the factories causing air pollution, brick kilns working on obsolete technology and smoke-emitting vehicles are being temporarily shut down. He expressed these views while chairing a review meeting of Environment Protection Department (EPD) here on Thursday. The minister informed that a monitoring committee comprising different stakeholders had been constituted to control the smog. The committee will ensure steps to control the menace of environmental pollution./The minister directed the EPD to prepare project cycles of ADP schemes and use the latest system for monitoring./EPD Minister Muhammad Rizwan and Industrial Minister Mian Aslam Iqbal also spoke on the occasion./campaign: Albayrak Waste Management carried out a smog and cleanliness awareness campaign in front of Dai Anga Tomb, GT Road on Thursday. Communications  and  Operations teams of Albayrak briefed the general public about increasing level of pollution in Lahore and the preventive measures required against the prevalent smog. The team also distributed face masks, saplings and cleanliness awareness brochures among the citizens. Citizens were also advised to avoid setting garbage on fire and plant maximum trees so that smoke could be reduced from the atmosphere."
"Smog, air pollution and oil"," Autumn has come and smog is in, more intensely in northern and central Punjab and especially in Lahore./Smog, although short-lived, and causing invisibility and immediate health issues, brings into focus the larger and permanent air pollution issue. The reasons are no secret anymore, although some are more in focus like brick kilns and stubble-burning, dusty construction industry and dirty fuel consumption by SMEs. The contribution of traffic congestion and pollution and fuel quality thereof is not in the limelight to the extent that it should be. It is the largest contributor to air pollution in all major cities of the country. We will focus on it in the following and posit some suggestions to improve the situation in this respect./In most countries, including Pakistan, road traffic is a major or even largest contributor to air pollution. Air pollution has dangerous health effects causing asthma, bronchitis, heart, lung and eyes issues and other diseases. Sulfur in oil is a major contributor in traffic pollution. NOx is created by combustion in automotive engines. Both contribute to particulate matter emissions. Unburnt fuel and CO production due to inadequate combustion is also a major cause. Older vehicles and motorcycles produce the latter kind of emissions more./Motorcycles, being small, are considered by people to be benign. However, motorcycles emit 10 times more emissions than cars due to engine inefficiencies and inadequacy and the lesser space for corrective equipment. Newer vehicles with catalytic converters and electronic combustion control fewer emissions. But we have older vehicles and motorcycles. Half of the country's total gasoline (petrol) is consumed by motorcycles and the population of motorcycles is increasing by leaps and bounds./In all vehicles -- motorcycles, cars and trucks and buses etc -- petrol and diesel are used. Both fuel quality and engine efficiencies (in the broader sense of the word) are in need of major improvements in Pakistan. Developed countries have done it and are continuously improving the technology, both in terms of fuel and engine quality./Fuel and engine standards, generally known as Euro-standards, have been introduced. Mainly, sulfur has been targeted among others. There used to be 5000 ppm (parts per million) sulfur in petrol and diesel earlier. Now, under Euro-VI standards, literally, there would be no sulfur. Euro V standards allow some sulfur at 10 ppm. Automotive engines are also required to burn this high standard fuel. New vehicles are already being produced to this standard./Where are we in this respect? We are stuck at Euro-2 and that has been introduced lately. Not only that, we are also stuck with metal additives like Manganese (Mn) for improving the Octane Number (to improve engine knocking characteristics). There are slightly more expensive, non-metallic options, which can be used./The other solution is an alternative oil refining process that may require major alteration in our old oil refineries. Oil refineries have been opposing the improvement in fuel standards. It requires investments to install the additional equipment to remove sulfur. Fortunately, sulfur removal does not require major alterations in existing oil Refineries but does require additional equipment for sulfur treatment or reduction. The government did provide incentives to oil refineries for modernization by introducing deemed duty (five percent tariff protection in product prices). The improvements have not occurred. There is controversy around it which should be sorted out by the government./The general argument given in such cases is that we are poor and underdeveloped and thus cannot afford the costs involved in pollution control activities or for that matter in adopting new technologies and products-a neat prescription for suffering and remaining under-developed. The opposite is true in many cases. New technology is cheaper and more efficient. In fact sticking to older technologies becomes more expensive due to market reasons./The availability of low quality, pollution producing fuels would become restricted by the day and such fuels may become more expensive or unavailable. It is already happening. Kuwait Petroleum which supplies 50 percent of Pakistan's diesel requirements has intimated that it would no longer be able to supply lower than Euro-V product, having 10 ppm sulfur. Instead of receiving the news with pleasure, if not glee, it has caused uneasiness in our oil industry. Consumers and all others are happy that without any investments, better quality oil would be available. But our oil industry? They have their limitations and constraints, some understandable and some not./What is India, stuck with identical or even more poverty and socio-economic degeneration, doing in this respect? India has already adopted EURO-IV (with 50 ppm sulfur) and is going to Euro-V or VI by 2020. Admittedly, there are two markets in India -- poor and well to do; urban and rural. The coverage and implementation of standards in India are reportedly 50 percent. Still, it is a 50 percent reduction in pollution, not a mean achievement./We may have to allow low quality high sulfur fuels for older vehicles and high quality low sulfur fuel for newer and new vehicles. This would also be a relief to the local oil refining industry. They would be able to continue to sell high sulfur fuel to the lower market segments including motorcycles, while imported fuel may be targeted at the higher end of the market. This sector may be unregulated as premium fuels are these days. Policymakers, however, may have a difficult job in weaving the aforementioned into the market structure of the oil industry. Lame arguments against the use of low sulfur fuels, that lubricity of the fuel is lost, can be met by requiring to add additives for improving lubrication. It is technically feasible./As for motorcycles, perhaps not much can be done, although conversion to CNG and EV are possible. CNG auto-rickshaws are already there. Two-stroke engines are the most polluting. Two-stroke engine motorcycles should be discouraged and ultimately banned. Electrical motorcycles are reportedly available in the local market. In-fact, EV is a counter-technology for all types of vehicles. EVs remove pollution from congested areas and shift it to the hinterland, which is at least a part solution. Renewable energy would solve the problems completely and possibly may create problems of their own./We would ask policymakers to go ahead towards adopting the low sulfur fuels standards by 2020. The maximum sulfur level that can be tolerated is 50 ppm (Euro-IV), while ideally it should be 10 ppm (EURO V or VI). All new vehicle imports and production should be on Euro-V. A vehicle fitness inspection system should be installed. Installation and good maintenance of catalytic converters should be encouraged (this is reportedly discouraged by our import tariffs). It is hoped that the new oil refineries that are being installed will be required to adopt EURO-V fuel processing./Pollution is a larger national problem affecting the health and well-being of the people. It has been around for quite a while but has started worsening due to the rising population and resultant congestion. It affects the poor more. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environment/Climate Change should have more effective consultations with the petroleum division for the development of a balanced and environment-friendly policy with respect to fuel standards./The writer is a former member of the Energy Planning Commission and author of 'Pakistan's Energy Issues: Success and Challenges'."
Air pollution in Lahore due to burning of crops' residues in India: NASA report,"  The present situation of air pollution in Lahore was a result of smoke being produced by the burning of crops' residues for disposal in India./Provincial Minister for Finance Makhdoom Hashim Jawan Bakht on Thursday, citing the NASA report, revealed that smoke  produced by burning of crops' residues in India deteriorated  air quality in  Lahore./The minister while presiding over a review meeting of Environmental Protection Department (EPD) here, said that a monitoring committee comprising of different stakeholders had been constituted to control the smog./This committee would ensure necessary steps so that the menace of environmental pollution could be controlled with concerted efforts and holistic reforms, he added./The minister said that change in air direction was resulting in the inclusion of additional quantity of smoke in the air of Lahore and if this situation remained constant then there were strong chances of smog in fog season./He said that in this regard, the Punjab government had started taking precautionary measures and factories causing air pollution, brick-kilns working on obsolete technology were being temporarily shutdown."
Environment safety," This refers to the news story, 'Smog emerges as major air pollutant in Lahore' (Oct 31, 2019). Since smog has become a recurring menace every year, it needs to be addressed on permanent basis. The main sufferers are the inhabitants of Lahore who become victim of various ailments. The Environment Protection Department (EPD) has performed an excellent job in Punjab by inspecting 3277 air pollutant units. As a result, 288 brick kilns and air polluting units were sealed and FIR registered against 129 persons. Stringent measures must be enforced from Oct-Jan every year. Many road accidents also occur as a result of smog./As far as crop-burning on the Indian side is concerned, we can ensure that solid waste containing polythene bags must be stopped at any cost as it emits toxic smoke which is injurious to human life. It is hoped that the EPD will discharge its duties in a most efficient manner in the future as well."
Smog city," Every November and December, thick fog descends upon Lahore, blocking out the winter sunshine, closing off the Motorway after dusk and preventing flights from landing at night. The problem has grown worse over the last five years due to the high levels of pollution and poor air quality in the city, created by increasing vehicular and industrial emissions. Even during the summer months, there is now a permanent haze hanging over the city that is only relieved when it rains and pollution is washed away for a short while. Air pollution is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed as Lahore is now considered among the most polluted cities in Asia. In the winter months, with delayed rainfall, the cold and continuously dry conditions concentrate all the pollutants in the lower levels of the atmosphere, causing the smog to spread all over Punjab. The foggy conditions also lower the daytime temperatures since there is little sunshine to warm up the day./According to Dr Qamar uz Zaman Chaudhry, national climate change expert and former DG of Pakistan's Meteorological Department, 'The main source of the pollutants in our lower atmosphere is Eastern Punjab where all the coal based industries are centered (across the border in India). Of course, we have added our share of the pollutants as well from factory and car emissions.' In places near irrigation canals, rice paddies and rivers where there is more moisture available, the fog gets even thicker. The smog only gets cleared when it rains, washing away the lower layers of the atmosphere where all the harmful gases and other pollutants are trapped near the ground."
"Dusty, toxic air - serious health threat to population"," Dusty and toxic air having high level of pollutants is posing serious health threats to population in the region after the sharp fall in mercury while various seasonal ailments, especially colds, flu, throat infection and other respiratory tract infections have already taken shape of epidemic./According to experts, dry cold and polluted air are main factors behind rise in incidences of RTIs as the winter season has set in yet there has not been any rain spell due to which the atmosphere is filled with toxic dust causing a number of ailments among residents./It is time for individuals to take extra care to avoid damages that the dust and chemicals in the air can cause. Experts say that after the setting in of winter, immediate rain and heavy wind is needed to cleanse the air quality./In the absence of rain, the air is engulfed by dusty clouds, toxic metals and vapours containing a number of harmful chemicals while vehicles also serve as big source of air pollution. Experts say that to minimise bad effects of toxic air, people must take precautionary measures./Many health experts say that the concerned government authorities have not been doing anything significant to control the increasing level of pollution in the air. At least, the concerned authorities and other stakeholders should launch awareness campaigns to educate public on how to avoid bad effects of polluted air./The infections including colds, sore throat, cough and flu that are hitting population badly in the region are highly contagious. These are passed by tiny droplets produced during sneezing, coughing of infected persons and touching things with hands and tissues that others touch./Health experts say that to minimise bad effects of dusty and toxic air, people particularly those staying outside for longer periods of time should wear quality air filter masks that can filter out the harmful particles. One should not stay out of home or office unnecessarily and should cut down late nights and vigorous exercise for a few days and should stop smoking and avoid second hand smoke./According to experts, having plenty of fluids, at least eight to 10 glasses of water a day and fruit juices preferably lemonade can minimize the harmful effects of toxic dust in the air as fluids help loosen mucus. Drink hot tea or water with lemon and honey. Chicken soup can also help loosen the mucus. Gargle with warm saline water a few times a day and use cough lozenges or cough syrup if needed to quite a dry cough./Experts also say that it may be beneficial for one to use a humidifier for keeping extra moisture in the room while well balanced diet including fish at least twice a week and seasonal fruits can help minimizing the bad effects of dry weather."
Six factories sealed in Gujranwala for causing air pollution," District administration Wednesday sealed six factories for causing air pollution. On the directions of the district administration, police arrested 26 people for polluting air./According to Additional Deputy Commissioner Revenue (ADCR) Dr Zeeshan, a team of district administration and police raided different industrial units and found six factories burning banned material and sealed the factories and arrested 26 people, including some owners of the factories, for polluting the atmosphere./Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sohail Ashraf said strict action would be taken against polluting industrial units, smoke emitting vehicles and brick kilns."
"As the world moves to curb air pollution, Pakistan follows suit","  With the climate crisis escalating in Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan had come up a few days ago with a much-anticipated and timely strategy to tackle environmental pollution and smog etc., not much different from what many developed and under-developed countries are doing, or have been doing for decades, to harness this ""silent killer"" that claims over seven million human lives prematurely across the planet each year./According to government's recent estimates, air pollution impacts 4.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), besides resulting in various health hazards like lung diseases, child stunting and cancer etc./The incumbent Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) regime thinks that environmental hazards in the country are due to an increase in the transport plying on the roads, viewing that motorcycles alone have increased by 250 per cent during the last five years./The government feels that other key reasons for air pollution in Pakistan was the phasing out of clean transport with the stoppage of CNG in 2014, and a 70 per cent decline in the number of trees over the past 10 years, especially in Lahore./Before we see and analyze what the world is doing to clean the air quality, here follows a list of the numerous anti-air pollution measures that Imran Khan's regime intends to undertake in this context in near future:/The Pakistani government plans import of environment-friendly oil with fewer chemicals, issuance of a stern three-year warning period for oil refineries to improve the quality of oil produced or be prepared for a shut-down, shifting of the auto industry's focus towards production of electric, hybrid or CNG-based vehicles, import of machinery to assist farmers in making use of the post-harvest rice crop, rather than burning it, making brick kilns use the pro-environment zigzag technology, removal of import duties on scrubbers top curb air pollution from steel factories and tree plantation over 60,000 kanals of land etc./What is the world doing to control the air pollutants:/Air pollution is a global issue, as University of Birmingham has estimated that over seven million people die each year from air pollution across the world, with 34,000 people in the United Kingdom dying early as a result./Researchers at the University of Birmingham are working to identify the different causes and effects of air pollution, and applying their learning to public policy globally to help develop clean air solutions in areas such as India, China, and East Africa, as well as in cities and regions across the United Kingdom./In its November 4, 2019, the 'BBC News,' an operational business division of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), has highlighted the steps various global cities are taking to counter this massive issue haunting the mankind right now./The British media house had stated: 'India's capital Delhi is blanketed under a hazardous shroud of air pollution. City authorities have imposed a car rationing scheme in a bid to bring levels down, but experts believe the real blame lies with crop burning by farmers in neighbouring states. Delhi is the latest city to try to come up with ways to tackle increasingly dangerous pollutants in the air.'/The afore-cited edition of the British public service broadcaster had also discussed what other renowned international cities were doing to in a bid to beat air pollution./It added: 'Thick smog used to frequently blanket the UK capital of London in the 19th and 20th centuries, when people burned coal to warm homes and heavy industry in the city centre pumped chemicals into the air. Referred to as 'pea-soupers,' the most famous of these events was the so-called 'Great Smog of London' in 1952. Cold weather in the preceding days meant people had burned more coal - often of low quality, which released more sulphur dioxide - while inner-city coal power stations added to the haze.'/The 'BBC News' had maintained: 'An anticyclone then settled over London, trapping cold air under a layer of warm air. The smog lowered visibility to a few feet and, over four days, is thought to have killed more than 10,000 people.'/The esteemed media house, which maintains 50 foreign news bureaus with more than 250 correspondents around the world, has revealed that in 1956, the United Kingdom had passed the Clean Air Act to regulate both industrial and domestic smoke, imposing 'smoke control areas' in towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burned and offering subsidies to households to convert to cleaner fuels./It further stated: 'The act was extended in 1968, and air quality substantially improved in London through the following decades. Air pollution still remains at hazardous levels in London. The city recently introduced an Untra Low Emission Zone, which charges drivers of more polluting vehicles. London City Hall said in October that toxic air pollution had dropped by a third in the six months since the measure came into place.'/The 'BBC News' had more to say about London's unsatisfactory air quality: 'But the UK capital still has some of the highest pollution levels in Europe. Particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide remain the greatest concern, and thousands are thought to die prematurely every year because of pollutants in the air.'/With reference to Beijing, the 'BBC News' opined that China's rapid industrialization had brought a huge rise in air pollution./It asserted: 'Coal-burning power stations and a boom in car ownership from the 1980s onwards filled Beijing's air with hazardous chemicals. A United Nations report this year shows that in the space of just four years, between 2013 and 2017, fine particles level in Beijing dropped by 35/<a href=""https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/27645/airPolCh_EN.pdf?sequence=1"">https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/27645/airPolCh_EN.pdf?sequence=1</a>/ and isAllowed=y per cent, while levels in surrounding regions dropped by 25 per cent. No other city of region on the planet has achieved such a feat,' the report says.'/The 'BBC News,' enjoying services of 3500 staffers, went on to say that since then, the Chinese government has imposed ultra-low emission standards, created an advanced air quality monitoring system, and built more public transport, although Beijing hasn't entirely fixed its problem and the city still struggles with pollutants./What has China done to fix the problem?/The United Nation data shows the importance of cutting vehicle emissions, government incentives for private businesses, data transparency, and diversifying the economy away from heavy industry to successfully cut pollution levels./About Mexico City, which was infamous during the 1970s and 1980s for its poor air, the 'BBC News,' which generates about 120 hours of radio and television output each day, as well as online news coverage, had noted: 'Just breathing was the equivalent of smoking dozens of cigarettes a day. Its tens of millions of inhabitants driving across the huge city in hundreds of thousands of cars pushed pollutant levels sky high. The city's position within a high-altitude valley means the poor air is often trapped by a ring of mountains. In 1992 the UN gave it the dubious honour of being 'the most polluted city on the planet.'/In 1989, Mexico City became the first in the world to impose curbs on car usage by slashing down the number of cars on city roads by 20 per cent from Monday to Friday, depending on their number plates. It immediately helped lower pollutants./The 'BBC News' had proclaimed: 'This was followed by a package of reforms dubbed ProAire, which expanded public transport and imposed stricter vehicle emissions standards, among other measures. All this helped improve Mexico City's air quality substantially in the years that followed. In May this year, the city officials declared an environmental emergency after PM2.5 particle levels rose to more than six times the World Health Organization daily mean recommended limit. Just as with other cities, Mexico City's experience show there is no easy solution to tackling air pollution.'/On October 16, 2019 report, Deutsche Welle or DW, the German state-owned public international broadcaster, had reported: 'Believed to cause seven million premature deaths every year, air pollution is increasingly recognized as a silent public health emergency. It's perhaps the most explicit illustration of how closely intertwined our health is to the state of our environment. Its particles have been found in human hearts and brains. It has been linked to asthma, Alzheimer's, dementia, cancer, and stroke as well as mental health issues and miscarriage. Despite its known damage, over 90 per cent of people around the world still breathe dirty air.'/Reporting a conference of various international Mayors, held in Copenhagen, the 'Deutsche Welle' had gone on to state that Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, had revealed that although his city was proud of reducing smog by 90 per cent, they still had the worst air quality in America./According to the German media house, one of the priorities of the mayor of Los Angeles was to move towards 100 per cent zero emissions vehicles./The 'Deutsche Welle' wrote: 'Mayor Garcetti shed light on the stories behind the statistics. He spoke of what it felt like for him as a child in Los Angeles. His home, at the intersection of two freeways, was situated on a street with a 'cancer cluster' due to emissions. Both his parents and sister are survivors of cancer; a total of eight times between them.'/The eminent Bonn-based German media outlet said Tokyo, Paris, London, Buenos Aires and Los Angeles have committed to set ambitious pollution reduction targets by 2025, besides establishing targets that would set them on a path to meeting WHO guidelines for particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulphur dioxide by 2030./According to the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, some 150 microsensors have been installed in schools across the city, while the future plans include the development of more precise measurement tools and working to replace diesel-run buses./In its report under review, the 66-year old 'Deutsche Welle' had held that India was one such country where a large number of the world's most polluted cities could be found./Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister of New Delhi, said his plans included the creation of city-scale 269 water bodies, greenscaping of 500 kilometers of roads and induction of 1,000 electric buses./Similarly, Sayeed Khokon, the mayor of Dhaka South, told 'DW' that rapid urbanization and development for cities were big challenges in tackling air pollution, and introduction of electric vehicles and increasing the pollution monitoring systems were integral parts of his plan./Last but not least, the May 17, 2016 edition of a widely-read British newspaper 'The Guardian' had carried a report reading: 'Paris bans cars in many historic central districts at weekends, imposes odd-even bans on vehicles, makes public transport free during major pollution events and encourages car- and bike-sharing programmes. A long section of the Right Bank of the river Seine is now car-free and a monthly ban on cars has come into force along the Champs-Elysées.'/About the Netherlands, the newspaper said the Dutch politicians wanted to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2025, allowing only electric or hydrogen vehicles./By the way, the proposed new law in Holland would allow anyone who already owns a petrol or diesel car to continue using it. Most Dutch cities encourage bicycle use though./The 'Guardian' had further divulged: 'Freiburg in Germany has 500km of bike routes, tramways, and a cheap and efficient public transport system. One suburb, Vauban, forbids people to park near their homes and makes car-owners pay pound 18,000 for a space on the edge of town. In return for living without a car, people are offered cheaper housing, free public transport, and plentiful bicycle spaces.'/About the Danish city of Copenhagen, the 198-year old British newspaper had contended: 'Copenhagen prioritizes bikes over cars and now has more cycles than people. The city calculates that one mile on a bike is worth US $0.42 to society, while one mile in a car is a $0.20 loss. Large parts of the Danish capital have been closed to vehicles for decades and the city plans to become carbon neutral by 2025.'/Meanwhile, the Norwegian capital of Oslo, according to this compact newspaper, plans to halve its climate emissions by 2020 and proposes a large no-car zone, the building of 40 miles of new bike lanes, steep congestion charges, a rush-hour fee for motorists, and the removal of many parking spaces./Meanwhile, the 'Guardian' had also unveiled the climate-improvement plans of cities like Helsinki, Zurich, the Brazilian city of Curitiba and the Indian metropolitan of Bangalore./Here follow the plans of these above-mentioned cities in the words of this London-based newspaper having a circulation of 130,496, as of September 2019:/'Helsinki: The Finnish capital plans to drastically reduce the number of cars on its streets by investing heavily in better public transport, imposing higher parking fees, encouraging bikes and walking and converting inner city ring roads into residential and walking areas. The idea is to make the city's public transport so good that no one will want a car by 2050.'/'Zurich: Zurich has capped the number of parking spaces in the city, only allows a certain number of cars into the city at any one time, and is building more car-free areas, plazas, tram lines and pedestrianised streets. The result has been a dramatic reduction in traffic jams, and less pollution.'/'Curitiba: The southern Brazilian city of 2 million people has one of the biggest and lowest cost bus systems in the world. Nearly 70 per cent of the city goes to work by public transport and the result is pollution-free air and traffic-free streets.'/'Bangalore: The Indian city is converting its 6,000 buses to compressed natural gas and discouraging the car. So far, says the city, it has reduced traffic pollution by about 20 per cent in a few years and one in four people who used to travel by car now use public transport.'"
KU's Dr Panjwani Centre claims success of clinical trials for Chinese traditional medicine," Pakistani and Chinese experts on Saturday announced successful completion of clinical trials of a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of chronic bronchitis, a respiratory tract disease, claiming that the herbal medicine, 'Yinhuang Qingfei', contains anti-microbial elements and it completely cured 212 patients suffering from the disease within three to seven days./'Today we announce the completion of successful clinical trials of Yinhuang Qingfei at the Centre for Bioequivalence Studies and Clinical Research (CBSCR) at Dr Panjwani Centre for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research. The herbal composition was used on 212 patients from October 2018 to October this year and it cured all the patients suffering from chronic bronchitis,' claimed Prof Dr Iqbal Chaudhry, the director of the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS) at the University of Karachi, as he addressed a news conference on Saturday along with Chinese diplomats and experts from the Hunan province of China./Prof Chaudhry declared the completion of successful clinical trials at the ICCBS as a historic moment and said it also paved the way for clinical trials of locally developed traditional Unani medicine of Pakistan and earning valuable revenue for the country./Prof Dr M Raza Shah, the in-charge of the clinical trial project, and Chinese officials, including Guo Chunshui, Jian Zhang and Feibao Chen, also addressed the news conference./Prof Chaudhry said the Chinese herbal medicine would be an alternative to antibiotics for chronic bronchitis patients and added that clinical confirmatory trials were conducted by the CBSCR, which is a component of Dr Panjwani Centre./Congratulating the Pakistani experts on achieving the milestone of successful clinical trials of the first traditional Chinese medicine in Pakistan, the ICCBS director said it was the first time in the history of Pakistan that a product would be introduced in the Pakistani market based on research and clinical trials carried out in the country./He said Yinhuang Qingfei was a herbal product prepared by the Hunan Anbang Pharmaceutical for the treatment of an acute attack of chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is a common disease related to chronic inflammation, which is caused by a variety of pathogenic factors, such as air pollution, smoking, and pathogen infection, he said./The expert added that although current treatments such as bronchodilators, antitussive drugs, steroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists can relieve some of the main symptoms of chronic bronchitis, the treatments based on these drugs still often causes a series of adverse reactions./Because of its satisfactory clinical efficacy, as the main component of complementary and alternative drug therapy, herbal preparation of natural medicine has drawn more attention from all over the world, which has also played an important role in the prevention and treatment of chronic bronchitis, he said./Prof Shah said the clinical trial was carried out by using randomised, double-blind, double-simulation positive control study to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of Yinhuang Qingfei capsules on Pakistani patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis./He told the media that a total of 212 patients of ages between 18 and 65 with an acute attack of chronic bronchitis were selected, diagnosed and evaluated according to the criteria of western medicine./The Chinese officials said the efficacy and safety of the medicine were evaluated by pharmacodynamics, toxicology, phase II and III clinical studies, adding that since it was approved to be listed in China in 2002, the Yinhuang Qingfei capsule had been widely used in clinical practice, and its curative effect was significant."
'Air pollution can lead to diabetes'," The speakers at a workshop pointed out that the association between air pollution and diabetes is stronger for traffic associated pollutants, gaseous, nitrogen dioxide, tobacco smoke and particulate matter and exposure to air pollutants is significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, says a press release./The workshop on Air Pollution was organised by Afro-Asian Forum./Speaking on the occasion, Botanist and Environmentalist Prof Uzma Khursheed pointed out that new research links outdoor air pollution - even at levels deemed safe - to an increased risk of diabetes globally. She pointed out that according to a study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans Affairs (VA) St. Louis Health Care System, the findings raise the possibility that reducing pollution may lead to a drop in diabetes cases in heavily polluted countries such as India and less polluted ones such as the United States./'Diabetes is one of the fastest growing diseases, affecting more than 420 million people worldwide. The main drivers of diabetes include eating an unhealthy diet, having a sedentary lifestyle, and obesity, but the new research indicates the extent to which outdoor air pollution plays a role,' she added. Speaking on the occasion, Afro-Asian Forum Chairman Mohammad Naeem Siddiqui said that some pollutants - once they have been breathed in - can enter the bloodstream and interact with tissues and organs. 'It's fairly well known that a bad diet, a lack of exercise, and genetics can all contribute to type 2 diabetes. But now we should beware that the air pollution emitted by cars and trucks can also contribute to type 2 diabetes,' he added."
UET ex-student invents country's first gasified stove," To fight smog and air pollution and provide a sustainable solution of green energy, a former student of University of Engineering and Technology has invented country's first energy-efficient gasified stove./The stove uses wood pellets as energy source, which are energy-efficient and environmental-friendly, said Sajid Mustafa, the inventor of the gasified stove. He said the technology of gasification was not new in the world but in Pakistan it was not being used. Talking about the technology, he said alternate energy was gaining popularity across the world and cutting-edge technologies were being introduced internationally. The present government is also emphasizing on promoting alternate energy and the stove is one of the best solutions the country can have. Gasification is a set of chemical reactions that uses limited oxygen to convert a carbon-containing feedstock into a synthetic gas, he explained, adding it sounded like combustion but in actual it's not./'In the combustion process abundance of oxygen is used to produce heat while gasification uses only a tiny amount of oxygen, which is combined with steam and cooked under intense pressure. This initiates a series of reactions that produces a gaseous mixture composed primarily of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which can be burned directly,' Sajid Mustafa explained./Historically, Scottish engineer William Murdoch developed the basic process of gasification in late 1790s by using coal as a feedstock and produced sufficient quantity of gas to light his home. Eventually, cities in Europe and America began using this process later termed as 'town gas' to light city streets and homes./Gas produced under this process is clean, economical and easy to use, Sajid said, adding solid biomass fuel is exclusively made for domestic and commercial cooking stove while the fuel or wood pellets are being used for industrial burners and can efficiently replace currently-used fuel such as wood/wood chips, kerosene, LPG and diesel./Explaining top benefits of gasified stoves, he said they burn in remarkable consistency and efficiency, the moisture content is very low, there is no fire hazard and they are replacement to conventional fossil fuels./Pakistan is an agrarian country, so abundant of raw material for pellets is available such as sunflower waste, rice field waste, wheat waste, corn waste, maize waste, municipal green waste and etc, he said, adding the wastes are turned in green pellets, which are extremely eco-friendly. 'The eco green pellets are carbon neutral solid bio-fuels - biomass pellets that are made up of agro residues, saw dust and other waste material which means they are using raw materials from the waste and converting them into biomass fuel to conserve energy./'Gasified stoves convert biomass in the form of wood pellet fuel to heat while giving off almost no wood smoke or ash, helping to protect the environment. This fuel is carbon neutral and helps in countering global warming. Wood pellets release the same amount of CO2 which was absorbed during the growth of the tree and produce 90% less carbon emissions than traditional heating methods,' he revealed./He said many other people were working in the field and it was the duty of the government to declare the industry as alternate energy and provide relief in taxes and other government fees to the manufacturers of gasified stoves and wooden pellets. He said he had already contacted the government about the invention but so far no one had taken the source of alternate energy seriously."
HomeToday's PaperOpinion," People born in the 1960s may be the last human beings who will get to live out their full actuarial life expectancies./'Climate change now represents a near- to mid-term existential threat' to humanity, warns a recent policy paper by an Australian think tank. Civilization, scientists say, could collapse by 2050. Some people may survive. Not many./Some dismiss such purveyors of apocalyptic prognoses as hysterics. To the contrary, they're Pollyannas. Every previous 'worst-case scenario' prediction for the climate has turned out to have understated the gravity of the situation./'Paleoclimatologists have shown that past warming episodes show that there are mechanisms which magnify its effects, not represented in current climate models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Paris Accords,' reports The Independent. It's probably too optimistic to assume that we'll make it to 2050./Gives new meaning to Generation X./Millennials and the children we call Generation Z face the horrifying prospect that they will get stuck with the tab for humanity's centuries-long rape of planet earth, the mass desecration of which radically accelerated after 1950. There is an intolerably high chance that today's young people will starve to death, die of thirst, be killed by a superstorm, succumb to a new disease, boil to death, asphyxiate from air pollution, be murdered in a riot, or shot or blown up in a war sparked by environmentally-related political instability long before they survive to old age./Long threatened, never taken seriously, not even now that it's staring us right in the face, human extinction is coming for the children and grandchildren we claim to love but won't lift a finger to save./Shelves sag under the weight of books that have been written arguing that we still have a chance to save ourselves. I wish I could believe that. Human population has tripled since the 1950s. More than a million species have gone extinct. Ninety percent of the fish in the ocean have vanished, replaced by one billion tons of plastic. Two-thirds of the trees have been cut down. The polar ice cap is gone; it's never coming back./We can't stop global warming. An increase of four degrees Celsius over the baseline set at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution means game over. We're well on our way there. It doesn't make sense to think that we can avoid extinction./What if we woke up and demanded action from our political leaders? Radical problems require radical solutions; only the most radical of solutions could resolve the most radical problem of ruining our planet's ability to sustain us: revolution."
Cardiovascular diseases get more deadly in winter," The rate of incidence of cardiovascular diseases gets the highest during the colder months in winter and the chronic patients suffering from any of the CVDs may become more vulnerable to serious and life threatening complications in extreme cold./Various studies have revealed that the number of deaths due to CVDs also get higher in winter months. The incidence of CVDs and its complications is associated with a number of risk factors including temperature, physical activity, air pollution, infections, and dietary habits however health experts say that the chronic patients may avoid the risk of life threatening complications by following precautionary measures, most needed in colder months./The CVDs including stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and rupture, and atrial fibrillation are considered as more deadly during the winter than in summer./A number of studies on seasonal variation in heart failure (HF) were carried out in France, Spain, Japan, Scotland, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Turkey, Nigeria, Canada, and USA that revealed that admissions of patients to hospitals increase during the winter season and show decline in summer season./Exposure to extreme cold increases peripheral vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels), which may lead to pulmonary oedema (a condition in which the lungs are filled with fluid, also known as lung congestion) as a consequence of left ventricular failure and may also cause abnormal clotting./Also both the systolic and diastolic mean blood pressures exhibit a seasonal peak during winter and trough in summer among adults, the elderly, and children. The extreme cold has significant effect on blood pressure among both the healthy people and patients suffering from hypertension./Many health experts in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have expressed to 'The News' that exposure to extreme cold increases the chances of vasoconstriction and affects the pumping power of the heart muscle in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. The extreme cold also affects the exercise capacity of heart patients that may cause serious complications./Experts say that in case a chronic patient needs to stay outdoor in extreme cold, in morning, evening or at night, he must cover his nose properly with a warm clothe to avoid inhalation of extreme cold air./In both sexes, the overall levels of physical activity are significantly higher in summer than in winter and physical inactivity is strongly positively associated with incidence of CVDs and its complications among chronic patients./Experts say that in colder months of the year, patients suffering from CVDs should follow a proper routine to get themselves physically active like a walk in daytime when the weather is little warmer./It is important that around the globe, greater number of sudden cardiac deaths is reported in winter than in summer while an increase in mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has also been recorded in the winter months. Experts say that patients suffering from CVDs should keep themselves warm through proper indoor heating and warm clothing and should avoid unaccustomed strenuous exercise in extreme cold weather. The patients must have a healthy diet in winter after getting advice from qualified physician."
Farmers find switching to betel leaf more profitable," A worker was chewing fresh betel leaf (paan) while sorting out fresh leaves at a farm in the coastal area of Keti Bunder in Thatta district./He calls it 'sulemani paan' without 'chuna katha', believes the leaves are a mouth refresher, good for controlling hunger, and maintain the digestive system. 'That is why many people chew paan after every meal to maintain health,' he said./The betel farm was filled with activity as workers were grading the product after picking from the garden. Betel leaves have three grades. Once grading is completed, the leaves are packed in five kilogram bags for supply to the market./Presently, betel leaves are considered a profitable product in the coastal area, especially in Keti Bunder and parts of Ghora Bari and Shah Bunder./Gulab Shah, a farmer and community activist in Keti Bunder said establishing a betel farm needed a bigger investment, but once that was achieved, farmers earned for the next 35 years, unless some disease damages the crop./Betel consumes less water, compared to other cash crops and gives higher product, he said, adding that in case of water shortage farmers arranged tankers to feed the small gardens. The crop needed fertile land, canal water and a pleasant weather for cultivation in the area, Shah said. 'A major chunk of marine land has already been degraded due to increasing sea intrusion.'/Many of the problems faced by farmers are connected to climate change, including persistent water shortage, weather ups and downs and crop losses in rains, high tides, and increasing warnings of cyclones./Farmers failed to maintain banana crops due to the acute water shortage in the area, and switched to betel. Betel is an evergreen, perennial climber. The commercial product is the leaf, mainly used for chewing with areca nut, slaked lime, tobacco and some other ingredients. It is considered the second major crop after banana in the coastal area due to productivity and income generation. Betel plants require humidity and pleasant weather to grow under sheds, which maintain the temperature. The sensitive vines neither survive in extreme heat nor biting cold, strong winds and heavy rains./Random interviews from farmers show that this is peak season for the product, with price range between Rs1,000 to Rs1,500 per kilogram in the local markets such as Lea Market Paan Mandi and Memon Goth in Karachi, Hyderabad and Thatta city. A large part of the population in Thatta chews betel leaves./A farmer said that out of the 30 members in his family, 22 chewed betel leaves, which gives an idea about the consumption pattern in Thatta. Some families have their own recipes to make slaked lime and catechu (chuna katha) for their consumption. He called 'paan shops and cabins' a lucrative business in the entire district. 'The common varieties available at shops include sada paan, meetha paan, pati (tobacco) paan, silver paan, fire paan, chocolate paan, and sulemani paan,' the farmer shared./Betel farming has two seasons. The first one starts from April, May, June and July, while the other starts in September, October and November. Farmers get seedlings from gardens and each acre requires 1,000-1500 plants, depending on size. Likewise, it has two harvest seasons one starts from April to August while the second from October to January./People believe that betel leaf chewing was beneficial for maintaining teeth. In some cases it provides relief in toothache. Some people apply leaf to cure injuries./Betel farmers said November and December 2019 were better in terms of prices, as they received higher rates of up to Rs3,000 to Rs3,500/kg. In January, the prices have dropped to Rs1,000 to Rs1,500/kg. Each acre can give around 1,000-1,500kg each year, depending on garden care./Gul Hassan Kalmati, a writer cum grower from Gadap town, Karachi said betel farming started declining in Dumloti area near Memon Goth during 1980s. Perhaps, 1985 was the last year in Dumloti when farmers adapted to alternative crops and sources of income due to acute water shortage, low soil fertility, and increasing air pollution./'Air pollution is one of the major reasons that betel farms disappeared from the suburbs of Karachi,' Kalmati said, adding that once Malir, Karachi was a major supplier of betel leaves in the country./Old farmers said some growers from Malir shifted to the coastal areas and started establishing betel gardens back in 1985. Kalmati himself had established a small betel vine garden near Sakro, Thatta district on a rented piece of land, but it did not survive the stormy winds in the area./Since then the agriculture lands, which used to be fed by Dumloti wells turned into barren land./In the past, some traders imported betel leaf from Thailand, but now they depend on locally produced product due to high import cost. Betel leaf is being farmed on more than 12,000 acres in Keti Bunder for supply to the whole country./There are three varieties - Sanchi, Ceylon and Pakistani. All three are valued and priced differently depending on freshness, flavour, and quality./Betel leaf use has been around for about 5,000 years not only as food, but also as a medicine. Some local people still use it for removing blood clots, while others eat it for shedding their weight. Many shops in different cities are famous for maintaining quality, and people present betel leaves as gifts to their relatives and friends. It is also part of wedding rituals. A combination of betel leaf and areca nuts symbolises a strong bond, fertility, and loyalty in a relationship. Betel leaf itself is harmless and rather healthy; however, regular consumption with areca nuts and tobacco can lead to oral cancer./Climate change has made life uncertain for many farmers. They are also aware of the vulnerabilities of betel vines to climate change, but are still sure of recovering their losses from this crop."
Biogas: the way forward," The biogas initiative was launched in Pakistan as early as the 1980s. In the meantime, almost nothing of significance has happened; a few thousand family sized biogas units have been installed, thanks to the RSPN and others' action or lack of it./By comparison, India has installed 4 million units and China six million household units. This translates to one biogas unit per every 10 households and one out of every 10 households in India./We need biogas, especially, in our rural areas. Pipeline gas provides gas only to 20 percent of the population, while 80 percent remain and will remain unserved. Our rural areas will remain without gas, despite great potential, if a reasonable initiative is not launched./Although biogas was initially conceived for households, nowadays it is a significant industrial solution. Today, large plants costing $20 million are being installed. Germany has 5000 of such units injecting gas into gas networks and producing electricity. In Norway, Sweden and Denmark, Bio-CNG has been fuelling buses for more than a decade now./To give the readers an idea of biogas potential, only Karachi has equivalent of two gas fields of 30 mmcfd each - one in the Landhi cattle colony and one in solid waste dump. Landhi has 400,000 cattle; the area pollutes both land and sea and spreads disease as well. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) has been a liability as well - 16,000 tons per day of MSW, containing 50 percent wet food waste. Converting it to biogas may be able to finance the MSW project costs, if not in full then significantly. A Landhi cattle colony biogas-to-electricity project has been talked about for about two decades now. The project has now been changed to fuelling green buses by converting biogas to bio-CNG. Will it happen this time?/There is also talk of generating electricity out of senselessly burning solid waste to produce electricity in Karachi. The threat and risk is air pollution caused by burning solid waste. Poor countries like Pakistan have more wet waste than dry waste culminating into a low heat content. An alternative solution could have been to produce biogas and inject it into the grid (after cleaning and upgrading) or/and fuel public transport buses and even private transport. Incineration is old fashioned and risky. Besides, MSW burnt electricity is expensive 10 USc per kWh as opposed to solar of 4 USc per unit./Interestingly, cow dung has traditionally been considered as the only traditional source of biogas. No more; today, biogas can be produced from all kinds of waste: crop waste, animal slaughter, poultry, food and vegetable waste and agro-industrial waste etc. Rice stubble is a menace which is burnt in the winter, on both sides of the border, practically shutting down Lahore, Haryana and Delhi. India has gone ahead with a project producing biogas out of rice stubble; the biogas produced will be injected into the nearby gas grid and supply gas to the adjoining areas. There is no move yet in this respect in Pakistan, although SMEs are having to close their businesses in the winter. That's an easy task if not a complete solution. Can SNGPL rise to the occasion?/Biogas is somewhat more expensive; it costs anywhere between locally produced natural gas and the more expensive LNG. Many CNG stations are being given gas on LNG rates. In India, bio-CNG is cheaper than normal CNG. Both dung and crop wastes are free, costing collection cost only./Biogas costs in the two countries may not cost very differently. A bio-CNG plant in India costs $1 million or so in CAPEX but practically very little fuel or operating cost. In India, bio-CNG rates are IRs35 vs IRs42 per kg for conventional CNG. They plan to install 5000 bio-CNG plants in the near future. They have already started doing that and many such CNG pumps are already in operation./Pakistan has a large sugar industry producing expensive sugar. Being water intensive, whether it should have been there at all is a controversial question. There are some 94 sugar plants, spread throughout Pakistan in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The sugar industry is a great pollutant, producing raw and dirty effluent and press mud-a solid waste. Despite EPA laws to the contrary, they divert their effluents into the water channel or divert it to agricultural land, purportedly providing fertilizer like material to the lands./Only if environmental laws are applied, and effluents from sugar plants can be passed in digesters (anaerobic), a lot of biogas can be produced. In fact, effluent and press-mud mixed have very high biogas generation potential - three times higher than gobar. Untreated biogas can be supplied to the adjoining areas at reasonable costs or/and bio-CNG plants can be installed at or nearby sugar plants. One sugar plant can feed at least 10 CNG pumps. Ninety-four sugar plants can provide biogas to 10 nearby NG pumps. Make money and solve the problem as well?/Put together, there is a potential of 1100 mmcfd of biogas, compared to the 4000 mmcfd of local fossil gas production. And this is renewable; as long as there is life and bio-activity on earth, this level of biogas and even more would be there. Fossil gas will go away; already our gas resources are dwindling and are projected to be exhausted in almost ten years, causing shortages in the meantime, as is the case already. It is not a fairytale; it is already happening in the region and has happened in Europe and the US./We have some 50 million cows and buffalos in Pakistan. There are 2 million households that have 4-5 cattle each. Practically, all of them should be able to install biogas plants; one million should be targeted for the next five years. There are more than 20,000 households which have 50 or more cattle. Community scale biogas plants can be installed without the need for biogas cleaning or upgrading. Local isolated gas distribution networks can be installed, using 2-3 inch plastic pipe. People and communities can do it themselves, if the legal framework and bank financing is available. A good-sized community biogas plant with network may not cost more than Rs5 million. It is peanuts compared to the cost of LPG Air Mix Plants./There is one problem, however, in biogas. It contains 65-70 percent methane only, well enough for firing hearths at home or industry. It remains a stranded resource, unless it is cleaned up, removing CO2 and sulfur; then it can be injected into the gas grid or used as CNG or for producing electricity. Significant investment is required to do this; 1 mmcfd plants may cost as much as $20 million. Biogas-based electricity is facing competition from the much cheaper solar, which is much more widely and conveniently used (however, only in the day). As a gas, it may cost anywhere between normal gas and LNG./What is the way forward; both gas companies. SNGPL and the SSGC may be tasked to install a few biogas-bio-CNG pilot plants. They may eventually find it so good that they may like to block the entry of others. Local communities and governments may be involved for smaller isolated gas grids. Bank and government credit and finance may be arranged by the federal and provincial governments./Biogas has the potential to initiate a cycle of economic activity without foreign investments. It will mobilize local investors and communities and create employment along with cleaning the environment. One does not see an equivalent competitor to this concept. Biogas should not be rejected or neglected among the list of national priorities./The writer is a former member of the Energy Planning Commission and author of 'Pakistan's Energy Issues: Success and Challenges'."
Turning angst into action," Our children are angry and frightened, and they are speaking out. Young people's voices are rising; they are loud and demanding to be heard, and it's working./Not only are they increasingly invited in, but they are being asked to sit at the table, to speak in the boardrooms of multinational corporations and in the halls of Congress, on the steps of the White House and in houses of worship around the world. This is something I haven't witnessed in my decades of working on the climate crisis./We know that this crisis can't wait. It's urgent, its real, and it's happening in large part because of us and on our watch. The emperor is wearing no clothes - we see this, and our children are watching and seeing it too. Our children are demanding answers and cutting through the 'noise' that distracts us in ways that only children can - with truth and without guile./Our children see our hypocrisy and our hesitations, and they are calling foul on our actions of 'kicking the can down the road.' Our shining 'north star,' the Paris Climate Agreement, is a promise at best, something to strive for but with no significant funding, enforcement mechanisms or implementation tools in place./So how do we as parents, relatives, friends and mentors respond to these urgent cries? We must do so by telling the truth, showing our children through our actions and our own demands for change that we are serious, and that we stand with them in their efforts./Our job is not only listen to children, but to hear them, support them, work with them and include them wherever it makes sense, so that together we are doing everything in our power to slow down the climate emergency. That process of truth-telling and multi-generational collective action begins by acknowledging that this struggle is both personal and political./Many of us are overwhelmed by the politics of the day, by our jobs and the need to put food on the table, and by managing our day to day lives and the activities of our children. Adding climate action to these responsibilities begins to tip many people over the cliff. But we need to get comfortable with the very uncomfortable fact that we will be living with the climate emergency for the rest of our lives./This requires us to work diligently so that we can turn the disease of climate change into a chronic illness that might eventually be cured, rather than a cancer that kills us. For this we need more than personal change; we need corporate, governmental and societal change. We need to recognize that slowing down the crisis doesn't rest on our shoulders alone, or the shoulders of our children./Emphasis on individual responsibility alone is naïve, yet to me, the call for personal action as the primary solution to the climate crisis seems to be embedded in our lives, with sinister intent. The weight of the world is being placed squarely but unfairly on our shoulders, often by the very companies and government officials that should be taking on these massive problems directly and urgently themselves./This isn't new. In 1953 for example, the Keep America Beautiful (KAB) campaign was launched in the United States to encourage people to promote an ethic of 'national cleanliness,' based largely on taking personal responsibility for waste. 'Reduce, Reuse and Recycle' became the mantra, and one that is still repeated widely and loudly today./Many of the KAB campaign's original corporate founders were from the beverage and packaged goods industries: Philip Morris, PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch and Coca Cola. Today the campaign continues, and its board of directors includes representatives from these same companies, as well as executives from Keurig, Dr. Pepper, McDonalds, Dow, Mars Wrigley, and the American Chemistry Council./Think about this for a moment./Beverage and packaging companies began to expand globally just as plastics entered the scene, causing costs to go down as manufacturers transitioned from recyclable and reusable glass and aluminum containers to cheap, single-use plastic ones. Marketing teams arrived at a creative and powerful way to keep costs low, which was to pass on the disposal and recycling of these items to the consumer. This put the onus on the consumer and made them think, not only that it's their responsibility but also their patriotic and ethical duty to keep the country clean and tidy./The cost of recovering, reusing, and recycling single-use plastic isn't ordinarily factored into their price. This is how single-use items are kept cheap and accessible. For more than 60 years, the ad campaigns that encouraged us to 'Keep America Beautiful' have been widely successful, but 'buyer beware.' You aren't just getting hydration from that plastic water bottle; that package in your hand is now your responsibility. Find a place to recycle it or throw it in the garbage and feel guilty - it's up to you./As it now turns out, facilities to recycle single-use plastics are few and becoming fewer. In 2018, many of our normal recycling venues - plants that had been moved not only out of sight but across the oceans to China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries - stopped taking recyclables from Europe and the USA. They put up signs saying 'closed for business,' and suggested that we clean up our own messes. In a similar way and with similar ad campaigns, we have been convinced by fossil fuel companies that it's okay if they produce goods and services that cause immense global pollution that affects our and our planet's health, and that the onus to clean up their waste resides with us./The use and burning of coal, oil and gas creates greenhouse gases and pollutes air and water; this is a fact. For a variety of reasons, however, the responsibility for addressing the damage these gases create, including the health impacts of hospital visits and the treatment of chronic diseases like asthma, certain forms of cancer and even changes to our DNA, are not apportioned - they are just accepted./CO2 and methane are two of the most damaging greenhouse gases to our atmosphere. Yet we have allowed the air to be treated as if it were a giant open sewer, with no collection fees attached. New studies have linked exposure to various types of pollution and stress, including air pollution and extreme weather, to in-vitro damage, so even the place where we consider our children safest, a mother's womb, is no longer safe./Excerpted from: 'How to Support Your Children in Turning Climate Angst Into Climate Action'."
"Pakistan second-most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, claims report"," Pakistan was on Tuesday ranked the second most polluted country in the world in terms of the population density of areas with high concentrations of dangerous airborne pollutants, according to a report on world air quality released by Swiss company IQ Air./The report, backed by United States-based non-profit Greenpeace, also contended that at least 90 per cent of the 200 cities grappling with high levels of air pollutants in 2019 were located in South Asia, with China and India topping the list, followed by Bangladesh and Pakistan./An overwhelming majority of cities with particularly high percentages of airborne pollutants in Pakistan were located in Punjab, the report claimed. Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Raiwind, Lahore, Muridke, and Sialkot featured of the index, with Peshawar also listed in most polluted cities./How was the index calculated?/According to the Swiss firm, the 2019 World Air Quality Index was calculated using data gathered from real-time monitoring of air-quality by thousands of initiatives run by governments, communities, non-profits, and citizens in hundreds of cities around the world./The index aggregated, validated and visualized real-time air-quality data of cities and assigned an average air quality score for every month to each city on the index. Based on these averages, an average score of each city for the year 2019 was calculated as well./The score, based on the air concentrations of fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 microns (PM 2.5) or less in diameter, was also categorized keeping in view the World Health Organization standards on air quality. So the scores of each city were ranked on a non-number scale too./This non-number scale ranked cities falling within WHO standards in terms of air quality to those having hazardous amounts of air pollutants. A PM 2.5 score of 0-12 was categorized as good, while a score of 250+ was listed as hazardous. A score of 55-100 was listed as unhealthy./What are fine particulate matters?/Particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter - roughly 1/30 the width of a human hair - is the most dangerous type of airborne pollution. Microscopic flecks are small enough to enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system, leading to asthma, lung cancer and heart disease./Most of the seven million premature deaths attributed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to air pollution are caused by PM 2.5 particles, which originate in sandstorms, agriculture, industry, wildfires and especially the burning of fossil fuels./""Air pollution is the world's leading environmental health threat,"" said IQ Air CEO Frank Hammes. ""Ninety percent of the global population is breathing unsafe air,"" he noted in a press release, as the report on the air quality was released by his firm./How does Pakistan measure air quality?/Many countries across the world have air quality monitoring stations in big cities. These stations gather real-time data and relay it to the concerned government departments. Pakistan has several fixed and mobile air quality monitoring stations./They are operated mostly by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), the national space agency. These include state-of-the art ambient air monitoring equipment for measuring concentrations of air particulates in big cities and small towns."
Expert talks about challenge to UN SDGs," A United Nations expert has underlined the urgent need to align all public and private sector policies with sustainable development agenda and climate change trends./Jamil Ahmad, UN expert on Climate Change  and  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Director, UN Environment Programme, New York office, delivered a keynote speech to students and faculty members at a symposium. Community Medicine Department, Northwest School of Medicine Peshawar had organized the symposium. The speaker pointed out that the future of the planet was under threat as biodiversity and forests were shrinking, emissions rising, alarming glacier melting, water resource (aquifers and rivers) depleting./He said all this was harming agriculture, food productivity and loss of livelihoods. The expert said health hazards due to air pollution, contaminated water and poor waste management have compounded critical problems. Citing the links between environmental degradation and health, Jamil Ahmad said '7 million people died prematurely worldwide every year due to both indoor air quality and outdoor (ambient) pollution. Many more were affected by serious respiratory diseases causing economic losses and financial implications for the marginalized people and communities./Reminding the audience that the 'unsustainable patterns of consumption and production and demands of a growing population (11 billion by the year 2100) have pushed the planetary resources to a tipping point. Pakistan, too, like other developing counties, faced serious consequences of global warming and climate change as it was the 7th most vulnerable nation to climate change impact. He said SDGs offered an internationally agreed roadmap and framework to achieve development and combat climate change. Policy changes at all levels for achieving the SDGs are, therefore, an urgent imperative, he added. The expert said up to 2 billion people still do not have basic sanitation (toilet) facilities, with at least 10% of the world's population now consuming food irrigated by wastewater./Poor sanitation is linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, polio and exacerbates stunting. Inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 432, 000 diarrheal deaths annually, and a major factor in several tropical diseases which also contributes to malnutrition. According to the latest United Nations estimates of the world's population, in 2019 youth numbered 1.8 billion persons between ages 15 and 24 years worldwide. 'You have a key role to play in the decision-making and in the implementation of the 5 'P' of the Agenda 2030 namely, People, Planet, Peace, Prosperity and Partnerships,' he said."
"Petroleum coke handling not being done in scientific manner at Karachi port, Sepa tells SHC"," The handling of petroleum coke is being carried out at the Karachi port in an unscientific manner disregard of the provision of the Sindh Environmental Protection Act 2104 as well as the rules for hazardous substance notified by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa), a Sepa report submitted before the Sindh High Court./Filing an inspection report before the SHC on a petition with regard to the operation of petroleum coke handling at Karachi port and its unsafe transportation to the city which is causing environmental hazard, the Sepa director general submitted that environmental concerns associated with the handling of pet coke were mainly related to transportation, the degradation of the air quality, particularly emanating from dust fall, water quality, soil contamination, damage to ecosystem, health issues and quality of life./He said there was no organised system to contain the dust emission nor any HSE system applied to safeguard the health of workers./The Sepa DG stated that the mishandling also lead to spillage of pet coke and dust emission. He said it was obvious that a large number of people in this particular location could be affected from respiratory, eye and respiratory diseases due to the air pollution containing coal./He said samples of petroleum coke and coal were sent to the environmental research centre of a private university and results showed that both coal and pet-coke have similar chemistry in term of metal contents, however, concentration of metallic contents was higher in pet-coke than South American and Indonesian coal./Sepa submitted that pet coke can be handled only under strict regulations at regulated spaces and the handling of pet-coke without strict measures would be dangerous to environment and human health. Sepa suggested that the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) must take precautionary measures as per best practices and ensure compliance of the provision of the Sindh Environmental Protection Act 2014 and rules and regulations made for the handling of hazardous cargo in general and pet coke in particular for the protection of environment and human health./Sepa also suggested that the KPT should plan for dedicated terminal of jetty for pet coke import with appropriate technology and pet coke storage in adequately designed storage facility./Filing comments on the petition, the KPT submitting that the imported cargo was always unloaded and transported in accordance with mandatory regulations./The counsel for the KPT, however, sought time to file objections on the Sepa report./The SHC's division bench, headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, while granting time, directed the KPT counsel to file the comments by April 2./Petitioner Dr Syed Raza Ali, a representative of a non-government organisation, had filed the petition against the operation of petroleum code handling at the Karachi port and its transportation in the city./The petitioner contended that despite the Supreme Court had banned coal handling at KPT, thousands of metric tonne petroleum coke was still being handled, kept at open coal yard and transported in the city./The petitioner's counsel, Salahuddin Ahmed, submitted that the KPT was allowing the import of petroleum coke at the Karachi port without complying the environmental laws as petroleum coke could cause harm to humans as well as environment because it was not only inflammable but also several direct and indirect hazard on the health of citizen. He submitted that petroleum coke particles cause serious and life threatening respiratory diseases as particles of petroleum coke enters human lungs through air and penetrate into lungs and very difficult to expel./He submitted that the petroleum coke handling and storage in US, India and other countries were either banned or regulated by strict preventive measures. The counsel submitted that petroleum coke could cause a number of health problems, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer, and most importantly children are highly susceptible and are affected by early onset of respiratory disease which can prove fatal in long term./He submitted that petroleum coke was being transported through heavy vehicles to other cities from the KPT and such vehicles passed through densely populated areas of Karachi, including Clifton, Boat Basin, DHA and Quaidabad, and other parts of the country./He said the SC had also banned the coal handling at the KPT but in essence it included petroleum coke because unloading of the petroleum coke and transportation from the KPT had same ramification as of coal. He said if import of the petroleum coke was to be allowed in future, it should only be allowed through the Port Qasim which at least had specialised facilities for import of the coal./He mentioned the environmental protection agency had failed to implement its laws with regard to safe handling of petroleum coke. The court was requested to declare that petroleum coke handling at multipurpose berths and storage at coal yard by the KPT was permanent threat to the life of citizens of Karachi, environment, port and marine life./He also sought declaration that petroleum coke handling, storage and transportation in open trucks is an environmental and health hazard. He requested the court to direct Sepa to take action against the KPT for import and transportation of petroleum coke in violation of Sepa laws."
Minister reviews progress on implementation of anti-smog steps," Provincial Environment Minister M Rizwan chaired a meeting of Cabinet Sub-committee on Smog for implementations of anti-smog measures at Civil Secretariat on Thursday./Punjab Minister for Industries Mian Aslam Iqbal and Chief Secretary Major(r) Azam Suleman Khan also attended the meeting./Environment Secretary Zahid Hussain presented the agenda of the third meeting and briefed the meeting about the follow-up of actions taken in pursuance of decisions taken in the second meeting regarding framework to ensure adherence to the timeline assigned for conversion of old technology brick kilns to zig-zag technology, installation of air-pollution control systems in industries, controlling vehicular pollution, checking air pollution from stone crushing and cement mixing plants and installation of dust control systems./He also briefed that final timeframe had been decided with brick kiln association as all brick kilns would be shifted to latest technology till December 2020 in different steps. He said different awareness drives were continuing by EPA./He said 30 stone crushers of Margalla Hills were being sealed on the directions of SC of Pakistan. The industries secretary briefed the meeting that a meeting was held with Pakistan Re-Rolling Mills Association to get an action plan with timeline to curb violation of environmental laws./The representatives from the transport sector said a letter for release of funds had been written to federal government for installation of two-way catalytic convertors in the existing vehicles./A representative of traffic police told that the Insepctor general of police issued instructions to all DPOs and CTOs for taking action against smoke-emitting vehicles. A representative of Agriculture Department told that 620 FIRs were registered against the violators the laws. A representative of Health Department told that the department had installed incinerators at the district level and directed the relevant hospital administration for proper disposal of hospital waste./A representative from LG and CDD told that water was being sprinkled on the both sides of roads on a daily basis. The environment minister said that awareness activities should be enhanced and much effort was still needed to control the situation by all relevant departments./He said a comprehensive strategy should be adopted by all relevant departments to eliminate fuel adulteration points in Lahore. He directed the environment secretary to make a proposal to constitute a committee to speed up cases of pending departmental inquiries./Provincial Minister for Industries Mian Aslam Iqbal said, 'For the fulfillment of dream of clean and green Pakistan, we all have to perform proactive role. We need to take on board all stakeholders./The chief secretary directed the environment secretary to forward a letter to speed up process of pending inquiries. He also directed the district administration to chalk out a quick action plan to eliminate adulteration plants."
"'Lockdown regime: It's time we reassessed urban sprawl, industrialisation to lessen air pollution"," The National Forum for Environment and Health (NFEH) has said that the lockdown regime enforced in Karachi has provided an opportunity to the relevant authorities to reassess the urban sprawl, the mass transportation and the industrial needs of the metropolis to curb harmful carbon emissions./In a press statement issued on Saturday, NFEH President Naeem Qureshi said Karachi was one of the major industrial and commercial hubs all over the world where lockdown orders had brought immediate drop in air pollution./The NFEH president said that with the public transportation completely halted, a minimal use of private vehicles, and a limited industrial activity, they had seen a decline in Karachi's air pollution./He said the relevant authorities responsible for mitigating the perennial environmental degradation should take stock of the present situation. He said the relevant authorities should not miss this opportunity as they should do a real-time monitoring of the drop in air pollution levels in the city with a massive decrease in the public transportation and the industrial activities due to the lockdown regime in place./Qureshi said the real-time monitoring of the air pollution data should lead to research studies by the scientists whose findings would help the relevant authorities in mitigating the environmental issue./'Once the lockdown orders are withdrawn, the benefits of the present situation for the city's environmental conditions should be retained to a certain extent,' said Qureshi, who is also the convener of the FPCCI's Central Standing Committee on Environment./'Such benefits for our environment could only be achieved when we sit together now to do a proper reassessment of our needs to do the industrial and transportation activities for the good of the society in a socially responsible and sustainable manner,' he said./Qureshi said the city needed proper infrastructures for the public transportation and the industrial requirements but these systems should have proper mechanisms to safeguard the environment./'The present situation once again teaches us the lesson we have long forgotten that environmental laws, rules, and regulations of the state should be enforced in a uniform and indiscriminate manner to mitigate the issue of environmental degradation,' he said./'While roads today carry fewer vehicles and minimal number of industries doing their operations in Karachi, we have to think now as how to massively improve our travelling and industrial practices to safeguard the environment that is constantly being damaged due to harmful emissions,' he said./'The Coronavirus epidemic has caused massive health emergency in our midst but this is like a blessing in disguise for us as we should not lose this opportunity,' said the NFEH president./NFEH Adviser Saquib Ejaz Hussain said the air pollution was one of the world's leading health risks. 'Recent releases from Nasa on the air quality over Wuhan before the onset of the coronavirus episode shows that the region was all covered with pollutants but it thinned out after China's attempt to deal with the situation. This leads to the inference that the aerosols in the polluted air were the carrier of the corona virus.'/According to Saquib, exposure to common air pollutants can alter host immunity to respiratory viral infections. 'Given the number of individuals that contract some kind of respiratory virus each year and considering that the most common form of illness in urban areas is respiratory allergies and infections which account for more hospital visits, potential interactions between exposure to air primary and secondary pollutants and respiratory virus infections have significant public health implications for people throughout Pakistan./More importantly, air pollution-induced enhanced susceptibility to respiratory viral infections could have even more serious implications for individuals with pre-existing pulmonary conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.'/He added: 'Sepa being a regulator is mandated to conduct studies and share results with public to improve the understanding of how exposure to air pollution enhances the risk for respiratory virus infections and who, if anyone, is most susceptible. An important challenge for the future will be to further our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating pollutant-induced effects on the susceptibility to viral infections and potential therapeutic strategies to overcome these effects."""
Closer to the edge," As the power of nature takes over us yet again, we're hoarding tissues that might wipe our mains clean but not our ignorance. While we drilled to boast our military power, we now struggle to merely choose which lives to save. The world urges for social exclusion, and yet we hold 'awareness' marches and mass congregations./While we fantasize and rely on techno salvation, we are reselling used masks. We wonder about the unprecedented growth of this virus, albeit we devour more animals. Some advice the activists of climate change to hire corona's publicist, and yet continue to stock up plastic. The homo sapiens (wise ones) as we like to call ourselves, clear up land in search of greener pastures, but end up being vulnerable to these viruses always in search of a new species of host. Are we really the most successful species on Earth? We might be, but definitely not the most humane one. We now know that Corona conquers white supremacy, and gains traction as it enters royalty or the wives of global leaders for that matter./All being said, the emerging scenario is paving an alternate reality. The global carbon emissions have gone down and people can finally breathe. Whether it's brushing teeth or listening to Fleetwood Mac, the overdependence on Chinese imports might decrease. With less access, people are probing their conscience and asking themselves if they really needed that extra pair of socks./JSTOR and Scribd are open access now. With all grand slam tournaments slashed, Roger Federer's all-time record stands corrected. The jobs and meetings that we were told couldn't be done remotely are virtually possible. More time at home means better communication, and potentially higher productivity as some acquire a new skill, while others render those unfinished tasks. Although people are stress eating, at-least we're eating at home that might lead to lower obesity overtime. With toilet paper's demand-supply distorted, the west is finally considering Muslim showers. The world cinema won't get to witness the release of yet another Fast and Furious. And the wild population growth might be subsiding for now, although the newfound time at homes might turn the tables./Interestingly, the high incidence of this virus might be offset by pollution reduction that may save more lives from the improving air quality, than are threatened by the virus itself. According to the WHO, the global toll of premature deaths due to air pollution stands at 7 million per year./The industrial and vehicular emissions, indoor pollution, and the smog hanging over our cities, results in a higher mortality rate from respiratory and cardiovascular infections, heart diseases, strokes, and lung cancer. With air comes water, and new guidelines of washing our hands for twenty seconds shouldn't mean twenty seconds of running water. We need to constantly remind each other that in the midst of one global crisis, we shouldn't worsen another. Limiting contagion requires behavioral change. It resides on system change, where a human choice has zero social costs and where norms such as illegal wildlife trade is banned indefinitely, as it was after all a bat that led to this fiasco."
Fighting for Earth," As Covid-19 began to take its terrible toll on world populations a few months before the 50th Earth Day was celebrated by the UN and other organisations around the world (yesterday on April 22), photographs began to appear over the media of skies that had turned clear blue, of wild animals that had reclaimed habitats on the outskirts of cities snatched away from them by unending human growth and of flowers appearing in urban fields where pollution had previously prevented them from emerging. These sights all present a sense of drama. But the WHO has also warned that Covid-19 will hit harder in cities which suffer unbridled air pollution because the respiratory systems of inhabitants are already endangered. The virus has taught us that pollution can indeed be cleared up. We now need to think of ways of doing so without exerting such a heavy toll on people and other species./ Sadly, there is no sign that the leaders of the world are ready to recognise this. President Donald Trump has already begun rolling back measures intended to protect the environment and combat climate change. These steps come mainly in an effort to revive industry which has ground to a standstill in many places. The virus has also taught us it is dangerous for humans to venture further and further into habitats that have traditionally belonged to other species. Scientists around the world are now convinced the virus originally arose from a bat. In past decades and centuries, people would not have been exposed to this mammal and the diseases it can carry./ Earth Day has come at a chaotic time for mankind. The ongoing pandemic has destroyed lives everywhere. But at the same time, it has brought a recognition of how important nature can be; of how trees can heal the damaged environment. There is a great deal that has gone wrong on our Earth. The Covid-19 pandemic may be a direct consequence of this. Two more species, the Chinese paddlefish and the cryptic treehunter were declared extinct last year. But on a brighter note, scientists have discovered three more species of electric eel which they never knew existed. People have also begun to realise the terrible consequences on our Earth of climate change, as illustrated dramatically by the bushfires across Australia early this year. There are other similar examples. Perhaps the Covid-19 pandemic will force world leaders and people working with them to adopt policies more friendly to nature, so that we may yet be able to save our battered Earth from further mayhem. There is a battle on at this point and we will need to see which side emerges the victor."
