"Coronavirus spread, lockdown revolutionized the world: Prof Zafar"," Measures taken to curb the spread of Coronavirus and ensuing lockdowns have revolutionized the world, leading to a significant reduction in air pollution and the spread of complex diseases among citizens. There has also been a decline in ozone depletion from air pollution and toxic gases./These views were expressed by Principal Post Graduate Medical Institute (PGMI) and Amir Uddin Medical College Prof. Dr. Sardar Muhammad Al-freed Zafar, while talking to media on Sunday. He also appealed to the citizens to change their lifestyle till the availability of coronavirus vaccine. 'We have to change our lifestyles and learn to live with this virus, he added./He said that Corona Virus is not only in Pakistan but the whole world is under its grip. He said that we can succeed in defeating the virus. He said that people should not take advantage of the Government's easing of lockdown, keep in mind Government's SOPs while shopping in the markets and do not take children with them./The Principal PGMI said that if the public did not follow the SOPs as per the directions of the government, the consequences could be dire and the hard work of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff fighting on the front lines could go down the drain. He further said that the only solution to restrain the spread of the virus was to maintain social distance and to follow the process of washing hands frequently.  Prof Al-Freed Zafar stated that citizens should also be aware of the environment around them and keep it clean and spray disinfectant to prevent diseases. He also urged the youth to give more importance to tree planting so that the country could be greener and the damage caused by climate change could be avoided."
Smog Fine," Throughout the course of the last few years, readings on the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Lahore have exceeded 600 crossing into extremely hazardous levels-owing to a multitude of reasons; one of which is increased road traffic. Finally, in recognition of lax laws and procedures to counter such a toxic atmosphere, the Lahore High Court (LHC) ordered a fine, ranging from Rs200 to Rs2000, on vehicles that emit excessive smoke into the environment with the hopes that the objective to minimise air pollution is achieved./Environmental experts, health professionals and activists have, time and time again, displayed their horror while observing the deteriorating quality of the atmosphere in the metropolis but have been unable to encourage prompt change. This inaction is particularly shocking given that there are a number of provincial and national laws that deal with depreciating air quality. Clearly, implementation should be the next objective of the government to ensure that any threat to the health of the masses, or their quality of life, is eliminated immediately./For this reason alone, LHC's initiative to fine smoke emitting cars is welcome because it targets one of the most significant polluters, especially considering that the average number of cars owned by each household in Lahore keeps increasing. Even the call to send such vehicles for impounding stands to set an important precedent for the masses, coaxing large-scale change to occur systematically. Another helpful aspect of the judgement passed by Justice Shahid Karim is the order for the submission for recommendations by the Environment Commission. This allows for the city to explore new avenues through which positive growth can be achieved, if such legislation fails to produce progressive results./The problem of long-standing, extremely noxious and disabling smog is one that has evolved into a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly hard to overcome as time passes. Limiting the number of cars we let onto the roads and regulating the types of cars driven within the city is one way to improve the AQI substantially."
Reduction of air pollution," The environment is being affected by COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, one of the most prominent issues was air pollution, as many regions were affected by the disease of air pollution coming from traffic and industries. According to the State of Global Air/19, air pollution was the 5th leading risk worldwide in 2017. Due to air pollution, 5 million people died globally. WHO reported that air pollution causes 4.2 million premature deaths annually. The majority of people died due to this disease, but now global warming has been changed due to the 6 months lockdown and because of the stopping of traffic and industries, air quality has been improved./Nonetheless, CO2 levels in the atmosphere reached their highest monthly average ever recorded in May - 417.1 parts per million. This is because the carbon dioxide humans have already emitted can remain in the atmosphere for a hundred years; some of it could last tens of thousands of years./India's capital is one of the most polluted cities in the world but its skies had turned blue and many peoples become able to see the Himalaya mountains. In Venice, Italy, canal water is so fresh that fish can be easily seen."
"Two-stroke rickshaw, chief pollution contributor in Peshawar"," Almost extinct in other parts of the country, the decades old two-stroke rickshaws were largely contributing to environmental polluting in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa metropolis, Peshawar, sadly without any check./These two-stroke noise creating rickshaws release much hazardous smoke which besides polluting the environment shed a very bad impact on human health. roximately there are over 70000 rickshaws in Peshawar with more than half having no registration. Among these rickshaws over 8000 are two-stroke. The excessive numbers of rickshaws are not only a major reason for traffic mess in Peshawar but above all a big challenge to environment protection and safety to human health./The health risks of air pollution created by these rickshaws are much more serious as poor air quality increases respiratory ailments like asthma and bronchitis that heightens the risk of life-threatening conditions./Azerbaijan liberates 13 more villages from occupation/Chaos on roads along with emission of hazardous gases by vehicles, especially by rickshaws, was growing and so was the threat to the people's health. No doubt these rickshaws are major pollution contributors, producing significant amounts of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and other pollution./According to a recent study conducted in several parts of the city, presence of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides in the air was much higher than the international standard set by the World Health Organization./The noise level in the city ranges from 90 to 100 decibels though its limit set by WHO is 85 decibels. Doctors blame rickshaws for noise pollution, which, according to them, was the major cause of high incidence of hearing impairment, hypertension and heart problems among locals. /Dr Hamza Khan of Khyber Teaching Hospital said the noise generated by three-wheelers had a negative bearing on human hearing and caused blood pressure, hypertension, palpitation, breathing difficulty, stomach problems, stress and sleep disorders. He said his 30 percent patients complained of hearing problems largely due to high noise levels of rickshaws./Trump official held talks in Syria to free US hostages/Interestingly, when asked by a two-stroke rickshaw driver why he was polluting the air, he harshly answered that he was not robbing the people but just earning livelihood for his children. However when calmed, he said in fact this rickshaw could not be run without mixing engine oil in its fuel and it has to burn the lubricants and release smoke./Most of the rickshaws drivers even have no proper legal documents of the vehicle and driving licenses. Moreover almost all two-stroke rickshaws were having no horn, proper headlights, indicators and above all proper brake mechanism which frequently caused major or minor road mishaps on city roads. /Though many of the rickshaw owners have acquired four stroke rickshaws that were comparatively environment friendly with less noise pollution but still there were scores of smoke emitting two-stroke rickshaws causing air and noise pollution in the city. /Police arrest Capt (retd) Safdar: Maryam Nawaz/Arshad Ali, a shopkeeper, said though the incumbent KP government had streamlined the affairs of cleanliness on the ground however the air was being badly polluted by the two-stroke rickshaws which needed solid steps to contain. This was a thought provoking situation for the authorities concerned, he added."
Smog to further intensify as PDMA takes steps to," The smog phenomenon is likely to further intensify in provincial capital in the next couple of days, taking the air pollution level above 400 on air quality index, which can also cause breathing difficulties./The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), however, claimed that effective multiple steps were being taken to tackle the smog situation./PDMA Director Nisar Sani told  here on Tuesday that a state-of-the-art monitoring cell had been set up, which was closely monitoring the situation and taking steps in coordination with the allied departments. The latest technology was being used to monitor anti-smog activities in the province./He said transport sector was a major factor behind smog, as it was contributing 42 per cent of the total pollution. To control transport related emissions, stringent steps were being taken by the PDMA, along with allied departments, he said adding that fine amounting to Rs 15 million had been imposed on smoke-emitting vehicles in the provincial capital besides issuing around 8,000 challans during the ongoing crackdown./Karabakh yet another failure: French daily/During the last 24 hours only, he said that 270 smoke-emitting vehicles were impounded whereas 338 industrial units were sealed besides arresting 18 violators. Rs 1.9 million fine was imposed over violations during the said period and 87 FIRs were got registered. Encroachments were causing congestion and slow traffic flow on roads, he said adding that operation was being conducted against encroachments. /Ride sharing concept was being promoted under which single person ride usage would be discourage because when every individual would come on road with a vehicle, it would ultimately increase traffic and more emissions. /He said electric vehicles were future of the country and a vital source to tackle environment related issues. The provincial government was working on it to replace old fuel reliant vehicles with environment friendly electric vehicles./In the first phase, he said locally manufactured electric rickshaws were being introduced which would help in decreasing air pollution in the city. He said the rickshaws would be cheap and economically low cost than traditional rickshaws as these would be saving fuel consumption./Court indicts Shehbaz, Hamza in money laundering case/Availability of spare-parts related to the rickshaws and its maintenance would be ensured. As major portion of passengers in the provincial capital used public transport, he said the government was planning to ply electric buses./He urged citizens to demonstrate like a responsible member of society and contribute for making the envi-ronment pollution-free./He said burning of crops residue was also a major source of smog; however, the PDMA was using the latest satellite images through SUPARCO to identify stubble burning spots and prompt action was being taken accordingly with the help of revenue and other departments. FIRs were being lodged on stubble burning by the relevant departments, he added./He said that massive residue burning exercise was witnessed at Indian side which was also adding smog intensity in Pakistan. /The PDMA official said that water sprinkle activities were also being carried out to minimise dust which was also a source of smog and water sprinkle activities were carried out in 11,259 localities in last three days./Biden brushes off Trump not recognizing his victory/Commenting on brick-kilns closure, he said that all kilns operating on old technology had been closed down until Dec 31 and kilns using the latest zig-zag technology were allowed to operate.  /December 31 was also a deadline for old technology brick kilns to convert to new technology, he said adding that the provincial government was also facilitating the brick-kiln owners of getting loans amounting to Rs 1.2 million to convert their kilns to the latest technology./He said that further rise in smog was expected in coming days; however, the PDMA was vigilant and taking effective measures to minimise its effect. He also urged people to take all precautionary measures to avert health implications of smog."
Light rain forecast from Saturday to Monday," The local meteorological department has forecast light to moderate rain with strong winds from Saturday to Monday in Faisalabad. There was also a possibility of reduction in the Air Quality Index in third major metropolis of the country, said Ahmed Ikram, the Assistant Director Environmental Testing Laboratory, Department of Environmental Protection Faisalabad. Talking to media on Wednesday, he said the air quality index should be between 50 and 120 under normal conditions but lack of rains and smog increased the Air Quality Index up to 300 which was very dangerous for human health. 'If it rains, it will reduce smog and seasonal diseases', he said. He said brick kilns were also being closed for reducing air pollution but kilns with zigzag technology would be allowed to run./He also asked farmers to avoid burning residues of crops while people should refrain from burning garbage as smoke was not only polluting environment but also causing smog./Six brick kilns sealed over violation/The district administration sealed six brick kilns over violation of environment protection laws./A spokesman for the local administration on Wednesday said assistant commissioners and officers of the environment department visited various areas and sealed six brick kilns due to old technology./He said owners of brick kiln were requested to install zigzag technology if they wanted to run their kilns but most of them did not pay heed./Govt providing incentives to livestock breeders/Advisor to CM Punjab for Livestock  and  Dairy Development Faisal Hayat Jaboana said that the Punjab government was providing incentives to calf breeders with aim to promote livestock sector and to enhance milk and meat production in the province./Addressing the prize distribution ceremony at tehsil Athara Hazari under 'Safe the Calf and Feedlot Fattening' scheme, he urged livestock farmers to become part of the 'Save the Calf' scheme and increase meat production and play their due role for the improvement of the economy. He asked the farmers to also get benefit from the facilities and incentives being provided by the livestock department. Earlier, he distributed cheques of Rs 1.4 million among 179 farmers. Director Livestock Dr Mahmood Akhtar, Additional Director Dr, Ghulam Abbas and other officers were present on the occasion./PMU set up to monitor water project phase-II/A Project Management Unit (PMU) has been set up under the management of the WASA to monitor the water project Phase-II worth Rs 14 billion./Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali inaugurated the PMU at Gulistan Water Works while Managing Director Wasa Jabbar Anwar Chaudhary, Vice Chairman Sh Shahid Javed, Additional Director General FDA Amir Aziz and others were also present/Speaking on this occasion, the Deputy Commissioner said that Water Project Phase-2 would provide 25 million gallons of clean drinking water to the masses through modern technology./He said that with completion of the project, 600,000 people in eastern part of the city would had access to safe drinking water./On this occasion, Vice Chairman Wasa Sheikh Shahid Javed said that the mega project would be completed with foreign investment while 19% funds will be provided by the Punjab government./Six clinics sealed/The district health authority sealed six clinics run by unauthorized medical practitioners./District Health Officer Dr Ataul Munim along with his team inspected clinics, medical stores and laboratories in different parts of the city and sealed Fatima Maternity Hospital in Dhudiwala, Bilawal Dental Clinic, Saleem Dental Lab, Aamir Clinic, Zahid Family Clinic in Mansoorabad and Al-Raheem Dental Clinic in Nishatabad./The team sent their cases to the Punjab Healthcare Commission, said a spokesman for the health department on Wednesday."
World Pneumonia Day," High temperature with heavy breathing and wheezing; nine-month old Tehreem is cuddled in her mother's arms. Nasreen, 22, had taken her to the health house in her neighbourhood and then to the lady doctor who sits in the clinic in the main G-6 Markaz, but no one could tell her what was wrong./Within a few days, her situation got worse as she started to struggle with her breathing, chest heaving up and down. That's when she had to be rushed to the Emergency at Pakistan Institute of Medical Science (PIMS). It was there that the doctor gave her an injection and got a chest X-ray. The report arrived some three hours later, the doctor confirmed that Baby Tehreem had suffered a pneumonia attack./With the plastic cannula inserted in her tiny little hand, Nasreen was able to take her baby girl home; the katchi abadi in Bari Imam in the outskirts of Islamabad. The doctor had prescribed an antibiotic injection course for the next seven days. Although the hospital did not charge for the vaccination, it was too far from home. Nasreen took her to a private clinic, paying Rs 100 per injection, twice a day to complete the 14 injections. Even before the antibiotic course was complete, baby Tehreem had recovered from pneumonia./However, every Pakistani child is not as fortunate as Tehreem. Known as the world's leading infectious killer under five, globally, pneumonia claims one child every 39 seconds./Experts feel the earlier a pneumonia suffering child is brought to a health facility, the more the chances of saving the little life. In our country children with severe pneumonia undergo a number of trial and errors, before they could actually reach the right health facility for the right treatment at the right time. It is therefore important to reach a child specialist whether at a private or a public hospital./There are many factors which make pneumonia an important cause of infant and child mortality. Malnutrition is the dominant risk factor for pneumonia and pneumonia associated mortality as babies with low birth weight and poor nutrition make our children more prone to pneumonia./Babies who live in overcrowded places, where indoor pollution levels are high and sanitation is poor, are particularly susceptible. Low rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life is another major concern which makes our children more vulnerable. Therefore, prevention is to be focused on more as compared to treatment./Pneumonia experts have recently warned that children in these settings may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to a confluence of risk factors including malnutrition, air pollution, low vaccination rates and poor access to healthcare./In 2012, with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Pakistan became the first South Asian country to introduce a vaccine for pneumonia, a cost-prohibitive vaccine costing a little over 133 US dollars (in 2012) for the entire course of three injections./However, the government, with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance provides it for free in its Expanded Programme on Immunisation for the entire cohort of 7.9 million children born in the country. And yet, it killed more than 58,000 children under-five in 2018-more than 7 child every hour./The biggest hurdle in Pakistan`s fight against pneumonia is the low routine immunisation (RI) coverage which stands at a dismal 66 percent, according to PDHS 2017/18./If administered, vaccines like pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) which targets the leading bacterial causes of childhood pneumonia have the potential to save thousands of lives, drastically reducing Pakistan's under five mortality rate. Yet children continue to die from this illness./Also known as the poor child's disease, pneumonia can push families into poverty. This is because poorer children are less likely to be protected against diseases but are also less likely to be able to access treatment for the diseases that they are not protected against./This traps them in a cycle of poverty and poor health-a cycle that becomes more difficult to escape with each case of vaccine preventable disease and its associated costs to the family./A deeper dive reveals that access substantially varies by geography and income status. In 2018, PCV-3 coverage among 1-year olds stood at 90 percent amongst the richest households while it was only 50 percent for the poorest households/Reaching these harder-to-reach communities, children living in the urban slums and security compromised areas, who have never been vaccinated is the only way we can actually reach our goals of ending preventable child deaths./This World Pneumonia Day in the age of Covid-19, is a sombre reminder of the urgent need to reduce health inequality and to ensure no child dies from pneumonia or any vaccine preventable disease."
Smog situation likely to be satisfactory," The smog situation is likely to remain satisfactory in the provincial capital during the next few days with air pollution level expected to be around 200 on average at air quality index./A recent spell of rain in the city had provided much needed relief to the citizens from hazardous pollution levels which had crossed 400 before the rain./Whereas, anti-smog drive was also continuing in the city and other areas of the province carried out by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and allied departments./A PDMA official on Saturday claimed that effective multiple steps were being taken to tackle smog situation. /He said that a modern monitoring cell set up at the PDMA was closely monitoring the situation and steps in coordination with allied departments. /The latest technology was being used to monitor anti-smog activities being carried out throughout the province. /He said transport sector was a major factor behind smog as it was contributing 42 per cent of the total. To control transport related emissions, stringent steps were being taken by the PDMA, he said, adding a fine of over Rs 30 million was imposed on smoke emitting vehicles till November 18 in the provincial capital during the ongoing drive besides registering 4,998 FIRs. /Kabul attacks part of US proxy war: Iran/During the last 24 hours, he said that 218 smoke emitting vehicles were impounded whereas, 43 industrial units were sealed besides arresting eight violators. /A fine about Rs1.2 million was imposed and 98 FIRs were got registered. /The encroachments were causing congestion and slow traffic flow on roads, he said adding that operation was being conducted against encroachments. /Ride sharing concept was being promoted under which single person ride usage would be discourage because when every individual would come on road with a vehicle, it would ultimately increase traffic and more emissions. /He said electric vehicles were future of the country and a vital source to tackle environment related issues.

"Safe methods for waste disposal can play role in controlling pollution, says Bakht"," Smog is a form of air pollution that is exacerbated by climate change. /Temporary restrictions on industry and transportation are not the solution and shifting of industries on environmental friendly technology and electric vehicles require time and resources, which are gradually being ensured. /On the other hand change in social behaviour is a matter of time for a quick and lasting solution to the problem. /Further, increasing the number of trees in industrial and residential areas, reducing the use of fuel: powered rides and using safe methods for waste disposal can play an important role in controlling pollution. These views were expressed by Punjab Finance Minister Makhdoom Hashim Javan Bakht addressing a seminar on the role of civil society in controlling pollution organized by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority on Monday./Shibli says no restriction on Nawaz, his sons and Dar to come to Pakistan/The Minister said that changing social attitudes to control pollution is not possible without the involvement of civil society, educational institutions and the media. /He said that the civil society representatives should be aware of the harmful health effects of pollution and discourage the causes of pollution. Students should be made part of tree planting campaigns. NGOs and organizations should promote pollution control activities at the local level. The Minister said that the research scholars should introduce ideas for a healthy and clean environment. /Other participants of the seminar included Punjab Relief Commissioner Babar Hayat Tarar Director Punjab Disaster Management Authority Raja Khurram Shehzad Umar, Chairman Urban Development Unit, representatives from civil society and media and faculty members from various universities. /Punjab Relief Commissioner Babar Hayat Tarar briefing the seminar participants about the causes of increase in air pollution and smog said that the main cause of pollution in cities is smoke from transport which is 43% of air pollution.  Sustainable pollution control measures are being taken at the government level. /PM Khan to chair NCC meeting today/The process of shifting brick kilns to Zigzag technology is also underway. /The Punjab Disaster Management Authority is ensuring operations on a daily basis. Local level committees have been hired to control fires in villages and monitor industrial units. /He agreed the civil society representatives to form committees at the community level in cities is being accepted. /Under the Environment Department, installation of modern machinery for measuring air quality and controlling pollution from different parts of the city is also being ensured./ Khurram Shehzad Omar rised the seminar participants that Punjab Disaster Management giving details of the authority's measures and smog control operations, he said that since October 20, fines of Rs 39,394,340 have been imposed for discouraging smog: causing activities, 2,148 industrial units and 8,579 vehicles have been impounded, while 1,402 kilns have been converted to Zigzag technology while the rest of the kilns are being converted to modern technology. /Canada's top diplomat says national security to dictate Huawei 5G involvement decision/The Chairman Urban Development Unit informed the seminar participants that for the last 20 years no systematic traffic plan has been formulated in the city nor communication plans and coordination of various authorities for the construction of cities has been made. /The present government is formulating a regular traffic plan with an ropriate plan for urban development. /The seminar participants reciated the government's measures to control smog and the PDMA's mechanism, stressed the need to increase the efficiency of the environment department and assured of playing a positive role in changing social attitudes."
Indian State-sponsored terrorism being discussed by the world: DG ISPR," Director General of Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Babar Iftikhar on Thursday said the dossier presented by Pakistan would be flagged at all global fora to highlight Indian State-sponsored terrorism on its territory./The dossier brought forward the proofs of India as a State sponsoring terrorism, vindicating what Pakistan had been stating for long, he said in an interview with Global Village Space (GVS) magazine./During the interview, the ISPR DG dilated upon diverse security and defence related issues linked with regional peace and stability, including the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Afghan Peace Process and the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK)./Major Gen Babar said the matter started with the revocation of Article 370 of Indian Constitution (in August, 2019) stripping the IIOJK of its special status to IIOJK.

However, Indians were uncomfortable and had very strange arguments about the project, he added./Major Gen Babar underscored that security issues around the CPEC project were increasing. 'Indians have decided that there are such timelines after which CPEC becomes irreversible so it should be retarded before that time limit. They don't want to let the project become successful.'/He said the Pakistan Army had raised two divisions for the project's security whereas eight to nine regular regiments were maintained for the protection of the routes of entire corridor./UN adopts Pakistan's resolution on inter-religious, cultural dialogue/Paramilitary forces were also the part of the security apparatus for the CPEC routes, he added./'We are taking every possible measure to secure CPEC where our Chinese counterparts have expressed their satisfaction on the security measures.'/He said the Indians were trying to tarnish Pakistan's international image to harm CPEC./The Indian sponsored terrorists were targeting the Chinese manpower and local labour working on the project, he said./'There are a lot of dimensions to the security of this project (CPEC).

'Our military engagements with China, Gulf region, US and Russia and it's all we have gone to explore new venues and taking Pakistan's international image to a new level.'/The outreach, whether it was for military training, strategic venues and others, was giving many dividends to Pakistan, he added./He also shed light on Pakistan's successful fight against COVID-19 and unprecedented civil-military collaboration to effectively cope with the pandemic. 'The Pakistan Army right from the day one has been part and parcel of every effort made by the government and people of Pakistan to deal with the contagion.'/The National Command and Operation Center (NCOC), he said, was manned by both the military and civil officials where the idea was to form a better strategy for amicably dealing with the disease./He said the Information Technology (IT) needs of the NCOC were fulfilled by the Pakistan Army. 'Be it information, IT and administration or enforcement, the Pakistan Army has been the thick and thin of everything involved.'/He said the first wave of COVID-19 provided a chance for capacity building of the deficient departments. 'We should (now) manage the second wave of the wave in a better way.'/The ISPR DG also lauded the role of media in educating and exhorting the masses to check the spread of coronavirus./Being the information arm of the NCOC, he said, ISPR had run many media campaigns worth billions of rupees free of cost to educate, encourage and advise the masses to ensure adherence to safety guidelines./'We have to help each other and remain more careful than before to fight this pandemic, he added."
Tourism In KP," Travel Responsibly for Experiencing Ecotourism (TREK) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has finally been launched by PM Imran Khan, in collaboration with the World Bank Group, KP Government and Nestle Pakistan. This new initiative to promote responsible and ecological tourism within the country is not only grounded in achievable reality but will also go a long way in preserving the sanctity of the region. If authorities, along with the local population, remain committed to the cause, the potential of expanding the project seems promising./TREK places a strong emphasis on preserving the northern environment through undertaking waste management schemes, like recycling plastic, across the province. Furthermore, it entails that the local population be educated and made aware about the importance of maintaining a healthy atmosphere not only for the sake of their livelihoods but also to protect the landscape. As such, waste collection and minimisation is expected to become an integral part of the tourism industry in Pakistan. Addressing this narrative in Pakistan is a major step forward for the government, both federal and provincial. For far too long, the tourism industry has remained neglected despite having made substantial contributions to the environment./One aspect that could, perhaps, be worked towards is reducing the level of air pollution caused primarily by high powered jeeps needed for transportation in the area. Leaving behind a trail of thick smoke, the increased use of these vehicles is bound to be detrimental to the population residing in the area, even if it is momentary. Fortunately, this problem is also one that can be countered fairly easily. Long-term infrastructure improvement along with strict fitness standards for vehicles are avenues worth exploring./As far as TREK is concerned, all relevant bodies have done well in bringing forward and solving an issue that was previously unacknowledged by the country. Now, all effort must go towards ensuring stern implementation."
Karachi ranked among the world's most polluted cities," The metropolis ranked atop in pollution in Pakistan while at 5th on a global Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday morning, placed among the world's most polluted cities./According to recent reading of the Air Quality Index, Karachi was ranked 5th with 209 particulate matter at noon. AQI as high as 151-200 is considered unhealthy, while an AQI between 201 to 300 is more harmful and an AQI over 300 is dubbed extremely hazardous./Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had earlier said in the morning that dusty winds blowing in the city from the northeast and particulate matter in the air is above the hygienic level at 190. Particulate matter in Lahore recorded 154, Peshawar 173, Indian capital New Delhi 175, Kolkata 174 and Dhaka 184. According to experts, the air is heavier in the winter as compared to summer, causing poisonous particles in the atmosphere to move downwards and making the atmosphere polluted. As a result, a layer of polluted particles, including large amounts of carbon and smoke, covers the city./The smoke produced by factories and by burning coal, garbage, oil or tyres enters the atmosphere and the effects of this appear at the onset of winter and remain till the season's end, experts said. Thus, air pollution reaches extremely dangerous levels, severely compromising the air quality./Although southwestern winds blowing from the sea may work as a filter for the air in the city, these winds remain mostly suspended during winter, experts said. They noted that winds blowing from the northeast increase the concentration of hidden polluted particles, and a healthy atmosphere in such a situation is subject to rainfall, which washes off all polluted particles."
Smog awareness session for traffic wardens held," WWF-Pakistan, in collaboration with Pakistan Engineering Congress (PEC), conducted smog awareness session with traffic wardens and the civil society on Tuesday. The event was organized to establish a consensus on the roles, responsibilities and actions required to ensure clean air for all, especially traffic wardens who are on the front lines regulating traffic and are directly exposed to polluted air. Waseem Dar, Senior Traffic Officer/SP City Division, City Traffic Police Lahore, stated that, 'Vehicular emissions are the top contributors to air pollution and the traffic police is at the forefront. To counter the problem, heavy fines are imposed on vehicles producing smoke beyond legal limits and those which do not have fitness certificates"

Karachi to remain among most polluted cities of world," The port city has been ranked among the world's most polluted cities as the level of hazardous particles in air reached to 324 on Sunday morning./According to recent reading of the Air Quality Index (AQI) hazardous particulate matter in Karachi was recorded at 188. AQI as high as 151-200 is considered unhealthy, while an AQI between 201 to 300 is more harmful and an AQI over 300 is dubbed extremely hazardous./Air pollution of particulate matter in Lahore was recorded 171, Peshawar 414, Islamabad 171, New Delhi 321, Kolkata 188 and Dhaka 288, as per the AQI reading./An expert said that in winter an increase in air pollution witnessed, change in the wind speed, wind direction and sliding minimum temperature increases air pollution, he said. The smoke from factories and vehicular traffic in cities are among some factors adding to the air pollution, he added./According to experts, the air becomes heavier in the winter as compared to summer, causing poisonous particles in the atmosphere to move downwards and making the atmosphere polluted. As a result, a layer of polluted particles, including large amounts of carbon and smoke, covers the city./The smoke produced by factories and burning coal, garbage, oil or tyres enters the atmosphere and the effects of this appear at the onset of winter and remain till the season's end, experts said./Thus, air pollution reaches to extremely dangerous levels, severely compromising the air quality./Although southwestern winds blowing from the sea may work as a filter for the air in Karachi, these winds remain mostly suspended during winter, experts said./They noted that winds blowing from the northeast increase the concentration of hidden polluted particles, and a healthy atmosphere in such a situation is subject to rainfall, which washes off all pollutants./The AQI is calculated based on five categories of pollution: ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide"
Pollution hub," Pollution is the biggest problem of Hub city, like water pollution, air pollution, pollution of sewer water, garbage pollution, and noise pollution. People are getting sick because of it. Hub city is home to factories and the factories emit a lot of smoke and gas./The city water supply system is also polluted and water is not drinkable. However, our city has no proper sewerage system. Installed sewerage lines are never cleaned, choked gutters and sewerage water are playing havoc with the city./It seems that concerned authorities are not aware of all these problems that our city is facing for so long. I request the government to pay attention to this issue and try to solve this."
Urban population growth and risks," In recent times, the urban population has witnessed tremendous growth. As per reports, around 56.2 percent of the world population was situated in urban areas in the year 2020. In the case of the developing world, this growth has overwhelmingly included rural migration to informal settlements in and around cities, more commonly known as 'slums'./A slum is a densely populated urban area with the following characteristics: poor-quality housing, substandard infrastructure, inadequate access to safe water, lack of proper sanitation, sewerage and basic facilities etc. A slum is more than just a place of concentrated poverty; it is an area of physical and social degradation./Apart from rural-urban migration, a slum is formed due to an overlapping of multiple factors which include economic recession, high unemployment, poor planning, politics, natural disasters, poverty and the informal economy./Given that all these factors are prevalent in Pakistan, around 40.1 percent of our urban population is living in slums. These settlements have existed for over several decades in our beloved country. They consist of improvised buildings and houses typically made of materials such as mud, brick and wood./Additionally, many of these shanties are built illegally by local land mafia. They rent out the homes to impoverished people and exploit them by taking advantage of their helplessness./Given such poor conditions, the living standards of these slum residents are quite horrific. In these areas, crime rates are high and multiple diseases are common. Lack of sanitation and toilet facilities leads to contamination of the groundwater, which relies on soil distinctiveness and distance between sources of water and toilets./Garbage management and the disposal and drainage systems are also poor. Exposed domestic wastes are quite common in these areas, which is hazardous to health./The health of women and children in slums is also unsatisfactory due to the lack of check-ups as well as the common occurrence of anaemia during pregnancy, leaving most of the children non-immunised. No wonder then that the infant mortality rate in Pakistan is high, with 67 children aged under 5 dying per 1000 live births./However, not only human beings are facing the adverse effects of such areas. Rather, the sustainability of the environment is also at stake./Environmental decay in a city is largely due to rapid urbanisation and a mismatch in the provision and maintenance of housing and infrastructure. In these areas, waste collection is poor, so the amount of contamination is high. This means that slums have a detrimental effect on natural ecosystems./Their presence can contribute to environmental destruction and loss of natural resources along with water contamination, air pollution, traffic hazards, and the amplification of heatwaves./These destitute living conditions, along with poor nutrition, inadequate health-seeking behaviour and horrible environmental conditions result in a high prevalence rate of infectious diseases. Diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition, measles, pneumonia, tuberculosis and stunted growth are heavily prevalent in these areas./Moreover, most of the residents can barely send their children to school (if at all), given their meagre income. As most of these slum dwellers are living below the poverty line alongside being uneducated and without a regular source of income, their socio-economic conditions only tend to become worse by the day rather than improving overtime./Shelter is a basic human right. Both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights assert 'the right of everyone to an acceptable standard of life for themselves and their families, including adequate food, clothes and accommodation, and the constant development of living conditions.' And Pakistan as a signatory of all of these commitments, should embrace these settlements as an integral part of the city and develop them properly. Only, then can we prosper as a nation, both socially and economically."
Worst quality air in Karachi," Karachi air quality has reduced over last year. It appears that pollution levels in Karachi are actually getting worse rather than improving. According to ranking in Pakistani, about 4.7% of population die due to lung disease while about 0.5% dies due to asthma. This is to inform concerned authorities to take the significant initiative to control air pollution. That would include the removal of ancient and abandoned vehicles off the road and move over cleaner fuel source."
"SN West unique automatic plant capable of burning 12,000kg waste per day Murtaza Wahab"," Spokesman for Sindh Government and Adviser to Chief Minister Sindh on Law, Environment and Coastal Development, Barrister Murtaza Wahab, while addressing the inaugural ceremony of SN West Incineration Plant Landhi Industrial Area on Thursday, said that SN West is unique automatic plant of its kind in the city capable of burning 12,000 kg of industrial and medical waste per day. He said that precautionary measures had been taken at the plant and special measures taken to protect it from environmental pollution in which black smoke was disinfected and converted into white smoke through modern scrubber towers installed in the plant. He said that a network of industries was being set up in the province, along with measures to reduce environmental pollution in factories, which would result in the proper disposal of hazardous waste. /The minister further said in his address that they had raided the KMC plant one and half year ago which was not functioning properly and now due to measures for a better future for the environment, private companies were also turning to this sector. The plant will burn industrial and medical waste in a conducive environment, he said and added that the Sindh government had constructed roads in Landhi Industrial Area and on the request of the industrialists, they had made the roads here very strong and magnificent in which money was invested from Sindh treasury. Wahab appealed to the industrialists to come to the private sector because SEPA was doing its best in this regard. Director General (DG) SEPA Naeem Mughal, Deputy Director Munir Abbasi and officials of Environment Department were also present on the occasion. Speaking to media persons after the ceremony, the Sindh government spokesman said that the Sindh government was planting trees across the province to reduce air pollution, especially on the coastal strip. He said that Sindh government had been given Rs80 billion less in terms of NFC Award which would affect their development projects. He said: 'The federal government has not given a single development plan to Sindh. PTI leaders do not fulfill any promises but our industrialists are our assets. Sindh CM has approved 11 new roads for site industrial area. The Sindh government will continue development work despite all conspiracies.' Replying to questions, he said that Shahriar Shar had also met Sindh CM and Faryal Talpur. Even when the PTI government came up with a plan against the islands, Shahriar Shar stood by the people of Sindh. It is our sincerity that people are coming with the PPP. In today's situation, PPP and PML: N stand together in principle. Wahab said: 'Governments around the world are vaccinating their people against coronavirus. Our federal government is not providing the corona vaccine to citizens./I pray to Allah Almighty to grant recovery to our PM but the PM has to show his feelings in words and deeds. Today, the common man has also  ealized that the PTI is an anti: people government that only makes claims but does not work.'"
Cleaner Kilns," The Punjab government's shifting of 7896 brick kilns to zigzag technology in just six months is a significant achievement. It is no secret that these kilns were one of the leading pollutants making our air toxic. According to research published by Stanford University, brick kilns across South Asia have a global warming impact equivalent to that of all passenger cars in the United States./The brick industry, along with iron and steel production, contributes 20 percent of total worldwide black carbon emissions. The air pollution from these kilns kills tens of thousands of people each year due to respiratory and cardiovascular disease./The Punjab government and Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam deserve appreciation for their efforts and hard work. The shift towards zigzag technology was sorely needed. The switch to this method is not only cleaner but also more viable economically. Hopefully, the relatively new phenomenon of smog that has become quite intense over the past few years will be positively affected to a degree through this measure./But the job is only half done. There are around 20,000 brick kilns in Pakistan. Many are located around urban areas and contribute significantly to air pollution. It is important to make the remaining kilns also shift to cleaner technologies. This way, the government will make an entire industry sustainable through its collaboration with the private sector./Nevertheless, these kilns are not the sole air pollutants. Emissions from industrial stacks, vehicles and power plants, burning fuel for domestic use also pollute the air. These are the areas where the government needs to intervene next. The main focus of the government must be on the introduction of electric transport, both public and private. Traditional power plants must give way to solar and other cleaner and renewable energy sources. Likewise, the environmental protection authorities must penalise industrial units that do not follow environmental protocols."
Plastic pollution," Everyone is aware of water pollution, air pollution and noise pollution. However, the world had run in a race where everyone ignored another major issue 'plastic pollution'. Plastic pollution is not just related to plastic only, but it is an accumulation of wastage since the world started. Even a small wrapper like a shopper, small bottles, buckets, and other wastes are put out easily by everyone on the road or in water. On other hand, plastic pollution affects wildlife habitats./To begin with, plastic pollution spreads a harsh impact on wildlife habitat. Day to day, the reproduction process of animals and plants is made difficult due to accumulation of wastage. It contains toxic chemicals if they transfer in animals' bodies then it slows down reproduction. Meanwhile, toxic chemicals vanish the purity to intake pure food thus basic requirements remain incomplete./In addition, microplastic increases the weight of accumulation. According to one research, 16 to 52 trillion microplastic bits were fluctuating in the oceans of the whole world, which increased the weight from 92000 tonnes to 237,000 tonnes, in 2014. Similarly, filling the clean spaces with wrappers causes to block that area which enhances the ratio of diseases with not just animals, but puts everyone's health and life are at risk./Furthermore, plastic pollution increases water pollution due to increasing weights of wastage in oceans, the drainage system. It slows down the speed of bad water movement. Nonetheless, water pollution raises air pollution because smell of accumulated waste does not drop out unless bad water is not removed./Finally, plastic accumulation is also one reason to generate a mixture of impurities where individual, as well as wildlife habitat, are suffering yet as things are interrelated like drinking bad water leads toward diarrhoea or constipation. Similarly, clean infrastructure is the combination of pure things. Otherwise ignoring little things in the past will create hurdles in future."
Fires In Margalla Hills," Alarm broke out in Islamabad as the city's scenic Margalla hills witnessed a fire on its military farmland./While Islamabad residents were worried to see smoke and flames in the hills, visible from the city's urban settlements, fires breaking out in the Margalla Hills National Park is not a unique occurrence. According to a 2018 report, over 300 incidents of forest fires have been reported at the park in the last 17 years damaging forests and adding to air pollution./Climate change and the dry terrain have been attributed as causes, the authorities have recently started looking into other factors which can be directly prevented. In this case, it seems likely that it was because of a burning cigarette on dried bushes. The response to fires has also been slow-the hilly terrain makes it difficult to extinguish the fire which is why officials from the environment wing are often called for assistance./The hills are an integral part of Islamabad; they contribute to the city's milder climate, as well as its scenic landscape. Damage to the hills and ecosystem can devastate Islamabad's environment, air quality and standard of life. The fire should propel the authorities to take stricter action to prevent irresponsible activities which risk environmental degradation, as well as prompt faster responses to a breakout./Two years ago, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) agreed to work together in controlling forest fires, through a proposed plan, where initially seven fire control points will be established in two phases at the Margalla Hills, both in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas./Last month, the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board banned activities like smoking, bonfires, carrying flammable items and littering at the park given the rising concerns of environmental pollution and loss of habitat. However, the continuation of fires shows that these efforts have not been enough-a comprehensive year-long plan needs to be drafted, with strict implementation."
"ITP discards over 16,000 pressure horns to mark World Environment Day"," Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) have discarded over 16,000 pressure horns removed from the vehicles as part of a special campaign against noise pollution./The ceremony also marked the World Environment Day 2021. The horns were destroyed at the ITP office in the presence of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad Qazi Jameel-ur-Rehman and Senior-Superintendent of Police (SSP) Traffic, Farrukh Rashid. Speaking on the occasion, the IGP said special squads had been constituted to conduct regular checking and imposing fines on vehicles involved in creating noise pollution or other environmental pollution in the city. Similarly, the ITP education wing was sensitizing motorists, transporters on noise pollution as it affects nerves and is injurious to human health, he added./Rehman lauded the efforts of ITP to end noise pollution in the capital city and said a joint patrolling unit would also be formed in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency to take action against smoke-emitting vehicles. He appealed to the residents to cooperate with the police force to eliminate noise as well as air pollution in the federal capital. At the onset, the IGP planted a sapling at the ITP office under the Prime Minister 'Clean and Green Pakistan' initiative, said a press release."
Plastic pollution," Pollution is defined as the unwanted change caused by unwanted substances and materials. There are different types of pollution which harm man. Similarly, there are different types of pollutants that help pollution to spread and come forward. Some of the pollutants are bio-degradable which naturally decompose with the passage of time. Contrarily, some of the pollutants are non-degradable which cannot decompose and take time to be decomposed. However, bio-degradable pollutants do not harm man as offensively as non-degradable; non-degradable pollutants live on the land for a long time and can harm man as these are neither decomposed nor finished./Moreover, plastic pollution is pollution spread by plastic which is a non-degradable pollutant. Plastic is polythene and a mixture of different lethal compounds. Today, one can find plastics anywhere he goes. Plastic is indeed cheap but never decomposing. It emits different rays which can pose serious threats to man. According to a survey, plastic can give birth to 52 types of cancer, this easily defines the lethality of plastic./The rays emitted by plastics can cause bone, throat and skin cancer. When we, particularly kids, eat parcel of pilaf so we take the plastic in our mouth and enjoy the pilaf. We do not know that when we eat pilaf along with taking the plastic in the mouth, it can affect us. Most of the illiterates think that they are entirely not eating the plastic; they are only eating pilaf in the plastic. But, it is totally wrong. Because when we take the plastic in our mouth so the plastic touches different parts of our mouth like tongue, teeth and jaws. The rays of plastic might remain in our mouth and might move to our belly and cause diseases./Not only this, but plastic pollution is also a problem for marine life. When fish and other living animals ingest the plastic, thrown in the sea by man, so they can die./Additionally, some people burn the plastics thinking that it will finish, it is not so. When we burn plastic so plastic changes its shape from solid to gaseous form and becomes more lethal. It changes into Sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and many other lethal gases which provoke different diseases. These gases also cause air pollution./Before some years the use of plastic was banned in Pakistan but government and people did not work on it. Now, it has spread again. The use of plastic should be minimized. Both the government and the public should work for the eradication of plastic and plastic pollution./The best way to minimize plastic is refusing and recycling as the developed countries do. Through this, the use of plastic can be easily controlled."
Risk of a third wave," I was born on November 15, 1924, and I am not sure if I will get to see my next birthday. Extreme weather, air pollution, and on top of that, the coronavirus pandemic is by far too much at my age. /Global warming seems to have caused abrupt weather patterns causing extreme heat, droughts, and flash floods. Coronavirus on the other hand has affected the world beyond imagination. Despite vaccines being developed, this deadly virus is proving to be resilient and constantly mutating, making it impossible to fully control it. Our leadership however seems too busy with more important matters such as leg-pulling and mudslinging. While they should be the role models for the general public in following the SOPs, they do just the opposite. They hold rallies and meetings where masks are not worn, and social distancing measures are not followed. While the number of COVID cases has gone down, it can strike back in a third wave if people are not careful. No disease can be eliminated if people do not work in complete unity. The carelessness of a few can lead to virus striking back causing loss of life and disruption of economic activity. With elections in AJK due, political parties are more interested in their share of the pie than any concern for people. I wish our politicians had any regard for people instead of their selfish gains. Election activity at this time can lead to the third wave of COVID-19 and our country can not afford it. For once the politicians need to realize the sanctity of life and be united in calling for the postponement of elections in AJK or we might once again be dealing with overcrowded hospitals and stalling economy in a few months."
Britain's minister pledges support to improve Pakistan's brick-kiln sector," The United Kingdom (UK) will help Pakistan convert smoke emitting brick-kilns to zig-zag technology for the improvement of air quality and reduction in smog./This was announced by UK's State Minister for South Asia and Common Wealth Lord Tariq Mahmood Ahmad on Tuesday during the launching ceremony of a UK funded project. British High Commissioner to Pakistan Christian Turner, Punjab Board of Revenue senior member Babar Hayat Tarrar and officials of brick-kiln association were also present at the event./Lord Tariq said that Pakistan was among the countries highly affected with climate change and other environmental issues, adding that traditional brick-kiln sector was the reason behind environmental degradation. 'To reduce emissions of brick-kilns in Pakistan, the UK will support Pakistan to convert its old traditional brick-kilns to the zig-zag technology which will help decrease air pollution by 15 percent at least,' he said./Ahmad said that the initiative would help train at least 10 brick-kiln owners and operators in efficient use of the new zig-zag technology. 'Besides, improving air quality and reducing smog, cleaner brick production processes will have a positive impact on crop productivity and better health outcomes.' According to a statement of British High Commissioner in Pakistan, over 11,000 brick-kilns are concentrated in Punjab's agricultural heartland. UK-supported, targeted training on Zig-Zag Technology for the brick industry will help embed cleaner brick production practices in Punjab, which could be scaled across the country. The UK will continue to support Pakistan on its climate journey through strong development partnership, and UK companies specialising in renewable energy and sustainable technologies./The UK and Pakistan are (continue to be) the best of international friends with the UK committed to supporting Pakistan tackle its climate challenge as part of its 'Road to COP26'. As COP26 hosts, we congratulate Pakistan on recent World Environment Day activities and for setting global leadership example including with the no new coal announcement and 10 billion tree initiative and would also like to see further ambitious climate commitments coming from Pakistan. The UK are proud to be providing support to Pakistan to help in their climate efforts, including to reduce emissions from brick-kilns, and to provide technical support on natural capital accounting."
Special campaign against overloaded vehicles launched across Punjab,"  According to the vision of Inspector General of Police Punjab Rao Sardar Ali Khan, under the leadership of DIG Traffic Punjab, Sohail Akhtar Sukhera, steps are underway to improve traffic management across the province.  A special campaign has been launched against dangerous vehicles causing accidents and deaths.  In this regard, 108 cases were registered against overloading vehicles, 165 vehicles were impounded and 114 drivers were arrested in different police stations. / DIG Traffic Sohail Sukhera has directed all the Chief Traffic Officers and Traffic Heads of the province to take strict actions against drivers of overloaded vehicles   posing a serious threat to citizens due to their irresponsibility. He also directed to send weekly progress reports to the Traffic Headquarters.  Directing the officers, he further expressed that transparent licensing process with fast track to facilitate citizens is one of his top priorities. Mr Sukhera strict emphasized upon implementation of rotation policy issued for appointments in licensing branch. According to the letter issued regarding the rotation policy, the staff of the Licensing Center will be changed every 6 months.  The deployment duration of Inspector Licencing, Licensing Clerk, Computer Operator, LP Clerk, Duty Officer, Ticketing Officer, Challan Clerk, Summary Clerk, Diary Clerk, Reader to DSP, MTO, OSI, Incharge Uniform Store shall be for six months whereas deployment period of CTO reader has been fixed at one year and all the staff must be replaced within stipulated period.  Sohail Akhtar Sukhera further told the officers that 5 special teams have been formed by the Traffic Headquarters to monitor the implementation of rotation policy and inspection of professional matters related to traffic. DIG traffic further directed to take strict actions in case of any violation SOPs regarding Rotation policy, overloading and anti smog campaign./He issued these orders while presiding over an important meeting of all traffic officers at Traffic Headquarters Punjab./In addition, in view of weather change and smog hazards, DIG Traffic Punjab has issued special advisory to field officers and staff, according to which   expedite operations against high-emission vehicles on highways have been expedited.  Traffic Headquarters Punjab has stressed on strict implementation of anti-smog SOPs and no delay in operations against high smoke vehicles./DIG traffic Punjab has also directed to pay special attention for public awareness campaign on anti-smog operations by making the citizens aware of their social responsibilities so that joint efforts could be made to reduce air pollution and public may be provided with condusive transportation facilities."
A threat to sustainable development," Air pollution in the atmosphere in modern day is like the monster Medusa, affecting almost all the aspects directly or indirectly related to human life, with its head having many venomous snakes, sometimes impacting human health by elevating risks of heart diseases, lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases, disturbing sensitive terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through acid rains, loss of fish biodiversity, damaging forests and soil fertility resulting in agricultural losses, eutrophication of waters and soils. Such direct impacts have been responsible for the climate to change slowly in the past and now pacing up rapidly, resulting in episodes of frequent and devastating floods and droughts, shifting weather patterns, highlighted by intense cold and heat waves, consequently impacting the socioeconomic thread of sustainable development by dragging the economies down with reduced crop yields and increased spread of diseases. If air pollution, quickly becoming an atmospheric monster, is not beheaded with intellectual, academic and scientific approaches, coming generations might not be breathing in fresh air./The air column encompassing Pakistan, is unfortunately ranked as one of the most polluted in the world. In our country, this menace of pollution has many dimensions. One of the main contributors include anthropogenic localised emissions from automobiles, industries, crops-residue burning, fossil-fuelled power plants, unmanaged solid waste and disposal sites, unplanned expansion in urban areas and transboundary air pollution. Transboundary air pollution (TAP) brings the subject of pollution in the limelight, from local to global scales, making the whole world a stakeholder for any atmospheric ill-happening in any part of the world. Pollutants through TAP may be transported, at hemispheric, intercontinental, or regional scales, over distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometres from their sources, subsequently hurting, affecting, and felt by some other countries. Events that are globally responsible for TAP include, industrial accidents (like the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion, 1986), forest fires (like the California forest fire, 2020), volcanic eruptions (like the eruption of Mount Tambora, 1815), dust storms (like the Trans-Atlantic dust storm, 2020), megacity emissions (like Delhi, Mexico City, etc.), and large scale crop-residue burning events (Like Punjab on the Pakistan and Indian sides, Myanmar, etc.)./Rising trends of air pollution in Pakistan are posing serious environmental threats and are caused both, by the local emissions and by transboundary transport of air pollutants. In the recent past, severe episodes of very high concentrations in air columns of various pollutants including, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, heavy metals, dust storms and smoke have been observed and documented, caused and transported by the transboundary air pollution. Such unusual environmental occurrences in various parts of the world including, the Middle East, Africa, Europe and India through TAP have created a huge burden on the air quality of Pakistan. For example, pollutants emitted during the volcanic eruptions from Jabal Al-Tair (Yemen), Dalaffilla (Ethiopia), Nabro (Eritrea) and Mt Etna (Italy) loaded the air quality of the western regions of Pakistan through TAP for several days during 2007-2011, and in these episodes, sulphur dioxide values over some of the regions were observed to be elevated to 1000 percent of the average values. Similarly, NO2, CO, and smoke from large scale crops-residue burning events in north-western India severely contribute to a transboundary phenomenon of wintertime smog episodes over northern Punjab in Pakistan, causing the shut down of schools, affecting the overall daily life and putting pressure on economic activity and the health system of Pakistan. Similarly, during March 2012, a dust storm originated from the Middle East and southwest Asia, hit most of the regions of Pakistan leading to a suspension of flight operations at airports due to poor visibility, and people were even hospitalised with elevated respiratory problems./Pakistan is a signatory of the Male´ Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and Its Likely Transboundary Effects for South Asia (1998). It is unfortunate that these aforementioned transboundary air pollution episodes were detected after years of their occurrence, due to a lack of real time and prior information systems for detection of such events./The issue of TAP must be dealt with a multi-pronged approach, including the quantification of the exported and imported pollution load, characterisation of hotspots, identification of sensitive and high deposition areas and impacts on different ecosystems. Also, there is a need for regular monitoring of cross-border air pollution to quantify the amount of pollutants and a mapping activity, identifying their pathways, so that responsibility could be fixed, and damage could be compensated with each other under the 'polluter pays' principle. Real-time monitoring and regulating the emissions of pollutants should be made one of the top priorities for environmental regulation agencies. The Remote Sensing, GIS and Climatic Research Lab (RSGCRL), (National Center of GIS and Space Applications), University of the Punjab, Lahore has started to conceptualise an early warning system, the first of its kind in the region for real-time monitoring of transboundary air pollution, in collaboration with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan for effective preparedness and early response to protect people, save local ecology and realise the dream of sustainable development for Pakistan./Dr Asim Daud Rana/The writer is Assistant Professor at Department of Space Science, and team lead of Remote Sensing, GIS and the Climatic Research Lab at the University of the Punjab, Lahore."
"Smoke coming out of vehicles causing smog, says CTO"," The city traffic police is working hard to eradicate smog and environmental pollution. The traffic police cracked down on 08,111 vehicles emitting smoke in two months, while the joint teams of the traffic police and the environment department cracked down on 431 vehicles. CTO Lahore Muntzir Mehdi said that more than Rs0.5 million fines were imposed during the joint operation. Along with the action, instructions for the awareness campaign were also issued. Muntzir Mehdi said that the unhealthy smoke coming out of the vehicles was causing smog. The dangers of smog could be avoided by taking precautionary measures. The CTO said that a climate free from environmental pollution and air pollution was the guarantor of a healthy society."
Air Pollution," The Pakistani citizenry, particularly the inhabitants of Lahore, seem to be in a state of worry as the average Air Quality Index Ratings (AQI) remain at an average of 350-a deathly hazardous level. After having suffered from the toll of the pandemic, as well the outbreak of dengue fever once again, this is an unnecessary health complication that can and should be avoided. Our authorities have gotten used to acting only when the situation becomes dire and this can be observed in the status quo as well; only now have anti-smog squads been created with the task of surveilling air pollution levels and correcting industrial malpractices that contribute to it./Just two weeks ago, Lahore was classified as the most polluted city in the world-due to the disturbing AQI level of 681-according to data released by the US Air Quality Index. Meanwhile, the Punjab Minister for the Environment, Muhammad Rizwan, claimed that there had been no smog in the province for the last two years. Such preposterous statements not only defy facts and are therefore false, but they actively invalidate the public's concerns and health risks. This is absolutely unacceptable especially considering how urgent the crisis of air pollution has become. A representative of the government tasked with the protection of the environment domestically through proposing solutions that promote sustainability must act more sensibly and address the facts for what they are./Years of crop burning agricultural traditions, increased burning of coal in factories and garbage in general and the use of oil has contributed to the worsening air quality in the country. Even small precautions that can be taken at an individual level like being proactive with waste removal, using cars equipped with green technology, emphasising the importance of minimising pollution are not practiced across the country./With the creation of anti-smog squads, there is some hope that industrial pollution will be curbed and smoke-emitting factories will be held accountable for their contribution in the crisis. This step should have been taken earlier but, it is reassuring to see that some action is being taken at least."
Lahore witnesses historic low in air quality," Different areas of Lahore city Sunday witnessed hazardous air quality levels, making the provincial capital one of the most polluted city in the world./According to the air pollution data, the provincial capital recorded the hazardous particulate matter (PM) rating of 427 in Township and 418 in Allama Iqbal Town. The average air quality of the city at the index was measured at 343. The AQI, as high as 151 to 200, is considered unhealthy while an AQI rating between 201 and 300 is more harmful. The AQI over 300 is dubbed extremely hazardous./According to experts, increase in the air pollution in winter, change in wind speed and wind direction, and sliding minimum temperature increase air pollution. The air becomes heavier in the winter, causing poisonous particles in the atmosphere to move downwards and making the atmosphere polluted. As a result, a layer of polluted particles, including large amounts of carbon and smoke, covers a city. The smoke produced by burning crop remnants, coal, garbage, oil and tyres enters the atmosphere, and its effects appear on the onset of winter and last the end of the season."
Anti-smog squad to conduct weekly inspection of industries," Special Assistant to Chief Minister on Information and Punjab government's spokesman Hasaan Khawar said that clean environment would remain a distant dream without sincere cooperation of people. During a media talk at the office of Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday, he said: 'People should play their role in keeping the environment clean by registering complaints on the helpline 1716, and on the Deputy Commissioner office's complaints helpline 0307-0002345, over violation of government's orders on smog.' He added: 'Lahore, the city of gardens, is the heart of Punjab, and steps like Miyawaki forests and introduction of electric buses will help make it more beautiful.'/Punjab govt's spokesman seeks people's cooperation to keep environment clean/He was of the view that by declaring smog a calamity, the government now has a number of viable options for its eradication. He said that a special anti-smog squad comprising representatives from the environment department, police, office of assistant commissioner, Lesco, Wasa and MCL would conduct weekly inspections of all industries in Lahore and take stern action on violations. He said despite the orders of transferring all the kilns in Punjab on ZigZag technology, reports of violations were being received. 'In this regard, 250 kilns have been sealed so far, and fines of about Rs27 million have been imposed.' He termed the burning of crop residues on both sides of the border a major cause of smog./'So far, fines of Rs3.6 million and 824 FIRs have been registered against violations,' he said, adding that 700 smoke emitting vehicles had been fined a total Rs3.8 million./Hasaan Khawar further said that the district administration had requested the oil marketing companies to ensure the sale of euro 5 standard petrol in two months to reduce air pollution."
Curtailing Smog," Urgent warnings of Pakistan's hazardous air quality in cities like Lahore continue to be raised while governmental efforts to counter this imminent threat remain slow. Reports of increased vulnerability to respiratory diseases as well as throat and eye infections have scared the public which is being urged by the government to avoid going outdoors and wear face masks as a protective measure./Advertisements by the authorities in news publications ask for people to step up and report cases of stubble burning, high-emission cars and polluting brick kilns. We have clearly crossed the point at which self-monitoring was an option and instead, radical steps are required to mitigate some of the damage done to our environment./According to statistics released, the transport sector is responsible for 43 percent of the country's air pollution levels, industries 25 percent and waste burning is at 20 percent. The use of eco-friendly cars in our country is severely limited and data on carbon emissions from cars through fitness certificates shows that there must be a serious push towards sustainability by the government./At the same time, the practice of stubble burning has become so prevalent that bouts of smoke can be seen escaping to the sky from the M2 as well. Similarly, brick kilns and industrial establishments have a big hand in polluting the air as well for which anti-smog committees have been established. The job of these groups should be to ensure that policy change occurs, various stakeholders abide by environmental laws and that accountability prevails to set a precedent that such a toxic atmosphere cannot be nurtured./New and innovative solutions are also being proposed with more research and technological development in the modern day. For instance, an experiment on using artificial rain to get rid of the smoke artificially is being carried out by the Punjab University Centre for Integrated Mountain Research. High-polluting cars should be kept off the roads through heavy fines and fitness certificates, and if nothing else, should be kept away from busy city centres at peak hours. Such strong directives are needed if some headway is to be made for improving the environment."
Serious measures against air pollution stressed,"  The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF), Lahore has shown concern over the Air Quality Indicators that have declared Lahore the most polluted city in the world. PBF President Ejaz Tanveer said that the worst air quality in Lahore was causing serious health problems such as respiratory diseases among people. 'Throat and eye infections are on the rise. The situation has gotten worse over the past decade,' he added./'The government should evaluate the issue on scientific bases and take effective measures to cope with this challenge,' he stressed. He also demanded that the government deal with the root causes of smog such as crop burning, smoke-emitting vehicles, factory emissions, etc. He said that the government should facilitate vehicle manufacturers to shift their structures on electric technology."
Lahore is suffocating,"  Through the esteemed column of your prestigious newspaper, I want to draw the attention of the authorities towards the degrading quality and impurity of air. Hardly a day goes by when people escape this unhealthy air. This is not a healthy environment for children, adults and old people. Many respiratory diseases are beginning to flare up. Smog can irritate the eyes, nose and throat. It can worsen existing heart and lung problems or perhaps cause lung cancer with regular long-term exposure. It also results in early death. Studies on ozone show that once it gets into your lungs, it can continue to cause damage even when you feel fine./This air pollution is caused by thick smoke emitted from big factories and from unmaintained vehicles these gases are poisonous in nature. This mixes with pure air and pollutes it. Factory owners should take responsibility for their actions. I thereby request authorities to take an immediate step and pass a strict law to punish the culprits to take responsibility for the environment by working in a sustainable manner. This will bring relief to all positively."
Lahore declared most polluted city globally," Provincial capital of Punjab has been declared the most polluted city globally after the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) went above 280./The Air Quality Index data was released on Wednesday and put Lahore on the list of the most polluted cities in the world while Karachi came in seventh./On the other hand, PM2.5 concentration in Lahore air is currently 46.3 times above the WHO annual air quality guideline value./According to details, the worst quality of air was recorded in Kot Lakhpat as AQI reached 479, followed by Bahria Orchard 407, Model Town 396, Gulberg 368 and Township Block Two at 364./Residents choking in acrid smog pleaded with officials to take action. Air pollution has worsened in Pakistan in recent years, as a mixture of low-grade diesel fumes, smoke from seasonal crop burn off, and colder winter temperatures coalesce into stagnant clouds of smog./Lahore, a bustling megacity of more than 11 million people in Punjab province near the border with India, consistently ranks among the worst cities in the world for air pollution./In recent years residents have built their own air purifiers and taken out lawsuits against government officials in desperate bids to clean the air -- but authorities have been slow to act."
Can Pakistan mitigate its smog calamity?," Since the last few years, Lahore has regularly topped the US Air Quality Index (AQI)-closely followed by other cities-in air pollution rankings of the world's major global cities. More recently, Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world, with pollution concentrations rising to extremely hazardous levels. In spite of measures being introduced by the federal and provincial administrations, deteriorating air quality and smog have engulfed the country since years. Even public concerns over the subject only gained traction in recent years. Smog is not only a public health emergency that threatens to reduce life expectancy of residents but also a socio-economic concern. In the past, the authorities have been forced to shut down schools, and hospitals declared emergency. Airports have regularly faced flight delays and suspensions while commuters on motorways and highways were severely impacted, with many losing their lives in road crashes due to low visibility as a result of smog. Many citizens, particularly manual labourers, are risking permanent damage to their lungs. In recent years, increasing warnings are now issued to citizens in Punjab to wear masks and avoid outdoor exposure./In this regard, the federal and provincial governments have introduced policy and regulatory measures to address the growing intensity of smog. The Pakistan Clean Air Network was first introduced in Pakistan in 2005 to improve air quality. Thereafter, revised plans were introduced in 2020 and 2021. The Punjab Government's Environmental Protection Department issued a policy on controlling smog in 2017. It imposed a complete ban on open burning of rice stubble, solid waste and other hazardous materials. Steel furnaces and other industrial units working without emission control equipment or using sub-standard fuels were to be shut down by the Environmental Protection agency. Similarly, the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) banned all activities that could intensify smog due to climate change, including vehicular and industrial smoke, and solid waste disposal, especially residual crop burning. The Punjab Local Government Act, 2019 was also enacted, which directs municipal authorities and waste management companies to ensure water sprinkling on roads, streets and construction sites producing dust. The Punjab Government has notified district anti-smog committees under Deputy Commissioners to enforce all necessary preventive measures./Nevertheless, the progressively worsening smog has led to questions over the performance of provincial governments. The biggest concern is the lack of timely action since policy measures are often introduced just before or after the onset of smog. Another connected and dire issue is the implementation of devised policies and regulatory mechanisms. Despite imposition of fines on vehicular and industrial emissions and their impounding and sealing respectively for violations, inspection standards and overall regulation, unfortunately, remain lax. The problem is further compounded by a lack of coordination between the different concerned departments; environment, transport and agriculture. Moreover, publicly available government data remains absent with only a network of citizen-operated sensors monitoring fine particulate matter and reporting data in real-time. The Federal Government recently announced a 'five-pronged' plan to tackle smog that includes urban forestry, installing smog filtration towers, regulating automobile and industrial emissions, limiting thermal power plants, and preventing stubble burning. Nevertheless, it is easier said than done. While trees may alleviate air pollution to a degree, they would be of limited help in removing industrial and toxic pollutants. Likewise, smog and air filtration towers have limited capacity to remove hazardous air particles and pollutants, apart from the huge areas to cover. Moreover, such curative and preventive measures notwithstanding, the underlying problem is with the implementation of laws./Improvement in air quality demands an enormous investment of time, resources and political will. It is necessary that Pakistan is committed to achieving results and learning from other countries. Quality data from air monitoring remains essential in formulating and assessing efficacy of policy mechanisms. Further, Pakistan must revise its national standards for industrial emissions and ensure industry compliance in line with prevailing international standards. Pakistan must also ensure inter-departmental and regional cooperation in air pollution mitigation strategies. It is unfortunate that the nation has been bearing smog as it continues to impact economic activity and daily standards of living. The citizens are breathing in hazardous pollutants while the smog has persisted unabated for far too long. Though it has not been one of our priorities in the past, it must certainly be so now. It is high time that we all do our part in adopting and complying with strict policies to alleviate air quality. Otherwise, our cities shall continue to top the charts of cities with bad air quality."

SEPA decides to resume vehicular emission testing activity in Sindh," Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) decided to immediately resume vehicular emission testing activity in major cities of Sindh that was Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur with the assistance of Sindh Traffic Police./The decision to this effect was made in a meeting chaired by Director General SEPA Naeem Ahmed Mughal at SEPA Complex here. It was decided in the meeting that monitoring activity on installed heavy generators placed on footpaths or rooftops of commercial areas also be simultaneously carried out in each district.  Meanwhile, co-ordination will be ensured with all land-owning organizations and District Management, KMC to take immediate actions against dust pollution on major roads to carryout sweeping, sprinkling activities and preparation of traffic management plans. It was decided that district incharges of SEPA will check all air pollution related issues, including burning of solid waste and control of smoke emanating from BBQ restaurants which release heavy amounts of carbon mono-oxide./Only those BBQ outlets would be allowed to operate having installed smoke catching equipment./All stakeholders including Port authorities, ABAD, Transport Association, Industries department, transport department, traffic police, NHA, Motorway police will be engaged to provide support to SEPA for controlling air pollution in the city. Stern action will also be ensured on all industrial and manufacturing units operating boilers on coal and other fossil fuels releasing pollutants in the environment causing significant contributing towards degradation of air quality./Efforts would be initiated to reduce pulmonary/respiratory lung diseases being faced by citizens of the city.  Moreover, all public and private sector organizations would be engaged and motivated to increase green cover through tree plantation drives to check on air pollution and climate change issues in the city. The strategy has been designed consequent to air quality monitoring held earlier at around 100 locations in the city which reflects alarming levels of PM2.5 in air quality."
Strengthening Participatory Organization launched a campaign," Strengthening Participatory Organization/(SPO) has launched a campaign issue of Lahore and our responsibilities./According to SPO, issues including the environment, smoke, water pollution, and sanitation are an integral part of the campaign. SPO is promoting the youth of universities by their social action projects and they will play their role to clean and green Lahore. Around 70 percent of the population of Pakistan depends on groundwater directly or indirectly for its livelihood, said Strengthening Participatory Organization./According to Shahnawaz Khan, Regional Coordinator, more than 60% of the population of Pakistan has no access to safe drinking water. Residents of Lahore depend on groundwater, unfortunately, the groundwater has become polluted. The issue of groundwater is multifarious and complex in its nature.  He said that the level of groundwater has declined to 100 feet. He further said that saltwater has been included in table water because of unplanned pumping. According to him, the river Ravi was only a natural aquifer but it remains dry almost the year except during the monsoon season. He further added that the natural recharging of groundwater aquifers is almost negligible due to construction activities and pavements of streets and roads./Additionally, untreated water had been discharged in the river Ravi which made it polluted. He said that factories of solid waste contribute a lot to water pollution, the government must take notice and these factories must be dumped outside of Lahore at dumping places. The color of water has become yellowish and odorous. He said that heavy metals have also been found in the groundwater samples and the concentration of lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni) and a number of E. coli levels exceeded the permissible limits of drinking water quality. He said that Lahore is a hub of industrial activities and its groundwater has become polluted.  He said that a wide range of pollutants generated by natural and human activities are contributing to the degradation of groundwater in the area. Abstraction of groundwater increases as the population grows and over-exploitation of aquifer results in a decline of groundwater levels/The regional coordinator added that the Metropolitan city of the Punjab province is choking on smog, driven in part by smoke from bricks kiln and steel mills, burning of rice stubble and garbage, growing numbers of vehicles on the road and large-scale losses of trees as the expanding city makes way for new roads and buildings. Air pollution has increased in the city and it could be controlled by reducing vehicles on roads. He presented a solution that officials must use public vehicles and schools, colleges and universities students should use public transport. He also suggested that in private offices pooling system must be adopted to reduce air pollution./Shahnawaz said that sometimes heaps of garbage appeared on city roads. It must be discouraged and needed prompt action. According to him, the metropolitan cities should be clean and green all the time. Sanitary workers must carry garbage wherever they see, additionally, the citizens should play their role to clean the city. Citizens of Lahore should not throw garbage in the street. Garbage must be placed on the places fixed by the government. After that, it must be taken into dumping places./He said that the world has become technologically advanced, we should learn from their experiences. Electricity could be produced by using garbage. He added that it has been observed that the uncollected garbage had been scattered on roads especially in lower and middle-class localities. Garbage has been seen in commercial and residential localities too. He said that Lahore Waste Management Company is doing their best to carry garbage and make Lahore clean but there is a need to enhance their role and vigilance./Minister for environmental protection Punjab, Bao Muhammad Rizwan said that collective efforts ought to be made to eradicate the rapidly increasing problem of environmental degradation. Hence, there is a need to create awareness at the grassroots level. He told that Department has recommended imparting environmental education to students up to 5th class and integrating 20 marks for the students of higher education, who are contributing to eradicating pollution.  Professor Dr. Sajid Rashid, Principal College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, PU cautioned that Environmental pollution would be a grave challenge in the coming decade, thus there is a need to put a ban on the usage of plastic bags."
Karachi Becomes World's 'Fourth Largest' Polluted City," Karachi has turned world's fourth largest air polluted cities as its air quality index has surged to an unhealthy level of 193, showing utter negligence of the federal and Sindh government towards environmental reforms, according to a new investigative report released on Sunday./PM2.5 concentration, as per IQAir organization report, in Karachi has been recorded 11.8 times higher this month which is above the WHO annual air quality guideline value./This clearly proves that the federal and Sindh governments' claims of making huge investments for improving the environment and public health in the city are nothing but disinformation and misinformation, says the investigation report made by a senior journalist M Nawaz Khuhro under a fellowship program offered by Pakistan Press Foundation (PPF) in collaboration with Media Matters for Democracy./The investigation finds that air pollution in Karachi contains solid and liquid particles, and certain gases in the air. The major polluters are transport and industrial emissions followed by burning of garbage, emissions from refrigerators, generators, flying of dust, and stoves used in houses and hotels./The investigation says all types of forests, including mangroves along Sindh's coastline, which used to help absorb carbon dioxide and clean air in Karachi, had been hacked to an alarming level.  Karachi's present mangroves forest cover is 50,000 hectares. In the last 50 years, Karachi has lost 10,000 hectares of mangrove forest due to encroachments, commercialization and infrastructure development, which is a loss to the environment of the city./A Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) report says the important ecosystems in Sindh, such as mangroves, have come under extreme pressure due to sea water encroachment and deforestation. There has been mass depletion of mangrove forests in the area due to illegal logging, irrigation and untreated industrial waste./City's air turns unhealthy causing lung and heart diseases: Investigative Report/The report says only 130,000 hectares of mangroves of the 600,000 hectares that existed at the start of the 20th century are now left. The total land area of Sindh Province is 34.84 million out of which 8% forest cover is forest cover, which is low./According to an international standard, a country should have at least 25 percent of its total land under forest cover to tackle environmental degradation including air pollution. The new annual economic survey of Pakistan released in June 2021 says Pakistan is a forest deficient country as it has 5.01 percent area under its forest cover./According to WHO, air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change./From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health.  It causes diseases including heart ailments, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, cancer and pneumonia. It says seven million people die globally each year due to exposure to ambient and household air pollution./Air pollution is a complex mixture of solid particles, liquid droplets, as well as gases. It can come from many sources for example: household fuel burning, industrial chimneys, traffic exhausts, power generation, open burning of waste, agricultural practices, desert dust and many other sources./Different sources can lead to different mixtures of air pollution. For example, an urban city near to the sea can have particulate matter consisting of sea salt, road dust and smoke from diesel engines. In contrast, a rural area near to a forest may have particulate matter consisting of soil, smoke from cookstoves and forest fires./Air pollutants measured include PM2.5 and PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of equal or less than 2.5, also called fine, and 10 micrometre respectively), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2)./Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can penetrate through the lungs and further enter the body through the bloodstream, affecting all major organs./Exposure to PM2.5 can cause diseases both to our cardiovascular and respiratory system, provoking, for example stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)./New research has also shown an association between prenatal exposure to high levels of air pollution and developmental delay at age three, as well as psychological and behavioural problems later on, including symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression./Air pollution is a threat to health in all countries, but it hits people in low- and middle-income countries the hardest,' said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus./In an interview, Naeem Qureshi, President at National Forum for Environment and Health, said that air pollution is continuously rising in Karachi, mainly due to emissions from transport, followed by industrial emissions and burning of garbage. Transport is creating 70% air pollution in the city./He said: 'The federal and provincial governments have formulated environment policies but they are not being implemented in true spirit as a result, there is no control on pollution in Karachi.' He said that the certification system of vehicles is bogus in the city, which needs to be improved./There should be effective checking of smoke-emitting vehicles to reduce harmful emissions. Mass transit should be launched in Karachi as early as possible besides launching electrical vehicles, Qureshi added./In an interview,SM Qaisar Sajjad, Secretary General, Pakistan Medical Association, said: 'Karachi has turned world's fourth largest air polluting city, which is matter of great concern. Air pollutionis a slow poison and can even take life in severe conditions.'/Dr Qaiser said that air pollution contributes to asthma, nose elegy, sore throat, and heart diseases. It causes 60 to 70% cases of sore throat and nose elegy in the metropolis of Sindh, while children and elderly people are badly affected by this pollution. The air pollution is also affecting IQ level of children./He said that the government needed to ensure establishment of proper data system of disease cases, including that of asthma and heart diseases. He said that the transport is major contributor to air pollution followed by industrial emissions and dust  and  garbage particles in the air./The PMA president stressed the need to regulate transport and industrial systems, and stop all smoke emitting and dilapidated vehicles which cause air pollution. Only fit vehicles should be allowed to ply Karachi roads while there should be proper checking of industrial emissions in the city besides stopping garbage burning at different areas of the city./According to a Word Bank report, nearly 80% of the more than 9,000 premature deaths caused every year in Pakistan by high PM2.5 concentrations are in Karachi./The PM emissions from road vehicles are estimated to be from diesel trucks, diesel buses and minibuses, and light-duty diesel vehicles. About one-third, however, appears to be from motorcycles and rickshaws, which almost exclusively have highly polluting two-stroke engines. A major source of PM emissions from industry corresponds to ferrous metal sources (steel mills, foundries, and scrap smelters)."
UN's Climate Warning,"A landmark UN report was released this week which warned that time has nearly run out to ensure a liveable future for all. The report offers a sobering reality check of how dire the situation is, and offers a warning that far worse is in store in terms of species extinction, ecosystem collapse, insect-borne orne disease, severe heatwaves and megastorms, water shortages and reduced crop yields./The report unequivocally conveys that we are approaching a point of no return because regardless of our efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions, we must brace ourselves for a climate onslaught that cannot be avoided./Even in more optimistic scenarios, the predictions are quite sobering. The report estimates that by 2050 there will be more than a billion people in coastal areas highly vulnerable to storm surges amplified by rising seas. An additional 410 million people will be exposed to water scarcity from severe drought at 2 degrees Celsius of warming, and up to 80 million will be at risk of hunger. As is always the case, the poorest and the marginalised will be the hardest hit./Given the situation at this point in time, in addition to reducing emissions, countries need to start adapting to conditions of a warmer world. This is all the more urgent for countries that find themselves on the front line of climate change. However, these measures will require significant investment to finance new technologies and build new infrastructure-something which developing countries will not be able to manage on their own./We need and must demand a collaborative approach to tackling this threat. Financial assistance should be obligatory on the nations that are major contributors while the global south faces the brunt of this crisis. It was reported recently that financial institutions from just six countries-the US, China, Japan, India, Canada and the UK-were found to be responsible for over 80 percent of coal financing and investment between January 2019 and November last year. This is dangerous behaviour to say the least; endangering the lives of millions around the world./The threat to Pakistan is also acute, with 40 percent of the population being food insecure, and 80 percent citizens in urban centres lacking access to clean drinking water. Pakistani cities rank highest on the air pollution score, and smog has cut five years from life spans in Punjab and elsewhere. Adaptation is an area where Pakistan is severely lagging as it still lacks an adaptation plan in its final form. While of course we will need external financial assistance to tackle this threat, we cannot afford to wait around for help and should prioritise climate spending by diverting more resources from the national pool."
"Screens, Air Pollution Damaging Eye Health, Say Medical Experts"," More than four million people across the globe are suffering from blindness because of glaucoma, making it the third biggest cause of visual impairment worldwide. However, timely diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma can prevent one becoming visually impaired. These views were expressed by Post Graduate Medical Institute (PGMI) Principal Prof Dr Sardar Muhammad Al-freed Zafar during an address to an awareness walk on 'World Glaucoma Week 2022' at Lahore General Hospital (LGH). 'To prevent eye diseases and blindness, it is important to control diabetes, high blood pressure and air pollution,' he said. 'Similarly, constantly watching cartoons on small mobile phone screens by children and working without computer shield by adults are also harmful for eye health,' he added./'Medical experts have also introduced a motto 'Make the kids play, keep the glasses away' and by implementing it we can save the eyes of our children,' he pointed out. Prof Muhammad Moin, Prof Hussain Ahmad Khaqan, Prof Tayyaba Gul Malik, Dr Khalid Bin Aslam, Dr Abdul Aziz, Dr Lubna Siddique, and other doctors, nurses and paramedics were present on the occasion. Prof Moin and Prof Hussain Ahmad Khaqan said that 1.8 million people in Pakistan were suffering from eye disease (glaucoma). They said that the disease could affect any age group in general. Prof Al-freed Zafar said that eye examination and operation facility was available at General Hospital from Monday to Saturday./'There are modern medical equipment for timely diagnosis and treatment,' he added./Dr Lubna Siddique said that the rate of visual impairment in children was increasing day by day as most of the parents gave mobile phones to the children between 2 and 6 years of age to entertain or feed them. 'They should spend part of the day on the ground and on the greenery to have good eyesight,' she added./The medical experts also informed about the symptoms and precautions of cataract and highlighted its timely treatment./Talking to the media, Prof Al-freed Zafar said that in order to observe the beauty of the world and enjoy the true sense of life, it was essential to have eyesight./'Its value can be assessed only by those who for some reason have been deprived of this great blessing of Allah Almighty,' he said and added that raising public awareness for timely diagnosis and treatment of cataracts was a need of the hour so that older people could change their lifestyle./He stressed the need for regular exercise and morning walk to control diabetes and blood pressure to avoid stress in daily life./'In addition, unnecessary use of mobile phones by children should be stopped which is causing them to wear thick spectacles,' the PGMI principal said and added that air pollution and smoke-emitting vehicles were also damaging eye health."
Death Bags," We see plastic bags everywhere around us floating on the roads and streets. Sometimes we find these bags flying in the air and hanging on the trees and garbage cans. In dump places, we find colourful heaps of these bags./Do you ever think how many plastic bags are used by us every minute in the whole world? Trillions of plastic bags are used worldwide each year, nearly 2 million each minute. It stands for a number of incredible benefits that help people every day but plastic bag is the most harmful material on our planet. You see without special treatment these bags are not readily degradable. Plastic bags are dumped into millions of hectares and emit dangerous toxic gases like methane, carbon dioxide gas, etc. Plastic bags take more than 400 years to degrade. Despite knowing all these harmful aspects we are still-using plastic bags. Plastic bags cause serious environmental problems such as air pollution, human and animal diseases, reduction of soil fertility and blockage of the sewage system. Thousands of marine species face suffocation and death in the oceans due to engulfing these plastic bags. In developing countries like Pakistan, these bags are used for carrying food items. The plastic chemicals react with the food and generate carcinogens that cause cancer. Recent research shows, that plastic is present in the human blood. Plastic bags block sewerage system, especially during rainfall which causes flooding. The blockage creates foul smells and suitable habitat for mosquitos. Mosquitos begin to gather in stagnant water which spreads a number of diseases like malaria and dengue. Plastic bags also affects agriculture by reducing soil fertility The reason behind the widespread use of plastic bags is their low weight, low price, easy availability and lack of other alternative material./By educating people through school and media we should increase awareness. We should take proper measures. Instead of using plastic bags, we should use canvas bags, paper bags, cotton bags, cloth bags and other environment friendly materials We should pay attention to the proper collection of used plastic bags so that they can be easily recycled. By converting plastic wastes into formic acid(a chemical used to generate energy) we can also produce electricity."
"14 Million People Suffering From Asthma In Pakistan, Says Dr Rubaba"," Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi on Friday said that over 14 million people in Pakistan were suffering from respiratory diseases of which 51 percent were adults and 32 percent have minors./She expressed these views in a message on the occasion of World Asthma Day./Dr Rubaba Buledi said that Asthma, a common chronic disease, which caused by air pollution, family allergies, smoking, extravagant lifestyle, carpet dust and other causes./'If such symptoms appear, the severity of asthma may increase when a qualified doctor is not consulted, this can make it difficult for the patient to walk or even climb stairs, and suffocation will lead to sudden death,' she mentioned./Dr Rubaba Khan Baledi said that after Karachi, Multan was considered second city with highest number of asthma patients in Pakistan.Dr Rubaba said that most people were not aware of the proper treatment for asthma, so there is an urgent need to spread awareness in order to control in the areas./Earlier, different programmes were organised to celebrate World Asthma Day with the aim to create awareness among people against asthma under Pakistan Chest Society Balochistan."
Air Pollution," Air pollution is a major problem confronting Pakistan, with cities like Lahore and Karachi ranking among the most polluted worldwide. The greater level of air pollution is a danger to human health. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), air pollution is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide every year. An estimated 128,000 Pakistanis die annually from air pollution-related illnesses (GAHP)./Mostly transportation and the widespread use of low-quality fuel are the biggest factors contributing to air pollution. Many vehicles in Pakistan still use a type of highly polluting Sulphur-laden gas, which is compounding the problem of air pollution. Transportation alone is responsible for 25% of carbon emissions in Pakistan. Not only that industrial policies and practices in Pakistan also compound the problem. Burning of tires to power factory units and brick kilns, and exposure to smoke from factories also pollute the air mostly./To control air pollution and improve the quality of life we can switch to Euro 5 emissions standards for all new vehicles although the of such vehicles in the country is still very low. Heavy taxes on the use of such vehicles are discouraging people from buying and using them. Urging factories to install new technologies to lower air pollution is the only option we can move fastly."
Anti-Smog Teams Seal 15 Units," The anti-smog teams of the Environment Protection Department (EPD) Punjab, adopting a strict policy, has launched an action against air polluters and sealed 15 units. During the raids in Lahore, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sheikhupura and Kasur regions, 15 units were sealed including five steel mills, three scrap recycling units, three kilns and four pyro plants. Secretary EPD Naeem Rauf has said that the smoke from steel mills, recycling units and kilns was causing pollution and spreading various diseases. The indiscriminate operation against smoke emitting units would be continued in future also, he said and added that a zero-tolerance policy was being adopted by the department as the health of people was a priority."
Natural Environment Essential For Survival Of Humanity: Senator Samina," Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri  on Sunday said that Balochistan natural environment protection was essential for the survival of humanity.  These views were expressed on Sunday  by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri in a meeting with a delegation of youth from Balochistan. She said'The goal of protecting natural environment is to draw attention to the damage done to the environment in the world and to make efforts to prevent them.' She said'Unfortunately Pakistan is currently among the top 10 countries affected by the effects of climate change.'/The Senator also said'Protection of forests and environment is a national responsibility of all of us.  But it is unfortunate to say that we are living completely unaware of the environment around us.'/'Despite repeated warnings from international environmental protection agencies, no attention is being paid to the fact that Air pollution is depleting the ozone layer, which is causing temperatures to rise. We can all protect our ozone by improving our environment.  Smoke from factories and vehicle fumes in cities are the biggest causes of air pollution,' she underlined./Talking to the delegation, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri said that our glaciers have started melting rapidly due to rising temperatures.  When glaciers melt, the water level in the rivers rises and as a result floods the surrounding populations, causing heavy loss of life and property. These glaciers also increase the country's water reserves, but when lots of water comes together, it does not become a store, which causes floods first, and then droughts, she maintained./Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri said that according to experts, by 2040, two-thirds of Pakistan's population could be suffering from water scarcity. She said'The impact of climate change is also severely damaging our agriculture.  Lack of rain during the rainy season and unpredictable rains and changing patterns of heat and cold are reducing the yield of our crops, leading to fears of malnutrition.'/She said'The owners of various industries, economies, brick kilns and smoke emitting vehicles would have to take steps in the fight against climate change in order to eliminate environmental pollution from Pakistan and save the ozone layer. This will not only benefit us but will also affect the climatic conditions around us.'  She said'The reason for the lack of rain in different regions is also environmental pollution due to which the rainfall in these areas has either decreased or not at all. It's over, which is a dangerous thing.'   Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri said'Pakistan is located in the most densely populated region of the world. Air pollution is the biggest problem of the region and air pollution in these countries is increasing day by day and this is the region which is fstest growing.'/Climate change is taking place and the seasons are intensifying,' she highlighted./She added'Pakistan is suffering from severe air pollution and various diseases of the lungs and throat are increasing day by day. This is the easiest solution to eliminate air pollution.'   Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri said that planting more and more trees would not only make the surrounding environment pleasant and clean but would also help in controlling pollution./'Balochistan is about half of Pakistan i.e. 43% and we all have to pledge to protect the environment of half of Pakistan. Twenty one percent of Balochistan is desert while other areas are covered with mountains, coastal strip and natural forests. Quetta, the largest city of Balochistan, is surrounded by natural beauty, meets the requirements we should protect this natural beauty and more in it in addition, trees must be planted in areas of Balochistan where trees can be planted, and for this we, alongwith the government, must all play our part in saving the ozone layer and in the coming days, climate change, to compete,' she concluded."
CS For Action Against Those Causing Environmental Pollution," In line with measures to control smog, Punjab Chief Secretary Kam­ran Ali Afzal on Tuesday directed the department concerned to take ac­tion against those causing environ­mental pollution./The Chief Secretary issued the di­rection during a meeting held at the Civil Secretariat. The additional chief secretary (home), administrative sec­retaries of various departments in­cluding environment, industries, agri­culture, local government, and officials concerned participated in the meet­ing. The Chief Secretary asked the secretaries of the departments con­cerned to take strict action against those causing air and environmental pollution - industrial, and vehicular emissions, burning crop stubble, and garbage. He said that to mitigate the factors behind smog, there was a need to adopt preventive measures and enhance awareness./He directed that the ban on the use of substandard fuel in steel mills and factories be strictly enforced. He said that all the provincial depart­ments should work in tandem on/the issue of smog, adding that progress in this regard would be reviewed regularly. The Chief Secre­tary also issued instructions regard­ing the formation of special squads to check industrial units and brick kilns. The secretary environment protection department gave a de­tailed briefing at the meeting./He said that an action plan had been prepared to control smog. Ac­cording to a study, 43 percent of contributors to air pollution were from the transport sector, 25 per­cent from industry, 12 percent from power and 20 percent were from agriculture sector. This year, more than 4000 industrial units were in­spected, 79 cases were registered,/19 people were arrested and 88 units were sealed, he said./Similarly, 11,000 brick kilns were inspected, 736 cases were registered and 19 people were arrested. The authorities also took action against 29,200 smoke-emitting vehicles, lodging 7,000 FIRs and impounding 17,600 vehicles, he added."
Preventing Pollution," To limit noise and air pollution, the Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) fined over 3767 vehicles in the last three months. The crackdown began after the directives of the DIG of Police (Ops) to take strict action against those who are contributing to climate change and causing health risks for the public. This, on its own, is a decent on-ground policy to implement but for real change to come about, the national environmental policy has to be amended and restructured to include vehicle emissions. The automobile industry should be relatively easy to regulate when it comes to limiting the sale of smoke-emitting vehicles and encouraging eco-friendly cars. The challenge lies in addressing the second-hand car market and vehicles that are already on the road./According to the police, the 3767 vehicles were fined for being smoke-emitting and using pressure horns that cause immediate distress in their surroundings. Plus, additional zones have been set up in which the police have vowed to take punitive measures against those who are contributing to the climate crisis. This is a good initiative to take that is bound to create enough convenience for the masses to think twice before using and buying vehicles that pollute. The excessive fine will also discourage a significant chunk of the population./However, to get polluting cars off of the streets, there needs to be a holistic and comprehensive strategy that is implemented on a national or provincial level. Regularising vehicular movement requires the use of fitness certificates and records about emission rates that the government must view and analyse. After this, it can devise policies that aim to encourage the replacement of polluting cars with hybrid or electric cars so that environmental impact can be restricted. Caps can be placed on the number of emissions allowed, members of the public can be forced to carry certificates that prove their cars are not hazardous to the environment and the problem as a whole can be tackled at the source level."
Plastic waste," My father told me that some decades back, farmers bought garbage collected from cities. Trucks carrying waste were bought and it was thrown on land. One man's trash becomes another man's treasure. It was like a natural fertilizer for crops. This way the waste became useful. But this practice ended because waste is full of plastic now. Plastic, a toxic material that neither decays nor decomposes, has entered our lives without our knowledge./Not only does it cause pollution, but is also the leading cause of urban flooding. Sewers get blocked by plastic and rainwater starts to accumulate on roads making them look like canals. Our country is facing a natural calamity, with some residential areas filled with rainwater mixed with sewerage and plastic floating over it. People are forced to live there and are in danger of exposure to several contagious and chronic diseases. I think in the near future every house will need a boat for travelling. It cannot be buried and burning it releases several toxic gases contributing to air pollution./Here in Pakistan, there is a trend of using double plastic bags for packing stuff and no mechanism for destroying it. Only the 3R strategy i.e; reduce, reuse, recycle, is a way out. We should prefer reusable cloth bags over plastic bags. People must take this problem seriously and take preventive measures against it or else these giant mountains of plastic around us would swallow us and there will be nothing but plastic everywhere."
"Lahore, Karachi rank among world's top 5 most polluted cities"," Lahore and Karachi have featured on the list of the world's top five most polluted cities by capturing second and the third rank respectively./According to air pollution data released by the US Air Quality Index, Lahore recorded a particulate matter (PM) rating of 181, placing the city at the second spot on the global index of most polluted cities./Meanwhile, Karachi reported a particulate matter (PM) rating of 172 and was ranked third most polluted city in the world./The standards set by the Air Quality Index categorises a city under 'unhealthy' if the PM rating lies between 151 and 200. A rating between 201 and 300 falls under the category of 'highly unhealthy' and anything above 301 falls under the 'hazardous' category./According to experts, the air becomes heavier in the winter as compared to summer, causing poisonous particles in the atmosphere to move downwards and making the atmosphere polluted. As a result, a layer of polluted particles, including large amounts of carbon and smoke, covers a city./It is pertinent to mention here that the Lahore High Court (LHC) on October 7 ordered the authorities concerned to impose a smog emergency in Punjabahead of the winter season./According to details, Justice Shahid Jamil heard a petition, demanding the government to take measures to control the smog in the province./Besides ordering to impose a smog emergency, the LHC directed Chief Secretary Punjab to summon a meeting to take precautionary measures ahead of the winter season./The court also ordered to immediately close down the smoke-emitting factories. 'Immediate action should be taken against people involved in burning the crop,' the judge added."
Water crisis and climate change," Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I want to invite the attention of the authorities towards the problem is water crisis and climate change./Pakistan is experiencing devastating environmental issues such as air pollution, deforestation, climate change, water scarcity, and loss of biodiversity. Karachi, a cosmopolitan city, is an ideal example of a polluted city. From sewage and drainage to the dirty public beaches and the infinite number of cars emitting smoke is resulting in air pollution. The massive infrastructure developed over the last 15 years or so has wiped out green spaces, hence leaving a desert-like condition where there is only a mirage of water but no water. The masses are literally tearing at each other. There is no water even to drink, let alone shower. Life has become a hellfire for the masses. They drink from the coolers installed in the park, rest under the shade of the few trees left and shower in canals to get relief from the surging waves of heat."
Lahore becomes Pakistan's top most polluted city," Lahore, Punjab's provincial capital, has topped the list of most polluted cities in Pakistan, according to the Air Quality Index./According to air pollution data released by the US Air Quality Index, Lahore recorded a particulate matter (PM) rating of 241, placing the city at the top spot on the index of most polluted cities of Pakistan./Meanwhile, Faisalabad and Karachi were ranked second and third most polluted cities respectively./The standards set by the Air Quality Index categorises a city as 'unhealthy' if the PM rating lies between 151 and 200. A rating between 201 and 300 falls under the category of 'highly unhealthy' and anything above 301 falls under the 'hazardous' category./According to experts, the air becomes heavier in the winter as compared to summer, causing poisonous particles in the atmosphere to move downwards and making the atmosphere polluted. As a result, a layer of polluted particles, including large amounts of carbon and smoke, covers a city./It is pertinent to mention here that the Lahore High Court (LHC) on October 7 ordered the authorities concerned to impose a smog emergency in Punjab ahead of the winter season."
"Lahore, Karachi ranked most polluted cities of Pakistan"," Karachi and Lahore have been rated most polluted cities of Pakistan on the Air Quality Index (AQI)./Karachi has been ranked second from the top in the most polluted cities of the world on the air pollution measurement scale./The port city has been measured to have air pollution of 199 hazardous particulate matter, while Lahore ranked third in the most polluted cities of the planet having 181 particulate matter, according to the air quality index./It is to be mentioned here that AQI as high as 151-200 is being considered unhealthy, while an AQI reading between 201 to 300 is more harmful and AQI over 300 mark is dubbed extremely hazardous./According to experts, the air becomes heavier in the winter as compared to summer, causing poisonous particles in the atmosphere to move downwards and making the atmosphere polluted. As a result, a layer of polluted particles, including large amounts of carbon and smoke, covers a city./The smoke produced by factories and by burning coal, garbage, oil or tyres enters the atmosphere and the effects of this appear at the onset of winter and remain till the season's end, experts said."
Hazardous Trend," Like clockwork, the winter season has brought with it thick and heavy clouds of smoke due to which, annually, Lahore and Karachi are ranked as the most polluted cities of Pakistan and the world. Every year, our country is dragged through the mud because of the rapid deterioration of the environment and excessive levels of pollution that become most visible during the winters. Not much is done by the government to control and prevent this, despite being part of the select few countries that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change./The Air Quality Index (AQI) as of right now is measured to be 199 in Karachi and 188 in Lahore. Through the course of time, this will inevitably increase as it did last year when we reported record-breaking readings of over 600 indicating that the quality of air we breathe has been extremely toxic and hazardous to our health. Soon, the government will issue warnings as well but at that point in time, we will have approached a point from which there is no return./Much of the pollution is attributed to the winds blowing from the northeast which increase the concentration of hidden polluted particles. One would have hoped that the excessive amounts of rain that wreaked havoc across the country would have at least washed away these polluted particles from the air but alas, here we are. The air is slowly becoming toxic and activities like crop burning will add fuel to the fire./Throughout the course of years, we have neglected countless warnings that urged action so that such circumstances would not prevail and now, we had an entire years in which we could have enforced policies through which emissions could have been reduced or air pollution would have been limited."
