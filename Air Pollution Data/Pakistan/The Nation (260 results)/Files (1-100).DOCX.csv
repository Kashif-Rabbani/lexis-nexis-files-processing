'City has higher level of carbon in air',"The atmosphere of Lahore has a greater percentage of carbon as compared to that of Karachi, professor of Environmental Chemistry State University New York Dr Liaquat Hussain said while talking to The Nation here Thursday at Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Invited by Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), Lahore Chapter, at a seminar at LCCI on creation of fog situation in Lahore, Mr Hussain spoke at length about the reasons, which have caused fog in Punjab and Lahore, especially in the last week of December and the first two weeks of January in the recent years./It is pertinent to mention that SUPARCO in its preliminary study has raised concern about what it calls deteriorating air quality in Lahore due to increased emissions from transport and industry with high levels of Sulphate and black carbon, the major constituents of dense winter fog. According to the study, fog content can cause respiratory diseases as well as cardiovascular complications. The study identifies emissions from thermal power plants in North Western India as another source of air pollution in Pakistani Punjab. Mr Hussain is also coordinating with SUPARCO in the monitoring mechanism of the Lahore air pollution./Explaining the mechanics of fog creation during extremely cold weather in Punjab province, he said that pollution level was only a contributing factor; what was central to the creation of fog was humidity level in the atmosphere. 'The combination of humidity and smog due to air pollution causes the fog,' he added. Talking about the impact of regional developments and cycles on localized phenomenon like fog, he said that the atmospheric trends in Eastern Punjab were responsible for similar conditions in Pakistani Punjab during extreme winter.""Pollutants can actually travel up to one thousand kilometres and impact upon the environmental condition.""/Regarding general atmospheric trends in Pakistan and India, Mr Hussain lamented what he called the non-availability of data, to make an objective assessment of the situation. He said unless the monitoring was done and data of the same maintained, one cannot hope of a clear-cut policy response to that. With respect to a national policy response to the situation, Mr Liaquat Hussain emphasized the need to control emissions whether transport equipment related or industrial in nature. He advised that the control strategy should not be made at the cost of the economic activity; rather it should be a gradual process."

"Toilets, tourists and prosperity","The Sindh Governor, while chairing a meeting of the city and town Nazism on 28th November 2005, reportedly called for a massive cleanliness drive as part of a face-lifting programme for Karachi. He said Karachi should look cleaner, healthier and much more presentable than how it looked now./He added that ailments and diseases, generating from filth and dirt needed to be dealt with seriously and environment had to be improved for the better health of the people. He reportedly issued directives for putting up ""Welcome to Karachi"" sign right outside the terminal building of the Karachi Airport, and to arrange it with lighting so that a good impression could be given to incoming passengers of the metropolis./The city government might take measures for proper disposal of solid and municipal waste, cleaning sewerages and covering open drains, overcoming the menace of over-flowing gutter lines, reducing air pollution and adding sufficient number of new hygienic toilets to the existing small number scattered over the metropolis./Mr. Farooq Dawood, the other day in his letter to the Editor of a daily newspaper, wrote that any country or city which lacks in any one of the five Ts- good Teachers, Toilets, Traffic, Trees and Time consciousness- can not be considered to be in the comity of good nations. The Karachiites would immensely benefit if a serious, sustained and integrated campaign for cleanliness is successfully mounted./The sight of men squatting in full view to relieve themselves is not uncommon in Karachi or in other cities and towns. Places like open drains, isolated street corners, footpaths, playgrounds, abandoned parks, railway track or roads, bushes, etc. are soiled by the men when relieving themselves, ignoring all ethical and social norms and thus creating worst environmental pollution./Such ugly scenes are enacted even when women and children are passing by, seemingly oblivious of what is happening. As a civilized society, steps might be taken to save the women and the children at their tender age from indecent exposures due to open urination or defecation./Tourists and visitors walking into restaurants, hotels, mosques, offices, shopping malls, etc., are often disappointed to find dirty and smelly toilets, mostly in bad repair. Clean toilets on roadsides are rarity in the country for travellers who are going from one city to the other./While travelling or moving outdoors, there are hardly any decent washrooms or places to rest including at local bus stops, inter-city bus-terminals or even recreational places and tourist spots. The toilets there stink badly and often are found without running water. The attendant in the public toilets expects you to tip him/ her even though it's clear that neither he /she nor anybody else has ever properly cleaned the restroom. Toilets in mosque vicinities are a big relief, by serving as public toilets, though in most cases opened only in prayer hours./The defecation and passing of urine is a must for all living human beings and animals. All people normally indulge in such activity more than two times in a day, with or without making use of a proper toilet. The city or town people who are without proper homes and living on footpaths, in shops, make-shift dwellings or under-construction houses tend to relieve themselves in open if there are no public toilets in the vicinity. Besides, the shopkeepers, the shoppers and the visitors also need to occasionally visit a toilet when away from their businesses or homes./Lack of clean toilets at convenient locations forces the people to relieve themselves in odd places. Open defecation leads to unpleasant living conditions and is considered a significant contributory factor to the spread of potentially fatal diseases such as cholera, typhoid or dysentery./Clean toilets are a basic need of the people, be it a village, town or city in any country. Toilets are one of the means for ensuring cleanliness in any society. Therefore, the people should not shy away from talking about toilets. Cleanliness will come with availability of large number of clean toilets. Education of the people in the proper use of toilets can enhance cleanliness./Toilet hygiene is a public health issue. If the toilet is dirty or smelly, one tends to suppress urination or relieving oneself. Such suppressing over a period of time exposes oneself to a number of health hazards. Town planners, environment and hygiene experts and toilet designers can come up with affordable toilet designs to improve the toilet facilities within the cities and towns. Suitable designs can be duplicated in other places to improve the situation. Preparation of low cost latrines for the rural areas would certainly help./Tourists (and also foreign investors) want safe and clean mode of traffic; general cleanliness with clean and hygienic toilets; peaceful law and order situations, without fear of muggings or purse snatching in the streets or buses. Such ills of a society put off the tourists who would chose a different destination . Good toilets are expected to increase a lot of tourism coming into Pakistan. One million additional tourists, each tourist spending $500 during the visit, would contribution $500 million to the country's economy. It could be increased many times if the tourists consider Karachi/ Pakistan and attractive destination. Impact on local businesses, employment and earnings would be tremendous./Properly painted or whitewashed clean toilets with running water, soap, toilet paper and electric lighting are what the tourists want. It should not be a problem for a nation that professes the cleanliness to be half the faith. The toilets should meet the needs of the people- old men and women, the young and the handicapped. The women prefer toilets separate from the men./The Citizens Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) had initiated a plan to build public toilets in various parts of Karachi. In fact, many toilets were set up, but their number is small and is grossly inadequate for the city. There is severe shortage of public toilets in and around shopping areas and other public places frequently visited by families. May be the toilets originally shown in the design of such commercial buildings were never built. If at all the toilets were constructed, these may perhaps be later converted to stores or stalls for selling goods./The city government may ensure that all commercial buildings and shopping plazas have sufficient clean toilets available to the general pubic as per original design. In addition, the local authorities all over the country are expected to provide as a public service places of public convenience and toilets in the cities and towns particulars in and around shopping areas and public places./In old days, the municipalities used to build public toilets in and around shopping areas or tourist spots. With the increase in population, more shopping centres are being developed. However, instead of making adequate provision for clean public toilets, the existing public toilets have either been demolished to sell the site for commercial purposes or have been neglected and are functioning in dilapidated condition. The city governments around the country are supposed to take effective measures for providing this basic facility to the residents, visitors and the foreign tourists. Public toilets may be built with proper signboards in Urdu and English giving the exact location./The city government alone may not be able to easily provide clean toilets to the populace of Karachi or other cities and towns. Therefore, the city government might consider associating other stakeholders as well as small businesses in this endeavour. Other stakeholders such as KPT, PIA, Pakistan Steel, DHA, etc together with rich people can contribute in the construction and maintaining of the public toilets. In other cases, the city government might build the toilets and then lease out to private individuals to operate and maintain the clean toilets with the right to collect a small fee from the users of toilets. This should reduce shortage of clean toilets and also offer employment opportunities./Karachi has five recognised industrial estates besides sprinkling of industries here and there. To reduce air pollution the city government may have to devise a phased out plan for moving out major polluters. Other industries may be allowed to stay on, but must cut air pollution and disposal of untreated effluents. Clean public toilets are badly needed in all these industrial areas. The industrial estates may also build public toilets to help clean the environment. They can also build mega fair-price shops for the visitors and tourists./Internationally, the role of toilet in general cleanliness is gaining ground. November 19 was declared 'World Toilet Day' in 2001 by 17 toilet associations around the world. Since then there has been established an annual World Toilet Summit and many other regional conferences./Since 2001, World Toilet Day is said to have become a global platform for academics, sanitation experts, toilet designers, environmentalists, etc. to share the latest on rural and urban toilets. It has objectives such as coordinating and promoting sanitation issues, continuously generating awareness for good toilet environment, promoting creative development in the design for the betterment of health in general, propagating the need for better toilet standards and collating, publishing and disseminating information globally. Karachi might also consider taking initiative in this regard to improve its cleanliness image internationally."
A wedding in Mumbai,"A belated Eid Mubarak to you all. Sorry about last week's article, but Mumtaz and I were in Goa with a few friends from Karachi and I wrote this article while sitting in my hotel room balcony at the Taj Fort Aguada Beach Resort in Goa, overlooking the Indian ocean./We were there to attend the last stage of a unique and unusual wedding of Farah, daughter of Merengiz and Shahveer to Nikhil, son of Kumkum and Sandip Shah. Unique and unusual, because Farah is a beautiful, charming and vivacious young Parsi girl from Karachi and Niki a mischievous, but gentle young Hindu boy from Mumbai. The two had met while at college in USA, fell in love, decided to get married and had planned the wedding two years in advance./When Merengiz invited us to attend the wedding functions in Bombay and Goa, I was excited but a little apprehensive, as my left ankle was still swollen and sore from the recent operation and I was still using an elbow crutch. I was also not prepared to go through the hassle of getting an Indian visa and hotel bookings in Bombay and Goa in such a short time, especially during the peek season./However, Arshad Gillani came to the rescue and arranged our non-reporting Indian visas within a week and Sarfaraz of Connexons, Delhi, (highly recommended - /<a href=""mailto:connexons@vsnl.com"">connexons@vsnl.com</a>/), courtesy Ahmed Bayat, our hotel bookings and after some initial confusion, we left on 3rd January by the PIA flight for Mumbai./The first stage of this fabulous wedding had started in Karachi, with a welcome dinner, followed by a well-attended reception the next day at KPI, both very well organised by Anisa Rashid Khan. The second stage had been in Mumbai, where over 200 young and old friends and relatives of the couple and the parents had gathered from over 12 countries, stretching from the Americas to Europe, the Middle East and all the way down to Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand to attend the wedding./The Mumbai festivities started with a wild party at Zouk, the latest addition to the famous Squeeze nightclub. This was followed the next day by the couple taking their marriage vows at the Blue Sea Hall in Verlee, first in a Hindu ceremony, where the marriage vows were read out in Sanskrit around a fire by the Pandetjee and then translated into Hindi./The Zoroastrian ceremony followed next, also around the fire, as the flame is considered as a sacred symbol of God in both religions and the blessings were read in the ancient language of Zend Avesta. Both ceremonies were beautiful and unique and paid respect to their respective cultures and contained many symbolic similarities such as the sacredness of fire and sprinkling of rice over the fire for prosperity./Here were two young, brave persons who were in love and prepared to break old traditions, cultural and religious barriers and geographical borders and be united in holy matrimony, with the support and blessings of their parents, relatives and friends./After the wedding rituals, the guests were treated to a delicious variety of finger licking famous and popular Bombay Chats, pani puri, iteele dossas, wadaas, cholas, dhai barras and a delicious wedding cake and ice cream. On the third day there was a glittering party at the Grand Ballroom of the Grand Hyatt, where a jazz band from California had been flown in to entertain the guests./As there were so many visitors from around the world, I thought this would be an ideal opportunity to get the views of the young college kids who were visiting Bombay for the first time. I asked Rob, a young student from Harvard of his first impression of Bombay. ""It's seems to be an exciting, happening city with a pulse"". And this view was shared by most of the other youngsters./I was returning to Bombay, as it was known in the old days and also my birthplace, after almost 20 years and expected a lot of changes in the airport and the city, especially after being bombarded with the 'India Shining and Incredible India' advertisements on their TV channels, but I was disappointed./The airport building and the facilities were no match to our spanking Jinnah Airport and just as 20 years back, there were no carbon papers and arriving passengers had to fill up numerous forms separately. But the normal TV sets had been replaced with flat TV screens./The airport staff and custom officers, though not in uniform, were efficient and polite and everybody had to stay in line and wait their turn. They displayed a sense of purpose when performing their duties and there was no idle chatter and discipline was maintained and the No Smoking sign strictly enforced./And the scene outside the airport and in the city was as chaotic as before. The airport was full of arriving and departing passengers from all over the world. There were luggage trolleys, lines of travel agents and buses from different hotels, searching for their guests and swarms of yellow and black motor rickshaws and taxis, buzzing like bees, zigzagging through the traffic./Our Karachi airport might be cleaner, better organised, with smartly dressed custom officials, but some how they lack commitment to their duty and have an arrogant, laid back, indifferent attitude. They are seen sauntering and lounging around in little groups, smoking cigarettes under No Smoking signs and no discipline is maintained and passengers jostle and push to get to the immigration counters./Our city might have tree lined, wide boulevards, billboards of all sizes and shapes, piled on top of each other, offering a wide range of luxury products, but only three 5 star hotels, which would be considered 4 star in India, which are dull and gloomy, with a handful of foreign visitors who are afraid to step out of the hotel and with nowhere to go./Comparing Bombay to our Karachi, the entire scene reminded me of a bumper sticker that I had read in the back of an old and battered taxi-cab, being driven by just as old a driver in Darussalam, Tanzania, which simply read: 'I might be old and I might be slow, but I am still ahead of you'./And this is exactly what is happening in India. Bombay might be considered dirty, with un-repaired streets littered with building material, garbage, chaotic, bumper-to-bumper traffic, overcrowded, with over 0.5 million living on the streets of the city. The others in slums and abject poverty around the glittering buildings and posh 5 star hotels. They have become the invisible, economical backbone of India, working in unhygienic conditions and providing cheap labour to the booming leather and handicraft industry./There is no International protest or outcry and nor do the Indians apologise for ignoring the plight of these poor and homeless citizens that the city of Bombay seems to have forgotten. They seem to have become part of the ""Accepted Indian Culture."" But there is no denying, India is on the move. Stepping out of the airport one could feel the energy and the exciting, racing pulse of the city/However, there has been a considerable reduction in the beggars and in noise and air pollution, as the government has ordered all motor rickshaws and buses to be converted to CNG. The Indian economy and the tourist industry are booming and there are new buildings and shiny cars and it is just impossible to get a hotel room, despite the fact that there are over 200 three, four and five star hotels./The last and final stage of the wedding was set on the beaches of the Taj Village, Goa, with a post wedding reception, a magical setting and a beach party, but more of that next week."
The Law Foundation,"Before I write about The Law Foundation, I would like to thank my friends who have called and sent me emails about the procedure relating to my blocked arteries. Thanks to my son-in-law, Zia, who insisted that we should get a second opinion before we proceed and arranged an appointment with his cardiologist friend at the AKU, who suggested that I have an echo and a thallium test./The tests were carried out yesterday and I am happy to inform you that though the two main grafted arteries are blocked, secondary arteries are providing sufficient blood to the heart, thus reducing the risk of any heart attack./In other words, the main roads may be blocked due to VVIP movement, but you can still use the side roads to get to your destination, unless you happen to live in Karachi, where the police even block the side roads and the patient never reaches the hospital in time and unfortunately dies of a heart attack./Last week, The Law Foundation and Help line Trust had organised a seminar on the 'Enforcement of Law' and to launch the fortnight journal-'The Law'. The Chief Justice of Sindh High Court, Justice Sabihuddin Ahmad was the chief guest. The other speakers were Javaid A Siddiqui, Editor-in-Chief of The Law, Justice[r] Aslam Nasir Zahid, Chancellor Hamdard University, Justice[r] Shaiq Usmani and me./When Javaid, a senior lawyer of the Supreme and Sindh High Court, asked me to help him to launch the journal officially and to establish The Law Foundation, I was happy to do so and suggested that we also ask Shaiq Usmani to help us. I have always believed that the only way we can improve the quality of life of citizens is through good governance. And this can only be achieved by establishing the rule of law, accountability and a code of conduct in government and society and to achieve this we need a strong and independent judiciary./A panel of Trustees, consisting of members from the superior judiciary, senior lawyers and civil society will manage the Law Foundation. Its main objectives will be to help reform the judiciary and to 'Lend A Helping Hand' for access to justice to under privileged and deprived members of society, particularly to women and children, by providing them free legal aid./The Foundation will take up projects to help build strong and independent judiciary, help promote the rule of law, interact with the bar, the bench and civil society, file Public Interest Litigations and help develop confidence and respect for the judiciary. CJ Sabihuddin Ahmed of Sindh High Court had stated that the courts have no power to take suo moto action or cognisance and said it is for the legal fraternity and non-governmental organisations to agitate matters of public interest before them.""High courts can only act through someone's application and we have heard any person, even if not directly affected, on issues of public interest./Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid had said that access to justice was a fundamental right and the legal system could be used as an instrument to improve the quality of life of the citizens. He urged the judiciary to restore confidence in the judicial system and said there were at least 35 kinds of problems facing the citizens, including crime, law and order, pollution, violence against women, etc., that can be tackled by law./He said that recently 200 prisoners could not be produced before court on time because there was traffic jams in the city because of VVIP movement. He said that the government was claiming that Pakistan has achieved 7.4 percent growth, second in the world after China, but its benefits were not trickling down to common person and the lot of the citizens was just as bad./Justice Shaiq Usmani, a former SHC judge, said while the statute book was full of laws and legal remedies, but there was no enforcement and there was no rule of law in the country and people were facing various injustices.""The profession of law has grown up in an isolated society, which it does not serve. There was no remedy against police excesses and people have to undergo considerable sufferings before a court comes to their rescue.""/Former Sindh High Court bar Association president, Syed Sami Ahmed regretted that the judiciary had done little to promote the enforcement of rule of law. He said that the public wanted to live in peace, honour and safety, but the standard of the judiciary has been deteriorating day by day./I had been rather critical and had said that we have laws for almost everything under the sun, yet fail to observe or enforce the simplest of laws. The classic example being our traffic and no smoking laws, which are broken and ignored with impunity, even by the law enforcing agencies, VVIPs, those in govt and the educated and the privileged, who should be setting an example./I pointed out that the ongoing campaign against cars with tinted glasses has been launched several times in the past, but as the law is not enforced effectively or continuously, once the campaign is over or till such time as a VVIP or his son is stopped and the campaign suspended and it will be business as usual. The government was continuously issuing orders and directives against Honour Killings, observing traffic, food and drug laws, illegal buildings etc., but little attention was paid to their enforcement. Even court orders are sometime ignored, both by government and citizens./The Sindh High Court has ordered Jirgas as illegal, yet in spite of these orders, they continue, unabated, with the government officials topping the list, as its own ministers and chief ministers have presided over 197 Jirgas in the past five years. And the Sindh province has topped the list with 1,796 ""honour"" killings for the same period./In my opening remarks, I had spoken about what I had observed in Delhi and Mumbai and how the basic laws relating to traffic, noise, environment were respected and obeyed without having to be enforced and about the Suo Moto action taken by the Supreme Court against the rising level of pollution in these cities. However, the learned judges were quick to point out the shortcomings of the Indian judiciary and Justice Zahid informed the audience that according to statistics, it would take the Indian judiciary over 300 odd years to clear its back log, whereas in Pakistan there were only 1,50,000 cases pending in the courts./In the end I had to defend myself by announcing that I was not a RAW agent and not critical of our judiciary, but simply citing what I had observed in the Indian cities. I also appealed to the Hon. Chief Justice to come to the aid of the citizens of Karachi by taking up the issue of Consumer Protection and improving the quality of life of the citizens by initiating Suo Moto action for the enforcement of existing food, drug and traffic laws and taking action against the noise and air pollution and help restore this city of lights to its past glory.

Government fails to ban auto-rickshaws,"Sindh transport department has failed to implement the Supreme Courts orders to ban 2-stroke auto-rickshaw plying in the city. There are around 39,754 auto-rickshaws registered till November 30, 2005 and plying on the different roads in city and causing great amount of noise and air pollution. The Supreme Court had ordered to ban the auto-rickshaws to reduce the noise and air pollution, which were not only causing great danger for environment but also causing the increasing number of patients suffering from different diseases./The orders were issued on May 23, 2003 and notified the provincial governments to replace all two-stroke auto-rickshaws by four-stroke CNG rickshaws in phase-wise. The process should have started on January 1, 2006 and be completed before June 30, 2007. In this regard, the Provincial Transport Department had sent a letter to Chief Minister Sindh for the approval but the response had not been received./Recently, the City Nazim Syed Mustafa Kamal had stated that they had no intention to ban auto-rickshaws in the city as the female passengers feel safety to travel in them. People in general have reservations to stop auto-rickshaws as the majority of these vehicles using Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), which is more dangerous for passengers and causing great, smoke emission and noise. Sources in transport department of City government disclosed that the total number of auto-rickshaws plying in Karachi were more than 45000 including hundreds four-seaters running in different thickly populated areas like Malir, Shah Faisal Colony, Ranchhore Lines, Lines Area, Lea Market and other parts of the city. It is also mentioned that every day in Karachi around 400-450 vehicles getting registrations including auto-rickshaws."
"Air pollution, a constant hazard for health","The increasing air pollution in City is causing alarm among the medical professionals as this major health hazard has increased the incidence of various diseases that can even become fatal./The health impact of air pollution in this mega city is worsening asthma and coronary diseases, both in numbers and severity. Other health problems include a rise in chronic bronchitis and Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Inhaling air pollution is leading to reduce haemoglobin production. Eye and skin specialists have reported irritation in eyes and skin because of air pollution./One of the biggest sources of air pollution, the rickshaws and the noise pollution caused overall, by the Karachi Road traffic is causing an impact on central nervous system. Besides, the air pollution is causing damage to the lungs and is resulting in reduced IQ in children./According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates of 2002, more than 150,000 deaths are attributable to urban air pollution, in South Asia, two to five per cent of all deaths in developing countries are due to exposure to particulate./WHO mentions that Asthma is growing and there are 150 million asthmatics worldwide. Increase in traffic, indiscriminate refuse burning, old polluting fleets and low replacement rates are the causes of air pollution and need urgent attention. Governments and communities need to take immediate and effective steps to prevent such air pollution./According to an international agency on environment air pollution causes not only health but also economic concerns, property loss, impacts on agricultural production, disruption of air and land transportation and decline in tourist revenue./Tourists are not willing to come to places were the environment will be harmful. Keeping the above facts in mind, one can easily say that producing and allowing such air pollution as seen on the City Roads is a crime, which needs special attention by the govt and particularly the law enforcing agencies. So far, no concrete efforts are in sight. Environmental agencies and organisations seem helpless. It seems that their agenda begins and ends at holding seminars and sending letters of officials once or twice."
Indoor air pollution effecting human life,"Indoor air pollution is a major health risk that needs to be addressed immediately. The problem is evident in developing countries including Pakistan. Pneumonia, LBW, chronic bronchitis in children is example of this risk./Over two billion of the world's poorest people in developing countries rely on solid fuels including biomes, which led to indoor air pollution levels many times higher than developed world. According to WHO-Geneva IAP causes lung cancer, TB, cataract, cardiac problems etc in high-risk groups. According to them ways should be developed and evaluated for ensuring access of cleaner fuel for poor communities./Majority of the population in Pakistan lives in rural areas. These areas also have very high rates of infant and child mortality. Deaths from severe respiratory infections are among the most common causes of child mortality in the country. It is estimated that over 80 per cent of our population relies on traditional biomes fuels, such as wood, animal dung, crop residues, etc for cooking and heating purposes. This is a major risk factor underlying high incidence of pneumonia-related deaths in young children in Pakistan as well as in other developing countries./Household fuel is considered to be a dangerous source of indoor air pollution. Countries like India and Pakistan where traditional fuel like wood is used for cooking indoor air pollution is an unavoidable threat for the population. However, measures at government and community levels can be effective in producing alternate sources for cooking./Indoor environment needs to be changed including better ventilation, use of cleaner's fuels and working to improve user behavior in order to keep children away from smoke emitted from cooking. Experts dealing with this situation mention that impact of this smoke should be reduced as the pollution caused by it, both indoors and outdoors have the most effect on women and children./At community level NGOs and Gos both should work on intervention studies to find out a detailed impact of indoor air pollution and at the same time develop a plan of action on indoor air pollution in the future. Women and children in developing countries are the worst sufferers primarily due to their indoor involvement./In Pakistan, women are involved in biomes collection and combustion; therefore also inhale most of the poisonous chemicals present in the smoke. About 90 per cent of the rural and 50 per cent of urban population depend on biome fuels having awareness about precautions./Intervention studies should be undertaken on a larger scale to know the impact clearly. NGO's and academia institutions working on environment should also develop a plan of action on IAP to save the generations."
Call to grant status of university to DCET,"Dawood College of Engineering and Technology (DCET) Advisory committee responsible to oversee administrative and educational affairs of the college, Karachi on Saturday decided to extend request to the federal government for granting status of an engineering university to only federal engineering college of Sindh./It was decided in a meeting held at DCET presided by SM Qureshi who is also chairman of the Inspection and Evaluation Committee, Sindh Education Department includes a total of 11 members out of which 9 attended meeting. Talking to journalists DCET, Prof Engr Hyder Ali Khan said the members of the committee present during the meeting unanimously backed the decision. The college fulfils all major requirement needed for granting a college, status of a university including working of five departments, 10 acre land, proper students and teachers' ratio and pre-requisite number of science laboratories operating at the educational institution./He pointed out already 5 departments including electronics engineering, chemical engineering, metallurgical and material engineering, industrial engineering and management and architecture and planning are operating at the college since long./""We have 86 faculty which also includes doctors and masters in different engineering subjects to cater educational requirements of more than 1600 students of DCET besides availability of 10 acre land, five each at present college and Gulshan e Iqbal area which would help advance its cause to be granted status of a university"" he added./Prof. Hyder Ali Khan said some one year ago Higher Education Commission (HEC) allocated Rs. 197.26 million to the DECT, which was utilised in the head of strengthening of academic infra structure, improvement of existing laboratories and equip them with latest equipment and establishment of new ones./After completion of the construction work, the college would have total 40 modern laboratories with latest state of the art equipment, which would also help dispensation of quality practical training to students./To a query, he said that Brig, Javaid Iqbal, Jt. Education advisor training wing, federal education ministry who was also present during the meeting assured to take up the issue with the concerned authorities and present the bill in the national assembly to get approval from the parliament./He hoped that financial allocation of the DCET, which is currently Rs 47 million annually, after being granted status of a university would be enhanced three fold, which would help its produce PhDs, and post graduates engineers in different disciplines of engineering subjects./Of ordinances, campaigns and bans/Straight Talk/By Hamid Maker/Mr Mustafa Kamal, the young and proactive City Nazim is trying to restore Karachi to its past glory. Some of the positive steps that have been taken by his city government are the on going campaign against unauthorised and illegal billboards./President Gen. Musharraf had taken exception to the haphazard manner in which billboards have been piled on top of each other in every nook and corner of the city and are an eye sore and had ordered their removal. So far over 400 billboards in various parts of the city have been pulled down, including 4 illegal Shadi Halls and a restaurant./The general practice throughout the world is that jumbo-sized billboards are not allowed near busy traffic intersections, central islands and at turning of roads and streets, as they distract drivers and also block the vision of motorists and pose a danger to the lives of people./And according to law, the distance between billboards should be 400 feet, size should not exceed 60 by 20 feet, height should be uniform, poles should be painted in silver to prevent accidents, they should not be located near electric wires and qualified engineers should undertake their construction./A recent survey has shown that out of the 17,000 billboards, only 6,000 are legal and about 11,000 are illegal and unauthorised. Approximately 70% of the billboards are controlled by CDGK, the remaining are under the Air force, Army, CAA, Pakistan Railways and various cantonment boards. They are protected by those who install them, who in turn are supported by political party leaders or officials of the various town administrators, who are also involved in the land mafia./As there is no accountability, there is massive corruption in the department. According to DO, Hassan Naqvi, the other objective of the campaign is to bring transparency in the out-door advertising business by updating and computerising the record of all the billboards to minimise chances of corruption in the CDGK's taxes department and help increase revenue./The city of Karachi has been declared as one of the most polluted cities in the world. So last week, Sindh Governor Dr Ishrat ul Ibad Khan banned the manufacture, sale, use of polythene bags, ""as they are a source of nuisance and block the sewage system"", through an Ordinance./The ordinance states that no person shall manufacture sell or use black polythene bags, including the polythene bags below 30-micron thickness and size and offer any kind of eatable and non-eatable goods in such bags./According to the Ordinance, ""Any person who contravenes the provisions of the ordinance shall be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three months or with fine, which may extend to Rs. 50,000 or with both.""/Though this is very commendable, such ordinances and bans have been announced many times by past city governments, including Mr. Paracha, our former city commissioner, but could never be enforced or implemented, because it was impractical and created a law and order problem./However, one can only hope that the Ordinance will be presented and finally approved by the Sindh Assembly in the near future and does not meet the same sad fate as the Consumer Protection Ordinance Sindh, which the good Governor had also approved and signed on 12th August, 04, but is still on the Assembly shelves, forgotten and gathering dust and like so many past Ordinances, has died a natural death. As such, Sindh is still without a Consumer Protection Law./Another good, but failed campaign in enforcing the rule of law, was the campaign launched by the Karachi traffic police against the use of tinted glasses in cars. Though there had been reports of police highhandedness in some cases, the overall reaction from the public was very positive./However, our feudal and VIP culture forced the police to abandon the campaign when a Provincial Minister, who should be setting an example, felt he was above the law, objected and complained to the Home Minister that the police had dared to stop his car also. The police officers were reprimanded and the campaign was abruptly called off./Adding insult to injury, an advertisement in the newspapers by the Home Secretary Sindh has CAUTIONED USERS OF MOTOR VEHICLES that ""All car owners are informed that the use of tinted/dark glasses, pressure horns, revolving lights and personalised number plates on vehicles has been banned. A case would be registered against the violators under the law.""/On the same day, a news item carried the news, that while launching the model Islamabad Traffic Police, our PM instructed the police 'to end the menace of VIP culture by tacking the violators of traffic rules to task and not extend any favour to the influential'. What a joke./This attitude of ""one law for you and one law for me"" has made a mockery of our rule of law and destroyed our respect for it. One hopes that the Governor, to whose political party the concerned minister belonged to, will take heed of the PM's wishes and take appropriate action and restore the campaign and the public's respect for the laws of this/country./Then there was another news item, informing the public that the government of Sindh plans to ban all public transport vehicles from I. I. Chundrigar Road beginning 15th February, so as to ease the traffic congestion and commuters would be provided a shuttle service instead./It would seem that once again VIPs using the road must have complained about having to wait in traffic every day. And the police, in all its infinite wisdom, have decided to take the short cut at the expense of the ordinary citizens, by banning buses from using this main artery into the business area./Such a ban will create serious hardships for citizens working and living in the vicinity of this road and seems totally impractical. Some years back, Help line Trust and Mr. Omer Morio, former DIG Traffic, had tried to convert this road into a model road and had introduced traffic lanes to control and regulate the heavy traffic. The campaign had been very successful but unfortunately, once again, the traffic police on the DIG's transfer discontinued it. I suggest that instead of stopping commercial vehicles from using roads to solve traffic problems, traffic police must concentrate on enforcing traffic laws and the use of traffic lanes. What is also desperately needed to save this city from noise and air pollution is a ban on noise and smoke emitting vehicles. There is a haze of dust and poisonous carbon monoxide gas over the city, which is reaching dangerous levels./However, many bans and ordinances have come and gone, including the favourite and most popular ban on the manufacture and sale of gutka and manpuri. We had started a campaign against these sweet poisons 10 years back, when my friend, Dr. Mervyn Hossein, the dental surgeon, had sent us a report from the KU, which had clearly stated that certain brands of sweet suppari contained traces of addictives and even heroin./We had launched a joint campaign with the Pakistan Medical and Pakistan Dental Associations to eradicate this deadly menace and despite numerous bans, gutka and manpuri continue to be sold openly in the markets of Sindh. So much for our respect for Ordinances, campaigns and bans."
Committee formed to control air pollution,"City District Government Karachi has formed a 20-member high-level committee by the name of Clean Air Coordination Committee to take measures against increasing air pollution in Karachi. City Nazim, Syed Mustafa Kamal stated this while chairing a high-level meeting on Monday./He said the committee would have City Nazim as its Chairman, DCO Karachi as Co-Chairman. The other members are DG Karachi Mass Transit Cell and EDO Transport and Communication Badar Munir Ghauri, Suparco Director General, Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan Director General, Sindh Environment Protection Agency, Government of Sindh, Chairman Department of Environment Engineering, NED University, representative of Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, Dr Muazzam Ali Khan, University of Karachi, Chairman Urban Resource Centre, Arif Hassan, President Pakistan Environmental Assessment Association Dr Mirza Arshad Ali Baig, representative of Karachi Chambers of Commerce, DIG Traffic Police Karachi, Irshad Bukhari, Karachi Transport Ittehad; Arif Pervez of Air Quality Consultant; Ahmed Saeed of IUCN; District Officer PPD, Deputy Secretary Transport Department, Sindh; representative of Automobile Corporation of Pakistan and Deputy Director Karachi Mass Transit Cell./The Nazim said that the committee would work under the supervision of city government while the office of World Conservation Union as a secretariat. He further added that the committee would present its suggestions to draw a comprehensive Plan of Action to reduce the level of air pollution in the city. ""The citizens suffered in different diseases by the increasing air pollution and it should be reduce immediately,"" he said."
PMA concerned over rising ENT cases,"Pakistan Medical Association, Karachi has recorded its concern over the increasing number of cases of Ear, Noise and Throat (ENT), respiratory and Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) during hot weather in Karachi./People are taking very much cold items like cold water, cold drinks, ice cream and golaganda etc., which cause symptoms like sore throat, nasal obstruction, difficulty in swelling, headache, low/high grade fever etc. These are the symptom of diseases like tonsillitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, deviated nasal septum, common cold, nasal al1ergy etc, these symptoms aggravate due to huge air pollution./PMA, Karachi praise the government that they are following the order of the Sindh High Court and taking very positive steps to control the air and noise pollution in Karachi. Everybody should support Government to make Karachi pollution free city. People are advice to avoid drinking very cold (chilled) water and cold drink, sore thing, smoking. Golaganda should strictly be avoided as it contains unhygienic ice and artificial (industrial) colour, which is a carcinogen, causes cancer./During hot weather people are advised to take plenty of water at least 15-20 glass of water/ day. The cases of gastroenteritis are very common these hot days particularly in small children, which lead to death. People are advised to boil water before drinking."
Drive against smoke emitting vehicles stressed,"National Forum on Environment and Health has expressed its concern over halting drive against smoke emitting vehicles. The campaign was initiated on the orders of Sindh High Court. In a statement, NFEH said that full-fledged campaign was launched after the court orders but after few days, it was stopped due to unknown reasons. Its president, Naeem Qureshi said, ""Thousands of vehicles can be seen plying on roads, polluting the environment. The public should be provided alternate transport facility."" According to an estimate of NFEH, over 1.4 million vehicles are plying on city roads, which includes 0.7 million cars, 39,462 rickshaws, 54,795 motorcycles, 44,480 taxis, 20,462 minibuses, coaches, 4,550 trucks, trailers and 73,305 other vehicles. About 415 new vehicles are coming on roads, he added./Naeem Qureshi further said that these vehicles were emitting sulphur oxide, Nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and other chemicals injurious to human health, as they cause cancer, asthma, tuberculosis and other chest infections. According to a WHO estimate, about 0.8 million people in developing countries are dying due to air pollution, he added. He said that in Karachi, more than 40 years old vehicles are also plying on roads./Stopping the campaign on pressure of transporters is unjust with citizens, as these vehicles contribute 70 per cent of pollution in Karachi, which affected health of people badly. A regular campaign should be launched to end smoke emitting vehicles despite decorated campaign. Fitness process of such polluting vehicles should be strictly monitored and fitness responsibility should be handed to private sector. Use of CNG for public transport should be must, he demanded."
Asthma cases up by 50 percent in one decade,"Asthma cases have risen by 50 percent worldwide in the last 10 years and up to 10 percent of the population in Pakistan are estimated to be suffering from this disease./Dr Ali Bin Sarwar Zuberi, Assistant Prof, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Aga Khan University Hospital stated this here on Monday. He was speaking at a seminar on ""Latest Advancements in Management of Asthma"" held under the aegis of Aga Khan University Hospital's ""Signs, Symptoms and Care Program"" at the University./Referring to a recent international survey, he mentioned that approximately 300 million people worldwide have asthma, while cases are on the increase in Pakistan. Dr Zuberi said that asthma often begins in childhood, it can be contracted at any age and that the condition is more common and more severe in large cities like Karachi./He further explained that the disease is caused by a combination of inherited and environmental factors, which include indoor allergens such as those produced by house dust mites, cats, dogs and cockroaches, air pollution from road traffic and other factors like life-style changes, dietary habits and cigarette smoking, both active and passive./Dispelling certain misconceptions, Dr. Zuberi declared that inhalers are the safest method of delivery of medicines to asthma patients. In the question-and answer session that followed, Dr. Javed Ahmed Khan, Consultant Pulmonologist and Head, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at AKUH, reiterated that tobacco is responsible for over 100,000 deaths in Pakistan every year. Citing a WHO report, he disclosed that seven out of ten major causes of death globally are directly or indirectly associated with smoking./Responding to a question, Dr. Ahmed Suleman Haq, Assistant Professor and Consultant Chest Physician, said that asthma is one of the manifestations of respiratory allergic reaction, and a patient may suffer from breathing difficulty, wheezing or cough. He informed that a permanent cure for asthma is not currently available, but with proper medication usage, patients can live a normal life. Dr. Nisar Rao, Lecturer in Pulmonology at AKUH, responding to another question, stated that asthma cannot be contracted by personal contact or sharing of utensils./He urged doctors to educate their respective patients to provide maximum awareness of asthma and its management. As part of its outreach program and societal commitment to creating awareness of early diagnosis and timely treatment, AKUH has organised over 200 Signs, Symptoms and Care programs in Karachi, Hyderabad and the UAE, benefiting more than 40,000 people."
Smoke-emitting vehicles still on the roads,"Sindh High Court, which gave three months deadline to transporters to withdraw or replace the smoke-emitting vehicles from roads, expired here on Wednesday night. Shockingly, the transporters have defied the orders and no such defective vehicle has been withdrawn from the road. The Traffic Police during these three months have not taken any action against such violation. More than 30-year-old buses and worn out vehicles are plying fearlessly on main roads emitting smoke, which is harming the environment./The DIG Traffic, Falak Khurshid maintains that the campaign against such vehicles was in full swing. Appropriate action has been taken, he added. According to the details, the SHC had granted three-month extension and asked transporters to replace their old and unfit vehicles within the deadline. In case the orders were not obeyed then the punitive action would be taken against the violators. President Karachi Transport Ittehad Irshad Ahmed Bukhari said that the transporters are not in a position to replace the old fleet./He said that they have financial constraints. In fact, four or five small transporters purchase a bus or wagon in share taking loans from the individuals. No one has the capacity to pool in Rs 2 to 3 million at a time to purchase the buses. He lamented the attitude of the govt, which has not given any financial assistance. Unless, we get subsidised loans, we cannot purchase any new bus./He further said that:'we have all the respect for the court but we are helpless. As the public transport is the main source of commuting passengers and it is main source of our living, we have to ply the buses on the roads in any condition we have. However, we are spending a lot of money to upkeep the old buses'./'Due to the lack of govt interest, transporters are passing through a very hard time. We have very little resources to cope with the high number of problems as the govt is not supporting transporters to bring CNG friendly buses on the roads', he added. The traffic police have impounded over 300 buses/mini-buses. 'The apprehension of public transport vehicles had caused great hardship not only for commuters but also for transporters as these vehicles are only bread and butter for their families""/He demanded that government should extend the deadline and arrange alternate arrangements before impounding old and faulty vehicles. As per Motor Vehicle Ordinance, no vehicle in public transport could ply on the roads, which is 10-year old. However, the majority of the buses and mini-buses are old more then 30-years and causing great hardship to commuters./According to an estimate more than 100,000 vehicles consisting of buses, taxis, rickshaws are plying on the road. The Police Fitness Wing of the Traffic Department has notified about 30 per cent as unfit. The sources in Transport and Communication Department of City Government said that anti-smoke emitting campaign has also started in the past to reduce the pollution level in the City but due to the negligence of traffic police, the campaigns failed and the number of faulty vehicles increased./The sources further mentioned that the transport mafia threatened wheel-jam strike to blackmail the govt. The source also said that the Government of Sindh is considering to provide financial assistance to transporters while the City govt is also busy to bring over 8000 CNG buses in City to reduce the level but there are no chances in future to fulfil these promises./TRAFFIC POLICE/According to the sources in Traffic Police Department, there are only 3,500 persons to control the huge volume of around 1.5 million vehicles in the City. The govt have asked many times to increase the manpower but no one paying any heed towards the situation./VEHICLES/It is also mentioned that there are majority of the vehicles in public transport, which are over 30-year old, and plying in the City. While in the province of NWFP and Punjab they had banned the vehicles over 10-years but the decision was not implemented in Sindh as over 75 per cent of public transport vehicles including buses, mini-buses, coaches are the main source of transport creating air pollution in the City./There are hundreds of two-stroke (four-seater) rickshaws which are also plying in the slum areas which not only increasing the air contamination but the noise pollution also creating different type of diseases among the drivers as well as the residents of these areas. The areas where four-seater two-stroke rickshaw plying are Malir, Kalaboard, Korangi, Shah Faisal Colony, Jat Lane, Lines Area and Ranchhore Line./ILLEGAL STANDS/The people of Karachi are not only suffering by air and noise pollution but over 200 illegal stand in different parts of the City also creating hardships. The majority of the illegal stands located in slum areas where buses, mini-buses, coaches, taxis and rickshaws are parked and occupied the prime land besides parking their vehicles at area petrol stations./DISEASES CAUSED BY POLLUTION/According to the health experts, the smoke emitted by vehicles creating multiple diseases, which are also highly dangerous. The smokes consist of sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide while the lead and sulphur creating the asthma, cancer, bronchi, TB and ulcer among the people./It is worth mentioning that the noise pollution created by rickshaws have also caused hearing problem in the drivers as over 90 per cent of them have the hearing problem. The experts also mentioned that the people who travel in these vehicles also suffer high blood pressure, cardiovascular complications and tension. The health experts also demanded govt to ban these vehicles creating multiple diseases among the masses and introduce environmental-friendly CNG buses."
Environmental degradation,"Due to neglect over the years, Pakistani cities are facing multiple environmental degradation. Solid waste management, deteriorating air due to vehicular emissions, drinking water contamination, coastal area degradation, poor disposal of hospital waste, noise pollution, tree felling and mangrove destruction are just a few nightmares that the citizens are suffering./Karachi was once famous as a city of light & beauty, but over the years, due to neglect, lack of ownership by the Government & its stake holders and insufficient funding, this great city has depleted beyond recognition into vast slums, over flowing gutters, broken roads, un-checked crime, chaotic traffic and dangerous air and noise pollution./In addition, even though environmental laws and an Environmental Tribunal exist, the Sindh Environment Protection Department has failed to tackle the issue. The Environmental Tribunal (ET) was constituted in 1997 under Pakistan Environmental Protection Act and can take up cases of air and noise pollution, hazardous waste, oils spills and other environmental destruction./Jst. (r) Syed Abdur Rehman was appointed as the first chairman of the EPT, but could only hold one staff meeting of the body in 1999. Another Chairman -a senior special judge - held the tribunal's second meeting in October 2000. After that, no meetings have been held. During that period, neither was any case referred to EPT nor did it take any suo moto action on environmental issues./Millions of rupees have now been spent on its tribunal building and a few years back, a building was hired in the DHA by the law ministry to house the staff of the tribunal. But the tribunal's offices are still to be set up and according to information, at present the posts of the tribunal's Chairman and registrar were lying vacant and no one is sure as to who is now the present Chairman. Various campaigns have been launched by environment protection agencies, police departments and NGOs against rising air and noise pollution over the years, but it is still on the rise./According to recent reports by Suparco and the Economic Survey of Pakistan 2005-2006, air and water pollution levels in Karachi and Pakistani cities have crossed national and international environment quality standards and are the highest in the world and a serious threat to the lives of the residents of the cities./Both survey state that the smoke and dust particles, known as SPM, that cause lung diseases, are twice the world average and five times higher than those in industrial countries and have crossed the safe limits. They have warned the government to take immediate measures to check the deteriorating environment. Environment protection agencies, police departments and NGOs have launched various campaigns against rising air and noise pollution over the years; it is still on the rise./Even the Supreme Court had realized that auto-rickshaws, smoke-emitting and diesel-operated vehicles were major sources of the rising pollution in our cities and in 2003 had issued directives to the different provincial departments to take appropriate action. In addition, in March and April 06, Sindh High Court had directed the Sindh Government and CDGK to produce comprehensive reports to reduce pollution and to remove all smoke emitting vehicles from the road within 3 months, as has been done in Punjab. However, even these directives have not been implemented or enforced./There are about 78,000 auto-rickshaws, buses, minibuses, taxies, trucks and pickups in Karachi, majority of which are faulty. DIG Traffic had suggested a complete ban on the registration and issuance of route permits to old buses and two stroke auto rickshaws from 2006./Recently the government, through the traffic police, had launched an aggressive campaign to impose a ban on old public transport vehicles and two-stroke rickshaws, but had to call the campaign off because of lack of political will and pressure from the transporters. We are now told that two stroke vehicles will be banned after June 07./Rickshaw owners and drivers had expressed willingness of phasing out of the two-stroke rickshaws, to four-stroke vehicles using CNG for a pollution-free environment, if they were provided financial assistance from the government, as has been done in India and Bangladesh./In addition to emissions from transport, there are issues of solid waste management, disposal of medical, toxic, hospital waste, dumping of industrial and domestic effluent into the sea, smouldering garbage dumps, power plants, noise and air pollution, water contamination, discharge of gases and chemicals from industries, tree-felling, elimination of mangroves along coasts, etc. Our drinking water is unsafe, and our factories are continuously releasing harmful by-products and discharging various types of effluents in our rivers and sea while thousands of vehicles throughout the cities continuously emit smoke, but conviction of the offenders is still a far cry./Air pollution from vehicular emission can be contained at different levels by installation of pollution control devices and by switching over to cleaner fuel, modification in design and by phasing out obsolete technology./According to sources, the city government, in view of the alarming level of air pollution on roads, has drafted a set of action plans, which will be forwarded to the City Nazim and the provincial government for the implementation as soon as those are finalized, after getting inputs from all the stakeholders. The plan will envisage a ban on registration of more diesel buses and conversion of old public transport vehicles with CNG./Karachi needs integrated policies and approach for sustainable environmental development and enacting of laws and its effective implementation, otherwise the environment will continue to be damaged in life-threatening ways. Therefore, monitoring and regulating air pollution is now a must./We must protect our ecosystems and habitats from further degradation or we will force devastation upon ourselves. It is imperative that environmental issues must be fundamentally repositioned in the policy-making. Our government must ensure strict implementation of the National Environmental Quality Standards./As the court directives have not been followed, we are planning to file public interest litigation in the SHC and request concerned citizens who wish to assist us to contact Help line Trust, Tel.

"$ 570,000 POLLUTION PROJECT KICKS OFF","ISLAMABAD - The Ministry of Environment has okayed the execution of the project ""Capacity Building for Development and Implementation of Carbon Finance"" with the grant of worth $570US,000 to be completed by 2009. The project will help in minimising the element of carbon dioxide in air caused by vehicular smoke and hence resultantly we will be in better position to control air pollution, says a Press release issued here on Friday./Federal Minister for Environment Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat expressed these views in a meeting with six-member delegation of World Bank Carbon Financial Mission, which met him in his office on Friday. The delegation was led by Michel Pommier, Regional Carbon Finance Coordinator, World Bank. Besides; Carles Joseph Cormier, Senior Carbon Finance Specialist, Jeremy Levin, Consultant, and other members of the delegation were also present on the occasion. The delegation, which is on its visit to Pakistan, is discussing with senior officials about the public and private sector Carbon Finance opportunities under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) initiative of the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)./The Minister said that the project aiming at strengthening of institutional framework and enabling environment to promote public and private participation in the carbon market, will enhance capacities of local stakeholders in CDM project development and support CEDM project preparation and development in priority sectors, energy, waste management, industries, and agriculture. The Minister was informed that the project was proposed by the World Bank and the Ministry of Environment to Japan Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Technical Assistance Programme. /Faisal Saleh Hayat and that the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan and ratified in February 2005 (Pakistan is also a signatory) sets emission reduction targets for the developed countries to reduce their combined Green House Gas Emissions (GHGs) by 5.2% during the period 2008-2012./He said that the Protocol introduces three major market-based flexible mechanisms for the emissions reduction i.e. Joint implementation (JI), Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) and Clean Development Mechansism (CDM). Faisal saleh Hayt said the CDM as a carbon finance tool was introduced on special request of the developing countries to assist then in meeting their sustainable development objectives while at the same time contribution to the ultimate objective of the Kyoto Protocol./Under the CEM, developed countries have been asked to support CDM project activities that reduce GHG emissions in the developing countries in return for certified emission reductions (CERs), which can be used by developed countries as credits to meet their emission reduction targets under the Protocol. He said that first CDM project on Nitrouus Oxide abatement in Pak-Arab Fertilzer, Plant, Multan has been approved by the Ministry./About 15 other projects are under development. These include 5 run of river project in Punjab and similar projects in NWFP that are being developed by provincial governments in collaboration with Asian Development Bank. UK is working on 2 projects on generation of electricity from steam waste in textile plant in Karachi and Project on waste management composting in Gujranwala./The government has hired a UK based consulting firm to assist in developing CEM project on municipal solid waste management in 7 large cities. Agha Khan Rural Support Programme is working on hydro power CEM project in Northern Areas in collaboration with the World Bank. A number of investors are also working on wind power projects which could also qualify for CDM."
"SMOKE-FREE PLACES 89PC LESS POLLUTED, SAYS STUDY","KARACHI - A new global air quality study released on Friday shows that indoor air pollution is 89 percent lower in places that are smoke-free compared to those where smoking is allowed. The Flight Attendant Media Research Institute and the National Institute of Health funded the study conducted by researchers at the Roswell Park Caner Institute in Buffalo, New York, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Harvard School of Public Health./The study measured air pollution at 1,280 restaurants, bars, transportation outlets and other places in 24 countries, including Pakistan and Ireland and new Zealand where there are nationwide law making all indoor workplaces smoke-free. The study found that the lowest levels of indoor air pollution were found in smoke-free places across each type of place./Researchers tested 27 smoking free venues in Pakistan and found air pollution levels that are nearly six times higher than in smoke-free zones in Ireland. The findings underscore the need to assess and implement a comprehensive smoke-free workplace law in Pakistan. Researchers used state-of-the-art air monitors to measure the level of fine particles in air pollution, of which second-hand smoke is a major source. /The US Environment Protection Agency has found that these fine particles can penetrate deep into human lungs, causing serious lung, heart and other health condition. Conducted between 2003 and 2006, the study included the following countries in which smoking was still allowed at the time of the study: Armenia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Spain, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, UK, US, Uruguay, Venezuela and Vietnam./The study shows the need for the government to take measures in order to protect the health of citizens who are exposed to second hand smoke. Government as well as private organisations need to ensure that all workplaces, including restaurants and public transport, are smoke-free places. The study shows why leaders need to enact a strong smoke-free law that covers all workplaces, including restaurants, said Prof Javed Khan, the head of Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine of Aga Khan University. ""Every time we are exposed to second-hand smoke we are exposed to thousands of chemicals that cause cancer, heart disease and other serious respiratory conditions./None of us should have to put up with polluted air in order to earn a living or enjoy an evening meal in a restaurant. Our members of parliament should discuss the issue in the National Assembly and Senate and take appropriate measures to protect our right to breathe clean, smoke-free air.""/The international tobacco control treaty, the frame work Convention on Tobacco Control calls on the government to protect all people from exposure to tobacco smoke, rather than just specific populations such as children or pregnant women. According to the treaty, smoke-free places should include 'indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and other public places."" The treaty became international law on February 27, 2005. Pakistan has not only signed but also ratified this treaty last year."
FOGGY MATTERS,"Are we living under an umbrella of dangerous chemical pollutants in Lahore and Punjab's other cities? Why is it that Lahore and its adjoining areas witness a thick blanket of fog during winter season, with the mornings usually hazy and the evenings smoky with zero visibility? Only a decade or so virtually no fog was witnessed in the surroundings of Punjab. The mushrooming of industries, traffic congestion is creating havoc with the lives of the people of Punjab./ The smoke emitting factories and congestion are polluting the atmosphere of Punjab. The fog, which we are witnessing, is a mixture of smokes and dust particles in the air. Due to which we see a brownish-yellow hazy cloud. It is made up of harmful pollutants including gases and fine particulates./ This fog comes from many sources including/ 1. Gasoline and diesel vehicles / 2. Homes / 3. Industries / 4. Coal-fired power plants / 5. Pesticides and herbicides / 6. Oil-based paints, solvents and cleaners / 7. Wood burning fireplaces / 8. Road paving and construction / 9. Barbecues / 10. Gas and diesel powered lawnmowers / 11. Natural sources such as / forest fires and plant growth / Fog that has become mixed and polluted with smoke is a form of air pollution produced by the photochemical reaction of sunlight with hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that have been released into the atmosphere, especially by automotive emissions./ Listed below are the main pollutants that are involved in the formation of fog. / 1. Ground Level Ozone/ 2. Particulate Matter/ 3. Nitrogen Dioxide/ 4. Carbon Monoxide/ 5. Sulphur Dioxide/ The fog is based on six key air pollutants that can harm human health and the environment. The six pollutants are: sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, total reduced sulphur and particulate matter.  In countries where there is thick fog due to pollutants the concentration of the six pollutants is measured at different time but here in Pakistan hardly such measures are taken. */ Fog is a mixture of pollutants with ground-level ozone as the main component. Ground-level ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds interact in the presence of sunlight. High up in the stratosphere, ozone protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays, but at ground level, it can be a harmful air pollutant./ About 95 per cent of nitrogen oxides that lead to the formation of fog, are produced when we burn fuels in our cars and trucks, or generate energy using combustion engines, combustion turbines, industrial boilers and power plants. Nitrogen oxides are related to other atmospheric problems such as climate changes and acid rain./ Volatile organic compounds are also necessary to produce fog. They come from the evaporation of liquid solvents and fuels such as gasoline or barbecue starter fluid, and from oil-based paint. On hot and sunny summer days, stagnant air can trap pollutants and, when combined with sunlight, result in unacceptable levels of ground-level ozone. Since ground-level ozone concentrations are generally highest when the sun's intensity is at its maximum, fog levels peak in mid-afternoon, and fall rapidly in the evening when the sun goes down. The pollutants build up over time, so anything people can do to reduce individual contributions to fog is beneficial to air quality, not only on high pollution days,/ but every day./ Most of the ground-level ozone comes from the contribution of long-range transport of pollutants from the industrial areas in Lahore. Also, weather conditions and patterns in the regions to the surrounding areas can also affect ground-level ozone concentrations. Therefore acceptable fog levels can be exceeded in cloudy, as well as sunny weather, with an equal number of accidences occurring both during the day and night"
GOVERNMENT LAGS BEHIND SCHEDULE ,"LAHORE - The government is lagging far behind the schedule of phasing out polluting vehicles from the City, reducing the chances of elimination of diesel buses and two-stroke rickshaws by December 2007. Absence of political will and lack of coordination among different government departments and stakeholders is creating obstacles in the implementation of Lahore High Court order regarding phasing out polluting vehicles from the City./ Though the City District Government has devised a phase out plan for the most polluting three wheelers, started its implementation by banning entry of two-stroke rickshaws on The Mall on April 16, 2006, there is no forward movement after that, making it really difficult to implement the court decision in letter and spirit.  The government has not devised any strategy to encourage buses with cleaner fuel as no CNG station of enhanced capacity is seen anywhere in the City to facilitate filling of big buses./ Environmentalists and general public believe that the government is not serious in replacing the diesel buses and two-stroke rickshaws with the ones with CNG fuel. They say that lack of plan to encourage installation of required CNG stations and deviation from the phase out plan for two-stroke motorcycle and auto rickshaws speaks volume about the sincerity of the government in getting rid of polluting vehicles and making the environment pollution free./ The CDG had made action plan for phasing out the pollution-spreading three wheelers from the City with all the fanfare but there is no progress after the banning of the entry of two-stroke rickshaws on The Mall in the second quarter of the current year. The CDG banned the entry of two-stroke rickshaws on The Mall from April 17, 2006. As per schedule, Jail Road was to be added in the list of banned roads for two-stroke rickshaws from July 17, 2006 and Main Boulevard Gulberg from October 16 but it did not happen. Chances of adding Canal Bank Road in the list from January 17, 2007 are remote. / As per phase out plan, Allama lqbal Road is to be added in the list of banned roads from April 16, 2007, Ferozepur Road from July 16, 2007, Multan Road from September 17, 2007, Old GT Road from October 16, 2007, Ravi Road and Circular Road from November 19, 2007 while the entire City will be banned for two-stroke rickshaws from December 20, 2007. / Environmentalists and general public believe that deviation from the phase out plan clearly indicate that the government will fail to eliminate polluting vehicles from the City by December 2007.  The sources revealed that the phase out plan was not implemented, as the District Nazim was not satisfied with the quality of newly introduced CNG rickshaws. They say that the District Nazim wants to keep the plan pending till the introduction of quality three wheeler. / According to the official figures, there are more than 50,000 auto rickshaws plying on the City roads. Out of these rickshaws, 20,000 three-wheelers are operating illegally as no route permit has been renewed following the imposition of ban on the manufacturing, sale and registration of two-stroke rickshaws by the Punjab government on December 31, 2004./ Besides contributing 60-70 per cent of the air pollution in Lahore, two stroke rickshaws are the main source of noise pollution. The three-wheelers powered with two-stroke engine, exhaust excessive smoke, emit un-burnt hydrocarbons and generate noise to the uncomfortable level. Usage of substandard lubricant and its direct mixing with gasoline has made the two-stroke rickshaws the worst enemy of the environment./ The manufacturers recommend usage of lubricant up to two per cent but the rickshaw / drivers enhance the quantity up to 12 per cent for smooth driving. The drivers remove mufflers to accommodate emission of un-burnt lubricants that ultimately enhance noise pollution.  District Coordination Officer Mian Muhammad Ijaz said the CDG would go ahead with its plan of phasing out two-stroke rickshaws till December 2007. / ""CDG will implement the LHC decision in letter and spirit. It will utilise all the available resources for phasing out polluting vehicles from the City by December 2007,"" he said. / Coordinator Lahore Clean Air Commission Mansoor Ali Shah said the LCAC would keep a close eye on the process of phasing out polluting vehicles from the City by December 2007./ ""Court has constituted a four member special committee to monitor the working of the government in implementing the decision. Committee will submit monthly report to the court about the progress of the government. Committee will facilitate the work of the government and gave due consideration to the genuine constraints,"" he said adding that the committee would file contempt petition if the government try to delay the implementation without any sound reason."
DONORS OFFER HELP IN SETTING STANDARD FOR 4-STROKE RICKSHAWS,"LAHORE - Donor agencies have offered assistance to set standard for four-stroke CNG rickshaws-longstanding issue that has been creating hurdles in phasing out polluting vehicles from the city./ World Bank and Asian Development Bank extended offer of sending experts to Pakistan to evaluate quality of locally manufactured CNG rickshaws and to set standards for such three wheelers suitable for local environment, on the sideline of Better Air Quality Workshop (BAQ-2006) held in Yogyakarta (Indonesia) in mid December./ The participants from Pakistan told the representatives of donor agencies that major hurdle in replacing the polluting three wheelers with CNG rickshaws was that the drivers were reluctant to replace their vehicles due to low quality of available environment friendly three wheelers./ The representatives of donor agencies readily accepted the request and offered to provide free of cost assistance to remove the major hurdle in phasing out two-stroke auto rickshaws from the city till December 2007. According to the government officials, there was no set standard for CNG rickshaws in the country and all the manufacturers were using different but old technologies./ ""Standard of CNG rickshaws varies from company to company. All nine manufacturers are using different but old technologies. There are several complaints of less power and non-durability of CNG rickshaws. Parts of CNG rickshaws are more costly as compared to those of two stroke rickshaws. The reason is that there is no set standard for four stroke CNG rickshaws"", said a participant of BAQ 2006 from Pakistan. / Sources say that the District Nazim is also not satisfied with the quality of newly introduced CNG rickshaws and wants to keep the phase out plan pending till the introduction of quality three wheelers. Justice Syed Hamid Ali Shah, in 27-page judgement on a writ petition filed in 1997 by the city residents against the increasing air pollution, directed Punjab Government to phase out existing buses, wagons, motorcab/ autocab rickshaws and diesel buses by the end of 2007./ The court had earlier constituted Lahore Clean Air Commission in 2003, requiring it to study and analyse the increasing problems of vehicular air pollution and to formulate a solution. In the light of recommendations, submitted by the commission, the court directed departments and authorities concerned, including EPA (Federal), Transport Department, EPD (Punjab) and City District Government to strictly implement the directions./ The LHC had directed the introduction of new four-stroke CNG rickshaws and phase out the existing rickshaws from Lahore by December 2007. CDG devised a phase out plan for two stroke rickshaws, got its approval from LHC and started its implementation by banning entry of polluting three wheelers on The Mall on April 17, 2006. Since then there is no further movement due to lesser than the required number of environment friendly three wheelers on roads. / As per schedule, Jail Road was to be added in the list of banned roads for two-stroke rickshaws from July 17, 2006 and Main Boulevard Gulberg from October 16 but it did not happen. Chances of adding Canal Bank Road in the list from January 17, 2007 are remote./ As per phase-out plan, Allama Iqbal Road is to be added in the list of banned roads from April 16, 2007, Firozpur Road from July 16, 2007, Multan Road from September 17, 2007, Old GT Road from October 16, 2007, Ravi Road and Circular Road from November 19, 2007 while the entire City will be banned for two-stroke rickshaws by December 20 2007./ Environmentalists and general public believe that deviation from the phase out plan clearly indicates that the government will fail to eliminate polluting vehicles from the City by December 2007.

"POLLUTION MAJOR CAUSE OF CANCER, NERVOUS DISORDERS: DR RANA","LAHORE - Pollution is becoming a major cause of cancer and nervous disorders in the country, Dr Nasruallah Rana, an ENT surgeon, has said.  He was talking to The Nation in an interactive discussion in which Lahore High Court Bar Association President Israrul Haq Mian, Vice President Rana Zahid and a human rights activist Liaquat Ali Qureshi also participated./ He said situation had already touched an alarming point and any further delay to arrest it might cost heavily to the society, adding the government should frame a strict legislation to check rise of pollution and save human lives. In view of Dr Rana, chemical pollution and noise pollution, apart from smoking, were badly affecting human lives./ ""A common man thinks air pollution like smoke emitting from vehicles or coming through the chimneys is dangerous but the fact is noise pollution is more dangerous than air pollution because it directly affects our nervous system and audibility,"" Dr Rana said. / In addition to the noise produced by vehicles and industrial machinery, noise pollution / was also being shared by the gadgets now fall in household use, he added./ He said cell phones were hugely contributing to the noise pollution and their excessive use was proving highly dangerous, adding an aimless long talk on cell phone be avoided, as it affected the nervous system causing irritation, short-temperedness, deafness and other mental disorders. / Explaining the biological effects of the excessive use of mobile phones, he said, the sensitive parts of the human ear were capable of accepting and working on a specific acoustic frequency, but their system got impaired when the level of frequency exceeded the normal limit through this electromagnetic device. / This, in fact, affected loudness and resulted in deafness, he added.  The level of chemical pollution, he said, was going up unabated by the vehicular smoke which contained carbon and lead which caused blood-pressure, cancer of nose, throat, gall bladder and breast. / He said pollution had increased to such an extent that even a person sitting in his drawing room was not safe from its effects. / He said air pollution could be curtailed by converting vehicles, particularly heavy ones, to CNG as it had been done in New Delhi under a Supreme Court decision.  ""We need to deal with pollution on emergency footings if we have to develop our society on healthy lines. And for that we must create public awareness and frame strict laws,"" he said./ Israrul Haq and Rana Zahid expressing similar views said that law on controlling pollution was not being implemented in letter and spirit. / Israr said in old areas of the city, pollution had reached to peak but nobody ever bothered  to take steps against it. He said at present about one million wheelers on city roads were emitting smoke and creating noise but the authorities hardly came up with any plan to deal with this menace.  He said road capacity in the city was far shorter than the traffic load and the government must note this fact before putting more load on to the roads./ He said there was a law which prohibited smoking on public places was but it was being openly violated and nothing was being done by the government to implement it. / In other countries he said instruments were available to measure level of noise pollution but Pakistan did not have any to assess how much damage this problem had done to the society.  Liaquat Qureshi stressed setting up of an effective system to implement the environment law, as at the international level this practice had proved very effective to control pollution.  He said a subject on the hazards of pollution in school syllabus should be included"
PUBLIC TRANSPORT ISSUE REMAIN UNRESOLVED ,"Karachi :  The lingering problems of public transport in Karachi, notwithstanding rosy statements of rulers issued now and then, today is where it was years ago, and no hope is on the horizon, as the rulers seemed not yet ready to give this pressing social, economic and human issue a proper place on the list of their priorities. / It has now become a set pattern that when the baffled Karachi cites raise their concern over this issue, the rulers pacify them with lollipops of the complete and early revival of Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) and 8000 new wide-bodies CNG buses. Years come and go, but the promises of the KCR revival and CNG buses are yet to be fulfilled. One could only salute the Karachiites for their 'very deep' cup of patience, as well as, their naivete./ During morning and evening rush times daily, millions of these patient, tolerant and brave Karachiites travel in shabby, overcrowded, painfully slow and dangerously fast buses and minibuses to reach their workplace or homes in a very pathetic and rather outrageous manner - stuffed in them like sheep and goat or travelling on their foot-boards and roofs by risking their precious lives. / To help ending their plights the former city government administration of Naimatullah Khan Advocate in 2001 introduced Urban Transport System (UTS) system in Karachi, and Green Buses and some other private companies plied some CNG-run wide-bodied buses. It is said that Naimatullah Khan had envisaged bringing some 10,000 environment-friendly CNG buses in Karachi in two phases, besides a plan to convert half of existing city buses on CNG. / He had also offered special incentives like CNG at half the price of diesel, sales and import duty exemptions and concessions for installing CNG refuelling stations. / He had successfully persuaded the federal government to waive off import duty and sales taxes on the import of these buses as a special case.  However, despite such ambitious plans, in practice some 300 CNG buses were brought on Karachi roads in era of Naimatullah Khan Advocate. / These include UTS and Karachi Public Transport Scheme (KPTS) buses include 32 AC long buses of Sweden Bus Company, 28 AC buses of Green Bus Company, 30 non-AC buses of World Wide Enterprises, 30 non-AC buses of Allied Bus Service, 28 non-AC buses of the Green Bus Company and 197 non-AC buses of Metro Bus Service./ Naimatullah Khan was hopeful that he would complete his plan regarding revamping his second tenure, but he was not lucky enough to see the second term in the CDGK. When he left his Civic Centre office, his public transport plans also went to the cold storage./ The new city Nazim Syed Mustafa Kamal also saw solution to the public transport problems in the wide-bodied CNG buses and said that his administration would introduce 8000 new CNG buses in five years to gradually phase out of worn-out buses from the city. According to his plan, the first tranche of these 8,000 new CNG buses had to reach Karachi by December 2006./ However, the year 2006 passed without seeing any of the promised CNG bus, and for the year 2007 there is even not even a tentative date for the first tranche.  There is a ray of hope that a South Korea bus maker is setting up an assembling plant in Karachi, but when it would be finalized and began rolling out production no one knows./ The progress on the revival of KCR, a mega rail-based urban public transport system for this seventh largest city of the world, also seemed painfully slow. It is a pity that though this ambitious project launched as back as 1969, it abruptly closed in 1999, and since them its fate hangs in balance. Three years back in 2004 President General Musharraf had ordered the revival of KCR within a period of two years, but despite passage of three years it still seemed in limbo. / Though it is now said that Japanese investors are keen to invest in this project and the government had also given green light, but to the dismay of Karachi commuters the physical work on this very vital rail-based urban project is yet to be initiated./ Many Karachiites see no hope in early future for the revival of the KCR or introduction of the CNG buses, as ruling quarters, notwithstanding their rosy statements, seemed not keen to take on these issues. / There is no concept of a urban city without a matching urban public transport system. / It is interesting that the basic theme of a majority of statements of Karachi-based rulers is that Karachi has not only joined the club of modern and developed urban cities, but it is becoming a regional hub of trade and commercial activities. One is at loss to understand how a city having inefficient and obsolete mode of public transport could be termed as a modern urban city. / The public transport sector of Karachi since long has been a victim of ostrich policies of successive administrations. Sadly the present one also seemed following their suit. The policymakers are forgetting the basic point that they could not get rid of pressing issues by putting them off, because these issues only get complicated and aggravated with deferral, and in later stages like chronic diseases are hard to cure. / To solve the chronic issue of public transport in Karachi, our policymakers instead of ostrich policies of avoidance, deferral and ignorance need courage, innovation and strong political will. Public, however patient and naive it may be, could be hoodwinked too long. Rosy statements and promises have also their limits, and they lack charm and appeal if repeated for too long. / There is a need of out of the box thinking. Time is crucial, as we have already wasted decades. It is the result of prolonged delaying, avoidance and ostrich policies that the mega city of Karachi yet lacks a matching urban public transport system.  The issue of public transport is in fact a very sensitive issue, as in past the citizens had paid a heavy price for ignorance of this issue by rulers. Karachiites still remember the 'transport riots' of 1986, when a female student Bushra Zaidi had died after falling from an overcrowded public transport vehicle. Ironically after two decade of that nightmarish incident, the condition of public transport system is still the same and any sad road mishap could spark same transport riots in the city anytime./ The public transport sector of Karachi could hardly be improved till the bureaucracy realizes the urgency of this issue. Studies and long-term planning with costly foreign loans, which our future generations have to pay, may be good, but they could not mitigate the immediate sufferings of Karachi commuters. / The immediate relief could be provide to commuters of this mega city with immediate, solid and non-nonsense efforts to revive the KCR at fast pace, and early introduction of the promised CNG buses that are not only necessary to facilitate commuters, but to fight dangerous air pollution that Karachiites are facing thanks to the army of shabby, old smoke-emitting public transport in this most developed city of country."
"CORRUPTION, POLLUTION JOIN HANDS","ISLAMABAD - Industrialists and environment protectors have joined hands to play havoc with the health of citizens by indulging in illegal, corrupt practices, TheNation learnt on Tuesday. All steel mills of Islamabad, in collusion with the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PEPA), are emitting untreated smoke, in order to save electricity charges. And if at all they run the installed anti-pollution devices they do so only when the PEPA plans to visit them. / A reliable source revealed that PEPA normally informs the concerned industry in advance before an inspection so that industry gets ready and presents as if everything is  in order.  When contacted Asif Shujah, Director PEPA, admitted that before the visit, his agency informs the industrialists because of what he called “security reasons”.  However he hastened to say that sometimes surprise visits are also conducted. / The PEPA issued notices to 8 steel mills in Islamabad to install pollution control devices. Six mills responded to the notices but Modern Engineering Re-rolling Industry and Pothohar Steel Industry did not. The process of installation of anti-pollution device in Modern Engineering Re-rolling Industry and Mill is very slow as the Supreme Court asked them to stop production till the installation of the required gadgets to control the environmentally hazardous emission./ After ignoring several notices issued by PEPA, Supreme Court took action and stopped the functioning of both the mills on February 12. On March 5, PEPA conducted a monitoring visit to check the air pollution devices installed recently. Global Environmental Lab also took the samples and would give the results after three days and PEPA will finally make any decision on the basis of these results. / PEPA sources told TheNation that site and scrap at Modern Re-rolling Industry were neat and clean and their anti-pollution device was effectively functioning. They said, “apparently the situation was satisfactory but after the Global Environmental Lab report we will take final decision whether or not the mill should run. The mill will remain under observation for the next six months and our two inspectors will visit it twice a day”./ Talking about the Pothohar Steel Industry the sources said, “ Its anti-pollution device is not effective and generates smoke. Fuel and oil filters were found in their scraps. / The situation was unsatisfactory so we issued them directions for test running of their plant for three days to rectify the shortcomings of the device. On March 9, we will again make a visit. We also asked them to improve the quality of scraps.”  They said that Zia Steel Mill is also delaying the installation of anti- pollution device so “we are planning to take action against it.”/ The sources further said that the waste and polluted water, the main source of diseases, is also a big problem for the environment of Islamabad but PEPA and other quarters concerned are completely ignoring the issue."
PUBLIC EXPOSES EIA AS EYEWASH,"LAHORE - The environmentalists, important stakeholders and opinion leaders on Wednesday termed the EIA report on 'Remodelling of Canal Bank Road from Dharampura to Thokar Niaz Baig' as incomplete which according to them provide no solid justification to carry out the project. The environmentalists at the public hearing jointly organised here at a local hotel by EPD and TEPA put to sword EIA report prepared by NESPAK, providing basis for the execution of the project of widening of Canal Bank Road that involves cutting of thousands of trees./ Most speakers said that TEPA has failed in managing traffic in the city and is trying to hide its inefficiency by introducing such projects, which require cutting of thousands of precious trees. Hundreds of people including a good number of students from various educational institutions and representatives of different NGOs came to attend the hearing. The host of the public hearing was not expecting such a big turn out on the part of the general public, difficult to accommodate at the venue. / The turn out was so huge that the organisers had to ask the hotel management to stop more entries into the hall, causing a mess in and outside the hall with people started shouting and chanting anti government slogans. Later, another portion of the hall was opened and people were allowed to enter. The people stopped from joining the debate later alleged that TEPA did not want the real stakeholders to participate in the discourse and as such TEPA officials arranged the public hearing in such a small place./ After the presentation on the EIA report by the NESPAK representative, the more blazing debate started with general public raising objections against the proposed project. Former IG Police Syed Salman Khaliq said TEPA's vision of development can easily be gauged from the fact that it is the only organisation in the world which planned underpasses on canal bank road on both left and right sides. He said over 2500 trees have been removed for these projects but without any compensation in the shape of new plantation./ He commented that the entire city was filled with smoke while the governments' tree plantation could only be seen on papers, banners and posters. He said that easy loans for car were responsible for increase in vehicles on city roads. He stressed upon the need for efficient public transport and establishment of Light Rail Transit System instead of changing the landscape of the city. He urged the authorities to introduce traffic management system instead of widening the roads by cutting precious trees. / He alleged the project was designed to serve certain vested interests. He quizzed as to what the TEPA would do if the traffic increased after five years of completion of this project. Renowned lawyer Mansoor Ali Shah questioned the legal status of the EIA report. He said the NESPAK made mockery of the  EIA report, being the designer of the project. ""How could it find holes in its own designed project"" he quizzed o this occasion. He said the project was to be executed by the Punjab government and as such its EIA should have been done by the federal EPD to ensure transparency and neutrality. / He claimed that over 30,000 trees would be cut down in this project, terming the figures presented by NESPAK as fake and fabricated. He alleged that NESPAK did not calculate the trees during the study and rely on the data given to them by TEPA. He further alleged that the baseline data presented to the public was too fabricated and factually wrong, as the NESPAK did not mention the real impact of this project on the inhabitants. He urged the authorities to look for alternative ways or more innovative ideas instead of going for this project. He said that these days widening of roads across the globe was being discouraged./ Representative of the WWF-Pakistan Hamad Naqi said that the project description was lacking in essential detail. He said that the alternatives mentioned in the EIA report are poorly described without giving sound basis as to why they were being dropped. He said that the tree inventory data provided in the EIA report was also contradictory to the WWF-Pakistan study./ ""The EIA report failed to take into account important issues to be dealt while it does not fulfil the minimum standards and requirements of a report which should be prepared in case of such a big project. EPD Punjab should reject the report and ask the consultant to resubmit it anew while addressing all important environmental issues and reservations voiced here"", Hamad Naqi commented./ Representatives of different NGOs including Lahore Bachao Tehreek said that the EIA report is inadequate and technically incorrect. The EIA does not establish the justification of the project. They said that damage done to the environment and to human life is not acceptable to them at any condition which this project has the potential to cause./ On this occasion they made several pinching and thought-provoking questions to the authorities such as who conducted this EIA, what are their qualifications, where are the projections for qualitative and quantitative impacts once the project is operational. They also proposed a traffic management strategy, which includes ban on trucks, tractors, rickshaws and carts on Canal Bank Road, as well as cyclists to use service lanes, provision of bus bays, increase of buses for public and speed limit./ They said sampling procedure was flawed as it only carried out for 24 hours and so not reliable.. They said air pollution would increase after cutting of trees, only to be compounded by the increase in traffic on the road, affecting the health of millions of people."
2-STROKE AUTO RICKSHAWS BANNED FROM 3 MORE ROADS," LAHORE - Following ban on the entry of two stroke auto rickshaws on The Mall, City District Government has decided to enforce similar embargo on three more roads from May 20 while in a more pronounced development the entire DHA has also been declared as a no-go area for these dreaded and polluting three-wheelers. The roads that are to be prohibited for these rickshaws are Jail Road which is a major artery, Sherpao Bridge to Old Airport and Aziz Bhatti Road-from Mian Mir Bridge to Mehfooz Pura Chowk. One-month notice to this effect will be issued on Thursday (today). / Sources informed The Nation that as the DHA, portion of road-from Sherpao Bridge to Old Airport and Aziz Bhatti Road did not fall in the jurisdiction of the CDG, the concerned quarters had been taken into confidence before banning the entry of two stroke rickshaws in these areas from May 20. The CDG is already behind the schedule in phasing out polluting vehicles from the city. As such other major roads will be included in the list of prohibited areas for such vehicles one month after the ban to the entry of two stroke rickshaws on Jail Road, other two roads and in DHA takes effect. / The CDG banned the entry of two stroke rickshaws on The Mall on April 17, 2006. / As per the phase out plan, Jail Road was be added in the list of banned roads for two stroke rickshaws from July 17, 2006, Main Boulevard Gulberg from October 16, Canal Bank Road from January 17, 2007 and Allama lqbal Road from April 16, 2007. But it did not happen due to lesser production of four stroke CNG fitted rickshaws. Now about 2400 CNG rickshaws are plying on city roads which prompted the CDG to go ahead with its action plan of phasing out polluting vehicles from the city. / ""More than 2400 CNG rickshaws are now plying on city roads. Nine companies are manufacturing environment friendly CNG rickshaws. Two more companies have filed applications for getting permission to manufacture four stroke CNG rickshaws"", said District Officer Environment Tariq Zaman Khan, adding, the availability of required number of CNG rickshaws would make the job of getting rid of polluting three wheelers till December 2007 much easier. / As per the schedule, Ferozepur Road is to be added in the list of banned roads for polluting three wheelers from July 16, 2007, Multan Road from September 17, 2007, Old GT Road from October 16, 2007, Ravi Road and Circular Road from November 19, 2007 while the entire city is to be banned for two stroke rickshaws from December 20, 2007./ According to the official figures, there are more than 50,000 auto rickshaws plying on the city roads. Out of these rickshaws, 20,000 three wheelers are operating illegally./ Besides contributing 60-70 percent of the air pollution in Lahore, two stroke rickshaws are the main source of noise pollution. The three wheelers powered with two-stroke engine, exhaust excessive smoke, emit un-burnt hydrocarbons and generate noise to the uncomfortable level. The manufacturers recommend usage of lubricant up to two per cent but the rickshaw drivers enhance the quantity up to 12 percent for smooth driving. Previously, the CDG had banned the entry of auto and motorcycle rickshaws on six major city roads from February 1, 2006 but the decision could not be implemented due to lack of coordination among different departments. Later, the auto rickshaws were excluded from the banned list and entry of motorcycle rickshaws only was prohibited on seven major city roads./ The steps on the part of CDG high ups show their aim to get rid of polluting three wheelers and making the environment free of noise and air pollution."
AIR POLLUTION AFFECTS OZONE LAYER ABOVE CITY,"KARACHI - The Ozone (O3 ppb) layer in various parts of the City has already affected due to increase in the air pollution and smoke emitting vehicles and industrial smoke is spreading various harmful gases including Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) and thus creating air pollution in the city. / It was revealed in a report that was jointly prepared by Transport and Communication Department (TCD) and SUPARCO. They carried out a comprehensive joint survey on 28 sites of Karachi to determine the air quality and noise pollution resulting from operation of vehicular traffic./ The most affected areas where the ozone layer is getting affected due to the air pollution are identified as Sohrab Goth, Burns Road, Karimabad, Liaqatabad 10, Tower, Gulshan Chorangi, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Preedy Street, Gurumandir, FTC area, Gul Bai, Empress Market, Shaheen Complex, Drig road etc./ The concentration of major air pollutants and the level of noise pollution were recorded at 28 different locations, two of them being those having low pollution level as compared to other polluted areas./ The main objective of the report was to describe the status of air pollution on the corridors of impact (COI) of the vehicular traffic operating on city roads. Site selection for monitoring the level of pollution against this sub-task was based on the direction in which the transport network of Karachi City has expanded./ The COI for the purpose of this study was defined as the corridors on which development process have intensified the flow of vehicular traffic. Population pressure and economic developments induced Northward expansion of the city to Nazimabad, Liaqatabad and Sindh Industrial Estate, and eastward to Landhi Industrial Estate, and Korangi Industrial Area./ According to the report, the economic development, since the initial stages, remained largely in the environs of the port, central business district, and industrial estates. The movement of traffic on the approach roads and the road network of Karachi comprising numerous major and minor arterials are largely oriented towards the following five corridors that radiate from Merewether Tower in Saddar Town. / The 28 different location were Sohrab Goth, Karimabad, Liaqtabad 10, Tin Hatti, Guru Mandir, Old Numaish, Garden Road Intersection, Tibet Centre, Mawlvi Musafir Khana, Merewether Tower, Ziauddin Road & Chundirage Road intersection, Burns Road, Garden Road & Preedy Street Intersection, Empress market, Metropole Hotel, FTC building, Teen Talwar, Sunset Boulevard & Gizri Road Intersection, Korangi Road & Baloch Colony Bypass Intersection, Drig Road Station, KPT, Mauripur Road, Gulbai Intersection, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Gulshan Chowrangi, SUPARCO Head quarter, Ibrahim Rahimatullah Road. The mobile laboratory was stationed at selected observations points. Ambient levels of the following air pollutants and noise, along with metrological data and traffic count were recorded continuously for 48 hours at the said above locations. / Status of air pollution on city roads: / The level of gaseous pollutants and noise was recorded at 15 minimum intervals, while that of particulate matter SPM, PM 10, were determined for 24 hours, suing pre-calibrated automatic monitors cited above. Traffic count was taken continuously for 24 hours. / Analysis of air quality data:/ It has been found that the CO concentration at different observations points in the city during the small hours of the morning remains between 2.27 ppm minimum and 10.75 ppm maximum and an average of 3.79 ppm at the different corridors, where the survey was conducted or 4 times above the ambient level at the reference sites. This indicates that CO level does not return to the reference level even when traffic volume reduces to the bare minimum, and also that the sources of CO emission is not just the vehicular traffic but also others including stationary sources./ With regard to CO2 it may be noted that average level lower than the global average of 375 ppm despite the high volume of traffic operating on each corridor. This could be attributed to inefficient performance of engines due to which the fuel is not adequately burnt and oxidized to produce the proportions amount of CO2. / The rise in CO level can likewise be attributed to inefficient performance of automobile engines, and the resulting incomplete combustion of fuel leading to higher emission of this gas, and lower as well as disproportionate emission of CO2. The high concentration of NOx at the traffic intersections is attributed to the use of diesel oil and increasing conversion of the vehicles for CNG usage, besides higher temperature reached as a result of long and continuous of the engines on congested roads./ The overall level of pollutants is lower than the estimates based on fuel usage and high volume of traffic. One of the reasons for this observation may be the low wind velocity that does not allow accumulation of pollutants at the time of observation./ The impact of emission is therefore not just on the microenvironment of the intersection but is dispersed along the corridor in the direction of the wind that is generally towards the Northeast."
RICKSHAW DRIVERS LIKELY TO GO ON STRIKE,"LAHORE - The transport department fears that two-stroke rickshaw owners and drivers may go on strike to protest ban on three-wheelers on three more city roads by May 20./ In a letter written to the home secretary, the District Coordination Officer Lahore and the SSP (Operations), the deputy administration secretary of the transport department said that the strike was likely on May 16./ In the light of the Lahore High Court directions to phase out polluting vehicles from the city till December 2007, the City District Government had announced to ban the entry of two-stroke rickshaws in Defence Housing Authority, GOR 1, Jail Road-from Qurtaba Chowk to Old Airport and Aziz Bhatti Road-from Mian Mir Bridge to Mehfooz Pura Chowk from May 20. / As the DHA, portion of road-from Sherpao Bridge to Old Airport and Aziz Bhatti Road did not fall in the jurisdiction of the CDG, the concerned quarters were taken into confidence before banning the entry of two-stroke rickshaws in these areas./ District Officer Environment, Tariq Zaman, said the CDG would not bow to the pressure and threats of strike by rickshaw owners. / ""Ban is necessary to save public from pollution related diseases.  People are victims of noise and air pollution caused by these three-wheelers.  This pollution is resulting in increased cases of lungs and skin related diseases as well as psychological disorders,"" he said."
PEPA FAILS TO CURB SMOKE-EMITTING VEHICLES,"ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (PEPA) has so far failed to prepare rules and regulations for the smoke-emitting vehicles and is still following the old standards set by European Union.  The agency launched a campaign to monitor smoke-emitting vehicles in May 2005, but failed to prepare the standards and is still in initial stages to draft rules and regulations for them./ Vehicular Emission Test System (VETS), a cell of PEPA, started this campaign to monitor smoke-emitting vehicles in the federal capital, but assigned different provincial agencies to look after the environmental matters in the remaining parts of the country, where the pollution level is rising with an alarming speed. / The environmental condition to some extent is better in Islamabad since the arrival of CNG stations. But, the scene is grave in the less-developed areas of the country like Quetta where sub-standard and cheap Iranian diesel is being used. Diesel deteriorates environment far greater than any other fuel. PEPA handed over all its responsibilities to agencies at provincial level who hardly submit any report to PEPA or inform it about their progress and performances. / This shows the negligence on part of the PEPA and provincial agencies that have entrusted upon this responsibility  Talking about the hazardous affects of smoke emitted from vehicles on human health, Dr Wasim Khwaja of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), said that it causes a lot of serious disease like skin allergies, chest infection, eye infection, cough and breathing problem. ""The smoke leads to development of life threatening diseases like lungs' infection, which leads to lung cancer,"" he added.  Old ill-kept vehicles, which emit smoke and other hazardous pollutants, are generally seen plying on the country's roads. The smoke-emitting vehicles, known as super-emitters, are one of the major contributors in the global warming. / Smoke-emitting vehicles not only pollute the environment but also consume a lot of fuel, which is also not in the favour of car owner. The dangerous pollutants released from super-emitters contain un-burnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, soot and heavy metal particles from lubricant oil./ Till May 2007, VETS Monitoring official have checked up 21 thousand vehicles, including public transport, private and government cars in the federal capital and challaned almost 600 mostly heavy vehicles./ Ambreen Tariq Khan, Research Officer VETS, while talking to TheNation about the criteria of monitoring, said vehicles that pass the criteria are allotted a 'Green Sticker' and are exempted from checking for six months.  However, if a small car is unable to fit in the criteria set by PEPA then it was given a warning and allotted a 'Red Sticker'./ The car-owner must be appeared before the PEPA Headquarter within 15 days, but if fails to do so then PEPA challans it. / In case of big vehicles that come from far of places and are not allowed to enter Islamabad during daytime, PEPA does not issue any warning to them on the spot./ PEPA is performing this task in the capital with the assistance of Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP), but the number of the especially trained officials to monitor the vehicles is not enough to control the whole city. / A Japanese organisation, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has installed seven Environment Monitoring System (EMS) through out the country to check the level  of air pollution and their report is awaited. Like other parts of the globe, Pakistan is also set to celebrate the World Environment Day (WED) on Tuesday with a renewed commitment to protect natural heritage of the country and ensure better living condition for its people./ Different events will be organized by the Government, Ministry of Environment, United Nations, International Environmental Institutions and organizations, NGOs and the civil society to reiterate the resolve for protecting the depleting natural resources in the country./ World Environment Day, being commemorated each year on June 5, is one of the principal vehicles through which the United Nations stimulates worldwide awareness of the environment and enhances political attention and action. The World Environment Day slogan selected for 2007 is ""Melting Ice - a Hot Topic."" In support of International Polar Year, the WED theme selected for 2007 focuses on the effects that climate change is having on polar ecosystems and communities, and the ensuing consequences around the world"
IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS REMAINS A FARCE,"LAHORE - Despite the fact that the government is puffing out of cheeks while celebrating the environment day, environmental laws are yet to be implemented to check the pollution. The pollution level is increasing with every passing moment with government agencies failing to implement set environmental rules and acting merely as spectators. About 1, 800 people die every year due to pollution in Pakistan. It seems that the govt is only making strategies to curb the menace of pollution with nothing happening on ground to provide relief to the public. / Though a number of campaigns have been launched, daily challans against those violating environmental laws are being made, eight water treatment plants are being installed on war footing basis in Punjab capital, Lahore, new housing schemes and industrial projects are not being approved unless NOC is obtained from Environment Protection Department, hospitals are being compelled to dispose of its waste as per law, but pathetically pollution have been shooting up with alarming pace due to reasons best known to the authorities concerned.  / It is pertinent to mention that around 6.4 million hospital admissions and 4,18,000 cases of minor sickness occur every year due to air pollution. The situation is getting worse due to haphazard industrialization, wild urbanization, deforestation and a rapid increase in the number of vehicles./ Before the devolution plan, the departments used to complain the lack of legal powers to check the pollution vehicles and industrial units. Now they have come up with new plea that there is s shortage of funds, modern equipment and field staff. / The role of Punjab Environment Protection department has also been very negligible in controlling the level of air and water pollution in the big cities of the province including Lahore. It launched countless campaigns against noise and smoke-emitting vehicles but authority could not pursue action on a regular basis. / The national conservation strategy (NCS) indicates that about 40 per cent of deaths are related to water-borne diseases. About 25-30 per cent of all hospital admission is linked to water-borne bacterial and parasitic conditions. With 60 per cent of infant deaths associated with the same infections. Drinking and bathing in polluted water are among the most common roots for the spread of diseases with symptoms./ Pakistan had 0.85 million cars in 1982 now 1.2 million vehicles come on road daily in Lahore. NCS revealed that an average Pakistani motor vehicle emitted 20 times as mush hydrocarbon, 25 times as much carbon monoxide and 3.6 times as much nitrous oxide in grams per kilometre as compared to an average vehicle in the United States./ When contacted ECO-Watch, general secretary Imran Ahmed Bhatti, he claimed that unless lacunas in the PEPA 1997 were rectified, situation would not turn to better. ""The Act allows the EPD to check only reservoirs' pollution and became silent over pollution in potable water., he said / He pointed out that 56 ingredients were compulsory to claim water as mineral water but lot of companies did not ensure their inclusion in their so-called mineral water. Anyhow when they were prosecuted, word of mineral was replaced with pure or safe water to avoid legal proceedings against them., he maintained./ It is learnt that different development projects needed Initial Environment Examination (IEE) and Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) to get them approved but usually they were given okay signal without following the stipulated  procedure. Reliable sources revealed that EPD was deprived of modern laboratory, state of art gadget system and other paraphernalia to assess level of polluted particular matters in air and water. An initiative is yet to be taken to improve the system with digital age demands."
"COME MONSOON, 60PC ROADS BECOME DITCHES","LAHORE - Despite the fact that all kind of road repairing, maintenance and construction work are stopped in monsoon season around the world, around 60 percent of the city roads have been dug up in the name of development, presenting the picture of war-torn area / The digging up of the city has practically turned the city into a graveyard causing immense nuisance for the commuters as well as pedestrians. The inconvenience aggravated more when downpour lashed out the city on Saturday. The ditches and pitfalls over every nook and corner of the city during repairing and construction of roads have turned into small pools./ The City District Government Lahore launched road repair work, construction of flyovers and bridges simultaneously at number of locations throughout the metropolis. The city wears a messy look creating innumerable problems for the citizens who are wasting their precious time due to the alternative routes. The commuter are also suffering from respiratory problems due to dust. / Besides causing immense hardships to motorists and commuters in public transport, these constructions have been contributing to traffic jams, noise and air pollution in the city./ Medical reports have revealed that about 90 per cent of the diseases of throat, eyes and ears are caused by the smoke emissions that we inhale everyday. In the ongoing construction process, sewerage lines in many localities have been badly damaged and the filth from these damaged sewerage lines is getting mixed with water lines. / This situation has spread various sorts of abdominal diseases, like gastroenteritis and dysentery. The daily fuel consumption of public and private transports has substantially increased due to under-construction road projects of the local government. These under-construction roads compel the drivers to change their routes, congest the main traffic arteries and cause traffic jams resulting in excess fuel consumption."
2-STROKES NOT TO ENTER THREE MORE AREAS,"LAHORE - City District Government has decided to implement ban on the entry of two stroke rickshaws on more city roads and the entire DHA from July 1 (Sunday), sources informed The Nation on Thursday. It is to be noted that in Lahore alone 50,000 two-stroke rickshaw are plying on the city roads./ Earlier, the ban was to be imposed from May 20 but it could not be enforced as the CDG was evaluating the option if conversion of old two-stroke into CNG fitted four stroke rickshaw was feasible. The CDG considered this option in view of the demand of rickshaw union who then threatened to come on the roads if the government press ahead with its proposed ban. Later, the CDG rejected the option of conversion after examining the prototype rickshaws presented by the union./ Meanwhile, the CDG has decided to go ahead with its original plan to ban the entry of two stroke rickshaws on city roads in phases, after finding the converted vehicles handed over by the rickshaw union as substandard and less roadworthy. / In the first phase, the CDG had successfully implemented ban on the entry of two stroke rickshaws on The Mall from April 17, 2006. / In the second phase, the roads that are to be prohibited for these rickshaws are Jail Road-from Qurtaba Chowk to Old Airport, Aziz Bhatti Road-from Mian Mir Bridge to Mehfooz Pura Chowk and the entire DHA. / As the DHA, portion of road-from Sherpao Bridge to Old Airport and Aziz Bhatti Road did not fall in the jurisdiction of the CDG, the concerned quarters had been taken into confidence before banning the entry of two stroke rickshaws in these areas. The CDG is already behind the schedule in phasing out polluting vehicles from the city. / As such other major roads will be included in the list of prohibited areas for such vehicles one month after the ban to the entry of two stroke rickshaws on Jail Road, Aziz Bhatti Road and in DHA takes effect. / As per the phase out plan, Jail Road was be added in the list of banned roads for two stroke rickshaws from July 17, 2006, Main Boulevard Gulberg from October 16, 2006, Canal Bank Road from January 17, 2007 and Allama lqbal Road from April 16, 2007. But it did not happen due to lesser production of four stroke CNG fitted rickshaws. Now about 3500 CNG rickshaws are plying on city roads which prompted the CDG to go ahead with its action plan of phasing out polluting vehicles from the city. / As per the schedule, Ferozepur Road is to be added in the list of banned roads for polluting three wheelers from July 16, 2007, Multan Road from September 17, 2007, Old GT Road from October 16, 2007, Ravi Road and Circular Road from November 19, 2007 while the entire city is to be banned for two stroke rickshaws from December 20, 2007./ According to the official figures, there are more than 50,000 auto rickshaws plying on the city roads. Out of these rickshaws, 20,000 three wheelers are operating illegally./ Besides contributing 60-70 percent of the air pollution in Lahore, two stroke rickshaws are the main source of noise pollution. The three wheelers powered with two-stroke engine, exhaust excessive smoke, emit un-burnt hydrocarbons and generate noise to the uncomfortable level. The manufacturers recommend usage of lubricant up to two per cent but the rickshaw drivers enhance the quantity up to 12 percent for smooth driving. Previously, the CDG had banned the entry of auto and motorcycle rickshaws on six major city roads from February 1, 2006 but the decision could not be implemented due to lack of coordination among different departments. Later, the auto rickshaws were excluded from the banned list and entry of motorcycle rickshaws only was prohibited on seven major city roads."
AQM STATIONS SET UP TO CHECK POLLUTION,"LAHORE - To determine exact quantity of air pollution caused by smoke and noise, two Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) Stations have finally embarked upon their regular function in the city  The AQM Stations have been established in Town Ship and Town Hall in collaboration with Japan agency JICA with the cost of around Rs. 60 million. These stations are functioning 24 hours, evaluating quantity of toxic gases and other pollutants present in the air. One mobile Air Quality Monitoring Station provided by Japan has also kicked off plying on different roads to assess the air pollution. / The AQM stations established at height of around 50 feet are able to detect and present the details of different gases like Carbonmonoxide Carbondioxide, Hydrocarbon, Hydroxide, particular matters, Aldehydes, Sulphurdioxide and Nitrogenoxide, Ooze and noise pollution within five minutes / The control room has also been established in the building of Environment Protection Department Punjab to co-ordinate with all AQM stations./ In the second phase, City District Government Lahore will set up two more AQM stations at Yadgar and Chairing Cross with presenting their details on display screen for raising awareness among the people for environmental protection./ It is learnt that air pollution has severe effect on human life, specially on newly born and unborn infants. It is creating bronchial irritation, heart problems, anaemia, asthma, eye irritation and other respiratory diseases. / Oxides and lead particles are hazardous to human health and cause cancer, asthma, heart problems, and chest, throat and skin diseases. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which, when its level in the air increases, depletes the ozone layer that helps protect the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. Depletion of the ozone layer causes global warming, resulting in floods, drought, diseases and land infertility. / According to the Pakistan National Conservation Strategy, (conducted in collaboration with the Environmental & Urban Affairs Department and World Conservation Strategy [IUCN]), the motor vehicles emissions account for approximately 90% of the total annual emission of Hydrocarbons, Aldehydes, Carbonmonoxide, Carbondioxide, Sulphurdioxide and Nitrogen oxide. / The average Pakistani vehicle emits 20 times as much Hydrocarbon, 25 times as much Carbon monoxide, 36 times as much Nitrousoxide in grams per kilometre, as compared to an average vehicle in the United States of America. / Latest statistics revealed that the presence of Carbonmonoxide, measured at various places of Lahore, on the average, showed that the Carbonmonoxide level is around 200 percent high against the level of Air Pollution violates of the National Environmental Quality Standards, formulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. / According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the safe level of carbon dioxide in the air in nine Particular Per Minutes (PPM). / The devastating level of pollution has exposed the inability of government departments and non-government organisations to check it. Hundreds of smoke-emitting buses, cars and auto rickshaws are plying city roads without being checked by EPA mobile teams or traffic police. / Before the establishment of AQM stations, the preliminary Carbon Monoxide survey of the city conducted by Environmental Protection Agency, Punjab showed that the major source of air pollution in the city was the vehicular emissions. / Vehicular emissions lead to air pollution, primarily due to incomplete combustion on account of two-stroke engines (Rickshaws, Motor Cycles, Scooters) and diesel engines i.e. mainly public transport in Lahore. The smoke by cars, rickshaws, wagons, buses aeroplanes, railways etc produce carbonmonoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, organic vapours, odours, etc. / Air pollution also comes from many different sources such as factories, power plants, dry cleaners, cars, buses, trucks and even windblown dust and wildfires. Air pollution can threaten the health of human beings, trees, lakes, crops, and animals. Air pollution also can cause haze, reducing visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. / According to experts, the motor vehicles not only emit hazardous wastes but also create noise, and its continuity can temporarily or permanently damage hearing. High noise levels can also cause psychological disorder, variation in blood pressure, difficulty in respiration and changes in human behaviour. / The main contributing factors in increasing noise levels are pressure horns, un-tuned engines, damaged silencers, over speeding and excessive use of first two gears./ According to Rule 163 of the Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969, owner of the motor vehicle is required by law to maintain the vehicle, so as it does not cause damage or annoyance to any other persons or property or endanger the safety of any other users of the road, fitted with an efficient appliance for the purpose of preventing the emission of sparks or grit etc. / While the Regional Transport Authority, established under Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965, is issuing Fitness Certificates to Transport vehicles, which do not meet the required standards./ Sources revealed that the move behind the establishment of the Air Quality Monitoring Stations was the judicial activism.  In a bid to provide clean air to citizens and eliminate vehicular air pollution from the city, Justice Syed Hamid Ali Shah directed Punjab Government to phase out the traffic of existing buses, wagons, motorcab/autocab rickshaws and diesel buses by the end of next year and introduce, mini buses and CNG rickshaws. The court had also earlier constituted Lahore Clean Air Commission in 2003."
EPIDEMICS LOOM LARGE AS GARBAGE FLOAT,"LAHORE - With the torrential monsoon rain, a number of unattended garbage dumps in the city are largely witnessed to be floating on roads and streets to expose the residents to epidemics while the city district government has been painting a rosy picture of cleanliness and successful monsoon action plan. / Unhygienic atmosphere has been prevailing in many areas of the city as heaps of garbage and rainwater remained stagnant in various streets and play-grounds serving as favorite breeding place for mosquitoes and flies. / Due to ineffective dealing of the post-rain situation by civics agencies and bad cleanliness situation, the Lahorities are braving for a possible outbreak of epidemically diseases such as water-borne gastroenteritis, viral fever, malaria and many others. / The motorists and pedestrians have been facing numerous problems due to filthy and stinky mud made up by the garbage on the inundated roads. The pedestrians are forced to wade through the sewerage water overflowing from the choked sewerage lines. During monsoon this phenomenon repeats every year but the authorities wake up only after some tragic incident. / During the survey, The Nation has found unattended garbage at a number of places all over the city. The most affected areas were Railway station, Landa Bazar, Ram Galli, Sanda, Ichra Bazar, Pan Mandi in Anarkali, Inside Bhatti, Rang Mehal, Misri Shah, Tezab Aahata, Ghoreh Shah, Shadbagh, China scheme, Fateh Garh, Canal scheme, Taj Bagh, Taj Pura scheme, Darogeh Wala, Mint area, Baghampura, Chah Meran, Township, and Sawami Nagar. / The city district government and town administrations have badly failed to deal with the situation emanating from the recent downpour and maintain sterile condition by promptly removing the heaps of waste and darning out stagnant waters on streets and roads of the metropolis. / The Solid Waste Management and Water and Sanitation Agency did not bother to coordinate to remove the garbage dumps unattended for the last one-week and the recent rains spell has worsened the situation. / It is learnt that people submitted a number of complaints to Town and Union Nazims but they did nothing but to make some consolatory remarks. TMOs also refused to attend the complaints saying garbage disposal were not their responsibilities as the sanitation department works under the district government. / The residents said that sanitary workers were habitual of not visiting the problem area on regular basis to collect the garbage. The sanitation branch has provided the workers with vehicles to lift the garbage but these vehicles have been specified for some particular areas where elite class or political figures reside./ The SWM spokesman seeking anonymity said that the solid waste generated by Lahoris in one year has increased by 500 tonnes due to which not only air pollution has increased but its disposal has also become a major problem for the Solid Waste Management. / SWM district officer Dr Tufail Ahmed Siddiqui said the department had recorded 5,000 tonnes of solid waste on a daily basis last year. He said this year this ratio had reached 5,500 tonnes. He said the department had improved its solid waste lifting procedure this year. He said heaps of garbage was the basic reason of air pollution and its disposal was becoming a serious problem with the increasing population./ He said four solid waste sites had been constructed around the city. He said a composite plant was set up in Mehmood Booti near Bund Road. The plant, he said, had been converting garbage in to fertiliser. He said 25 percent of the total city's solid waste had been converted in to fertiliser so far. / He said 383 vehicles were collecting solid waste and besides this the SWM had set up nine camps in various towns of Lahore. Other than those nine camps, he said, two emergency camps were operational round the clock. He said the city district government had planned to set up 500 solid waste sites in a year across the city./ He said that 90 percent waste is disposed of while the remaining 10 percent is left open as people throw it in drains or dump at unattended plots.  ""We can't enter some plots without the permission of their owners and due to this reason garbage piles up in many areas of the city,"" he added. / Environment Department district officer Tariq Zaman Khan said the unplanned urbanisation was the basic reason of increasing garbage generation. He said the Environment Department had launched a number of programmes to educate people about health and environment. He said the department in collaboration with the city government was using different techniques to dispose off the waste. He said the techniques employed by the city government were not environmental friendly as most of the garbage was being burnt resulting in emission of poisonous smoke. / A shopkeeper in Misri Shah said that the sanitary staff was not collecting garbage regularly and they were forced to hire services of private contractors in this regard. / He said that every union council had 40 to 50 sanitary workers but the nazims and naib nazims were more interested in keeping sanitary workers busy in their streets instead of getting the entire union council area cleaned./ According to NUPAP report the solid waste generation in Pakistan ranges between 0.6 kg to 0.8 kg per capita/day and it is increasing by 2.4 percent annually. It further states that around 40 percent of the generated waste remains either at collection points or in streets."
TWO MORE COMPOSTING PLANTS TO BE INSTALLED,"LAHORE - In collaboration with private sector, two more composting plants for converting solid waste into organic fertilizer are being installed by Solid Waste Management Department, so that more than 6200 solid waste per day in the city could be dealt with. / Already a composite plant is operational in Mehmood Booti producing 50 percent fertilzer from the solid waste on daily basis. / After the installation of these plants, the City of Lahore will attain the unique distinction of being the leading city of Pakistan where three composting plant will be producing organic fertilizer from solid waste The project will be also the first ever project of Pakistan launched on BOT basis, setting a precedent for more projects on these bases. / Land in Sagrian and Kana Kachah has been earmarked. It is learnt that Ravi Town, Data Gunj Bukh Town and Samnabad town will dump their solid waste at Sagrian plant. Nishter Town, Allama Iqbal Town and Gulberg Town will dump their solid waste at Kana Kachah plant. Private firms will be awarded contract to install these composting plants on 25 years lease. / It is also learnt that already a composite plant is operational in Mehmood Booti where Shalamar Town, Aziz Bhatti Town and some portion of Gulberg Town are dumping their solid waste. A private firm ""Lahore Compose"" is managing the plant. The plant is converting half of the total solid waste dumped daily. Out of the half organic fertilizer 500 to 100 tonnes is provided to City District Government Lahore under the agreement. / The City District Government has started looking for offers from interested parties for installation of composting plants in the city for fertilizer production. / After the pre-qualification process, through bidding the best firm will be awarded contract to install the composite plant. / It may be recalled that contrary to the defunct Metropolitan Corporation, which had been catering solid waste requirements within the 440 sq Kilometers of municipal limits only, the City District Government has to take care of the entire district Lahore spread over an area of 1770 sq Kilometers and housing 8 million people, after abolition of urban -rural divide under the system of district governments. / Contacted to DO SWM Tufail Saddiqi Mian Amer, replied that that population growth and generation of added quantum of waste have further augmented the Solid Waste Management problem. / He said a composite plant was set up in Mehmood Booti near Bund Road. The plant, he said, has been converting solid garbage into fertiliser. He said 25 percent of the total city's solid waste are being converted into fertiliser so far. / He said the department had recorded 5,000 tonnes of solid waste on a daily basis last year. Now the department has recorded more than 6200 tonnes solid waste daily. / He said heaps of garbage are the basic reason of air pollution and its disposal is becoming a serious problem with the increasing population./ He said 383 vehicles are collecting solid waste and besides this the SWMD has set up nine camps in various towns of Lahore. Other than those nine camps, he said, two emergency camps are operational round the clock. / Environment Department district officer Tariq Zaman Khan said the unplanned urbanisation is the basic reason of increasing garbage generation and air pollution. He said the Environment Department has launched a number of programmes to educate people about health and environment. He said the department in collaboration with the city government is using different techniques to dispose off the waste. He said the techniques employed by the city government are not environmental friendly as most of the garbage is being burnt resulting in emission of poisonous smoke. / He said that the City District Government has decided for setting up waste collection centers in all the new public and private sector housing schemes to be launched in the city in future. The idea was already being executed in the first ever-housing scheme for government employees LDA-Avenue-1, he added. / Sources in Urban unit, Planing and Development Punjab said that solid waste management is a major issue for the government of the Punjab and local governments. / Upon the request of government of the Punjab the World Bank as a part of Punjab Large Cities Development Policy Loan, arranged a comprehensive study on Solid Waste Management (SWM) study in nine (9) cities of Punjab (Lahore, Multan, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, and Dera Ghazi Khan). / Sources informed that the plants are being installed under the recommendation of the study report which also devised the technical, institutional, financial, and regulatory aspects of the solid waste management system in the urban areas."
AIR MANAGEMENT PLAN IN CAPITAL STILL A DREAM,"ISLAMABAD - There is a dire need of a comprehensive air quality management plan to control air pollution in Islamabad, which is mainly caused by Industrial Area and the brick kilns along the Islamabad Highway./ Recently, the air pollution situation in the Capital has been aggravated by land clearing activities and digging for road construction and other development projects, as well as by gas emissions from increased motor traffic, which also form particles in the atmosphere./ Vehicles travelling on under-construction roads and unpaved diversionary routes also create fugitive dust particles, which pollute the air. Moreover, uncovered piles of earth and other materials at the construction sites also contribute to air pollution. One such uncovered storage pile of earth in H-sector is over 10 feet high. On some windy days, which is quite a common phenomenon in Islamabad, this construction area is enveloped in thick fog-like dust./ All this dust or particulate matter, known as PM-10 and comprising a broad class of chemically and physically diverse substances that exist as particles with a diameter less than or equal to 10 microns, is hazardous to health./ According to the Pakistan Economic Survey last June, air pollution levels in Pakistan's most populated cities are among the highest in the world, dust and smoke particles are generally twice the world average and five times higher than the developed world, causing serious health issues in the process./ A source said on condition of anonymity told TheNation that over five years ago, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency together with provincial environmental protection agencies started the process of establishing an air quality monitoring system in five cities including Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta in collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The project envisaged the installation of fixed and mobile air monitoring stations in these five cities to collect data about the ambient air quality. But until now this air monitoring system has not been fully instituted./  The source added, in addition to an air quality index, many cities elsewhere have also developed comprehensive plans for dust control targeted mainly at construction companies and industrial firms. Under these plans, construction companies and industrial firms whose activity result in dust emission are duty bound to adopt one or several methods of controlling dust emission from their land clearing activities, earth moving activities, storage piles of earth and other construction material./ With more road construction, a new industrial estate in I- Sector and other land development activities in the pipeline, the quality of air in the city is expected to deteriorate further in future, if we do not adopt measures in time to arrest the situation./ Islamabad is still waiting for PEPA's air management project to materialize so that it can be brought under a similar air monitoring network whereby the state of air pollution, whether good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups or worse, can be regularly communicated through the electronic and print media along with health advisory to the people to create more awareness./ Dr Shabbir Ahmed told TheNation that dust particles could cause negative health effects when inhaled by people working and living in the areas surrounding the construction sites and by motorists and commuters travelling through these areas.  These health effects include premature death, acute respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. Some individuals, such as the elderly, young children, with pre-existing health problems and asthmatics are much more likely to suffer the negative health effects of PM-10./ A comprehensive air quality management plan for Islamabad will also require improvement in the industrial processes. Several efforts were made in the past decades to control the emissions from the Islamabad industrial area but these have made little progress because the area, which is adjacent to residential sectors, is still enveloped in a greyish-black haze, particularly in the mornings./  Finally, more roads and more driving lanes may help alleviate the traffic problems in the capital city but this only promotes more air pollution problems. / Therefore, an effective air management plan will also necessitate the introduction of an environment-friendly public transport system to reduce the number of cars on the road, and thus reduce air pollution from direct car emissions and fugitive dust emission from cars travelling on unpaved and paved roads."
Making the month of Ramzan smoke-free,"ISLAMABAD - Ulema participating in a consultation on ""making the Month of Ramzan a smoke-free month"" here on Thursday decided to launch an anti-smoking campaign says a press release./ The Ulema will advise the Muslims to abstain from smoking according to Quranic teachings. In their khutbas, the Ulema will urge people to give up the habit of smoking and other tobacco and stress upon smokers to get rid of the bad habit during the Holy month of Ramzan./ While speaking at the occasion the Federal Health Minister Mohammad Nasir Khan said that smoking is the largest preventable cause of bad health.  The Health Minister informed the audience that nearly 5 million people die every year in the world due to diseases caused by use of tobacco. / The minister said, ""passive or involuntary smoking is equally harmful for non-smokers"". Passive smokers means those persons who themselves are not smokers but breathe the air polluted by smoke of smokers.  It is also a clear violation of others' right because the non- smokers have the right to the clean air.  This is the reason that the government has promulgated   ""Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non Smokers Health Ordinance 2002"". One purpose of the Ordinance is to protect the health of non-smokers by banning smoking in all public places and transport. He appealed to the youth to avoid this bad habit of smoking. He also urged the families to force smokers to quit during the holy month of Ramzan. He called on Ulema to combat smoking by educating people to remain away from this harmful addiction./ WHO representative Dr. Khalid Bile explained the health hazards of smoking, which included Lung Cancer, heart ailments and respiratory health problems.  He said smoking is a killer. It kills nearly 5 million people in the world every year. It is prohibited in Islam and it causes poverty."
"Sector I-9 in grip of air, noise pollution","ISLAMABAD - Air and noise pollution in Sector I-9 and other adjacent parts of the Capital City is on the rise, as hundreds of trucks, entering and leaving Islamabad daily through this route, causing serious health problems.   / Owing to these large vehicles, the complaints of noise, dust and smoke from the residents of Sector I-9 and other nearby areas of Islamabad are increasing with each passing day. / They were of the view that this air and noise pollution made lives of people, especially of asthma patients, more miserable but no one among the relevant official quarters was willing to redress their grievances./ A resident of Sector I-9, Irfan Sohail said that hundreds of trucks enter and leave our area every day and most of them use Potohar Road where he is working thus emitting huge quantity of smoke, which is injurious to human health. ""I am a patient of asthma and these vehicles have increased my woes manifold,"" he complained. He said that it was the responsibility of Capital Development Authority (CDA) to ensure the area's cleanliness but they were least bother to perform their duties and ensure the visits of sweepers on daily basis. / Another resident of this area, Arshad Naeem said that hundreds of trucks use Warsak Road and one could easily observe layers of smoke in the air causing throat, nasal and lung diseases. However, he lamented that CDA was doing nothing to address their problems./ According to health experts, the noise and air pollution is highly injurious to human health. They said that the smoke was emitted by trucks could cause respiratory infections, exacerbation of bronchial asthma and high blood pressure. / The smoke also contains carcinogens that could cause cancer and the dust could cause nasal allergy, asthma and noise hearing problems. An official of Islamabad Traffic Police when contacted said on condition of anonymity that the trucks could only use Link Roads to enter or leave the city. / He said the traffic police had been asked to keep an eye on trucks causing noise or air pollution. However, he admitted that some lapses had been reported and we were doing our best to control the situation."
Government seeks time to phase out smoke-emitting vehicles,"LAHORE - The Punjab government will approach Lahore High Court to seek more time to phase out smoke-emitting vehicles particularly two-stroke rickshaws. The Punjab government will submit an application stating as the country was facing uncertainty on political and economic fronts, the deadline set by the court was hard to meet. So the government would need three to six months more to eliminate these vehicles. / The LHC in 2004 responding to a writ petition filed against the 2-stroke rickshaws spreading noise and air pollution in the City constituted a Lahore Air Commission under which the Punjab government was given the date of December 31, 2007 to phase out all smoke-emitting vehicles to provide clean environment to the citizens. But Punjab government failed to enforce ban by the stipulated time.  / The Punjab government had also an important meeting with Punjab Environment Department to discuss the issue and decided to submit an application to LHC to get more time to get rid of smoke-emitting vehicles./ On a query, the Deputy Secretary Punjab Transport Department Tayyab Farid. said that the series of untoward incidents at national level since the last many months impeded the flow of work on different development works. / District Officer (Environment) Tariq Zaman supported the thoughts of official of transport department and termed uncertainty as basic reason leading to hamper the development works as well as deadlines set by government. / Details reveal that the apex court ordered to ban these rickshaws but as the living of more than 10, 000 families was based on these vehicles, the CDGL appealed towards a gradual phasing out. / The Punjab government banned the registration and manufacturing of two-stroke engines for rickshaws in the main cities of Punjab including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan and Gujranwala from January 2005, following directions of the Lahore High Court and Chief Minister Punjab's Green Punjab Programme. Contrary to the ban, illegal conversion of motorcycles into motorcycle rickshaw continued with impunity. These illegal rickshaws have neither route permits nor are registered as public transport vehicle. / Officials of the Transport Department seeking anonymity said that the no measures had been ordered to them by the authorities concerned to act in the matter. They said that the government was likely to contact the LHC to get more time to phase out the existing 2-stroke and diesel vehicles and introduce CNG rickshaws and buses in urban transport system of the city. ""Despite our utmost efforts, no transport company has showed consent to ply CNG buses,"" they said, claiming that the production capacity of a CNG fitted 4-stroke rickshaw manufacturer has not been enhanced. They said an immediate end of motorcycle rickshaws and 2-stroke rickshaws would create colossal commuting problems in the city, 'hence extension in the deadline is demanded./ Environment Protection Department also failed to tackle the issue. The Environmental Tribunal (ET) Constituted in 1997 under Pakistan Environmental Protection Act could not take up issue of banning the smoke-emitting vehicles / Various campaigns have been launched by environment protection agencies, police departments and NGOs against rising air and noise pollution because of the two-stoke rickshaw over the years, but these vehicles are still on the rise. / According to recent reports by Suparco and the Economic Survey of Pakistan, air and water pollution levels in city have crossed national and international environment quality standards and are the highest in the world and a serious threat to the lives of the residents of the city./ Both survey state that the smoke and dust particles, known as SPM, that cause lung diseases, are twice the world average and five times higher than those in industrial countries and have crossed the safe limits./ Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) official Riaz Mehmood said that proportion of harmful suspended particulate in the air was four to five times higher than the prescribed standards of the World Health organisation (WHO)./  He said the government under its Clean Air Programme had installed air pollution monitoring systems in federal and provincial capitals and centralised data was being gathered at a laboratory set up in Islamabad. He said the government was introducing Euro 2 standard, adding that petrol and gas vehicles would begin following it by 2008./ The City district government (CDGL) planned to ban two-stroke rickshaws from six important roads of the city. This follows an initiative that banned the rickshaw from the Mall and jailed road. / The CDGL served notice to two-stoke rickshaws under the Lahore Clean Air Policy. The notice informs the rickshaw-drivers that they are banned from using the Jail Road. It stated that their entry on the Ferozepur Road, the Multan Road, the GT Road, the Allama Iqbal Road and the Main Boulevard would also be banned by December.  According to official figures there are more than 60,000 auto rickshaws on the city roads. Out of them, 30,000 are operating illegally and have not renewed any route permit following the banning of the manufacture, sale and registration of two-stroke rickshaws. / Two-stroke rickshaws are alleged to contribute 60-70 percent of the city's air pollution. They are also the primary sources of noise pollution caused by vehicles. The rickshaws emit un-burnt hydrocarbons in the form of smoke. Drivers remove mufflers from their vehicles to accommodate the emission of un-burnt lubricants. This ultimately enhances noise pollution."
Heaps of garbage on Double Road irk residents,"ISLAMABAD- Heaps of litter and garbage persist on Rawalpindi Stadium Road (Double Road) as no system of removing the rubbish has been framed despite that the attention of the concerned authorities has been drawn in the matter over and again. / The dustbins bearing the title ""Use Me"", kept in middle of the road for the wastes to be dropped in, always remained swarming and people are thinking what to make use of them./ Due to the ongoing rainy season, the rubbish has been spread over both sides of the road emitting a very bad smell affecting the pedestrians while walking along the road./ This was revealed  during a survey conducted by daily TheNation here on Monday. Residents of the Double Road stressed upon District and Tehsil Councils Rawalpindi to make sure the frequent removal of the garbage from the area and take concrete measures in order to bring about betterment in the situation./ Amjad Zarin, while taking tea in open air in front of a restaurant, said that the wastes thrown on the road was projecting a very poor image of the concerned authorities, as they were unable to keep clean that small portion of the road on which important places like Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium and Nawaz Sharif Park were situated./ ""Besides the litter on the road, the area is supplied with bitter taste water. It seems as if the authorities have totally ignored this area"", said one of the complainants. / The wastes dispersed here and there contaminate the air and adds to the air pollution. Besides, it makes the air hazardous for the health of the residents, which may cause skin and stomach diseases, if persistently inhaled./ ""Both the ministries of environment and health are required to launch an anti-pollution campaign on regular basis in collaboration with the local bodies to cope with the monster of pollution"", suggested another resident./ Double Road can rightly be called as students' heaven as they move through this road while going to different universities of the twin cities and coming back to hostels situated here. ""They serve like ambassadors for rest of the country and take bad image of the twin cities. Therefore, the authorities of Rawalpindi District Council are required to pay special attention to the area"", said Qayum, a student of Sir Syed University.    "
"Viral fever, chickenpox on the rise","KARACHI - Experts have warned the citizens to prevent themselves and especially their children from infectious diseases as chickenpox and viral fever are on the rise in the metropolis adding that thousands of local residents are visiting hospitals with symptoms of these diseases. / They said that viral fever was difficult to prevent because it occurred in the form of epidemics. Chickenpox is a common infection among children, especially those under 12 years of age but aspirin must not used to reduce pain or fever in children with chickenpox, they added. They further said chickenpox vaccine is very expensive but significantly lowers a child's chances of falling victim to this disease. / Talking to The Nation on Wednesday, Pakistan Medical Association General Secretary / (Karachi chapter) Dr Samrena Hashmi said that viral fever was a contagious infection, which often spread in dry whether.  ""The low or high grade fever, running nose, nasal congestion, headache, redness of the eyes, cough, muscle and joint pains are the symptoms of the viral infection, however a skin rash could also be present. Air pollution and dusty environment cause the infection among the people. The people are affected with the fever by the intake of contaminated water or food or by direct contact with affected person./ She urged the citizens to take precautionary measures against transmittable fever and said that use of more fluids, vegetables and fruits for affected people especially was essential.  / She said, ""no medical treatment is required if the fever is mild with no other problems. If a child feels comfortable, drink plenty of fluids and able to sleep, fever treatment is not likely to help. However, the medical treatment is required to lower a fever if an affected child or adult is uncomfortable, vomiting, dehydrated, or having difficulty sleeping. / Dr Faisal Mehmood, Assistant Professor Infectious Disease Dept of Medicine, said that chickenpox was considered as highly contagious infection, caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). He said, ""an itchy rash of spots on the human body are the major symptoms of the disease, while flu, cold and cough are considered other symptoms. Such symptoms usually go away without treatment, but due to contagious nature of the disease, an infected children or person should stay away from public and stay home and rest until the symptoms are gone. / Infected children should be kept out of schools until their complete recovery from the infection or until all blisters have dried, to prevent other schoolchildren. Chickenpox is contagious from about 2 days before the rash appears and lasts until all the blisters are crusted over. All blisters have dried, usually about 1 week."" / As per some international health resources, some kids have a fever, abdominal pain, sore throat, headache or a vague sick feeling a day or 2 before the rash appears. These symptoms may last for a few days and fever stays in the range of 100_-102_ Fahrenheit though in rare cases may be higher. / Younger kids often have milder symptoms and fewer blisters than older children or adults. Typically, chickenpox is a mild illness, but can affect some infants, teens, adults, and people with weak immune systems more severely. Some people can develop serious bacterial infections involving the skin, lungs, bones, joints, and the brain (encephalitis).""/ Talking about the treatment, Dr Mehmood said, ""Physicians usually avoid to prescribe antibiotics because chickenpox is caused by virus. / The treatment of the disease is called symptomatic. However, antibiotics may be required if sores become infected by bacteria. Doctors usually prescribe antiviral drug acyclovir to make the infection less severe. Antiviral drug must be given within first 24 hours after the rash appears. Acyclovir can have significant side effects, so it is only given when necessary. The ointment is also prescribed for the patients to relief them from itch, caused by chickenpox."
Black smoke emission smothering Karachiites,"KARACHI - Black smoke emission from the vehicles is the major source of air pollution in the country particularly in Karachi, while factories are the second cause of the pollution and garbage burning plants also playing havoc in the atmosphere of metropolitan./ The citizens are likely victims of various diseases due to this urban menace if the matter will not be tackled at the earliest, environmental expert expressed his concerns while talking to The Nation on Thursday./ Former Director General of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Sindh Dr Iqbal Saeed, when contacted told The Nation that, the environmental laws could not be implemented owing to ever increasing number of vehicles plying on the roads- a phenomenon which is a constant contributor to the air pollution./ ""Then there are factories and garbage plants that are worsening the situation further. All this smoke emission is the main source of creating air pollution that may lead to several decreases"", he opined./ He said most of the vehicles plying on the roads were technically unfit but still they were allowed to roam free, producing unchecked black smoke emission. ""Similarly there appears to be no proper system to check and control the factories of garbage plants, which are main sources of this problem,"" he added. / He said that mostly factories operating in the city would emit chemical in the air and into the water that was also among the major problems for the Karachiites, as the factories drained its chemical waste into the Lyari and Malir rivers. He was of the view that neither the factories nor the government had any proper system to dump the chemical waste./ Dr Iqbal who has also served as DG of EPA from January-2005 to July-2006 is also a PhD holder from Karachi University said that the laws concerning the factory operating system are being implemented successfully in various countries and those could be introduced in Pakistan as well. It may be mentioned here that several previous governments and the public administrators also initiated many efforts to resolve the problems but no progress could be made so far./ Last year, for instance, Sindh High Court took a suo moto notice in this regard and summoned the then DIG traffic. The court asked the top official to take notice of the unfit vehicles plying freely with unending emission of pollution in the City. The government also officially banned such vehicles. / The department concerned also issued directives to the public transporters, including buses and rickshaw owners to maintain their vehicles but instead of doing what they were asked, their representative bodies termed the directives as anti-poor policies and announced to launch agitation and consequently the matter was left as it was- but only for worsening further. / In utter defiance of civic laws, the transporters continue to ply faulty buses spewing clouds of black smoke and rendering the air with ear-splitting horns.  Then the rickshaws are another big source of harmful leaden smoke and most horrible noise factory./ The deadly effects of these emission could be gauged from the fact that the roadside plantation on several busy and major roads of the City including M.A Jinnah Road has lost its colour and vitality due to abundant lead supply from these vehicle and all forms of pollution leave citizens with high blood pressure, insomnia and lung diseases."
Govt proposes standards to control vehicular emission,"KARACHI - For the first time, federal government has proposed a set of standards to control the increasing vehicular emission harmful for human beings as well as for the environment, The Nation learnt on Wednesday.  According to official sources, the Pakistan Standard Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) with consultation of other stakeholders, made this standard with a view to control pollution. The PSQCA has convened a meeting of representatives of Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) and other stakeholders to be held on April 21, 2008 in Karachi./ Currently there are no specific standards for vehicular emission, generally to regulate nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and particulate matter (PM), said an expert. A concerned official told The Nation that during preparation of this draft of standard, the assistance was sought from M/s Automotive Corporation of Pakistan (ACP), Bureau of Indian Standards, European Emission Standards and Environmental Protection Agency./ He further said that first technical committee had worked out the modalities and standards being implemented in the world. The National Standards Committee of Mechanical Engineers Division has also endorsed and approved the draft of ""Emission Standards"" prepared by the technical committee of PSQCA. The committee has followed the standards being implemented in European countries, the official said adding that this standard would be implemented in phases rather than immediate and abrupt enforcement. / This standard is intended mainly to cover the technical provisions relating to emission limits from the vehicles operating/working at different stages and emitting air pollutants in the atmosphere and it does not cover the fuel quality consumed during the operation of the vehicles./ In order to keep the progress of trade and industry, Pakistan standards are revised periodically, the official said adding that suggestions from all stakeholders would be welcomed and placed before the committee for consideration at the time of revision. The proposed draft of standard prescribes the emission limits of air pollutants emitted by the vehicles at different load conditions during operation/working. / The official further said the emissions from new and old vehicles are controlled through standards. Generally for the protection of human health and environment, emission standards for vehicles are fixed at different parameters like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide, smoke and particulate matter, which are emitted from vehicles.  Due to growing number of vehicles and high emission rates, serious air pollution in the urban areas is on the rise creating problems for environmentalists and the masses, he said.  / The majority of Asian countries have adopted the Euro Emission Standards for new gasoline and diesel vehicles, the official said adding it was necessary to establish the exhaust standard both for new and in-use vehicles and bring them at par with the standards prevalent in the countries of this region."
Asthma creates alarming situation,"KARACHI - Experts on Sunday said that the disease of asthma had turned into an alarming condition as about 10 per cent of children in Pakistan were suffering from this disorder, while 5 to 10 per cent of the adult population in the country was suffering from this condition./ A research, done by the Aga Khan University (AKU), reveals that the prevalence of asthma in Pakistan has increased to 18 per cent in children of 13-14 age groups, said a leading consultant of the AKUH, Prof Dr Jawed A Khan, while talking to The Nation on the eve of World Asthma Day to be held on May 6. The day in 2008 is being observed with the theme ""You Can Control Your Asthma."" He said that the epidemiological studies from other parts of the world had also confirmed that asthma prevalence was increasing in the world especially in the developing countries. According to a study, conducted two years back, more than 300 million people in the world are suffering from this disorder, while thousands of people die of the disease every year, he said./ He said is a chronic disease of lungs characterised by recurrent breathing problems. The common symptoms of asthma include breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. During normal breathing, air flows freely in and out of the lungs. However, in a patient with asthma, the airways of the lungs become thick, swollen and inflamed. The airways of asthma patients were very sensitive to environmental changes. Asthma symptoms vary from time to time. Some patients get symptoms very occasionally, once or twice a year, during the change of weather./ In spite of extensive research in this field, the causes of asthma increase remain unclear, in fact the rapid increase in asthma prevalence around the world is considered as one of the biggest mystery in modern medicine. There are several possible explanations for the increase in asthma cases. / These include changes in lifestyle e.g. increased use of carpets, changes in the dietary pattern in particular, decreased use of fruits and vegetables and increased consumption of fast-food. Increased prevalence of smoking is also being considered as an important factor for the rise in asthma cases in many developing countries. / Factors that can set off an asthma attack include inhaled allergens (such as dust mites, pollen, and cat and dog allergens), tobacco smoke, air pollution, exercise, strong emotional expressions (such as crying or laughing), chemical irritants, and certain drugs (aspirin and beta-blockers). Some colouring agents and food preservatives can also cause asthma attack. Flu and common cold are by far the most common reason for worsening of asthma symptoms. / Avoidance of allergens and irritants is necessary in order to avoid asthma symptoms. Each person with asthma reacts to a different set of factors and identification of these factors and how to avoid them is a major step for each individual in learning how to control their disease. / Allergen avoidance may not always be possible because most patients do not know to which agent they are allergic to; however, skin tests are helpful in this respect. House dust mite, a microscopic insect like creature, is the biggest enemy of asthma sufferer. It thrives in humid and warm conditions and its diets consist of shed scales from the human skin. At home, its sources are bedroom mattress, pillows and carpets, which provide the best warm condition, humidity and food. It is also present in blankets, curtains and furniture. / Certain measures can reduce the exposure to house dust mite. This include, removal of carpets, at least from the bedrooms, discarding feathers pillow and using hypoallergenic polyester pillow, encasing the bed with a plastic cover, washing bed-clothes weekly, putting linen and blanket in the sun light at least once a week."
"Joint working group to ensure safe drinking water, says Saad","LAHORE - PML-N government in Punjab will form a joint working group comprising Water and Sanitation Agency, representatives of government and civil society organisations to ensure safe drinking water in the province.  The government will make concerted and coordinated efforts to resolve environment problem including water and air pollution. A comprehensive anti-encroachment campaign would be launched soon. / This was stated by PML-N stalwart and Former Federal Minister for Culture and Youth Affairs Khawaja Saad Rafiq while addressing a seminar on 'Waterborne diseases' held under the aegis of Al-Khidmat foundation Lahore presided over by Naimatullah khan, Ex-district nazim Karachi and President of Al-Khidmat Foundation Pakistan. Hafiz Salman Butt, President Al-Khidmat Foundation Lahore and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. / He praised Al-Khidmat Foundation Lahore's Anti-Water Born disease campaign with endeavour to provide healthy human environment by eradicating water borne disease. He also called upon the civil society organisations to contribute towards such efforts to improve, protect and maintain the quality of fresh water fit for public. / He observed that water was a critical resource and achieving water security was a major priority of the government. He said water borne diseases were one of the major hazards for public health and the government was committed to providing safe drinking water to the entire population of the Province. / He further said that deterioration and contamination of lakes, rivers and groundwater aquifers had increased water borne diseases and other health hazards and the Punjab government will launch a project involving preventive steps against water borne disease and awareness programme to check contamination in water sources. / He showed concern over the level of pollution in river bodies and quality of water being supplied for human consumption, pollution threats to water resources and future scarcity of water in view of excessive extraction of ground water. / Ex-district nazim Karachi and Al-Khidmat Foundation Pakistan President Naimatullah Khan announced to provide five filtration plants for Lahore. / He said that government departments, civil society, private sector organisations, philanthropists and communities had to come forward to ensure the safe drinking water for everyone. / He said that every fifth person in the country suffered from illness associated with pollution, and 40 percent of deaths in urban centres were caused by unsafe water. About 47 percent of the population of Lahore had no access to safe drinking. / He said that Al-Khidmat foundation would make all out efforts to get sufficient knowledge regarding waterborne diseases and its affect on human health to understand the overall affect of polluted water on environment, to conduct a research to know the current status of unfit water in Lahore; to educate people regarding waterborne diseases by using electronic and print media. / 'The original quality of water sources has been altered by the impacts of various human, industrial and agricultural activities in Pakistan. These contaminants such as microorganisms, chemicals, toxic substances, industrial wastes or wastewater in higher concentration makes water unfit for drinking. Such contaminants cause acute or chronic health effects such as circulatory system problem, skin damage, kidney damage, gastrointestinal distress, blue baby syndrome, increased risk of cancer and nervous system disorder,' they added. . / They said that in order to improve the health of inhabitants of Pakistan both quantitative and qualitative analysis was required on local level which was only possible by the establishment of water quality monitoring labs at district level.

"Exposure to chemicals causes birth defects, reproductive failure: scientist","LAHORE - The renowned Pakistani scientist Dr Kazim R Chohan from Medical University of Syracuse, New York (USA) has said that inadvertent exposure to chemicals in the environment might predispose birth defects and reproductive failure in both males and females. / According to a Press release, Dr Kazim was delivering a lecture on the ""Effects of Environment on Human Reproduction"" at the University of Health Sciences (UHS) on Thursday. UHS Vice Chancellor Prof Malik Hussain Mubbashar, senior faculty members and a large number of students attended the lecture. / Dr Kazim said that infertility now affected 15-20 per cent couples in industrialised countries compared to 7-8 per cent in early 60s. He added that because of environmental factors, girls were reaching puberty at an earlier age in some parts of the world whereas the number of boys born compared to the number of girls had shown declines in several regions. / Dr Kazim said that every year more than 100,000 new chemicals were produced worldwide. There were chemicals in the workplace, chemicals in the environment (from air pollution and from carelessly disposed materials that contaminate the land, water supply, or food chain), and food additives. He said that exposure to these chemicals and other low-level environmental contaminants such as phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins and pesticides might subtly undermine our ability to reproduce. / He informed that most common chemical compound hazardous to human reproductive health was bisphenol A used in plastic bottles, baby milk bottles, CDs, glass eye lenses, lining of food cans and dental sealants. Phthalates were found in toys, shampoos, vinyl flooring, lotions and cosmetics, whereas nonylphenol were used in detergents, lubricants, paints, etc. He also said that smoking and excessive use of cell phones and laptop computers adversely effects male fertility. / Dr Kazim claimed that there was no grading system for bisphenol A in plastic bottles in Pakistan. He advised that women should use stainless steel utensils in kitchen instead of non-stick pans, which again contained hazardous toxic chemicals. Dr Kazim Chohan further said that effects of smoking on male reproductive health included decreased sperm motility, low sperm count, increased abnormal morphology, impaired sperm function and increased sperm DNA damage. / He further said that compounds that decrease male fertility by toxic action on the tests and sperm included lead, DBCP, kepone, and chloroprene. Dr Kazim stated that there could be various factors involved in infertility in both men and women. Male factors might include low sperm count and sperm abnormalities, such as altered morphology and low motility. Female factor stemmed from ovulation problems such as premature ovarian failure (early menopause), thyroid irregularities, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and fallopian tube obstruction. / But up to 10 per cent of infertility could not be explained medically, he added. / Earlier, UHS VC Prof MH Mubbashar said the research had shown that people who smoke cannabis, their offspring had low IQ. He added that spiritual stimuli could improve our physical, spiritual as well as mental health."
Swiss govt launches 'greener' brick kiln tech in Capital,"ISLAMABAD - The Swiss government, in collaboration with local brick kilns' owners, has launched a new technology 'Vertical-Shaft Brick Kiln Technology' (Hi-VSBK) in the Capital which will enable brick kilns to use less energy with low level of air pollution. / After successful implementation of the 3rd generation of Vertical-Shaft Brick Kiln Technology (Hi-VSBK) in Nepal and a successful start in Afghanistan, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) commissioned Skat to transfer the 3G-VSBK technology to Pakistan./ According to official sources, the Energy Efficient Brick Production (EEBP) programme has been launched at Lohi Bher and 3G-VSBK new Chinese Technology is being used there for manufacturing bricks. The 3G-VSBK is a new Chinese brick manufacturing technology, combining with the energy efficient firing of the Vertical Kiln with the traditional slow cooling./ Firstly in 1996-7, this technology was introduced in Peshawar and Mardan on experimental bases but unfortunately the experience was flopped, as the local Bhatta owners and experts had rejected quality of bricks. ""We are working with three Bhatta owners at Lohi Bher and besides giving financial help of $ 14,000 to each of them, we are also offering them free of cost technical services,"" said a project Director of EEBP Thair Pervez while talking to TheNation here on Monday./ He described that during the five years of experience in Nepal, Afghanistan and India, the technology proved its high economic profitability due to high and uniform brick quality and coal savings of around 30-40 per cent. He informed that the Switzerland government under its programme named Climate Change Window funded the project./ It is also to be mentioned here that besides hundreds of smoke-emitting buses, cars and auto rickshaws that are plying on city roads without being checked by the concerned authorities, there are nearly 50 brick kilns in Rawalpindi and Islamabad jurisdiction, which are working with existing old technology./ According to the Environment Act, the brick kiln community is bound to follow the environment act of Pakistan. But unfortunately despite ban on rubber burning in kilns, the majority of brick kiln owners burn rubber to turn bricks red or yellow for cutting down their cost. About which experts informed that burnt rubber always produces sulphur dioxide that billows in the air and converts to sulphuric acid when it rains, and sulphuric acid is always dangerous for crops and aquatic life besides human life./ But despite the fact that the existing brick making technologies are creating environmental pollution, the devastating level of pollution has exposed the inability of government departments and non-government organisations to check it. On the other side, officials associated with the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-Epa) were of the view that they were looking for new technologies to produce bricks. Rafi Ullah, Deputy Director, ABCD project Pak-EPA who is also monitoring Energy Efficient Bricked Production program said that execution of new brick making techniques would not only reduced cost of brick kiln owners, but it would also helps to produce bricks with no air pollution. ""We are in contact with officials of EEBP and they are also continuously sharing their experiences with us regarding new technology and its results,"" he noted."
Smoke-emitting brick kilns to be shifted out of Capital,"ISLAMABAD - The Ministry of Interior is mulling over a comprehensive plan of shifting smoke-emitting brick kilns, surrounding Benazir Bhutto International Airport, to the outskirts of the Capital in a bid to make residential areas pollution free.  / Realising the fact that smoke emitting brick Kilns near Benazir Bhutto International Airport, Islamabad are causing air pollution depending on the wind direction and affecting visibility, the government has taken initiative and made an inclusive plan for relocating the brick kilns from the area./ TheNation has learnt on Friday that a plan is under consideration in the Ministry of Interior for relocating brick kilns of nearby areas of Benazir Bhutto International Airport./ In this regard the administration of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) has also constituted a committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Commissioner and worked out a phased plan for shifting the brick kilns from area./ According to details, in first phase about 12 brick kilns located in Red Zone very near to the Airport would be relocated, while about 20 brick kilns located beyond the Red Zone for from the Airport would be shifted in second phase. In third phase around 50 brick kilns located beyond the Red Zone far from the Airport would be shifted./ It was also learnt that two brick kilns adjacent to Airport were issued Environment Protection Orders to stop operation, of which one got stay order from the court./ A survey conducted in 2005 by the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), an implementation agency of the Ministry of Environment revealed that there were nearly 50 brick kilns in Rawalpindi and Islamabad jurisdiction, which are working with existing old technology and creating devastating level of air pollution./ But despite the fact that business of brick making with old techniques is increasing day-by-day, officials of the environment ministry were opined that presently they are considering for alternative options and want to introduce new technology./ While taking about appalling affects of existing methods of brick making, an official of the ministry informed that on directives of the Minister of Environment, official of the Pak-EPA is preparing a presentation on available options for averting smoke emitting brick kilns from jurisdiction of twin cities. / ""A meeting is going to be held with a week, in which officials of Pak-EPA would give detailed Presentation on alternative options for making brick kilns business pollution free to the Minster of Environment"", he source further added./ Sources also informed that adoption of new technology for making brick kilns, which would enable brick kilns owners to use less energy with low level of air pollution, is under consideration that would be examined in up coming meeting./ In this regard The Swiss government in collaboration launched the project with local brick kiln owners has launched an Energy Efficient Brick Production (EEBP) program at Lohi Bher and 3G-VSBK new Chinese Technology is also being used there for manufacturing bricks. / After successful implementation of the 3rd generation of Vertical-Shaft Brick Kiln Technology (Hi-VSBK) in Nepal and a successful start in Afghanistan, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) commissioned Skat to transfer the 3G-VSBK technology to Pakistan./ The 3G-VSBK is a new Chinese brick manufacturing technology, combining with the energy efficient firing of the Vertical Kiln with the traditional slow cooling. / Firstly in 1996-7, this technology was introduced in Peshawar and Mardan on experimental bases but unfortunately the experience was flopped, as the local Bhatta owners and experts had rejected quality of bricks."
Cleaner environment necessary to develop sports anisuddin khan," Gulzar Feroz, a senior tennis player and Chairman Standing Committee on Environment FPCCI has underscored the importance of creating a better and cleaner environment which in turn, he said, would help in the promotion of sports and development of a healthy society./He was speaking here on Saturday at a reception hosted by Pakistan Senior Tennis Association (PSTA) to congratulate him on being awarded Tamghe-e-Imtiaz for his services to the promotion of a cleaner environment.  Chairman of PSTA Saeed Hai, President Jamal Mirza, Secretary Khalid Rehmani, former Davis cupper Altaf Hussain, and a number of friends attended the reception. Gulzar Feroz is also President of Karachi STA. Jamal Mirza lauded his efforts in promoting senior tennis by inviting friends to sponsor events in Karachi./Gulzar Feroz, who also heads Pakistan Tanner's association environment committee in Landhi and Korangi Industrial area, said there is no doubt playing grounds were important for the promotion of sports, but better and cleaner environment was also essential for the development of sports and healthy activities. One could not improve without the development of the other, he pointed out./He drew attention to the fact that better sportsmen were produced in a clean /neighborhood with ample playing facilities. In Karachi and elsewhere in the country there were a number of playing facilities, parks and playgrounds but they were not being fully utilised because the environment was not as clean as the society wanted it to be in most of those areas where these facilities exist./He said society in general and urban centers in particular with large number of industries and road traffic faced greater challenges on environment.  The Pakistan Tanners Association, he said, had taken measures to clean the environment by constructing affluent treatment plants in recent years. Such a plant was constructed some years ago to treat the affluent discharged by the tanners located in Landhi Korangi Industrial area. There was need of creating more facilities but due to red tape some projects were still lying in the files but hoped things would move faster in the future with greater awareness of the need for creating better and cleaner environment./He said a number of industries in SITE area of Karachi had also on self-help basis or with the support of the govenment launched a number of schemes to treat industrial waste. The efforts made so far were laudable but, he said, much was still needed to be done in that direction./Efforts were also needed to work on reducing air pollution on city roads all over the country and particularly in Karachi where large number of mostly old buses, taxies, private cars and rickshaws emit smoke causing degradation of the environment./He said not much could be achieved to the improve environment without the support of society in general, the government and other stakeholders."
Pb Govt fails to achieve environment targets,"  The year 2009 designated by government for environment protection initiatives is ending without achieving most of its objectives in Punjab where 66,000 industrial units along with other pollutants are operating in the folds of residential areas in violation of environmental laws. Yet no concrete steps have been taken to control the release of toxic industrial effluents, chemical waste, emissions, smoke, air poisoning, noise, dust particles and lethal gases in the towns of Punjab, which pose a serious threat to life in the urban areas of the province. /Besides, traffic smoke and noise, another big threat to environment, is also mounting undeterred due to poor planning and multiplication of road traffic in big cities including Lahore. It has been learnt that out of 66,000 industries about 5,000 factories including chemical factories, tanneries and stone crushing units, have been identified as ""highly problematic"" for clean environment in areas of pure air, water and soil. The dangerous factories are shrewdly ignoring the warnings of Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) on one pretext or the other. /The EPD has not gathered any mass till now, except some slow-paced attempts for awakening awareness in the public especially school children, about potential environment hazards which are looming large on urban life. /""EPD and NGOs funded by it could not even conduct awareness walks and seminars as much as planed for year 2009 mainly on account of security concerns,"" an official revealed on Thursday. Talking about the performance of EPD in 2009 officials revealed that the department was working in low profile because till now Rs500 million funds allocated for Punjab environment department for budget 2009-10 have not been released. ""Only partly payments have been made for few projects, which included ongoing projects of financial year 2008-09,"" they said. /EPD sources confided to The Nation that under a development scheme the EPA funded about 97 NGOs in 2008 and 501 NGOs in 2009 for working in various sectors along with EPD to protect environment and most of the NGOs in the programme were given funds for creating awareness in public about environment. /They said the NGOs working at district level all over Punjab have got Rs26 million in last two years in instalments from EPD but their performance is yet to be assessed in their respective sectors. /The sectors in which the EPD funded NGOs are working include management of municipal solid waste, disposal of sewage water, supply of drinking water, promotion of environmental awareness among masses, promotion of awareness among drivers, community regarding vehicular pollution, promotion of awareness among youth in educational institutes and public, encouraging recycling and reuse of municipal waste and industrial solid waste, prevention of air pollution, tree plantations for improving air quality, teachers training on environment degradation, promoting renewable energy and other environment issues. /Sources said the activities of these NGOs remained very low in year 2009 on the pretext of security concerns. /Naseemur Rehman, Media Advisor Environment Department, told The Nation that NGOs which are working with the EPD are registered with the government under Social Welfare Agencies Registration Act 1984. He admitted that performance of the NGO concerned is not satisfactory. He said EPD worked on ending water and soil pollution by tanneries and stones crushing factories in 2009. He said in 301 tanneries in Sialkot are being shifted out of city due to the efforts of EPD and in this regard land has been purchased by Sialkot Tanneries Association./Punjab Environment Protection Agency Secretary Sajjad Saleem Hotiana told The Nation that in 2009 EPD worked on several areas such as disposal of solid waste, conducted study of water body of Ravi where a water treatment plant is being installed to stop discharge of untreated sewerage water in the river. /""We are monitoring industries effluents waste all over Punjab and challans of the industries, which are committing violation Pakistan environment protection Act 1997 are being sent to tribunals for proceedings,"" the secretary said. /He said the working of NGOs funded by EPD is being assessed and if any NGO fails to serve the purpose it will be dropped.

Milk retailers summoned over contempt of court,"  Sindh High Court on Tuesday summoned the milk retailer's association and others on contempt of court application over fixing the milk rate in the next hearing to be fixed later. /The divisional bench of SHC comprising Justice Mushir Alam and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi issued notice to the respondents seeking explanation over the application filed by City District Government Karachi against non-implementation of the court direction to fix the milk rate as the Chief Secretary had allocated it./Citing the All Karachi Milk Sellers and Retailers Welfare Association and others in the application, the plaintiff submitted that despite issuing the court direction to set the price of milk, the retailer were still violating the court's order for not following it./The applicant submitted that the court had fixed the rate to the retailers to Rs 37, but they are still taking charge of Rs 8 extra in per litre. Explanation sought over encroachment of plot  allocated for bus-terminal In another case, the same bench directed Chief Secretary Sindh to submit its report over progress on the plot allocated for the inter-city bus terminal in the next hearing to a date in office. /The bench conducted the hearing on two different constitutional petitions moved by Kazi Ali Athar and Islam Hussain over the encroachments across the metropolitan by the intercity bus terminal as well as releasing voice and hair pollutions by unfit public transports. /EDO Law CDGK, Manzoor Ahmed appeared before the court where he told that the land that had been primarily allocated for the bus terminal by the provincial government was unscrupulously occupied by mafia. /On the query of the court; he replied that the authorised graveyard was established on the most of the part of land./""It's strange that a graveyard was set up overnight, how was it possible. Such strange claims show that the CDGK is not serious to establish intercity bus terminal"" said the court while its observation over the arguments of the CDGK's representative.   /The court after hearing his comments directed the Chief Secretary to submit its report pertaining to intercity bus terminal before the said court and threatened that otherwise, the court will give its judgment without considering the comments of the CDGK. /Petition separated over  poor vehicle's Pollution  Besides, on the request of one of the plaintiffs Kazi Ali Athar, the court separated his petition as it highlighted the pollutions released by the public transports. He submitted that the public transports released over one lac seventy five thousands tone toxic gasses in the metropolitan. He pointed out in his petition that the two-stroke engine vehicles contributed major share of air pollution, these vehicles account for about sixty percent of the motor vehicle, resulting in adverse health effects, particularly for urban dwellers. Such vehicles caused hydrocarbon emissions, besides visible smoke./The poor condition vehicles maintenance, misuse of lubricants, and adulteration of gasoline exacerbate emissions from these vehicles. Emissions from existing 2-stroke gasoline engines can be reduced by using the correct type and quantity of lubricant, improving vehicle maintenance and using the quality of gasoline. Such unfit vehicles used to release one lac seventy five thousands nine hundred and thirty five tone different toxic gasses, those comprised several kind of toxic gasses.  /He pleaded to seize the old and unfitted vehicles, while issue direction to the vehicles manufacturing companies to install CNG kits to all the vehicles, he also prayed to establish five other centres for the fitness checking as only fitness checking centre is operating.  /EDO summoned over contempt of court/Another divisional bench consisting Chief Justice Sarmad Jalal Usmany and Justice Sajjar Ali Shah issued notice to EDO education CDGK and Education Officer of Karimabad over contempt of court on the application moved by a HST teacher till December 23./The HST teacher Saiqa Aziz filed an application for not following the SHC direction to pay her salaries as per required his promotion. /The applicant submitted that the said court on her constitutional petition had issued direction to issue her same salaries as she was provided after her promotion as HST teacher. She submitted that on Jun 18, 2008, she was promoted as HST from JST and her salary was also increased as per her promotion. /On March 21 2009, she was reversed to her previous position as JST and similarly her salary has also been decreased. /Furthering her statement, she said that the court had directed the concerned department to issue the same salary to her, but so far the direction has not been implemented."
Air pollution sets alarm bells in City,"  The air quality reports prepared by the Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) indicate that ambient air in most parts of the metropolis has become seriously polluted and it is increasing the ratio of lung diseases and infections in the general public. /The EPD has proposed to City District Government, TEPA and transport department to take appropriate steps to stop increase in the ratio of lethal gases emission from vehicles and other toxic effluents damaging the environment mostly in congested areas of the City./The data of EPD collected during 2007 to 2009 reveals that emission of compound pollutant gases including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitro oxides (NO2), methane gas/ hydro carbons (MGHC) respiratory dust (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and other pollutants are on the rise in major areas of the City. /Official said major source of the air pollution is the higher density of traffic on roads, emission of lethal gases, poor motor examination system, traffic jams and industrial waste in the urban limits. /The experts revealed the respiratory dust (PM2.5) present in the air is most dangerous for citizens who are inhaling the electronically detectable dust particles, which cause lung diseases and serious throat infections besides flu and aliments of chest and nose. The emission of gases in winter is more harmful as they remain in the breathing range of the air./According to the Environment Protection Act 1997, air pollutant means any substance that causes pollution of air and includes soot, smoke, dust particles, odor, light, electro-magnetic radiation, heat, fumes, combustion exhaust, exhaust gases, noxious gases, hazardous substances and radioactive substances which may threaten human health and affect quality of life./The EPD officials said two ambient air quality-monitoring stations are working 24 hours in Lahore in Town Hall and Township while one mobile air quality monitoring station moves in all parts of the City for studying the level of pollution in the air. The reports are sent to the respective stakeholders on weekly basis for necessary actions and urban planning work. Similarly, air quality stations are working in Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar and Quetta for the air study. /The EPD has requested the ministry of environment to notify the vehicular emission standards for Nox, SO2, and HC fro vehicles, which are yet to be made for taking action against vehicles for various violations of the environment. /Besides, the EPD has asked the ministry of petroleum and gas through ministry of environment to reduce the sulfur content in the fuel, which is basic cause of higher amount of vehicular soot and smoke on roads. In addition, the EPD proposed to introduce pay principle in vehicular emission. /""The traffic engineering mechanism should be developed for smooth, uninterrupted vehicular movement and motor repair workshops having facilities of emission testing in the City"" the EPD recommended in one of its reports. /EPD Director General Dr Shagufta Shahjahan told The Nation the environment protection department had dispatched reports and studies regarding proportions of air pollution in the City to the three stakeholders: city district government, transport department and TEPA:  with regard to formulation of the strategies for controlling pollution in the City. /Dr Shagufta Shahjahan stressed it was responsibility of the said stakeholders to make polices for controlling traffic density on roads to help reduce air pollution in the City. "
Nuisance of generators plague City life,"  As loadshedding continues in City again with all its might, nuisance of generators has once again plagued the residential and commercial localities causing noise and air pollution besides barricading way for the pedestrians. Most of the generators are creating more than 100 decibels noise against normal level of 70 decibels trigging alarming noise pollution in the City. A number of commercial buildings, including banks, restaurants, offices and retail shops, have placed heavy generators outside their premises or on footpaths. One can witness hundreds of generators running simultaneously in commercial markets like Liberty Market, Icchra, Anarkali and many other markets when there is power outage. /Lahorites are already facing serious threats from the rising level of noise pollution on different city roads and crossings especially on Ferozpur Road, Multan Road, Jail Road, The Mall, Canal Road, Wahdat Road and Circular Road, the generators have been playing their nasty role. /One can hear the heavy noise of generators in almost every street in the provincial capital and the people residing in flats in commercial markets are having serious problems with the noise and smoke. In most of the commercial areas, people place their generators either outside their premises or at the footpath so that they can save themselves from the noise. A very thin majority has also placed heavy generators at their rooftops or at the backside of their business areas. According to the traders, the main reason for placing generators outside their business areas is lack of space. It is pertinent to mention that majority of the users have not installed silencers on their generators, besides using diesel generators. /Moreover majority of the commercial entrepreneurs do not get any no objection certificate (NOC) from the Environmental Protection Department (EPD). A senior EPD official said commercial and industrial entrepreneurs are bound to get an NOC from the department. /He said the department had already directed the telecommunication companies installing BTS Towers in the province to give priority to UPS system at their sites. /He said the second priority was gas generators while the diesel generators were the last choice. ""In case of a diesel generator, the company is bound to install silencer and other equipment on the generator to control its sound and as well as emissions,"" he maintained, adding that the noise released from the generators should not be more than 70 decibels. /District Officer (Environment) Tariq Zaman said the generators, place outside the premises of a business, were considered encroachments and the City District Government was going to start a campaign against the heavy generators. He said the Environment Department received a number of complaints regarding the issue. Meanwhile, the market is now flooded with Chinese generators. Japanese generators are qualitatively superior but the price difference is too vast. There is a marked price difference between Chinese and Japanese brands. The quality conscious buyers still prefer Japanese generators. /A 500-watt Japanese generator is priced at Rs50,000 as compared to Rs20,000-30,000 for a Chinese generator. The price of a one-KVA generator of Chinese brand ranges between Rs30,000 and Rs40,000, as against Rs70,000 for a Japanese generator. /Similarly, a two-KVA Japanese generator can be purchased at Rs1,00,000 as against Rs50,000 for a Chinese generator, depending on make and quality. "
Prolonged dry spell causing severe dust allergy,"  Prevailing long dry spell coupled with massive construction activities has resulted in enormous increase of dust particles adversely affecting air and water quality hence causing severe health problems./For years, air pollution in Islamabad was caused mainly by pollen particles from its plentiful mulberry trees and by emissions from the Industrial Area./Vehicles and other big and small businesses such as the brick kilns along the Islamabad Highway, the stone quarrying activities at the Margalla Hills National Park and cement plants also cause air pollution. Recently, air pollution situation in the Capital has been aggravated by land clearing activities. /Digging for road construction and other development projects also enhances dust particles in the atmosphere./Subsequently, the city that was designed to provide a healthy climate, pollution free atmosphere, plenty of water and lush green area have lost its charm because of the deteriorating environmental situation and economic activities, which have given birth to high-rise buildings, residential apartments, housing schemes, industrial units and new markets. The situation can be gauged from the fact that the significant sits of the Capital could not be clearly seen because of the presence of elevated dust pollution./Available statistics of Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) with TheNation revealed that air pollution level in the country's most populated cities are the highest because of the presence of elevated dust and smoke particles in the air. Data pointed out the presence of high-suspended Particulate Matter in the air of major cities. The very fine Particular Matters (PM2.5) of size 2.5 micron and below were found as high as three times the safe standards (35 microgram/m3) at Lahore. Recorded average pollution level of major cities revealed that Peshawar and Islamabad are also highly polluted cities. /Dust or particles, known as PM-10 and comprising a broad class of chemically and physically diverse substances that exist as particles with a diameter less than or equal to 10 microns, is hazardous to health./According to health experts these health effects include acute respiratory illness, premature death, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function./It is to be mentioned here that the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has come up with Environmental Protection Regulation aimed at averting air and water pollution by adopting effective measures. However, official sources close to the development consider the said authority as violators of the environmental laws because of the massive construction activities with cutting of trees and dust pollution, lack of proper solid waste system in the twin cities and water pollution in absence of proper sewerage system./The situation has become more aggravated owing to the ineffective role of Environment Ministry and its attached departments in implementing environmental laws."
The return of the smog," Amid all the cold, perhaps the only reassurance is that the West, which at the best of times is colder than us, is having one of its worst winters in many years. And the badness of the weather is not limited to one country or the other, but the bad weather is spread across continents, not just the countries they are divided into. The weather over here is not particularly bad, just generally, and is running at par for an early January in which there has not been any rain yet. However, this is as much a sign of global warming as the weather in the West, for by now there should have been rains breaking the winter snap. The absence of winter rains has not meant the spreading of the flu it normally does, though I don't know why that hasn't happened. It might have something to do with the swine flu reaching Lahore, but I certainly am not sure about that./However, one of the things that winter has brought to this city, and which has arrived as certainly as the rains have not, has been fog. Nobody waited for Lahore's fogs to become like London's old peasoupers, which developed as the city grew, and switched over to coalfires. But not just Lahore, the whole of the old Punjab, developed fog in past years, fog unknown, as any old-timer, indeed any adult, will testify, in their youth. Lahore was never really known for the clarity of its air, but it never before knew fogs. The fog was actually smog, the unholy mixture of water droplets and smoke that bedevils so many large cities. This is mainly caused by air pollution, which in turn is caused by too many vehicles burning too much fuel. And not just vehicles, but factories and power plants and everything else, and not just oil, but any fuel based on carbon, except gas. Burning gas is not non-polluting, but since gas burns completely, it's a whole lot less polluting than petrol or furnace oil. In fact, gas is much less polluting than wood, which is still used in areas which don't have Sui gas, to provide fuel for heating and cooking. And if you don't have a geyser for hot water, then a stove can't be beaten for heating the water./But the smog was supposed to be fading into obscurity with the conversion of so much transport, both private and public, to CNG. However, after the government's shutting down the pumps for two days a week, the CNG Dealers Association decided to shut down for an indefinite period, and CNG was not to be had anywhere. The fog had been beaten back a little, but now, while it had not yet come back, the gas guzzling that had called it forth came back perforce, and the stage was set for the return of the fog. Now we don't know if the fog we are witnessing every night is the smog of yore (well, last year) back with a vengeance or whether it's just the left-overs from previous years' pollution, but that there is some around is not deniable./But then, who's denying the fog? Not when they can deny that there is any CNG crisis, except that created by the dealers themselves. But no one seems to have said so yet, because they are too busy dousing the flames of sectarianism that are being raised in Karachi. It seems it's all happening over there, with political killings being interrupted by a house being blown up, perhaps by militants. Anyway, the militants had already struck in Karachi with the Ashura blast and the ensuing violence. One of the significant things about Karachi was how things only got worse with Rehman Malik around. Well, somebody should have told the Sindh government that he was the wrong man to bring in if they wanted matters calmed down. The authorities in Lahore should also note, in case there ever is an untoward situation over here: don't bring Rehman Malik here. If he decides to come anyhow, stop him. Tell him anything, like telling him to go straight to Sialkot district. Learn something from Karachi./But while the common impression is that no one benefits from the cold, Sui Northern chose just now to push up rates. That's a little like WAPDA, though there are probably fewer electric heaters now than gas heaters. However, there's some electricity loadshedding, as well as gas. If this is the situation in winter, then just think about what is going to happen in summer. And I'll leave you with that thought to warm you, presuming nothing else has."
Kilns owners to use new emission control technology,"  Government has unveiled a plan of adopting emission control technology for smoke-emitting brick kilns surrounding the Benazir Bhutto International Airport in a bid to make the residential area pollution-free./The smoke-emitting brick kilns near Benazir Bhutto International Airport, are causing air pollution depending on the wind direction and affecting visibility, besides placing negative effect on environment and general heath./Realising the fact the implementation agency of the Ministry of Environment, Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (PAK-EPA) is considering alternative options and in process of adopting modern technology for minimising effect of the smoke caused by the brick kilns. In this regard, a meeting was held earlier this week and attended by officials of the Pak-EPA and General Secretary Bhatta owners, Ikram Chaudhry./On the occasion the representative of Bhatta owners agreed on adopting Indian technology suggested by the agency's officials. They said they agreed on adopting new technology or any other plan suggested by the government. He also assured that the bhatta owners would cooperate with regard to the Capital Development Authority's (CDA) plan of compensating brick kilns owners, so that they could shift their business to some other area./Option of adopting Indian technology for making brick kilns that could enable brick kilns owners to use less energy with low level of air pollution, would be examined in the upcoming meeting./Earlier, the Swiss government in collaboration with the local brick kiln owners had launched an Energy Efficient Brick Production (EEBP) programme at Lohi Bher, where they used 3G-VSBK new Chinese Technology for manufacturing bricks. But so far, the plan could not be implemented on a large scale./It is to be mentioned here that in the past the government had taken diverse initiatives and made inclusive plans for relocating the brick kilns from the area, but to no avail. /According to details, the Ministry of Interior had made a comprehensive plan of shifting smoke-emitting brick kilns, surrounding Benazir Bhutto International Airport, to the outskirts of the capital. In this backdrop the administration of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) had also constituted a committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Commissioner and worked out a phased plan for shifting the brick kilns from area. In the first phase, about 12 brick kilns located in red zone near the Airport would be relocated, while about 20 brick kilns located beyond the red zone far from the airport would be shifted in the second phase./In third phase, around 50 brick kilns located beyond the red zone far from the airport would be shifted./It is also learnt that two brick kilns adjacent to the airport were issued Environment Protection Orders to stop operation against which one got stay from the court./A survey conducted in 2005 by the PAK-EPA revealed that there were nearly 50 brick kilns in Rawalpindi and Islamabad jurisdiction, which were still working using old technology and creating devastating level of air pollution."
Plant native trees to fight pollution,"  Native species of tall and shady trees including Pipal, Barghad, Siris, Toot and Neem are needed today to fight the monster of environmental pollution that has become a global threat. /It is the height of apathy that native trees are on the verge of becoming extinct due to the present fashion of planting small-sized bushy plants, which scarcely have the power to fight pollutant gases. /According to a research, tall and shady trees having high canopy absorb pollutant gases a hundred times more than the in-fashioned small-sized bushy species of various plants, which have replaced the tall trees of the past. /The decorative plants do not help fight air pollution as they are small-sized and not on the height where trees and gases could interact. /The Environment Protection Department (EPD) Punjab has made a list of 32 'Pollution Abating Trees', which belong to the native species of the trees found in the Punjab a couple of decades ago. The EPD has sent the list of the environment-friendly trees to various departments including the Punjab Forest Department to promote the culture of planting tall trees in order to save environment. As its recommendations, the EPD said the native trees be planted in housing societies, on the banks of canals and by the sides of roads. /EPA Director General Dr Shagufta Shahjehan told this scribe that it was unfortunate that native trees of the Punjab were becoming extinct despite the fact that the same trees could help us fight air pollution. /She said the Environment Department conducted a research about the native trees in collaboration with a team of botanical experts. The research found that the trees of the past were friends of mankind and environment. She said the trend of planting decorative plants in urban areas had no benefit./The recommendation for promoting tall trees has been sent to the Director General Lahore Development Authority (LDA), Director General Highway Authority, Secretary Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries, Managing Director TEPA, Chief Engineer TEPA, Secretary Communication & Works Department and Secretary Government of Punjab, Local Government & Rural Development Lahore. /The pollution abating trees (PAT) are Siris, Pipal, Shisham, Barh, Barghad, Bakin, Toot, Neem, Alstonia, Samandar Phal, Kachnar, Bottle Brush, Toon, Amaltas, Gul Mohar, Gul-e-Nishtar, Jaman, Gular, Beeri Patta, Gul Fanoos, Magnolia, Moulsari, Sukh Chaen, Poplar, Dinner Plate, Putajan, Sagwan, Arjun, Bahera, Harar and Ber. Researches have proved that trees act as the purifiers of the environment by producing oxygen, absorbing carbon dioxide, reducing noise pollution and controlling temperature./The report further says the environmental degradation costs our country 6 per cent of the GDP, which is Rs365billion per year. /Surge in diseases, cost of medicine and medical treatment is result of air pollution. In Pakistan air pollution contributes to 50 per cent of premature mortalities. It can be reduced with native trees if these are planted in the City limits and in houses. "
"EPD, PHA to plant 150,000 saplings in City","  Some private companies in collaboration with Punjab Environment Protection Department will plant in the city 150,000 trees of indigenous species like Pipal, Barghad, Siris, Toot and Neem to combat environmental pollution. /Under the initiative the private companies will buy 5 feet to 6 feet size plants saplings, which will be provided to Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) for planting them in the city. /This was decided at a meeting at Environment Protection Department (EPD) on Wednesday, which agreed in principle to plant traditional trees instead of decoration plant in a bid to control air pollution in the metropolis. /Director General PHA Abdul Jabbar Shaheen, EPD Secretary Sajjad Saleem Hotiana, Director General (DG) Dr Shahgufta Shahjehan and a number of representatives of the private companies attended the meeting. The trees will be planted at roads, canal, parks, markets and any available space in the city. The companies will spend Rs 50 to 200 per plant. /Under the plan Nestle Pakistan will buy 30,000 saplings of native plants, Ali combines, a glassware company, 5,000 plants, Sabbari Plastics 30,000 plants, National Transmission and Dispatch Company 30,000 plants, Berger Paints 25,000, Khawaja Steel 5000 and Brighto Paints 20,000 plants. /According to EPD's research, the native trees being tall and shady with high canopy absorb pollutant gases 100 times more than the in-fashion style small-sized bushy species of various types of plants, which have replaced the tall trees of the past./In a report, the EPD recommended that old species of tall and shady trees including Pipal, Barghad, Siris, Toot and Neem are needed in the present times to fight the monster of atmospheric pollution and environmental degradation that has become a global threat./The decorative plants do not help fight the air pollution because it is on the height that trees and gases interaction and pollutant gases are purified in the interaction./The EPD has made a list of 32 ""Pollution Abating Trees"" which belong to the native species of the trees found in Punjab a couple of decade ago. The EPD circulated the list of the environment friendly trees to various departments including Punjab Forest Department to promote and plant the tall trees. /EPA DG Dr Shahgufta Shahjehan told this scribe that EPD had prepared a list of old species of native trees of Punjab which are known as Pollution Abating Trees (PAT). As per EPD recommendations the companies agreed to help plant the same trees in the metropolis in the first stage. Later the trees will be planted all over Punjab, she said revealing details of the meeting./She said the PHA will start planting the trees in just 15 days after the companies buy 5 to 6 feet saplings of the trees from nurseries across Punjab. /She said the trees would act as the purifiers of the environment by producing oxygen, absorbing CO2, reducing noise pollution and controlling temperature./The EPD DG said surge in diseases, cost of medicine and medical treatment is result of air pollution. The total damage cost including premature mortality the share of air pollution is 50 per cent and it can be reduced with native trees if these are planted in city limits and in houses."
Smoke-emitting brick kilns under observation,"  Ministry of Environment is in the process of monitoring smoke emitting brick kilns near Benazir Bhutto International Airport, causing air pollution and affecting visibility of the aeroplanes./It has been learnt from the concerned officials within Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), attached department of the Ministry of Environment, that they have completed monitoring of almost half of brick kilns of the area./Soon after completing the monitoring process, they further informed, they would formulate a comprehensive strategy for making residential area pollution free./ ""It is a possibility to close down brick kilns that are not matching with the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS)"", they added./Other concerned sources revealed that the brick kilns owners were demanding compensation for relocating their business to some other place, and it was not possible for the Government to pay them such heavy amount./It is to be mentioned here that the high ups of the Ministry often receive a number of complaints about environmental pollution caused by brick kilns, which emit thick black smoke exceeding the permissible limits. /After providing opportunity to the brick Kiln owners to explain their version, the high ups of the Agency had decided that the brick kiln owners were unable to control pollution. Therefore under section 16 of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997, they issued notice to close down the operation of brick kilns immediately, falling under the Red Zone (near to Benazir Bhutto International Airport)./Besides other measures, it was also proposed to close down 12 brick kilns near to the Airport by year 2009, closure of 30 brick kilns lying in orange zone (within ICT) by year 2012 and closing of 50 brick kiln (outer periphery of ICT) by year 2015.  The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had also been perusing the matter since long to close down these brick kilns, as visibility at the airport runway was being affected due to emission of smoke. /In order to overcome pollution caused by brick kiln business, several other plans were made in the past, but all those remained unsuccessful./According to the details from the Ministry of Interior, a comprehensive plan of shifting smoke-emitting brick kilns, surrounding Benazir Bhutto International Airport, to the outskirts of the Capital was also under consideration./It has also been learnt that the administration of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) had also constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Commissioner and was working out a phased plan for shifting the brick kilns from the area. However, despite these efforts the positive results in this regard could not have been achieved even yet."
Monitoring of brick kilns near airport completed," Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), an attached department of the Ministry of Environment has completed monitoring of smoke emitting brick kilns surrounding the Benazir Bhutto International Airport for making effective strategy that would help in minimising pollution level from the area./The smoke-emitting brick kilns near Benazir Bhutto International Airport, are causing air pollution depending on the wind direction and affecting visibility, besides placing negative effect on environment and general heath./Realising the fact PAK-EPA is considering alternative options and in process of adopting modern technology for minimising effect of the smoke caused by the brick kilns./The team of the Federal Environment Protection Agency that was in process of monitoring brick kilns falling in the area has completed monitoring process./An official within the concerned department told TheNation that the monitoring has been completed and now they are in process of making comprehensive strategy for averting pollution level caused by smoke emitting brick kilns. He also informed that so far they have decided to suggest measures to owners of the smoke emitting brick kilns. /Another concerned official opined that complete closer of the smoke emitting brick kilns, or relocating them to some other place is not possible task, as the brick kilns owners are demanding compensation for relocating their business to some other place and it is not possible for the Government to pay them such heavy amount./That's why, he continued that the owners of the brick kilns, which emit thick black smoke exceeding the permissible limits would be suggested measures for minimising pollution level. It is to be mentioned here that in past under section 16 of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997, officials of the Federal Environment Protection Agency (PAK-EPA) issued notice to close down the operation of brick kilns immediately, falling under the Red Zone (near to Benazir Bhutto International Airport)./Besides other measures, it was also proposed to close down 12 brick kilns near to the Airport by year 2009, closure of 30 brick kilns lying in orange zone (within ICT) by year 2012 and closing of 50 brick kiln (outer periphery of ICT) by year 2015."
Protecting mother earth," The US President, Barack Obama, on assumption of office on Jan 26, 2009, spoke on global warming and climate change, and signed a memorandum to stress strict limitations for emission of greenhouse gases. And on the 40th anniversary of Earth Day 2010, he urged the new generation to carry on the Earth Summit agenda by planting trees in the communities. /In South America, in the late 1800s, the emperor of Brazil established Tijuca forest at Rio de Janeiro (the venue of Earth Summit 1992) and set a unique example of the emperor's pursuit of  reforestation and love for nature. The emperor ordered some more than 100,000 trees to be planted to replace coffee plantations for the city park. Puerto Rico, another South American country provides yet another example of the king's interest in forests and the good use of degraded lands. The forests cover in the country grew from 9% in 1900 to about 35% in the 80s- a success story that could well be emulated by countries like Pakistan with more than 60% of its land degraded and facing currently the worst havoc of torrential rains that warrants reforestation to avert floods and soil erosion. In 1957, China's initiative to build the ""Great Green Wall of China"" -a shelter belt of trees to protect Beijing against sand storms from Gobi desert, bode also well for biodiversity and the Ozonosphere./Plants, trees and greenery have been an integral part of American life. On a complaint by an elevator operator of the White House that the park nearest to his house was too far for his family to visit, the then first lady of America, Pat Nixon initiated a programme called ""Parks to the people"" for all towns and cities in the US in the 60s, while in 1970 President Nixon proclaimed the last Friday of April every year as the National Arbor Day: a day to plant trees in the country. And later, through an executive order, Nixon established the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that demonstrated President's explicit concern for environment. /At the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil, in June 1992, President George Bush endorsed the idea of establishing a National Centre of Biodiversity at Smithsonian Institute in US to take into account the widespread information on biodiversity and to lead in understanding and communication of biodiversity information. The idea lay in cold storage till Bill Clinton assumed presidency and worked it through. In contrast, by burning oil wells in the Gulf War in Iraq in 2002, President Bush, a self designated ""Environmental President"" contributed to air pollution to the extent that a massive flora and fauna was destroyed in the region and elsewhere. In addition, the smoke and dust that traveled as far as the mountains of Himalayas darkened its cliffs with ""black snow"" that mourns the death of the silver white look that these cliffs once wore. Although the earth summit agenda was non binding, the former continues to focus attention on global environmental issues and has paved way to future agreements./The former US President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore (author of the Nobel Prize winning documentary on environment titled ""An inconvenient truth"") are known for green initiatives. According to a gallop held recently in the US about 80%, Americans call themselves ""environmentalists"". National parks in the country serve to mitigate deforestation and a model for the maintenance of biodiversity to ensure sustainable development. /In the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, the rule of the Moghul emperors could aptly be termed, in its own right, a green chapter in the history of environment. The famous Shalimar Gardens at Lahore, the Taj Mahal at Agra, India, and many others in the region bear witness to the aesthetics of the Muslim emperors for nature. /During a visit to the Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology, Faisalabad, in March, 2000 (where the first author was director ), Nobel Laureate Professor Norman Borlaug remembered the late President Ayub Khan of Pakistan for his contribution to afforestation and helping in  coining the term ""Green revolution"". Ayub Khan is known for rehabilitation of forests through aerial seeding of forest lands in the country. Presently, the government has assured the international community of covering six to seven percent of its forest land by plantations by 2015. Forest cover in a small country in the region e.g. Bhutan, for instance, is over 60% of the total geographical area of the country./The enormity of beneficiaries from forests and parks could be judged from the services in terms of preservation of watershed and prevention of floods, perils of drought downstream and modulation of climate. How-ever, population growth, pollution and climate change, all on the rise are likely to combine to decrease the world water supplies in coming years, says the World Water Development Report 2008./The immense devastation wrought by the current floods in the country is a case study of the backdrop of the heaviest felling of trees over the years and unhindered flow of floodwaters. While the shortage of fresh water in the country underscores the necessity of reforestation, among other measures such as agroforestry, zero tillage etc., and small dams, the wide spread alluvial deposits on the soil surface and leaching of salts from the barren lands, point to a much greater necessity of plantations. Be it a CCC American prototype or a GCUF one- student one- tree approach, it could be a step in right direction now, should all planners, policy makers, legislators, environmentalists, engineers, administrators etc., involved with rehabilitation and resource renewability in the country took cognizance of it.    /Professors at the Government College University (GCUF), and the Government College for Women, Madina Town, Faisa-labad."
Government fails to control spread of infectious diseases," Citizens have become easy target of infectious diseases in the metropolis, as the Provincial Government has failed to get control over the spread of infectious diseases, especially dengue fever, malaria, viral fever and conjunctivitis, in the city. /Dengue fever and malaria, caused by mosquito species, are on the rise in the city but the authorities concerned have yet to hold any effective fumigation drive and cleanliness campaign in the city to eradicate mosquitoes, stinking stagnant water and heaps of dirt. It is also worth mentioning that as many as six cases of Congo virus have so far been reported in the city during March to September 2010, out of which three patients have died. /The first case was reported in March at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH). According to the claims of private health facilities, hundreds of citizens with complaints of dengue fever, malaria, viral fever and conjunctivitis are rushing to these health facilities in the city. According to the claims, these patients largely depend on OPD sections, while in case of severity of the diseases patients are admitted to public or private hospitals. ""Last year around 600,000 cases of malaria were reported in the country, which shows the prevalence of the disease in the country,"" Dr Habib-ur-Rehman Somroo, Central Secretary General Pakistan Medical Association, told TheNation on Sunday. /He said that people are dying of different diseases in the metropolis and country as well, caused by poor sanitation and meagre health facilities. The Government and concerned authorities are just trying to show their performance only on papers, he said and added that this was prime responsibility of the Health Department to aware people about the precautionary measure of infectious diseases especially dengue and malaria. He claimed that corruption was the main hurdle in the smooth working of the health department. He said, ""From August to the end of October dengue and malaria remained on the rise. Rainy days are specific for breeding of mosquitoes causing dengue fever, the heavy torrential rains in the province helped activating victors (eggs) of the mosquitoes; the rainy season have created new breeding pools, breeding of mosquitoes, in the city that would be multiplied if the water of these pools did not drained properly. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with any one of the four dengue viruses."" Medics are of the views that air pollution and dusty environment cause the infection among the people, who are affected with the fever and other diseases by the intake of contaminated water or food or by direct contact with affected person./In-charge Provincial Dengue Surveillance Cell Dr Shakil Malik told TheNation as many as 21 new patients suspected with dengue fever had been admitted to different public and private hospitals in the city, while total 78 patients are admitted in various public and private health facilities, including Civil Hospital Karachi, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital, Anklesaria Hospital, Ziauddin Hospital, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center hospital, Qatar Hospital, Sindh Government Hospital Saudaabad, LNH, NIBD, Karachi Adventist, Kutyna Memon Hospital, Fatima Bai Hospital, Patel General Hospital, OMI Hospital, Holy Family Hospital, OT Hospital etc./He said, ""As many as 664 dengue suspected have been reported since January 01, 2010, out of which 443 cases were found positive. The disease has claimed lives of five patients this year.""/When Sindh Secretary Health Hashim Zaidi was contacted by TheNation on his mobile phone, he said that he was in funeral ceremony and could not pass comments on the issue. On the other hand, Special Secretary Health Dr Abdul Majid did not attend the call when contacted. "
Making the planet a better place!," The GCC-Asia relationship is built upon a foundation of mostly economic and trade-based exchanges. But what does it hold for the environment and what can we do so that these relations can benefit environmental causes? Environmental issues have attained global significance It is no longer effective to work in isolation on the problem; sharing knowledge on environmental management and having joint projects between countries is probably the first step towards a holistic solution. /Although global warming is not the only source of worry when it comes to environmental protection; the global food crisis has led emerging nations to profit from getting big importers of crops to effectively lease their farmlands. It comes as no surprise that a majority of investors are from the GCC and that most countries leasing out their farmland are in the Asia region. The GCC countries are suffering from desertification. Their concern is the distribution of water resources for different uses. Agriculture remains the prime water-consuming sector, despite its meagre contribution towards the GDP. /But they still import most of their food products and are nowhere near achieving self-sufficiency. Many parts of Asia suffer from the same problem, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. Thus, it makes sense for Asia and the GCC to cooperate on environmental projects and techniques to tackle desertification./According to the UN, all GCC countries except Oman fall in the category of 'acute scarcity' of water. Even Oman is at medium risk on the Water Security index. Apart from the Arabian Gulf region, Central Asia, South Asia and parts of Southeast Asia seem most susceptible to water security risks. There is a huge scope for cooperation between GCC and some Asian countries in the area of desalination, for instance./The nature of air pollution makes it trans-boundary and regional; the fluidity of air means that pollution is easily carried over large distances over land and water to affect other countries. In Southeast Asia, forest fires from Indonesia create haze which is hazardous to health and lowers visibility rates. The haze is carried by winds to the rest of the region, and the nearest countries, Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore./The same happens in the GCC across the Arabian Gulf, with air pollution from sandstorms. As is with all global commons, it is the large players with critical mass from the sheer size of their countries that will have the greatest effect on air pollution. /This is a key reason why rapidly industrialising giants like China and India are now in the limelight for their energy consumption and practices. The pace of development is spurring on higher amounts of emissions and neighbouring countries could easily become victims of air pollution from heavy industry. The concerns for India and GCC countries are very similar: how to accommodate economic growth, while ensuring environmental sustainability./Despite the similarities in the nature of environmental problems of the GCC and some parts of Asia, there has been little collaboration between them on environmental issues. In the past decade, however, there has been a marked improvement with countries like Japan taking the lead in bridging the gap between problems and available support and solutions. A prominent example is the ""Initiative for Kuwait-Japan Cooperation on Environmental Issues and Technology Transfer"" in December 2002, one of whose achievements is the environmental rehabilitation of Kuwait Bay. Many Asian companies are investing in clean technology projects in GCC countries./With the push for alternative energy solutions, the growing market for renewable energy could prove to have strong commercial interests for businesses in the energy industry. Joint environmental projects to improve renewable energy technology could expedite the process of development and provide markets for these technologies./As countries become more directly involved with each other through trade or otherwise, they will have a greater impact on each other. Collaboration between GCC and Asian countries needs to move beyond economics or politics into a realm previously neglected: environment and renewables. In fact, cooperation in the environment and renewables is a win-win situation for both sides and will eventually strengthen economic and political relations. A joint technical committee on environment and renewable cooperation will help explore ways of joint activities and projects./It is a must that countries cooperate on environmental issues that will not only make our planet a better place to live in, but also create business opportunities for both sides, help fight climate change, food crisis, energy crisis, desertification and so on."
Chemical factory serious threat to residents health,"  Like the other residential localities, situated near factory areas, death is looming over the residents of Ittehad Colony (grand battery) Multan Road as they compelled to live under the shadow of fatal diseases as a result of precariously mounting environmental pollution due to a chemical factory, residents told TheNation./It is witnessed that deadly smoke and health hazardous substances, omitting from a chemical factory, owned by influential business persons not only is contributing diseases among the inhabitants of the surrounding vicinities but also are poisoning environment with the noxious chemical. In addition, the people living in this colony are very uncomfortable and suffering from serious diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis and heart diseases as well./""I have been living in the colony for years. In our colony most of the people are very disturbed with the dangerously increasing air pollution as well as noise pollution"", said Zulqarnain Qureshi, a resident adding it is the only factory which is working over there while others have been closed down just because of serious issue related to human health. He has appealed to the government and the higher authorities of Environment Protection Department to visit the said colony and initiate action against this factory after measuring the pollution level. He also stressed the need of action on part of the government to follow the studies of World Wildlife Funds (WWF)./He referred WWF International media release, issuing warning regarding the risk to the Amazon and other forest areas of dramatically reduced protections against deforestation just approved by Brazil's Senate. According to warning, the Revisions to the Forest Code, which now go back to Brazil's National Assembly and then require ratification by President Dilma Rousseff, allow deforestation much closer to watercourses and on steep slopes and give amnesties for past illegal deforestation. Much of the responsibility for implementation and enforcement is passed to the States, where large landholders and agribusiness interests have more influence."
Construction activity kicking up tons of dust," Construction of infrastructure and buildings is taking place at a feverish pace in all major cities of Pakistan. While this development is encouraging for the economy, it must be noted that most companies involved in the construction do not care for the damage inflicted on the environment and the effects of that damage on residents. One visible problem is air pollution: construction activity kicks up tons of dust into the air which then either remains suspended in the air, resulting in haze, or settles around the area./This can cause many respiratory problems, and the issue can be avoided if some care is taken by the contractors. Secondly, contractors tend to dump waste matter from their activities in any vacant area they find nearby, not caring about the impact of that waste on the area. However, apart from these environmental concerns, there is also the issue of workers' safety. Most contractors do not obey labour laws of Pakistan and make their workers perform extremely dangerous tasks and do not even provide them with adequate safety equipment and medical insurance. This must change. We need development, but not at the cost of the environment and humanity."
"Save the planet, please!"," One of the greatest problems that the world is facing today is that of environmental pollution, increasing with every passing year and causing grave and irreparable damage to the earth./Air pollution is by far the most harmful form of pollution. It is caused by the injurious smoke emitted from cars, buses, trucks, trains, and factories, namely sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Even the smoke from burning leaves and cigarettes is harmful to the environment, causing a lot of damage to man and the atmosphere.  Evidence of increasing air pollution is seen in lung cancer, asthma, allergies, and several other breathing problems along with severe and irreparable damage to flora and fauna. Even the most natural phenomenon of migratory birds has been hampered due to severe air pollution, preventing them from reaching their seasonal metropolitan destinations of centuries."

Adopting EU standards to end pollution," Air pollution is a big health hazard and can be decreased by adopting pollution control standards. The European Union had set up a standardised evaluation scale in 1992, which is generally known as the European Emission Standards (Euro Standards). These standards help control the exhaust emissions from road vehicles. Different degrees of controls have been set up for different kinds of vehicles./Majority of countries in the world are following these Euro Emission standards. These standards are now also being applied by the countries in the sub-continent. The basic objective of these emission standard is to reduce the intensity of hazardous gases that pollute the environment. However, these standards are continuously undergoing changes since 90s. /In August 1993, the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) for motor vehicle exhaust and noise were launched by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), under clause (e) of section 6(1) of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997. The NEQS were approved by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Council. Pakistan now plans to follow the Euro Emission Standards, to compete with the countries already applying Euro III and Euro IV. Positive steps are being taken by the Ministry of Petroleum with the help of the Ministry of Environment regarding the implementation in new gasoline-fuelled vehicles./The availability of fuel was the major hurdle in the implementation process of these emission standards in Pakistan. At the moment, it has been decided by the government to apply the Euro Emission Standards in the country from July, 2012.  Sessions were conducted in this regard by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency with all stake-holders, including the Ministry of Petroleum, Ministry of Environment, auto manufacturers and oil companies./The quality of fuel was acutely focused during these sessions as an important point. The main emphasis was on the reduction of sulphur particles from Diesel fuel to 500 ppm, as presently it contributes nearly 9000 ppm. /The oil refineries need to be modified, to function according to the Euro II standards. However, these refineries are already in process to manufacture Euro-II-compliant petrol and diesel.  The modification procedure requires heavy amount of capital. Auto manufacturers should make Euro-II-compliant vehicles. Some of them are already producing vehicles based on Euro II and Euro III standards. Such as, Pak Suzuki's Swift, Indus Motors' Toyota Altis and Honda Civic are locally produced models complying with Euro III standards. /As per the information from the auto industry, various models correspond to the Euro II standards, while talks are still in progress to relieve the import of Euro II and III-compliant engines from duties./The General Manager Commercial & Corporate Pakistan Refinery Limited, Aftab Hussain, stated that the government is taking steps towards complying with the Euro Emission Standards and that in this regard the specifications of Euro II are being fulfilled for petrol engines. However, for Diesel engines, Diesel hydro-treaters are to be installed to decrease the amount of sulphur particles from the Diesel fuel. /As per the government's Euro II-compliance policy, catalytic converters are to be used that fulfill the requirements of Euro II standard fuel. Basically there are two types of engines. One is the EFI engine and the other is the carburettor engine. EFI stands for Electronic Fuel Injection. The EFI system enhances the performance of the engine and controls emission, besides working for better fuel economy. Most of the new Toyota models are equipped with the EFI system, with a built-in diagnosis system. /The carburettor engine system can produce as much horsepower as an EFI engine. The only factor applied is tuning which makes the carburettor engine more efficient. The EFI system is more easily compatible with the catalytic converter than the carburettor engine. The entire conversion procedure cost would range from US $ 120 to $ 400. However, for carburettor engines, it would cost from US $ 500 to $ 2,000, which would consequently raise the prices of vehicles quite substantially. /The new measure taken by the Government of Pakistan to reduce the amount of pollutant particles from automobiles by implying the Euro Emission Standards i.e. Euro II, would have some major impacts. The application of Euro Emission Standards would definitely have a positive effect on the environment as its main aim is to reduce the amount of emissions from the fuel.  /Euro II would help in enhancing the air quality with minimum presence of smoke, carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases in the atmosphere. Serious air pollution issues occur specifically in the urban areas, forming haze and smog in winter which leads to respiratory diseases as well as economic loss. By the introduction of Euro Emission Standards, these drawbacks would hopefully be reduced in the cities. The introduction of Euro II compliant standards would also help in reducing noise pollution./Since the cost of conversion of the conventional engine systems to catalytic converter is quite high, it would increase the prices of Euro II-compliant vehicles. Therefore, while the introduction of Euro II standards would be advantageous for the environment, car buyers and vendors would be negatively impacted. For this reason, newer strategies need to be formulated by the government to provide duty/tax benefits to environment friendly vehicles. "
"Wind corridors can generate 50,000MW power"," About 32 projects have been taken up by the Alternative Energy Development Board of federal government through private investors in Thatta and Jamshoro districts to produce approximately 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts of electricity from wind and solar sources. This was informed to the Sindh Assembly session by Sindh Environment and Alternative Energy Minister Shaikh Muhammad Afzal during question-hour of Assembly on Thursday. He said that the federal government's organisation's step was overriding the provincial government authority, demanding to involve the alternative energy department into the projects. Currently these projects are at various stages.This activity is being implemented by the federal government with consultation of Sindh Board of Investment and Revenue Department as Alternative Energy Department has not been involved in these projects. /He informed the House that in February 2011, the 35,000 acres land allocated to the investors through the Alternative Energy Development Board was cancelled as none of the projects were fulfilled their commitment to generate electricity in 2011. Subsequently, the allotments were reviewed on case-to-case basis after tasking additional bank guarantee and undertaking to complete the project by 2013, provincial minister said. ""The progress is being monitored and in case of violation of agreed time-schedule, the allocation of land can be withdrawn.""Among the projects taken in hand are 84 micro wind turbines installed in 13 villages of Thatta to electrify 580 homes, besides 3,000 households in 49 villages of district Tharparkar have been provided electricity through solar PV technology. Through the ADP 2012-13, the environment and alternative energy department is implementing some projects in the field of alternative energy, he added.Regarding areas feasible for installation of wind mills, provincial minister told the house that the strongest wind corridor of country is located in Sindh. This wind corridor known as Gharo Keti Bandar Wind Corridor spreads 60km along the coastline of Sindh and more than 170km deep towards the land and is mostly located in Thatta and Jamshoro districts. /This wind corridor has potential to generate 50,000MWs of electricity. Recent data received through new masts installed by AEDB and UNDP at different locations in Sindh has identified new potential areas in Sindh, which include Badin, Tharparkar and Hyderabad.Afzal said environment and alternative energy department had held number of meetings with banks and financial institutions to facilitate the solar systems for power generation projects for common man.To another question, the minister said that system of cooking was being introduced through solar energy in the villages to save forests in the province. Through an ADP scheme titled 'Supply of solar stoves in rural areas of Sindh', solar stoves/cookers will be distributed in the rural areas of province, which would ensure conservation for forests vital for ecosystems, specially endangered ones like mangroves and also protect the women fold from air pollution. This would also reduce vulnerability to water borne diseases as boiled water would be available for use, free of cost, minister added.Responding to another query, he said that a number of industrial units are polluting the environment. /The Sindh Environment Protection Agency with its limited resources make efforts to monitor and take action against such violators, he claimed.When asked whether government had planned to generate 50MW electricity through solar energy during 2009-10, provincial minister replied in affirmative, saying that a project for generation of 50MWs electricity through solar energy in upper Sindh was proposed in 2009. A feasibility study is being conducted through the Annual Development Programme in the current financial year, on which the actual project would be formulated. He told the House that no any proposal to prepare small and medium sized energy project of 5 to 10MWs in costal belt was under process by the department.The environment minister replying to another query said that electricity could be generated by using bio-gas produced from cow dung. The Environment and Alternative Energy Department is facilitating a project in Landhi Cattle Colony., which is being pursued by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation."
Factories causing air pollution in twin cities," The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has failed to check increasing air pollution in twin cities of Islamabad Rawalpindi caused by the steel and marble factories set up in the nearby industrial areas./Dozen of marble and steel factories, set up in twin cities are one of the major contributors to air pollution in twin cities. The residents frequently complain of diseases like chest congestion and asthma, which are directly linked to air pollution according to doctors./The marble factories are not the only cause of air pollution but they also cause noise pollution. These factories throw their waste into the nearby natural streams. None of these factories follow any environmental or labour laws, says Aslam Tahir, a worker. He said most of the workers developed chest diseases due to inhaling dust frequently and that the factory owners adopted no safety precautions./According to environmentalists at the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (PEPA), the steel industry is a big source of pollution because it uses low-quality scrap as raw material and releases a huge number of harmful particulate in the air./""We are living in worst environmental conditions, but the CDA, despite growing concerns among inhabitants of this area over the air pollution, has remained indifferent"", Mr Akram, a resident of I-9 sector while talking to reporter said./When contacted, CDA director-general environment he said the authority was pursuing industrialists, with a special focus on steel and marble factories, to use treatment plants to filter hazardous smoke emissions. The official agreed that the residents of the sectors close to the industrial area were suffering from air pollution, and, as a result, were more prone to respiratory diseases./""If the industrialists do not follow CDA directives to control air pollution in near future, the authority will file a complaint with the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (PEPA),"" he said. He said the authority had devised a plan to check air pollution in the federal capital territory."
At the mercy of nature," The climate change debate remained deadlocked in Doha at COP18, despite the toll of damage from superstorm Sandy continues to climb and the efforts of civil society activists go to waste. The changing opinion in the US that the devastating effects of climate change are now pocketbook issues will, perhaps, force President Barack Obama to tackle it in the second term.Recently, Carol Browner, former EPA Chief and White House Climate Czar, laid the blame directly on the climate deniers in the House of Representatives. ""I think unfortunately, right now a majority in our House of Representatives appears to not even think the problem is real,"" Browner told Think Progress. /""It's sort of stunning to me because I've never seen the breadth of scientific consensus on an environmental issue like there is on this,"" she said.The report by DARA International, an independent organisation committed to improving the quality and effectiveness of aid for vulnerable populations suffering from climate change, describes the plight of the coastal people in the least-developed countries. In anticipation of the Doha COP18 talks, DARA International released a report in September 2012. It describes the damage caused by current levels of carbon emissions and rising temperatures. A carbon-saturated economy is a leading global cause of death, responsible for 5 million deaths each year (4.5 million deaths due to mainly air pollution and 400,000 due to hunger and communicable diseases associated with climate change), according to the report./The devastating impact of climate change on the world economy has risen to 1.6 percent of global GDP, amounting to $1.2 trillion in lost wealth a year, which will double by 2030. Lower-income countries already face extreme costs, reaching approximately 11 percent of GDP by 2030. For the past two weeks, as the delegates from 194 countries gathered to work out a legally-binding global climate deal, they arrived at no substantive agreement except to extend the existing treaty.One of the best summary of what went on in Doha for the past two weeks appeared in a blog on OneWorld.net on the final day of the discussions: ""There were some winners here the coal industry won here, the oil industry won here, the fossil fuel industry won here. This wasn't an environmental or science-driven discussion. This was a trade fair,"" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.Kumi Naidoo of Greenpeace International stated: ""We came to Doha with low expectations, but those low expectations got even lower. Any government coming out of these meetings suggests that this was a success is suffering from a case of cognitive dissonance.... We heard yesterday that the entire cost of reconstruction in New Jersey alone is $60bn. /This is the entire sum we were trying to negotiate here for the whole world."" The talks ended with an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, which the US has never supported. Now, Kyoto agreement has an extension, but the coverage will include only 15 percent of global emissions. Several developed countries, including Japan and Canada, have opted out of the protocol. Hedegaard said that the members of the European Union hope Obama ""will present not only an enhanced domestic climate policy, but also an enhanced US engagement and willingness to commit more in an international climate context"".Even as the Doha talks were stalled, another major Typhoon Bopha hit the Philippines, taking as many as 600 lives and leaving millions homeless. The head of the Philippine delegation, Naderev Sano, in his closing remarks, urged world leaders to ""open their eyes to the stark reality"".The writer has authored a book titled 'Barack Obama in Hawaii and Indonesia: The Making of a Global President'."

Pakistan slipping below water scarcity level: Experts," With per capita availability of only 1,000 cubic metre of water, Pakistan is slipping below the water scarcity level as in 1947 it was 5,000 cubic metre, posing a threat to the life and agriculture, disclosed the vice chancellor of a university during a workshop on Saturday./Government College University Faisalabad Vice Chancellor Dr Zakir Hussain was presiding over the concluding session of a two-day workshop titled 'Water Pollution and its Mitigation'. The workshop was arranged by GCUF's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries under a project titled INSPIRE being run by GCUF and Newcastle University, UK in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission and British Council./Faculty of Science and Technology Dean Dr Naureen Aziz Qureshi, Dr Abdul Shakoor from Newcastle University, UK, Dr Abdul Jabbar from Brunel University, from British Council Saira Pervez, Dr Alan Younger, the Head School of Agriculture, UK and Pakistan Coordinator for INSPIRE Dr Farhat Jabeen also spoke on the occasion./The VC said that the country was losing water equivalent to five Tarbela dams by dumping it back to sea, and added it was need of hour to build new dams to improve the water situation. Dr Zakir said that pollution of the water is not only posing a threat to human life but also provoking a sharp decline in the sea life. He demanded establishing a Ground Water Authority to address the issue and devise a comprehensive plan in this regard.  He said that pumping out of huge groundwater had caused a reduction of the water of many feet./He urged stakeholders to build a comprehensive strategy in a bid to put an end to water pollution. He said untreated waste water, industrial effluent and agricultural run-off is poisoning our water and people./He also said 92 of wastewater remained untreated and discharged into water resources across the country breaking out various fatal water-borne diseases responsible for 40 percent of human deaths./Dr Naureen Aziz said the water quality situation in Pakistan was an environmental catastrophe. She added that maximum numbers of deaths in Asia were occurring because of water and air pollution. She said that three Es including education, environment and economic are interlink to compete with the world.

Pakistan slipping below water scarcity level: Experts," With per capita availability of only 1,000 cubic metre of water, Pakistan is slipping below the water scarcity level as in 1947 it was 5,000 cubic metre, posing a threat to the life and agriculture, disclosed the vice chancellor of a university during a workshop on Saturday./Government College University Faisalabad Vice Chancellor Dr Zakir Hussain was presiding over the concluding session of a two-day workshop titled 'Water Pollution and its Mitigation'. The workshop was arranged by GCUF's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries under a project titled INSPIRE being run by GCUF and Newcastle University, UK in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission and British Council./Faculty of Science and Technology Dean Dr Naureen Aziz Qureshi, Dr Abdul Shakoor from Newcastle University, UK, Dr Abdul Jabbar from Brunel University, from British Council Saira Pervez, Dr Alan Younger, the Head School of Agriculture, UK and Pakistan Coordinator for INSPIRE Dr Farhat Jabeen also spoke on the occasion./The VC said that the country was losing water equivalent to five Tarbela dams by dumping it back to sea, and added it was need of hour to build new dams to improve the water situation. Dr Zakir said that pollution of the water is not only posing a threat to human life but also provoking a sharp decline in the sea life. He demanded establishing a Ground Water Authority to address the issue and devise a comprehensive plan in this regard.  He said that pumping out of huge groundwater had caused a reduction of the water of many feet./He urged stakeholders to build a comprehensive strategy in a bid to put an end to water pollution. He said untreated waste water, industrial effluent and agricultural run-off is poisoning our water and people./He also said 92 of wastewater remained untreated and discharged into water resources across the country breaking out various fatal water-borne diseases responsible for 40 percent of human deaths./Dr Naureen Aziz said the water quality situation in Pakistan was an environmental catastrophe. She added that maximum numbers of deaths in Asia were occurring because of water and air pollution. She said that three Es including education, environment and economic are interlink to compete with the world. She expressed her concern that as many as 1.2 billion of people all over the globe do not have access to potable water. Six million children are losing their lives due to water and air pollutions worldwide./British Council representative Saira Pervez stressed bringing the research to the ground to get benefit of it.

Excessive use of gas heaters harmful to health," People have started using gas heaters particularly at night to keep rooms warm oblivious to health hazards it poses to human health./Very few among them are aware of precautionary measures and majority do not care for even if they are known to these precautions. Scattered incidents of suffocating to death in Pakistan surface every year during winter due to keeping gas heaters on for whole the night even when asleep./Health experts believe that many deaths and number of complications can be avoided by making public aware of the preventive measures. Gas heaters emit carbon monoxide directly into the room and increase the level of indoor pollutants which can potentially harm human health including high incidents of respiratory symptoms./Heater burning consumes oxygen while gas leakage results in suffocation if the romms are not properly ventilated. Talking to a private news channel, health expert Dr Ayaz Saeed said that some people are more susceptible than others to suffer health effects of gas heaters such as heart disease patients, asthmatics, children and elderly. He said Carbon monoxide is invisible, odourless, colourless and tasteless gas, so is difficult to detect. It is highly poisonous and deprives the body of oxygen./Dr Ayaz said that an individual is rendered completely helpless without feeling the harm thus becoming unconscious during sleep and ultimately die. ""If the level of carbon monoxide in a room goes above the `safe levels', people with heart disease may get chest pain or angina,"" he said adding smokers with heart disease are particularly at risk. ""Young children and the elderly may also be affected.""/He said exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. ""Its symptoms include tiredness, shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, nausea, muscle weakness, confusion etc while exposure to extremely high levels of carbon monoxide can result in death.""/He added that many deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning can be avoided if some simple safety measures are ensured. If the gas leakage is suspected, extinguish all naked lights and open doors and windows to ventilate the area, turn off all consumer safety shut off valves and report immediately to gas authorities. Dr Ayaz said that the length of time that gas heater is used should be/minimised. ""Also check that the heater has a safety system that shuts the heater off when there is not enough gas pressure."" Heaters that are not in a good working order release higher amounts of pollutants./To a question, he said that suspected case of gas poisoning should be removed immediately from the source to the fresh air and evacuated to the nearest hospital. ""Be careful about using gas heater, especially if anyone has heart disease, asthma, or is elderly.""/Air pollution becomes top ten global killers; Deaths linked to air pollution have increased by 300 per cent since 2000 to 2012 according to a new study. Research released by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) showed that outdoor air pollution has moved up the list to make up one of the world's top ten killers. According to the statistics, air pollution causes more than 3.2 million deaths worldwide, an increase from the 800,000 it was deemed to cause in 2000./This constitutes a 300 per cent increase, something the GBD say cannot be ignored Environmental Technology Online Website Quoted./""The new estimates of particle air pollution are based on ground-level measurements, satellite remote sensing and global chemical transport models to capture population exposure,"" the group explained./Figures gathered in the study revealed that in south Asia, outdoor pollution is ranked as the sixth biggest killer. However, indoor air pollution in the area is significantly worse, ranking as the second biggest killer./Around two-thirds of the 3.2 million air pollution deaths occur in Asia, with Indian fatalities making up just under a quarter of the total./As a global killer, outdoor air pollution is now just behind blood pressure, tobacco smoking, indoor pollution, poor nutrition and diabetes./Anumita Roychowdhury, the Indian Centre for Science and Environment executive director-research and advocacy and head of its air pollution unit said the findings were worrying./""The GBD count on air pollution and its health risks must trigger urgent, aggressive and most stringent action in India to curb air pollution to protect public health. India cannot afford to enhance health risk at a time when much of its economic growth and motorisation are yet to happen.""/She warned that outdoor air pollution is a great leveller, as no one, regardless of class or status, is able to escape it. However, children and the elderly are most at risk. ""Toxic effects like cancer surface after a long latency period. Therefore, exposure to air pollution will have to be reduced today to reduce the burden of diseases,"" she added."
"Experts highlight climate change threats, suggest remedy"," Pakistan is facing severe threats of climate changes causing heavy floods, air pollution and water borne diseases which need to be overcome with enhanced practical work. /This was stated by speakers at an inaugural session of two-day International Conference titled 'Global Environment Changes' held at Government College University, Faisalabad (GCUF) here the other day/GCUF Vice Chancellor Dr Zakir Hussain presided over the session while PCSIR, Islamabad Chairman Dr Shaukat Parvez was the chief guest. /Faculty of Science and Technology Dean Prof Dr Naureen Aziz Qureshi, University of Agriculture's Dean Prof Dr Muhammad Arshad, Prof Dr Ahmet Mermut from Turkey, Director Research and Prof Dr Farhat Abbas also spoke on the occasion. /GCUF VC Dr Zakir Hussain said that ozone layer was deteriorating owing to enhanced emission of smoke from factories and human activities which was resulting in climate changes including massive floods and droughts. He said that clean water situation was worsening in the country that was a matter of greater concern ""In the list of potable water accessibility index, Pakistan is placed at the bottom countries with 80th position out of 12nations,"" he added. /Dr Shaukat Parvez said that the country was blessed with treasure of natural resources including gold and copper worth billions of rupees and it was need of the hour to explore these resources to solve the problems of the country especially the climate change. /Dr Naureen Aziz Qureshi said that food security and the water were the areas of the grave concern for the country. She was of the view that all stakeholders should sit together to map out a comprehensive plan. /Dr Muhamamd Arshad said the environmental issues were also affecting the quality of life. He said that the European countries were fulfilling their 25 percent demands from bio fuel, adding that the country was needed to develop bio fuel model to avert the changes. /Dr Ahmet Mermut said that the global changes were caused by human activities that could be over overcome by proper planning to save the environment. He said that the water was the base of life that was pouting due to human activities and the glaciers were also melting down because of climate changes. /Dr Farhat Abbas said the GCUF has emerged the number sixth best university in the Higher Education ranking. He concluded that moot comprising eight technical sessions aimed at devising a plan to address the issues. "
Air pollution up in twin cities," Air pollution increasing day by day in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi caused by the steel and marble factories set up in the nearby industrial areas I-9. Dozen of marble and steel factories, set up in twin cities are one of the major contributors to air pollution. The residents frequently complain of diseases like chest congestion and asthma, which are directly linked to air pollution according to doctors./The marble factories caused air and noise pollution also. These factories throw their waste into the nearby natural streams. None of these factories follow any environmental or labour laws, says Aslam Tahir, a worker. He said most of the workers developed chest diseases due to inhaling dust frequently and that the factory owners adopted no safety precautions./""We are living in worst environmental conditions, but the CDA, despite growing concerns among inhabitants of this area over the air pollution, has remained indifferent"", Naveed Ahsan, a resident of I-9 sector while talking to the agency said./When contacted, CDA official, he said the authority was pursuing industrialists, with a special focus on steel and marble factories, to use treatment plants to filter hazardous smoke emissions. The official agreed that the residents of the sectors close to the industrial area were suffering from air pollution, and as a result they were more prone to respiratory diseases. He said the authority had devised a plan to check air pollution in the federal capital territory./Meanwhile, the encroachment activities are going unchecked in federal capital, despite tall claims of civic body to take action against encroachments on foothpaths./It is not only causing inconvenience to the pedestrians, but also poses threat as some shops selling glass items dump glass pieces and other waste on the footpath, said a visitor at Aabpara market./Different areas including Aabpara, Peshawar More, Karachi Company and other places have not still been cleared from the encroachment by the vendors and shopkeepers. M Ramazan, a resident of G-6, said that footpaths in the busy markets are being misused by the area shopkeepers./The residents also complained of growing encroachments in the market causing inconvenience for the pedestrian and motorists. They appealed to the concerned authorities to remove these encroachments to provide a smooth way for pedestrians and other people, visiting the market./An official of the CDA when contacted said that the concerned authorities have strictly warned the vendors and others to avoid encroachment, adding that CDA also confiscated several goods items from the footpaths. He said that CDA was committed to discourage and stop the activities of the vendors and shopkeepers on the footpaths./The people of federal capital have welcomed the steps initiated by the concerned authorities against encroachments on footpaths and public places, but expressed disappointment over its slow pace of action."
70 pc kids exposed to carcinogenic tobacco smoke," In Pakistan, 70 percent of children get exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, globally declared as a class-A carcinogen, that is capable to produce cancer. Experts talking to APP said tobacco smoke is a major cause of contribution to the indoor air-pollution in the country, where people are generally not aware about the harm caused by passive smoking./Breathing the smoke from other people's cigarette is called passive smoking that consists of smoke from the burning end of the cigarette called ""side-stream"" smoke and smoke exhaled by the smoker ""mainstream"" smoke./Civil Hospital Karachi Pediatric Department chairperson Prof, Ayesha Mehnaz, in reply to a question about harmful effects of passive smoking on children said it also increases their risk of catching respiratory infection including pneumonia. Chronic cough and phlegm, increased risk of asthma, glue ear (chronic middle ear infection), growth retardation and reduction in lung function are also associated health hazards for children, she said./Dr Shaheena Qayyum, Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases referring to available statistics said 1500 children between six to 16 years also take up smoking every day in Pakistan. These were cited to be kids who are active smokers and are among the 32 percent male population and six percent female population who actually smoke./""Lung cancer is the number one cancer among male in Pakistan and over 90 percent of lung cancers occurs in smokers,"" said the senior chest specialist. Meanwhile cancer of the mouth, throat, lungs and oesophagus (food pipe) occur ten times more in smokers. Tobacco smoke has also proven to increase the risk of developing bladder, pancreatic, cervical and breast cancer. The experts registered their serious concern that huge amount of money was being spent by tobacco companies in their promotional activities compared to meagre amount spent on public health education./It was regretted that the tobacco industry is trying to link smoking to pleasure, relaxation, enjoyment and adventure - with children and teenager as their main targets. This was again in a scenario where 54 percent population of the country was consuming tobacco in form of paan, naswar, gutka, mainpuri and so-forth."
"Heavy trucks causing air, noise pollution in Capital"," Hundreds of heavy trucks, entering and leaving the industrial area everyday, are causing air and noise pollution in the federal capital and disturbance among the sector's residents./Resident of the industrial areas told media that the number of noise, dust and smoke complaints from the area were steadily increasing with each passing day. One of them is Shahid Ali, working in an automobile painting shop in the sector for over 10 years, is an asthma patient. He attributes his problem to the heavy presence of smoke and dust in the industrial area./He said hundreds of trucks enter and leave the area, adding, ""My shop is located at Potohar Road and over 200 trucks use this road daily"". Aslam Khan, a resident of Sector I-9, also complained that scores of trucks that use the road daily create a lot of noise and smoke pollution./Muhammad Tahir, another I-10 resident, said one could easily see layers of smoke in the air. He said throat, nasal and lung problems were quite common in the area. Doctors warn that noise and air pollution is injurious to human health. Dr Aftab Ali Malik, who render his services at Polyclinic/Hospital, remarked that the smoke emitted by trucks could cause respiratory infections, exacerbations of bronchial asthma, and high blood pressure. He warned that smoke also contained carcinogens that could cause cancer. The doctor said the dust could cause nasal allergy, asthma and noise hearing problems./When contacted, Senior Superintendent of Traffic Police said trucks could only use link roads to enter or leave the city. He said they he would ask his men to keep a vigilant eye on trucks causing noise or air pollution./A CDA official said the civic body had warned factories against polluting environment through notices and would proceed against the smoke emitting or effluent discharging industrial units. He informed that environment protection laws were also being amended."
Pull a solution to pollution," The nation is observing another World Environment Day on Wednesday (today), but the authorities in the polluted country are taking least interest in tackling the situation./Like the previous year, events such as seminars and walks are on the cards at public and private level as a standard ritual that somehow skirts the real issue. Devising a concrete plan to control the ever-increasing pollution has remained ever so elusive, making the life of a common man miserable./We specialise in every form of it - air pollution from moving and stationary sources; noise pollution from factories and smoky vehicles; and water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes and agricultural runoff, to name a few. These all pose a serious threat to life, a battle we all fight without a clear roadmap to survival, let alone victory./Deforestation, soil erosion and desertification add insult. But instead of giving due attention to the growing problem, state institutions continue wasting resources on stereotypical methods (named above) to highlight environment-related issues. Addressing the problem practically has never appeared to be a serious concern./The level of pollution in Pakistan's major cities of Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar is higher than the permissible limits. Lahore, for instance, has topped the list of most polluted cities, with highest air pollution level of 121.85 micrograms per cubic meter that is three times higher than the safe standards, according to the Pakistan Environment Agency (Pak-EPA) statistics./We are daily breathing polluted air. This has become a cause of concern as a large number of people, particularly children, are contracting lungs and related diseases. The problem is solvable, yet it is unfortunate that neither the people nor the government pay any attention to it./The National Conservation Strategy Report has documented solid and liquid waste as a major source of water pollution in the country and the cause of widespread waterborne diseases./As only over half of urban residents have access to sanitation, the remaining urban waste ends up on the roadsides, into waterways, or is incorporated into solid waste. Additionally, only three major sewage treatment plants exist in the country; two of them operate intermittently./Much of the untreated sewage goes into the irrigation system, where the wastewater is reused, and into streams and rivers, which become sewage carriers in low-flow periods. Consequently, the vegetables grown from such wastewater have serious bacteriological contamination. Gastroenteritis, widely considered in medical circles to be the leading cause of death in Pakistan, is transmitted through waterborne pollutants./Low-lying land is generally used for solid waste disposal, without the benefit of sanitary landfill methods. The National Conservation Strategy has raised concerns about industrial toxic wastes also being dumped in municipal disposal areas without any record of their location, quantity, or toxic composition. Another important issue is the contamination of shallow groundwater near urban industries that discharge wastes directly into the ground./In most cities, there are no controls on vehicular emissions, which account for 90 percent of air pollution. The National Conservation Strategy Report claims that an average Pakistani vehicle emits 25 times as much carbon monoxide, 20 times as many hydrocarbons, and more than three and one-half times as much nitrous oxide in grams per kilometer as the average vehicle in the United States./Another major source of pollution, not mentioned in the National Conservation Strategy Report, is noise. The hyper-urbanisation experienced by Pakistan since the 1960s has resulted in loose controls for heavy equipment operation in densely populated areas, as well as in crowded streets filled with buses, trucks, automobiles, and motorcycles, which often honk at each other and at the horse-drawn tongas (used for transporting people) and the horse-drawn rehras (used for transporting goods)./Researchers at the Pakistan Medical Research Council recognise that a large proportion of diseases in Pakistan are caused by the consumption of polluted water. Even the 38 percent of the population that receives water through pipelines runs the risk of consuming seriously contaminated water, although the problem varies by area. In Punjab, for example, as much as 90 percent of drinking water comes from groundwater, as compared with only 9 percent in Sindh./The federal government's Perspective Plan (1988-2003) and previous five-year plans do not mention sustainable development strategies. Further, there have been no overarching policies focused on sustainable development and conservation./The state has focused on achieving self-sufficiency in food production, meeting energy demands, and containing the high rate of population growth, not on curtailing pollution or other environmental hazards./Similarly, of special concern to environmentalists is the diminishing forest cover in watershed regions of the northern highlands, which has only recently come under close scrutiny./The theme for this year's World Environment Day is 'Think, Eat, Save'. It is an anti-food waste and food loss campaign that encourages reducing foodprint."
"Another E-Day, pooh Pooh"," Like other parts of the globe, the World Environment Day (WED) was observed across the country on Wednesday to renew pledge to conserve natural resources and save the environment./The nation observed the day with the authorities performing the ritual of arranging public awareness related activities without fulfilling the responsibility of taking measures to check ever increasing pollution./Like the previous year, events such as seminars and walks were organized both at public and private level as a standard ritual. Devising a concrete plan to control the ever-increasing pollution remained ever so elusive, making the life of a common man miserable. Like the previous years, seminars, walks, photo and painting exhibitions, and poetry recitals were organised at different places in the City to mark the event./Since 1973, the WED is observed annually on June 5 across the globe under different themes. The WED's theme this year was ""Think-Eat-Save""./Every form of pollution is alarmingly high in major cities of Pakistan and authorities are paying least attention to the ever increasing problem of the masses. Air pollution from moving and stationary sources; noise pollution from factories and smoky vehicles; and water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes and agricultural runoff are playing havoc with public life and health. Deforestation, soil erosion and desertification add insult./But instead of giving due attention to the growing problem, state institutions continue wasting resources on stereotypical methods (named above) to highlight environment-related issues.

Secretary Environment Punjab Sher Alam Mahsud was the chief guest while DG EPA Punjab Farooq Hameed Sheikh, A R Saleemi, Rafay Alam, students and people from all walks of life also participated./Speakers at the seminar stressed upon the need to safe food as per the theme of WED 2013, ""Think-Eat-Save"". A R Saleemi, member Environmental Tribunal, gave a detailed presentation that how much energy consumes during a food manufacturing and how could one save the food from wastage. He said that every individual should come forward to save the food from wastage. He said if people prepare exact quantity of food as per regular need then betterment could be observed in this regard./Rafay Alam, Advocate Supreme Court, guided the participants about the importance of current theme of WED and also gave a detailed presentation./Students of Lahore College for Women University (LCWU) prepared a video documentary in which they showed various fields of life where people were seen while wasting food without any reason./Secretary Environment Sher Alam Mahsud said that he believes if every individual control his food requirement and eat as per hunger then food wastage will automatically be controlled. He said that there are many aspect in life in which people need improvement and food aspect is one of them. He appreciated the LCWU students for video documentary and said that such documentaries should be filmed on regular basis and Environment Department will sponsor it./Speakers at a seminar in Quetta emphasised that keeping the environment clean and protecting forests should be top priority of every citizen to address environmental issues. ""Clean environment is a freedom from numerous diseases,"" they added./IUCN, Unesco and Environment Department organised a seminar at local hotel to mark World Environment Day on Wednesday./Forests and Wild Life Secretary Khud-i-Rahim Ehjani, Environment Secretary Abdullah Jan, Planning and Development Secretary Zeeshanur Haq and people from all other school of thoughts were present on the occasion."
Beware! rubbing eyes can cost you dear," When seasonal heat rises, a many people suffer from itching, burning, and watering of the eyes and this 'red eye' can either be due to allergens, called 'allergic conjunctivitis' or owing to infectious conjunctivitis, says an expert./The eye specialist said that red, watery eyes, inflamed lids, blurred vision and a sandy or scratchy feeling in the eyes may indicate that one has conjunctivitis. He said that the pus-like or watery discharge around the eyelids indicates an infectious form of the disease, commonly known as ""pink eye.""/Dr Jamil Ahmed informed that Conjunctivitis is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva, a thin, transparent layer covering the surface of the inner eyelid and the front of the eye and it affects people of all ages.About the types of Conjunctivitis, he said it three main types are infectious, allergic and chemical./A contagious virus or bacteria causes the infectious form, commonly known as ""pink eye,"" and patient body's allergies to pollen, cosmetics, animals or fabrics often bring on allergic conjunctivitis like irritants air pollution, noxious fumes and chlorine in swimming pools may produce the chemical form, he added./The certain forms of conjunctivitis can develop into a serious condition that may harm the vision and it is important to have conjunctivitis diagnosed and treated quickly, he said. He said that some common allergens include pollen from trees and grass, weed pollens and moulds, animal skin, fur and secretions such as saliva, perfumes and cosmetics and eye make- up, skin medicines, air pollution and smoke./The assistant professor of Eye Department of ISRA University Hospital said that grass pollens tend to cause symptoms in early summer and various other pollens and moulds may cause symptoms later in the summer. He said that in our city construction dust is a major cause of allergic conjunctivitis and the perennial form persists throughout the year and is usually triggered by dust mites./He said that in some cases, use of mosquito-repellant liquids used in a closed room throughout the night can cause allergies and puffy eyelids, viral and bacterial infections. About the symptoms of conjunctivitis Dr. Jamil Ahmed said that the eyes are usually itchy, and the whites of the eyes look red or pink, a burning feeling may occur and it may be painful, eyelids tend to swell, eyes can water as in allergic conjunctivitis or become 'gluey' as in infective conjunctivitis but their vision is not usually affected, he added./He also said that when one person rubs the eyes, the germs get on to the hands and from there they spread to someone else's hands while sharing things such as doorknobs, towels etc and the most important precaution whenever patients are outdoors is never to rub their eyes since their hands have been all over the place and wash their hands frequently./He said that the person suffering from infective conjunctivitis must refrain from rubbing the eyes and if the urge to itch is strong, first the hands must be washed, then the eyes cleaned and the hands washed again with soap but it is important not to share soaps, towels etc, he added. About the treatment he suggested that bathing the eyes with a cloth soaked in cold water soothes the eyes. He said that depending on the type of conjunctivitis, eye drops that reduce inflammation and treat infection (antibiotic) are prescribed by the eye doctor./He said that steroid eye drops are rarely needed or used and steroids are good at reducing inflammation. However, they should only be used under the supervision of an eye specialist as infection and other causes of conjunctivitis need to be definitely ruled out. He added that steroids can make some other eye conditions worse. He said that Conjunctivitis treatment depends upon the cause and treatment of allergic conjunctivitis is by avoiding the allergen./Viral conjunctivitis resists treatment, broad-spectrum antibiotic and eyedropper may prevent secondary infection. He said that children, who may forget these precautions, should be kept away from school, camp and the swimming pool until the condition is cured./Antibiotic medication, usually eye drops, is effective for bacterial conjunctivitis. He further said that infectious conjunctivitis caused by bacteria, is usually treated with antibiotic eye drops and ointment but other infectious forms, caused by viruses, cannot be treated with antibiotics and must be fought off by patients' body immune system."
World COPD Day observed," Pakistan Chest Society, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter, and International Primary Care Respiratory Group, Pakistan chapter, jointly arranged a seminar here at a local hotel on the occasion of World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day./In this seminar all members from Pakistan Chest Society and IPCRG, chest specialists, general practitioners, family physicians and other people related to the medical field participated. Chief Executive LRH and Head of Pulmonology Department, Prof Dr Arshad Javed, was the speaker at the seminar. He said that this chronic illness leads to shortness of breath, cough with expectoration, and whistling of the chest.  It is also a common disease not only in Pakistan but throughout the world over the age of forty years in male and female both with every tenth person in the society leading the fourth leading cause of death in the society and in the world more than the aids and cancer with more than 5,000,000 death every year, according to WHO statement./He further stated that the leading causes are tobacco use, smoke inside the homes, air pollution, use of wood by the female inside the poorly ventilated houses at hilly and rural areas because in Pakistan 72 per cent of the people use these methods for warming inside houses, especially during winter season."

Health at risk as kilns' smoke mocks at law," The air pollution is causing health problems in district Sheikhupura particularly in the city area mainly due to brick kilns, reveals a survey./It was observed that a number of brick kilns are functioning in residential areas with the connivance of local Environment Protection Agency. The brick kiln owners are flouting the law by polluting the environment in residential areas. It is noted that at Hirn Minar Road where more than one dozen schools, housing schemes and thousands of inhabitants are living, brick kiln causing environmental pollution. Dozens of residents including Rehan of Sun City said that smoke billowing out of chimneys in brick kilns can be seen hanging over the surrounding areas. He said that workers, schoolchildren and women residing in the nearby houses are victims of the practice. Allah Yar Bhatti, a resident of the same locality, said that these kilns had made their lives miserable./He said the use of rubber and plastic with coal pollutes the air, making it difficult for the residents to breathe. He further said that the unplanned brick kilns should be controlled immediately and shifted to far-flung area from the residential areas./Muhammad Yousaf, a resident of Hirn Minar road, said that the Environment Department did not take any action against these kilns. He said the officials were not serious to control pollution. They demanded shifting of kilns from Hirn Minar road to other suitable place./Dr Abdul Qayyum talking to The Nation disclosed that poly-aromatic is commonly found in smoke that causes vomiting, diarrhea, eye irritation, nausea and disorientation. Prolonged exposure may result in liver and renal diseases and even cancer, he added./The administrator of a private school where a large number of male and female students get education also disclosed that during school hours, the kiln smoke entered into the classrooms causing great nuisance to the children./On contacting, an official of Environment Department said requesting anonymity that it was understaffed and faced with shortage of resources. Even then, he added his department was closely monitoring the brick kilns and had served notices on the brick kilns that were found violating the rules."
Curtailing the carbon footprint," Three of our provincial capitals are ranked within the top ten of the world's most polluted cities. Shock and awe: Karachi is not one of them. Quetta comes at a whopping 4th place, Peshawar at number 6 and Lahore at 10. /Access to clean drinking water in these cities is a virtual impossibility unless you are investing in barrels of mineral water daily, (amidst allegations that that is not safe for drinking either). Additionally, in an agrarian country, the yield is inversely proportional to the pollution levels of any given area. As a result, soil is gradually getting corrupted./Beyond domestic concerns, global warming (no matter how persistently we shrug off responsibility), will affect the world regardless of who the greatest polluters were. New studies reveal that Asia will be the most impacted region. Flood, famine, drought- you name it, it's on the list. /The water levels in the country are already dropping and this decrease is likely to increase exponentially in the future. Pollution related diseases, often life threatening, are on the rise in urban centers, and preventative measures are not being seriously considered./In less developed countries, significant pollution may be impossible to eliminate completely but there is a strong case for control; to decrease its persistent interference with the personal lives and the health of citizens./Air pollution from factories and cars must be curtailed, and instruments such as catalytic converters that reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted should be looked into. However, these don't address the fundamental problem of local attitudes. More than anything, a culture of awareness needs to be inculcated, and a narrative that focuses on individual responsibility must come into existence especially amongst young people and young professionals. Only then will people make the conscientious choice to reduce their carbon footprint, and to extend their love of country to, literally, the grass-roots level."

Beware! Effluent-irrigated vegetables serious health risks," Crops and vegetables which are being irrigated with industrial waste can cause serious health hazards for the consumers, and that their longterm use could expose the people to various diseases, as per an expert./University of Agriculture Faisalabad Vice Chancellor Dr Iqrar Ahmad was talking to a delegation from a Lahore college which visited the university to discuss research studies on water and air quality./The delegation was headed by Irshad Hussain, Project Director, Southern Punjab Poverty Alleviation Project. He was flanked by Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council Deputy Secretary Hamid Nisar, Establishment Division Director Sharaf Jehan, and Ministry of Religious Affairs Director Noor Salam./The vice chancellor said that industrial effluent was playing havoc with the lives of the people because of few waste treatment mechanism. The most of the water is being utilised for the agricultural purposes. He said that industrial effluent was also contaminating the underground water. He said that 80 percent of the industrial water is going to the canals etc whereas 20 percent is becoming the part of underground water./He said separate lines for supplying drinkable water and household water were required across the county to ensure the availability of potable water to the people. He told the delegation that the university had conducted hundreds of valuable researches on water and air pollution issues./Faculty of Agriculture Dean Prof Dr Muhammad Arshad said that sewerage and industry waste water was dumped into single source that had been aggravating the situation. Mixing of household drainout water and industrial waste water was making difficult for experts to treat them and convert the toxic water into nontoxic water, he said. He was of the view that the industrialists were reluctant to set up waste water treatment plants at their units that was a real challenge. He said that excellent law regarding the water and air pollution must be implemented into letter and spirit./Irshad Hussain said that industrial effluent treatment was essential to provide the healthy environment to the citizen. He stressed a need to expedite joint efforts for the cause. He said that it was need of the hour to treat the industrial and waste water./Institute of Soil and Environmental Sciences Director Dr Javaid Akhtar called for adopting the measures to protect the environment as per the international standards. He said that the climate changes are posing the serious threat to the people and Pakistan was its worst victim./Dr Ghulam Murtaza said that effluent must be treated at the industrial area. The effluent at its passing track also contaminates the ground water that creates the health issue for the people. He was of the view that the proper check on the air pollution was imperative to deal with the different diseases./meanwhile, the international colloquium titled opportunities and challenges of maize production was arranged by Plant Breeding and Genetics Department, University of Agriculture Faisalabad./It was found that maize will become the topcultivated crop in the world by 2020 because of its nutrient values and China will also import it to feed the pollution. Chairing the session, the UAF vice chancellor said that maize is the most versatile crop that is being grown in more than 166 countries. He told the audience that that its global production has increased more than 12 times in the last five decades. He said before the green revolution, maize flour was used by people as it was economical as compared to wheat. In the modern era, technology is needed to make roti from maize to market it to address the issue of hunger./Punjab DG Research Dr Abid Mahmood said that maize was the crop of future keeping in view the food security. He said that steps were being taken to enhance its productivity through research. He said demand of cereal was increasing and maize would become most important cereal especially in developing countries./Faculty of Agriculture Dean Prof Dr Muhammad Arshad stressed the need to put the research focus on tangible researches to ensure the food security in the county. He said maize was the third biggest food crop and it was also a major crop in many countries because of its multiple uses and high yield./PARB Chairman Dr Noorul Islam said that maize crop is utilized in many ways including excellent human food, cattle feed and raw material for many industries. PBG Chairman Abdus Salam said insectresilient maize can alleviate hunger and help achieve food security in third world countries./Rafhan Manager Dr Khalid Aziz said that they were working to get three cultivation of maize in a year that will increase productivity manifold. Director External Linkages Dr Ashfaq Chattha, Dr Muhamamad Aslam and other notables also spoke."
Another Blight," Pakistan's abysmal record when it comes to healthcare and child mortality rates shows no signs of abating. /On 24th October, World Polio Day exposed Pakistan as the last remaining stronghold of the paralysing disease. Now, as the globe observed World Pneumonia Day, Pakistan is making headlines again, for all the wrong reasons. In a report released by the Global Coalition Against Child Pneumonia, Pakistan ranks third for the most number of pneumonia related deaths of children in the world, with 71,000 losing their life to the respiratory disease. Once again Pakistan takes its place amongst struggling subSaharan countries when it comes to health standards. Neighbouring India, with a similar cultural and political background, tops the list with 174,000 deaths per year, yet compared to Pakistan it is doing well considering its gargantuan population./As with polio, the hurdles in curbing pneumonia are chiefly our own apathy and failing institutions. Pneumonia is combated in a variety of ways, vaccinations against various bacterial and viral diseases is usually effective. The other major method is reducing air pollution; having ventilated rooms when cooking with wood or dung, and curbing passive smoking. Once contracted, effective medical care, rest and a few antibiotics are usually enough to heal the person. Therefore much more than polio, which had its unique issues with vaccination campaigns, the spread of pneumonia is a damning picture of our healthcare system as a whole. /Lack of proper medical facilities, especially away from urban centres, badly constructed sewage systems, lack of adequately stocked medicine cabinets and a lack of simple awareness campaigns, educating people towards proper hygiene and air ventilation betray just how casually the government treats the threat of diseases. And as with polio the solution requires basic management and a little empathy, a rare commodity on Pakistan. /Our country is fast becoming a global cesspool of all sorts of diseases. With Pakistan already in the news for uncontrolled militancy, it is appalling that it is doing the same with healthcare."
SC seeks report on setting up of hotels on green belts," The Supreme Court Thursday sought report from chairman Capital Development Authority regarding establishment of hotels and restaurants on green belts of Islamabad./A divisional bench comprising Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan and Justice Umar Atta Bandial heard suo motu notice related to environment pollution. /The court observed that Islamabad was no more a clean city, as it used to be 10 years ago because people in the federal capital are also facing environmental pollution, smoke emitting vehicles, and out of order drains./The court also sought reports from the federal and the provincial governments to control pollution on next date of hearing. The court ordered the Islamabad administration to launch campaign to beautify hilly areas and mountains./The Punjab government presented report, which says water treatment plants had been installed in the province. /It says new environmental laboratories have been established at Sheikhupura, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Rahim Yar Khan. /The report says the procurement of fieldtesting kits for measurement of ambient air quality parameters i.e. smoke, vehicular exhaust gases and noise has been made. ""Due to promotional and legal action, 164 air pollution control devices have been installed by different industrial units,"" it added./The court appreciated the efforts but observed that people in farflung and rural areas still did not have clean drinking water. /Justice Ejaz stated in urban areas people suffer from dangerous deceases due to filth and polluted water./Additional Advocate General Sindh Shafi Chandio informed that the provincial government would soon start the metro bus project in the province, while mass urban transport system is also under consideration./He said according to the project, 100 buses for Karachi and 500 buses for other parts of Sindh would ply on roads. He further told the provincial government amended the Motor Vehicle Ordinance and imposed heavy fine on owners of public transporters, who plying old buses and vans./Justice Ejaz remarked what is the advantage of such steps if those were not beneficial for ordinary citizens? He said in Karachi garbage heaps were found everywhere and the people dying of polluted water./Muhammad Arshad Cheema, representative CDA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), submitting report informed that all the stone crushing factories in Taxila had been closed, while the oil refineries had been directed to adopt modern filtration system. For vehicles examination latest monitoring units have been provided to relevant authorities./Justice Ejaz Afzal said Khanpur and Maripur jungles have been cut, which became cause of landslide. /The court observed that cutting of jungles badly affect the environmental pollution, and directed to take affective measures to stop the cutting of jungles. /The Additional Advocate General Khyber Pukhtoonkhawa also submitted the report. Justice Ejaz Afzal expressed satisfaction over some of the steps taken by the federal and provincial governments but observed that sewerage issue should not be ignored as it become major cause of environmental pollution. /The hearing was adjourned till the second week of January."
Pollution at large scale," The National Conservation Strategy report has documented how solid and liquid excreta are the major source of water pollution and cause of widespread waterborne diseases as only half of the urban residents have access to sanitation; the remaining urban excreta are deposited on roadsides, into waterways, or incorporated into solid waste. Additionally, only three major sewage treatment plants exist in the country; two of them operate intermittently. Much of the untreated sewage goes into irrigation systems, where the wastewater is reused, and into streams and rivers, which become sewage carriers consequently, the vegetables grown from such wastewater, has serious bacteriological contamination. Gastroenteritis, widely considered in medical circles to be the leading cause of death in Pakistan, is transmitted through waterborne pollutants./Air pollution has also become a major problem as there is no controls on vehicular emissions, which account for 90 percent of pollutants. The National Conservation Strategy Report claims that the average Pakistani vehicle emits twentyfive times as much carbon monoxide, twenty times as many hydrocarbons, and more than three and onehalf times as much nitrous oxide in grams per kilometer as the average vehicle in the United States. Government should take measures to reduce all kinds of pollution from Pakistan as it is effecting our environment."
Inefficiency behind Rawal Lake pollution: Mushahid," Federal Minister for Climate Change, Mushahid Ullah Khan, has taken notice of inefficiency of the ministry's official and relevant departments' performance during an internal meeting of the ministry and expressed his deep concern over environmental degradation, particularly water and air pollution, which is continuously affecting the health of the people./The minister said that environmental degradation has emerged to be a grave socioeconomic issue for the country and effective policy measures are needed to address these problems./He called upon the officials of different sections of climate change ministry, particularly environment, forestry and Environmental Protection Agency  Islamabad (PakEPA) to play their due role in this regard and work hard consistently to cope with the environmental issues, particularly illegal treecutting, deforestation, water and air pollution./He warned, ""There is no place for inefficient, incompetent and lethargic officials in the ministry./They will have to prove themselves through hard work and efficiency that they can address the environmental problems being faced by the country or they will have to go./Mushahid said it is a matter of deep worry that pollution in Rawal Lake continues to increase and relevant environmental agencies and departments have failed to check the contamination of the lake./He said that no one responsible for contamination of Rawal Lake will be spared,"" he warned./He noted that thousands of people are being affected with different waterborne diseases by drinking the contaminated water of the lake because the people have no choice but to consume water infested with diseases./""In this regard, PakEPA (Islamabad) must play its due role or it should be ready to face the music,"" he said."
Disaster of air pollution in human life," ""If our nation wants to reduce global warming, air pollution and energy instability we should invest only in the best energy options. Nuclear energy is not of them (Mark Z Jacobson).""/Air pollution occurs when the air has gases, dust, fumes or odor in the harmful amount, which could be harmful to the health or comfort of humans and animals or which could cause damage to plants and materials. Most of the air pollution results due to burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, natural gas, and gasoline to produce electricity and power our vehicles. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a good indicator of how much fossil fuel is burned and how much of other pollutants are emitted as a result./Smog throws harmful effects to the environment. Studies have shown signs of lungs diseases in dolphins due to high concentration of harmful air particles. Air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, irritation in the throat, nose, lungs, eyes, breathing problems and asthma. Children and old people are more sensitive to air pollution. In large cities, over 80% of fatal pollutants that cause lungs damage come from cars, buses, motor cycles and other vehicles on the road./""The health effects of air pollution imperil human lives. This fact is well documented (Eddie Bernice B Johnson).""/According to WHO, ""Air pollution has become the worlds single biggest environmental health risk that is linked to around 7 million or nearly one in eight death in 2012""/We should avoid using harmful chemical products inside and outside of our homes. We should properly recycle all household water and garbage. Natural honey bees wax candles should be used. We should plant more trees as they absorb carbon dioxide. We should use renewable energy sources and public mode of transportation./Air pollution caused form gases, dust particles, smog, acid rain and other sources is damaging to health. We can prevent our environment from air pollution by limited needs of energy which can reduce air pollution. As a result we can maintain our lives and survive easily./""The value of life will suffer a solution if you dont fight air pollution (Cupid)."""
Call for global action to protect health of human civilisation," A report on Planetary Health has called for immediate global action to protect the health of human civilisation and the natural systems on which it depends./The report 'Safeguarding Human Health in the Anthropocene Epoch' provides the first ever comprehensive examination of evidence showing how the health and well-being of future generations is being jeopardised by the unprecedented degradation of the planet's natural resources and ecological systems./The report by The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission that has been globally launched before it was shared in Pakistan with environmentalists, researchers, health professionals, development partners and policymakers with a view to exploring the report's analysis and recommendations and their relevance for the country./The report was written by a Commission of 15 leading academics and policymakers from institutions in eight countries, including Dr Sania Nishtar, President Heartfile Pakistan. It demonstrates how human activity and development have pushed to near breaking point the boundaries of the natural systems that support and sustain human civilisation. The report says that Pakistan is facing threats to the health and development of millions of people from a combination of adverse environmental trends and a high population growth rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum./The Commission warns that a rising population, unsustainable consumption and the over-use of natural resources will exacerbate these health challenges in the future. The world's poorest communities will be among those at greatest risk, as they live in areas that are most strongly affected and have greater sensitivity to disease and poor health./The health of people, nations, and the planet are deeply interconnected, therefore the complex interdependencies in public policy implementation said Dr. Sania Nishtar while speaking at the launch. We need a new paradigm of governance to promote collaborative inter-sectorial action for solving 'sectorial' objectives. Intermediary agencies skilled to convene, instruments for asset allocations mappings; incentives for collaborative division of labor and metrics for the whole of the government performance assessment are needed now more than ever, she stressed./After 18 Amendment there were no linkages even between the provincial and the federal health departments, remarked Minister of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination Saira Afzal Tarar. Underscoring the need to have inter-sectorial collaborations between various ministries, she announced to appoint a focal person for planetary health in the national health ministry.We are on the verge of triggering irreversible, global effects, ranging from ocean acidification to biodiversity loss, said Sir Andy Haines, Chair of the commission. These environmental changes - which include but extend far beyond climate change - threaten the gains in health that have been achieved over recent decades and increase the risks to health arising from major challenges as diverse as under-nutrition and food insecurity, freshwater shortages, emerging infectious diseases, and extreme weather events, she added./The findings and recommendations of the report are crucial for Pakistan in the wake of recent floods, heatwaves, and other natural disasters, he added. The Commission outlines a range of beneficial policies and actions that can be taken by governments, international organisations, researchers, health professionals and citizens that are good for both health and the environment. Examples include benefits from reduced air pollution, healthy diets with more fruit and vegetables, active transport (walking and cycling), reduced urban heat stress from green spaces, and increased resilience to coastal flooding from intact wetlands and mangroves. In addition, the report identifies some major gaps in evidence and the research that is needed./Solutions to these clear and potent dangers are within reach, say the Commission authors, but the world needs to take decisive, coordinated action to protect the environment and secure the health of future generations. It calls for integrated social, economic and environmental policies, Better governance, improved health systems, a re-organisation and expansion of our knowledge on Planetary Health."
Is pollution increasing or decreasing?," Burning of solid waste, emissions from moving and stationary sources, continuous demolition and construction activity and fast disappearance of trees for development purposes have caused considerable increase in air and noise pollution in major cities including Lahore./While accepting high level of pollution in urban areas in general and major cities especially Lahore in particular, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials claimed that the level of pollution was decreasing due to lesser congestion after gradual improvement of road infrastructure./The environmentalists, however, contradicted the claim, saying that improvement of road infrastructure was only worsening the situation by eating up green areas and attracting extra vehicles that was ultimately leading to more congestion and excessive emissions./Situation on Ferozepur Road and Maulana Shaukat Ali Road in Johar Town Lahore are examples, said Imrana Tiwana, prominent architect and environmentalist./Developed countries are replacing concrete with green cover for reducing carbon footprints./The situation is opposite here./The development should be sustainable./Environment and quality of human life should not be compromised on the name of development, she said./Emissions from brick kilns, unfit vehicles, use of rubber tyres and coal as fuel in factories, cutting of trees and fast replacement of green areas with concrete structures and roads are major factors in high level of air and noise pollution, posing serious health hazards for millions of residents and those visiting major cities daily for earning livelihood./Particulate Matter (PM), Ozone (O3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitric Oxides (NO and NO2) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) are major pollutants and their levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) standards./Pollutants restrict photosynthesis, increase respiratory infections, birth defects and acid rains./Lead, chromium, cadmium and zinc are also present in fumes released by steel industry that cause collapse of central nervous system, degeneration of joints, lung and kidney diseases./As major cities shared almost the similar factors with little or no efforts to overcome the menace of pollution, the residents and visitors are at risk of developing health related problems that is increasing burden on public sector hospitals and on pockets of individuals./The EPA has also admitted that air pollution was costing Pakistan one percent of its total GDP in the form of respiratory health problems and premature deaths./The situation is really alarming when the victim is the sole bread winner of his/her family./Allergy, lugs infection and stomach problems are affecting every second person in the congested and industrialized areas and in localities where construction activities are going on./People with allergy should avoid going to places where construction work is in progress./People should also wear masks to save them from inhaling polluted air, said Dr Abdul Rauf, a family physician running clinic in the congested locality of Farooq Gunj in Northern Lahore./According to a report of WHO, Lahore is among 10 most polluted cities in the world./Since other cities shared the similar factors, the situation is almost the same there, said experts who desired immediate mitigation measures like intensive plantation on war footing, proper maintenance of public transport and private vehicles, putting to an end trend of burning of garbage and tyres during protests and installation of treatment plants at factories./The EPA has installed Ambient Air Quality monitoring stations in eight major cities including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Rahim Yar Khan and Sheikhupura./As all the cities are different in sizes, we cannot exactly tell that which one is more polluted./Big cities like Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, however, shared almost similar pollution causing factors./As such all cities have more or less the same level of pollution./Level of pollution varies from one locality to the other./Industrialized and congested localities have higher level of pollution as compared to the residential areas due to emissions from moving and stationary sources./Moreover, emission level varies from time to time, said Director Environment Protection Department (EPD) Nasim-ur-Rehman./He claimed that the level of pollution has decreased gradually due to lesser congestion after improvement of road infrastructure in major cities especially Lahore./Introduction of Euro II standard diesel busses and petrol powered cars have also reduced emission level, he said, adding, there was still need of more efforts to overcome the menace of pollution./He suggested intensive plantation on war footing to reduce level of pollution./He endorsed that all construction projects should be monitored properly by the executing agencies to ensure the activity was not polluting the air./He claimed that the department was vigilant and could order suspension of construction activity and impose fine on developers for not taking measures to save the environment./He said that the EPA was also carrying out regular campaigns to check violation from industrial units./In the event of violation, the cases are taken to courts which prescribe penalties and punishments."
More than 6m chronic obstructive pulmonary patients in Pakistan," As the world observes World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day, more than 2,410 million people worldwide are suffering from COPD with Pakistan sharing the burden of 6.9 million people./Briefing the media at a local hotel yesterday, leading pulmonologists stressed the need for realising deadly effects of COPD as it would become the leading cause of death in future even ahead of diabetes and depression. The worst part is there is little awareness about COPD and not much attention is paid to fight it./The global Initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as a common preventable disease characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and lungs to noxious particles and gases./We have to realise that COPD is a major threat. Being a chronic disease, once a man falls prey to it, there is no point of return. If not controlled, it progresses with time. Difficulty in breathing will restrict him to perform any sternness job. He becomes a non productive part of family and society, said Prof Kamran Cheema, President Pakistan Chest Society and Head of Pulmonology Department, Services Hospital./Talking about the signs and symptoms of COPD, he said shortness of breath, persistent cough, coughing up mucus, wheezing, fatigue/tiredness, weight loss, morning headaches are alarming signs of the disease. It is more prevalent in men as compared to women. Prevalence of COPD increases with age, primarily affects people of 40 years and above./He said that symptoms of the disease develop slowly and are ignored by most of the patient as 'old age' or 'smoker's cough' which is a dangerous attitude and by the time it is realized they have often lost a significant amount of lung function./Dr Ashraf Jamal, Assistant Professor Pulmonology Services Hospital, while sharing data on COPD symptoms, said that the prevalence rate of COPD related symptoms is 18.5 per cent and 26.7 per cent patients come with co-morbidities. Similarly, around 33.3 per cent COPD patients are hospitalised for their condition and 26.7 per cent patients visited an emergency due to their respiratory condition. He said that smoking is the major contributor that accounts for up to 75% of all cases of COPD. Not only smokers are at higher risk but they also harm other people through passive smoking. Recent trends of 'Sheesha' and 'e-cigarettes' are also harmful and contributing heavily to the menace. People consider them a safe alternative but they are gravely mistaken. He urged people to stay away from smoking and other air pollutants. He urged patients to take care of their routines and habits; they have to avoid triggers like cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes and dust./Once diagnosed with COPD, daily medication is necessary along with short-acting rescue inhalers. COPD is a chronic disease and has no cure. The only way to counter is through healthy living and using prescribed therapies, he said./International moot at PICL The Punjab Institute of Cardiology is holding a three day international conference staring at a local hotel today (Thursday)./Experts from the country and abroad will read their papers about cardiac diseases. Teams of experts will treat patients through angioplasty/stenting. These cases will be conducted at PIC and shown to the participants through satellite./Junior doctors, nurses and allied health staff will benefit directly from the experiences and knowledge of experts and get guidance in complicated cases. The delegates from the US, UK, Germany, China, Japan, Poland, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam will attend the conference."
