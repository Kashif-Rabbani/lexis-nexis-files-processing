Polluted economy," There is no doubt in it that Pakistan would have to be environmental standards compliant if it wants to have a healthy nation and desires to do business with the rest of the world. It would have to look more vigorously into all environment related issues ranging from fast increasing level air pollution to water pollution and noise pollution./Today, when the whole scenario has been changed and world has become a global village, environmental issues could easily demolish the economy of any country because all major countries including European Union have set very strict environmental standards and are reluctant to import goods, specially food, from countries facing the environmental problems like Pakistan. Pakistan is already facing many crisis including energy, law and order and political instability etc, therefore, it can't afford more crisis. Government and masses have to pay attention towards the issue of pollution; otherwise it would not only play a major role to derail Pakistan's economy but also adverse effects on our future generations./A study report of World Health Organisation (WHO) says in the developing world, pollution is guilty for 5% of total demises. As far as Lahore is concerned, near 65,000 people die every year while 1300 people lose their lives because of diseases produced by the polluted environment. A medical expert has also revealed that 22% Lahoris are suffering from Asthma, a disease that born and grow in only polluted environment./Pakistani people are facing three types of pollution, air, water and land. Major reason of air pollution is rapidly increasing vehicles, thanks to car leasing schemes of banks. Approximately, daily 12 lakh vehicles travel on the roads of Lahore city and number of vehicle escalating with the ratio of 15 to 20 percent annually. Though, high petroleum prices have encouraged the people to use CNG as fuel in their vehicles, still the usage of petrol is on the higher side and creating serious environmental issues./Noise is also a kind of pollution. Vehicles at roads and machines in factories make noise throughout the day and disturb the whole atmosphere while illiterate and senseless drivers are also responsible to poison the environment as they are use to use horns without any need and hesitation. They do not care whether they are making it in the front of a hospital, school mosque or residential area. Noise pollution is putting heavy mental strain on the people of Lahore. Besides increasing blood pressure and stress levels, noise pollution can also put deadly effects on hearing. Water pollution infects the water and makes it unfit for drinking and other human use. It is also a major cause of most of the water-borne diseases like Hepatitis and dysentery and skin problems./It is a matter of satisfaction that PML-N Government has initiated a campaign to create awareness among the masses, regarding deadly and unaffordable effects of pollution. This awareness would be enhanced through newspapers, television, workshops and seminars gradually. Awareness in masses could be very helpful to curtail pollution problems hurriedly. Indian government has done a lot to curtail the pollution and yield very positive results by initiating awareness campaign. A large number of Indian drivers turn their vehicle engines off at traffic signal, not only to save some fuel but also to control pollution generated by fuel./Forests not only help to reduce the environmental problems but also control temperature. In Pakistan a large number of trees are being murdered without any adequate efforts to plant new plants. This leads to deforestation, which has caused a rise in the pollution levels and distortion of natural order. Government should not only take measures to protect the existing forests but also start growing non-natural jungles like Changa Manga./I do want to share with you that why I chose the environmental issue at this point in time when the whole world is facing financial constraints. Actually the global recession has provided us an opportunity to increase our exports to the desired levels but to my understanding the environmental issues are coming in the way quite prominently./To my understanding, the private sector in Pakistan alone can not handle the environment related issues and neither the government can do it. Both the sides would have to join hands to tackle the situation. Like neighbouring India who sensing the gravity of pollution situation Delhi, converted all its public transport on CNG, we would have to take some solid and sector specific measures to deal with the monster./We should start war against pollution to save not the economy alone but the whole nation as well otherwise our future generation will not forgive us."
Air pollution in our cities," Air pollution in, more or less, all our big cities has become a great nuisance. Ill-planned urbanization, not road worthy vehicles on the road, lack of awareness and despicably weak institutional capabilities for air pollution management and such other local factors and actors have played havoc with air quality in our cities and towns./Last month, I have had an opportunity to visit my home district Larkano, one of the most inexpensive cities of fruit, fish, vegetables and other daily usable commodities in the world, where I could see and experience that air pollution in the city has become an increasingly serious issue. Dirt and dust nuisance has made lives of the people miserable and in different mohallas even difficult to breath. According to one public health consultant from Larkano, People of all age groups, in particular, elderly people, pregnant women and children have started suffering from lung damage, heart disease, strokes and cancer due to poor air quality and heaps of dirt and dust clouds hovering over the city because the roads, lanes and drains which are being dug and the construction of different buildings which never is completed in well in time in this city and people suffer./I often think that let the poor people of this country be sitting and using the contaminated soil or water, inhaling dust or soil, suffering from ingestion of food, skin diseases or increased acute respiratory disease but it would never ever the be topmost concern of our ruling elite to devise ways and means to control air pollution and improve the quality of air to save their lives."
"Knackered, smoke-emitting vehicles taking toll on public"," The poorly maintained vehicles, emitting toxic black smoke, have swarmed the city roads, causing not only air pollution but also lungs and respiratory diseases./During a survey conducted by this correspondent, residents of different area regretted that Kamalia and its surroundings are getting swarmed with pollution-emitting vehicles amid the inefficiency and indifference of the traffic police./Most of the vehicles including bikes, motorcycle rickshaws and cars have faulty and poorly maintained engines, billowing out toxic black smoke and polluting the environment./They accused the officials of traffic police and Regional Transport Authority (RTA) of connivance with the transporters for 'bribe.' Those supposed to check movement of the smoke-emitting vehicles have turned their back on the culprits who are wreaking havoc with the public health and environment, they charged./They regretted over the indifference of the authorities concerned and pointed out that corrupt and inefficient officials are responsible for this situation./Had the officials discharge their duty, the situation would have been better today, said a citizen who introduced himself as Amjad./He said that you cannot blame the transporters alone for this grave violation as they (vehicles owners) can't dare ply on roads at their own./The traffic police or any other government agency concerned never bother to bind the owners to get their vehicles examined and ensure its fitness./The public at large has expressed concern over the rising pollution and lungs and respiratory diseases, demanding the government to check the situation./The residents of the different areas also appealed to the authorities to conduct a grand operation against vehicles causing pollution to check environmental deterioration./RESOLUTION OF FARMERS WOES: Prompt payment to farmers after the purchase of wheat and swift resolution of their problems is the top priority of the government, PML-N lawmaker Nishat Ahmed Daha said./Speaking to the farmers during visit to a wheat procurement centre here, he said that the Punjab chief minister has directed the PML-N lawmakers to visit wheat procurement centres so that the farmers' problems could be resolved swiftly./He pointed out that agriculture is the backbone of economy and the government has taken various measures to enhance farmers' capability./Assistant Commissioner Ch Muhammad Khalid, Tehsildar Rao Muhammad Zafar and In-Charge Wheat Procurement Centre Syed Haider Shah were also present on the occasion."
A solution to pollution," Pollution is the major problem as a result of which several respiratory diseases are caused./These diseases have severe impact./A solution to it is to plant more trees through which we can reduce air pollution./Trees are nature's answer to diminishing air pollution as well as reducing respiratory problems./According to the US Forest Service, broad scale-estimates concluded that trees are saving more than 850 humans live by improving air quality./Trees absorb odours and gases which cause pollution like nitrogen oxide, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and ozone./So let's make tree Plantation our goal and not just wait for the government to do so./Let's just do it ourselves and save lives."
Polluted Turbat," Being a citizen of Turbat, I am facing several problems in the form of air pollution while traveling to college./Many vehicles that have not been maintained over the years are discharging too much smoke, which is affecting the environment./I am also suffering physically, and was sick for nearly a month./Diseases such as coughing, sore throat, headache and many other dangerous diseases have affected me already./For one whole week, I was unable to attend my classes, leading to my education suffering./I request Balochistan CM Sanaullah Zahri to ban or charge such vehicles, which are responsible for so much air pollution in the region."
Pollution in Karachi," A prevailing problem in Karachi is pollution./Being an industrial city, it produces thousands of tonnes of solid waste./Some of Karachi's fertile land is used to dump waste products./Due to the accumulation of waste, many diseases are spreading in Karachi./People from lower socio-economic class search these heaps of garbage for material that can be recycled./This practice has adverse effects on their health./The streets of the city are very poorly kept./Gutters and water pipelines leak in many areas mixing clean water with polluted water./Water borne diseases are spreading at a rapid pace./The hygienic conditions of the city are poor./Garbage is sold and burnt as a fuel./This produces air pollution./Moreover, it also gives way to many diseases such as lung diseases etc./The environment is put under harm and thus nature suffers greatly./According to a research 80 percent of the garbage can be recycled if the collectors collect it separately as in, put similar materials into the same place./I urge the Government of Sindh to take necessary reforms to improve the state of environmental affairs in Karachi./If prevailing practices continue, life in the city will face even more challenges as it does today./Burning of garbage should be banned./Those who illegally sell garbage should be put to punishment."
City air pollution crosses red line," The entire population of Lahore is at risk of getting diseases due to ever deteriorating ambient air quality, experts say./In a recently released report, World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that 92 percent of the world population lives in places where air quality levels exceed danger level, posing serious health hazards./As many as six million deaths in a year are linked to exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution./The most dangerous pollutant is particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres, or PM2.5./It includes toxins like sulphate and black carbon, which can penetrate deep into the lungs or cardiovascular system./Ninety-four percent are due to non communicable diseases - notably cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer./Air pollution also increases the risks for acute respiratory infections./As per the experts, the situation is worse in Lahore where pollution level is much higher than any estimate due to excessive emissions from moving and stationary sources, continuing demolition and construction activity and fast disappearance of trees for development purposes./""Environmental Protection Agency lacks equipment to gauge level of pollution./As such there is no data to determine the ambient air quality./The WHO report has made alarming revelations./Pollution is high in urbanised and industrialized centers./But the situation is bad in developing countries and even worse in cities like Lahore,"" said Ahmad Rafay Alam, a leading lawyer and environmentalist./Referring to a report published about a couple of years back, he said that level of pollutants was seven to 14 times higher than the WHO standards in different parts of Lahore during different seasons./""Even during monsoon, level of pollutant was seven times higher than the WHO standards./In winter and following transition period in weather, the level increased 14 times"", he told The Nation./""The level of pollution would have definitely increased due to enhanced emissions from industries and vehicles./Continuous rising of dust from roads is another major source./Large scale digging and construction activity has increased pollution level manifold,"" Alam said, adding that ongoing wok on mega projects has made Lahore dirtier than the most polluted cities on the globe./He said that the prevailing factors have deteriorated ambient air quality to a dangerous level./""PM10 affect eyes, skin, throat and respiratory system./PM2.5 is more dangerous as it enters blood through lungs./This type of pollution has caused considerable increase in cardio vascular diseases.""/He further said that children were at greater risk of getting diseases due to weak immune system./Such level of pollution, he added, also hinder normal growth of brain of infants./""Even those mostly staying indoors are not free from risk of exposure to pollution./Air polluted with fine particulate matters enters rooms./As such housewives and infants are also at risk of getting diseases./""We can say that 100 per cent population of Lahore is exposed to excessive pollution and as such is at risk of getting diseases,"" said the environmentalist."
Second Hand Smog," Lahore has been choking under a blanket of smog for the past two days and the people of this city are incensed, as they should be./The place that was once known as the city of gardens has become a concrete jungle filled with smoke, traffic, dust and now hazardous gases that have no release due to the cold high pressure in the upper atmosphere./The smog was probably caused by unchecked burning of farmland in India, however our own ecology has been broken down to a point that such manmade disasters harm us more than they should./Thousands have complained about breathing problems, eye irritation and reduced visibility on roads, terming this event as the worst in the history of Lahore./The smog comprising nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and other aerosols, is only made worse by the ever increasing vehicles on the expanse of highways and roads that were made at the cost of 2200 precious trees, with nefarious plans of cutting 1900 more./If this catastrophe is not a wakeup call for the provincial government, then nothing is./The most disturbing fact is that we have no system or proper equipment for monitoring air pollution, despite the fact that Lahore ranks in the top ten cities in the world for the worst quality of air./The intensity of the problem cannot be understood or identified and hence the government is completely lost as to how it can address this live hazard./With the EPA in disarray since its director general was sacked recently, in the absence of a barely functioning body that should have declared this event as an environmental emergency, the people have no knowledge about the precautions they can take to protect themselves from this poisonous smog./Staying indoors and wearing facemasks can prevent a degree of damage to the lungs and eyes and also avoiding using your own cars and vehicles on heavy smog days is the least that can be done to prevent exacerbating the problem."
Court moved," Walid Iqbal, grandson of great thinker and National Poet Allama Dr Iqbal, filed a writ petition in the Lahore High Court seeking directions for the Punjab government to take adequate steps to control smog and air pollution in the provincial capital./Iqbal filed the petition through his counsel Advocate Sheraz Zaka and submitted that many ill-planned development programs were initiated in the city./He said digging at several places in the city had caused huge pollution./The petitioner said people had been suffering from the Smog which he said was the mixture of dust and smoke in the air./Life had turned miserable due to this endemic air pollution./The government authorities, he said, did nothing to prevent the city from pollution which was increasing fast./People had been getting ill due to it, he said./He prayed the court to direct the government for taking adequate steps to control smog and air pollution."
Smoke not smog," We are not contributors toward air pollution but rather its victims. Most of the smog you see here is coming from India"", indubitably postulates our Punjab Environment Protection Agency (PEPA) official. The hilarity that is this statement is beyond comprehensible. The ease with which officials play on the 'Indian conspiracy' and toy with society's emotions is astounding. Our officials mindlessly and without caution tap into baseless argumentation, without fail. Yet these laughable individuals are our representatives, and we allow them to exploit their positions. What is even more unnerving, however, is that the so called 'educated' civilians buy into these theories. As a nation, collectively, it has never been hard for us to brush aside any issue and blame it on India./Smog is air pollution; a blend of smoke and fog. However, at 21 degrees Celsius in Lahore, fog is NOT in the mix - this current blanket is purely smoke and sulphur dioxide. We call this photochemical smog i.e the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and ozone that creates this haze. The chemicals that are currently burning your eyes and itching your throat include aldehydes, nitrogen oxides, particularly nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, peroxyacyl nitrates, tropospheric ozone and volatile organic compounds. The cooling temperature makes the air heavy, and locks these chemicals at the ground level - it is not smog, it is smoke./Contributors include, mass traffic, rubbish incineration, expansive urban development and fossil fuel burning. Lahore is the second largest industrial city in all of Pakistan. It has both small and large industries - those within its boundaries and those just outside. When the last census was conducted in 1998, it was home to 5.143 million people. In the 18 years since, and with a 1.49% per annum population growth rate according to U.N estimates, Lahore has become the second largest and second most populous city in Pakistan. It is the 32nd most populous city in the world./Lahore is slowly becoming home to millions more through unprecedented rural-urban migration. 54% of the world's population currently resides within urban cities, and this will continue to expand to approximately 66% by 2050. To put this into perspective, the world population will be nigh on 9 billion by 2050 as projected by UN statistics. Not only is this putting a strain on cities themselves, but it is making those within them all the more vulnerable./The buildings that we reside in globally, collectively contribute to 45% of greenhouse gas emissions merely through cooling, heating and powering. 54% of the electricity in Pakistan is contributed by fossil fuel burning. Global warming has attributed to sky rocketing temperatures in Pakistan, leading to excessive use of air conditioning and (because of faithful load shedding) generators. With no garbage disposal or recycling system, the waste in the city is usually burnt. Every car has only a single individual making use of it. The exorbitant Orange Line is subjecting endless amounts of dust onto civilians and a myriad other projects are taking place simultaneously. Uncurbed deforestation in the nation, and callous tree cutting within Lahore as well, has immense ecological impacts that cannot be related in a single article./The United States Environmental Protection Agency created a measure called the Air Quality Index (AQI), to relay air quality information to the general public. An 8-hour average of ozone concentration between 85 to 104 parts per billion volume (ppbv) is unhealthy for 'sensitive' citizens, 105-124 ppbv as unhealthy to the general public and 125-404 ppbv as 'very unhealthy'. What is currently occurring in our city has not been translated to us because the PEPA 'lacks the equipment for real-time monitoring of the city's air quality' as described by the same spokesperson./This kind of noxious environment is extremely hazardous to all civilians of society. It can inflame breathing passages, decrease the lungs' working capacity, and cause shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. No matter how much you try to escape it, it is present in the air of your homes and offices. One cannot imagine the impact on our birds and insects that provide us with important ecosystem services./Cities of the world account for around 70% of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Yet they only cover 4% of the world's land mass. Ecosystems have often proved resilient to human damage, capable of healing itself. But human actions no longer harm only a small fragment of a forest or pollute only the air around big cities. October 31, 2016 marked the 3rd year since 2014 (when the UN announced the date) as World Cities Day. This was done to create awareness about global urban expansion and the aggressive need to challenge growth. Climate change is attributed to colossal amounts of fossil fuel combustion and monolithic deforestation. We forget, however, the primary reason these issues take place is due to the ceaseless growth of our urban landscape./In the age of information and technology, there are ways to direct and adapt cities to benefit humans, their way of life and the natural world. Intelligently designing our cities could reduce chances of damage./Renewable energy investments will pay back quicker if neighbourhood layouts and urban networks are coordinated with building strategies. A large-shared geothermal energy system for heating and cooling buildings within one network will help save everyone costs. Similarly, if the same is done for solar energy panels, energy savings could reach 30 percent or more. Net energy will always be produced and could be sold to other grids. This means, poorer segments of society could have electricity cheaply catered to them too. Germany is testament to the benefits of renewable energy when it paid its citizens to use electricity./Green roofs have become exceedingly trendy, and have been known to benefit the buildings where they have been installed. Studies have indicated that buildings with green roofs are substantially cooler than neighbouring buildings that do not have them. This means a marked decrease in use of cooling or ventilation for those buildings. In addition, the ecological importance of green roofs is becoming very valuable. Firstly, it would aid the transpiration process, so that we have timely rainfalls. Secondly, they provide homes and shelter to our pollinators (birds and bees) who are slowly losing their habitats. Ensuring the health, safety and reproduction of our pollinators ensures that we are still provided with their eco-system services; such as pollination, which stabilises forest growth. Restabilising forests means keeping global warming in check, and hence reducing risks of natural disasters. Lastly, more green will ensure better air quality for all residents./Mass transit must be completely overhauled. China is slowly working its way to become a world leader in developing state-of-the-art, fast and efficient electric trains and buses. These will carry its working population to their jobs and back with zero emissions. Zero carbon emissions spells better health for city dwellers, meaning less strain on the health system and less burden on city officials and tax payers./Miraculously, all of this will do no harm to the environment, benefit human health and safety and save humanity billions of dollars. These are only a few examples, yet the benefits are far-reaching./Why don't we attribute this smog to the world's largest polluter, from whom we live downwind, our friend and neighbour China? Lahore, Delhi and Beijing come under the world's top 10 cities prone to the worst smog - Beijing coming in at first place. The fact is, however, that in the anthropocene era, one city or country is no longer the sole contributor - it is the entire world."
Punjab's smog emergency," For the past week, a spectre has been haunting Punjab./A spectre of smog and haze./Arriving just when temperatures began to dip in honor of winter, it was first dismissed as nothing more than the early onset of winter fog./But winter morning fog gives way to warm shafts of sunlight as the day progresses./Last week, hopes turned to ash when, as morning turned to afternoon, the ""fog"" didn't settle./In fact, it took on an altogether alien look, engulfing large parts of Punjab in an unfamiliar brown, dusty cloud./Hospitals were inundated with cases of respiratory problems; children with bad throats and commuters with stinging eyes./There was a run on surgical masks in Lahore, and haze has been blamed for a tragic accident on the motorway that resulted in the loss of 25 lives./Instinctively, large parts of the mainstream and social media started looking for someone or someone to blame./Many knee-jerk reasons for the smog have been suggested./It could be construction dust, with the Orange Line Train and other development projects in the city choking the city./It could be industrial pollution, with factories using anything from plastic to rubber to fire up their boilers./(To the uninitiated, a drive over Sheikhupura Road on the Motorway or along the Northern part of Lahore's Ring Road presents a bleak picture of hell: black smoke billowing from factory chimney after factory chimney literally chokes the sunlight in these areas.) It could also be the huge amount of hydrocarbons the incredibly large number of cars, motorbikes and ""Chinqchi"" rickshaws spew into the air./But none of these reasons explain the scale of this smog, which has affected not just Lahore, but blankets a large part of central and northern Punjab./It could be smoke from the large scale crop burning taking place in Indian Punjab and in scattered locations along our side of Punjab as well./The smoke from these crop burnings have impacted Indian cities as far away as New Delhi and Agra and everything in between from there to as far as the Salt Range./Alternatively, the smog could be part of the Asian Brown Cloud, a massive cloud of poison that stretches from China to India, blocking out the sun, causing illness and acid rain throughout the region./The fact is we don't know./We don't know because the EPA, Punjab - which is mandated with the responsibility to protect the environment of the Province and our Fundamental Right to a clean and healthy environment - doesn't have any air quality testing machines that can determine the nature of the smog or its severity./The Government may have money for expensive chandeliers for the renovation of the Governor's House, Murree, it may have money for overpasses, laptops, dengue control and hospitals, but it appears not to have the US$ 150,000-200,000 that UNEP says a country needs to set up ""a countrywide network of mobile and stationary air monitoring stations"" on the cheap./Without monitoring equipment, we can't tell what the smog is composed of./We can't therefore determine the causes of the smog, its severity or how dangerous it is./Without monitoring equipment, we can't even begin to plan how to deal with the smog./It will not do to blame the Orange Line for the smog if it it in fact crop burnings that are responsible./It won't do to ban cars if the problem is industrial pollution./Misdiagnosis will not cure the problem./Most likely the smog is an amalgam of pollution sources./But we won't know until and unless we have monitoring equipment./And if it is true that the large scale incidents of farmers in Indian Punjab burning the residue of their rice crop that is responsible for the smog that has engulfed the Northern part of South Asia, this raises a number of transboundary environmental control issues./Indian courts have banned the practice of rice burning, but the state governments there appear to have little enforcement capacity./Reports from India indicate that increasing biomass prices versus falling coal prices have meant most of the tenancy farmers of small-scale holdings simply don't have the money to afford alternatives to crop burning; and do so in full knowledge of the impact it has on other Indian cities./Regardless, the Pakistani state owes a responsibility to protect its citizens from environmental pollution./What legal frameworks and diplomatic options are available to it to interact with India on this issue./Can SAARC be leveraged to control crop burning next year? What can be done to prevent another public health emergency next year at this time? If the smog has a transboundary factor, it is a nothing less than a challenge to South Asian diplomacy./However, a transboundary element in the current smog emergency should not be an excuse to overlook the already dangerously high pollution levels in our cities and rural areas./In 2005 - over a decade ago - the Word Bank Environment Assessment of Pakistan calculated urban air pollution caused around 22,000 premature deaths among adults and 700 deaths among young children annually, and cost the Pakistan exchequer some Rs.65 billion a year in health-related costs./Research papers published in international science journals inform us the particulate matter (PM) in our air is 2 to 13 times higher than limits prescribed by US Environment Protection Agency; that air quality ranges from unhealthy to dangerous through the year; and that major contributions to PM are soil/road dust, industrial emissions, vehicular emissions and secondary aerosols./Even without the present pall of smog, Pakistani cities, especially in the Punjab, have dangerously high levels of air pollution./With the smog, these levels will most certainly have shot through the roof./However, without air quality measurement devices, the public cannot be informed of the severity of the threat./In Beijing, regular air quality updates inform people how long it is safe to stay outdoors./In Delhi, as a response to the smog emergency, the Capital's government has shut down some 1800 public primary schools to protect children from falling prey to the ill affects of the smog./In Beijing, PM is referred to nothing less than ""cancer causing particulate matter.""/It is the Fundamental Right of every Pakistani to enjoy a clean and healthy environment./It is the right of every working man and woman to be able to get to work and home again without getting sick./It is the Right of every child to play outdoors without acquiring respiratory disease./The Supreme Court of Pakistan has cast a ""positive obligation"" on the state to protect this Right, meaning it cannot sit by and act only when the right is violated./It must remain vigilant against any threat to the Right and act to stem them immediately./It is good news that the Government of Punjab constituted a high-level to make recommendations about how to handle the smog./The public needs to be informed./But the Government must also act fast to procure air quality testing devices./Without these instruments, there is no means of knowing how and how badly our air is polluted, or what we can do to say safe from harm./And unless the transboundary element of the smog is not properly appreciated and dealt with, Punjab could suffer more lethal smog emergencies./Standards will have to be established and protocols rolled out that can advise the public of whether its safe or not to go outdoors./Whilst the smog of November 2016 is a environment and public health emergency, it is an opportunity for environment issues to capture the public's interest./It is up to civil society and the media to keep the pressure on the Government's concerned to act appropriately."
"Poor bylaws, lack of implementation termed reason for smog"," Pollutants-carrying smog that has engulfed various parts of Punjab has not only disrupted routine life but also causing throat infection, sore eyes and breathing ailments./A survey conducted by the correspondents reveals that the tehsil Bhalwal and elsewhere have been blanketed in dense smog for the last five days./The citizens are of the view that ropy roads, lots of dust and smoke-emitting vehicles are the reason behind the situation./They said that commuters, workers, shopkeepers and people belonging to all walks of life are facing several traffic and health problems owing to smog as no precautionary measure by the government have been taken so far./They said that the smog has decreased the visibility on roads which also have caused many accidents during the past five days./Bhalwal Sarafa Market President Muhammad Aslam Soni lashes out at India, saying the immense straw burning there has caused dense smog in Pakistani Punjab which is affecting the people's respiratory systems, causing eye-burning and skin allergies./Renowned physician Dr Kamran Bhatti said that smog is highly toxic which is increasing respiratory-related health problems and causing irritation in eyes among the citizens./He said that smog, sometimes, also threatens the lives of patients with respiratory ailments./In Sambrial, people termed air pollution a newfangled challenging issue for Pakistan after terrorism./They said that poor implementation of Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997 is ruining environment in country./As per SRO 1062(1)2010 in exercise of the powers conferred under clause (C) of sub-section (1) of section 6 of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997, national environment quality standards were established for ambient air./But unfortunately these NEQS have never been enforced in true spirit by the Environment Department since its promulgation, they regretted, adding the NEQS defined the limits of parameters regarding air pollutants including Nitrogen Oxides which is the reason of smog./It is also caused by the smoke being emitted by industries and vehicles, combustion of woods, coal and fossil oils./Smog has covered several areas of Punjab and spreading to more and more areas./They said the smog, loaded with pollutants, is damaging public health as it is causing throat, nose and eyes irritation, adding the worst health suffering of smog is headache and chest congestion./They said that people of tehsil Sambrial are worried, especially about health of their school-going children due to prevailing air-pollution."
Smog: What's wrong," The term ""smog"" was first used in London during the early 1900's to describe the combination of smoke and fog that often blanketed the city./Smog is a type of air pollution which is composed of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, ozone, smoke or particulates among others (less visible pollutants include carbon monoxide, CFCs and radioactive sources)./Man-made smog is derived from coal emissions, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions./Modern smog, as found for example in Los Angeles is a type of air pollution derived from vehicular emission from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog./In certain other cities, such as Delhi, smog severity is often aggravated by stubble burning in neighbouring agricultural areas./The atmospheric pollution levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Mexico City, Tehran and other cities are increased by inversion that traps pollution close to the ground./It is usually highly toxic to humans and can cause severe sickness, shortened life or death./Air Pollution is defined as ""Chemicals added to the atmosphere by natural events or human activities in high enough concentrations to be harmful""./Two categories of air pollutant are: (1) Primary Air Pollutant: Harmful substance that is emitted directly into the atmosphere, (2) Secondary Air Pollutant: Harmful substance formed in the atmosphere when a primary air pollutant reacts with substances normally found in the atmosphere or with other air pollutants./The 20th century has been characterised by a transition from urban air dominated primary pollutants to one where secondary pollutants are very important./Three major outdoor air pollution problems are industrial smog from burning coal, photochemical smog from motor vehicle and industrial emissions, and acid deposition from coal burning and motor vehicle exhaust./Photochemical smog is a unique type of air pollution which is caused by reactions between sunlight and pollutants like hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide./Although photochemical smog is often invisible, it can be extremely harmful, leading to irritations of the respiratory tract and eyes./In regions of the world with high concentrations of photochemical smog, elevated rates of death and respiratory illnesses have been observed./Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialisation./It is present in all modern cities./The initial step in photochemical reactions is the absorption of a photon by an atom, molecule, free radical or ion./The result of this absorption is strongly dependent on the energy, in other word the wavelength of the photon./Photochemical smog can occur in any environment where there are large and continuous emissions of primary air pollutants./However specifics of climate and geography play an important role in the persistence and severity of the photochemical smog./Two factors influencing the formation of photochemical smog (a) Topography: Wind moves air masses both horizontally and vertically, dispersing pollutants and reducing concentrations with distance from the source./The amount of dispersion which occurs is directly related to the stability of the air or how much vertical air movement is taking place./(b) Temperature Inversion: Thermal inversions worsen any type of smog ./It is abnormal arrangement of air masses./A warmer layer of air is trapped between two layers of colder air./This causes pollutants to be trapped near the earth's surface can form when hills or mountains stop horizontal winds, causing pollutants to collect over a city./Warm air collects over the polluted air, acting as a lid to stop the pollutants from being dispersed./Major Air Pollutants responsible for photochemical smog are Carbon oxides (CO, CO2), Nitrogen oxides and nitric acid (NO, NO2, HNO3), Sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid (SO2, H2SO4), Particulates (SPM), Ozone (O3), Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)./The reactions that lead to the formation of photochemical smog are irritated by sunlight and involve hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted from automobiles./Photochemical smog (mainly automobile pollution) from the burning of coal and oil contains sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide, soot and ash (particulate matter) and sulphuric acid./It can cause breathing difficulties in humans, plus acid rain damage to plants, aquatic systems, and metal or stone objects./The time of day is a very important factor influencing on the amount of photochemical smog:(a) Early morning traffic increases the emissions of both nitrogen oxides and no methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) a type of VOCs - as people drive to work./(b) Later in the morning, traffic reduces and the nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds begin to react to form nitrogen dioxide and increase its concentration./(c) As the sunlight becomes more intense later in the day, nitrogen dioxide is broken down and its by-products from increasing concentrations of ozone./(d) At the same time, some of nitrogen dioxide can react with the volatile organic compounds to produce toxic chemicals like PAN./Vegetation is easily harmed main agents of damage are ozone and PAN./Sensitive crops, trees and other vegetation are harmed at lower ozone concentrations than is human health./Ground level ozone can damage leaves, and reduce growth, productivity and reproduction./It can cause vulnerability to insects and disease, and even plant death./When ozone levels are fairly high over a long period, agricultural crops can suffer significant harm./Smog can also accelerate the deterioration of rubber, plastics, paints and dyes./Damage to metals, stone, concrete, clothing, rubber and plastic is directly related to contaminants in the air./The typical culprits are sulphur dioxide, sulphuric acid, ozone (photochemical smog), and nitric acid (HNO3)./Anyone who engages in strenuous outdoor activity - from jogging to manual labor - may suffer smog-related health effects./Physical activity causes people to breathe faster and more deeply, exposing their lungs to more ozone and other pollutants./Four groups of people are particularly sensitive to ozone and other air pollutants in smog:/· Children - Active children run the highest risks from exposure to smog, as children spend a lot of time playing outside./As a group, children are also more prone to asthma - the most common chronic disease for children - and other respiratory ailments than adults./· Adults who are active outdoors - Healthy adults of any age who exercise or work outdoors are considered at higher risk from smog./· People with respiratory diseases - People with asthma or other chronic respiratory diseases are more sensitive and vulnerable to the effects of ozone./Typically, they will experience adverse effects sooner and at lower levels of exposure than those who are less sensitive./· People with unusual susceptibility to ozone - some otherwise healthy people are simply more sensitive to the pollutants in smog than other people, and may experience more adverse health effects from exposure./Elderly people are often warned to stay indoors on heavy smog days./Elderly people are probably not at increased risk of adverse health effects from smog because of their age./Like any other adults, however, elderly people will be at higher risk from exposure to smog if they already suffer from respiratory diseases, are active outdoors, or are unusually susceptible to ozone./In addition, the numbers of road crashes with high mortality and morbidity rates have also been reported./The road, the air and the coastal traffic may be effected./Don't take chances with smog on days when air quality is poor./The best approach is to spend less time outdoors and replace vigorous activities, like running or biking, with gentler options, such as walking./You can also schedule your outside activities for the early morning or evening, when ozone levels are low./These simple steps can help protect you and your family on smoggy days, whether you live in a major city or you're just passing through."
Emergency Measures," When NASA pointed out that farmers burning crop stubbles in India might be a major reason for a smog blanket in Lahore, our government was most likely overjoyed./This meant that the blame pinned on them for destroying the ecology of Lahore could be very well deflected on India and all would continue business as usual./But the smog has persisted and the haze refuses to budge./How does the Punjab government intend to deal with this dangerous hazard that threatens the health and safety of millions of people?/Lahore is the second largest industrial city in all of Pakistan and the second most populous./There are a multitude of reasons contributing to the smog; trans-boundary crop fires, mass traffic, rubbish incineration, expansive urban development and fossil fuel burning everywhere from vehicles to industries./The solutions proposed to the CM, by a committee he created to tackle this situation, included shutting down of industrial units around Lahore temporarily./So far the district administration has closed down thirty-eight factories in Darog-e-wala, Band road and Shumali area, with four more closing tomorrow./Ten other factories were given notice and the crackdown will continue on all those industrial units that are emitting sulphur dioxide directly into the atmosphere./While, as short term measures, these are absolutely essential to clear this choking smog, this is an opportunity for the provincial government to make some permanent changes in the way the industrial sector functions./The federal government has turned a blind eye towards the powerful refineries and did not pressure them to take corrective measures even though the problem had been identified long ago./These refineries have continued to produce diesel, which was sending dangerous amounts of sulphur dioxide into the air through machines running on them, including heavy transport and construction machinery./In 2005, the Word Bank Environment Assessment of Pakistan calculated that urban air pollution caused around 22,000 premature deaths among adults and 700 deaths among young children annually, and cost the Pakistan exchequer some Rs 65 billion a year in health-related costs./Here we are a decade later, creating hasty policies and performing emergency crackdowns because we refuse to implement a proper policy framework to address the problem of air pollution."
"Courts sitting on 94 cases of air pollution, PA told"," In a shocking revelation made in the Punjab Assembly yesterday, at least 145 factories are spreading air pollution only in one provincial constituency of Lahore while environment courts are sitting over 94 cases filed against factory owners for violation of environment laws./The constituency (PP-145) forms north eastern part of Lahore comprising areas of Harbanspura, Tajpura, Ghaziabad, parts of Mughalpura and Baghbanpura./In a written reply submitted to the Assembly, the government has admitted that the area got developed without any planning and factories cropped up in the residential areas. The Assembly was further told that there are 154 factories in the area out of which 134 were producing steel by melting scrap./But the local MPA from this constituency, Muhammad Waheed Gul believes that the number of factories causing pollution is far higher than the official figures. In his question asked from the environment department he has put the figure of 1580 mills polluting the environment by burning carbon, chemicals and wires./Punjab Minister for Environment, Zakia Shahnawaz also acknowledged on the assembly floor that factory owners would burn tyres, plastic and other toxic material to melt the iron when gas was not available in the winter. But at the same time, she passed on part of the blame to the polluted air coming from India when her colleague Hina Pervaiz Butt asked the reasons for the recent unprecedented smog in the city. The minister also mentioned other causes like smoke emitting vehicles and factory pollution saying that laws were being strictly applied to address this problem./The Assembly was told that environment courts were sitting over 94 cases of air pollution filed against owners of different factories for spreading toxic emissions. This disclosure leaves a question mark on the functioning of green courts set up by Chief Justice of Lahore High Court, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah to dispose of cases relating to environment./The written answer also contained information about 55 factories which have been sealed in this particular area for using prohibited fuel. It also mentions cases of 19 mills which are under trial in the department and 10 factories whose owners have been sent show cause notices under section 16 of the Environment Protection Act./The government, however, failed to reply part of the question in which the legislator had asked if the government had any planning to shift these factories from the residential areas. Nonetheless, the minister replied that government was asking the factory owners to shift to modern technology to reduce the level of harmful emissions./In reply to a question by Muhammad Arshad Advocate of the ruling party, the environment minister informed the House that government was prosecuting 10 owners of smoke emitting vehicles while 25 persons have been fined by environment magistrate. About the Sahiwal coal power plant, she assured the Assembly that emissions from this plant would be kept as per the international standards. She said government had already purchased one Air Quality Monitoring Station to check the level of air pollution while five more stations would be available in the near future./The minister further told the House that government was asking all factory owners in Punjab to shift to the modern technology to reduce the level of air pollution./Also, the Opposition staged walked out from the Assembly to register protest over poor law and order situation in Punjab. Citing recent incidents of robbery in the City, Opposition leader Mehmoodur Rashid said that despite significant increase in budget for the Punjab police, the crime rate was still showing an upward trend./Earlier, the session started behind the schedule with a delay of around two- and- half hours. Speaker Rana Muhammad Iqbal snubbed PPP legislator Khurrum Jehangir Wattoo who lodged protest over the delay. The Speaker attributed it to late arrival of the assembly members and asked the Opposition leader Mehmoodur Rashid to calm down the protesting member. Rashid told the chair how he could admonish him when he was raising a valid point."
People exposed to serious health hazards," Corrupt officials of various departments with connivance of influential people are patronising the illegally installed stone crushing plants which cause serious threats to public health and environment, it is learnt./The officials have turned a blind eye to the illegal stone crushing at the 58 plants located at Sakhi Sarwar and eight gypsum crushing plants located at Taunsa Sharif. These crushing plants are causing adverse environmental effects, as per a report of District Environment Protection Agency Dera Ghazi Khan./The report said that stone crushing units without boundary walls in Sakhi Sarwar have been installed to crush big stones into different grade small stones. The crushed stones are separated and stored near the crushing machines via conveyer belts for sale. About 10 persons do work in a unit as labourer in different shifts, as per the report./EPA Inspector M Arshad inspected M/S Allah Wasaya and Hussain Stone Crusher Plant near Sakhi Sarwar Quetta Road. He reported that crushing/grinding process was dry; therefore air pollution in the form of dust is produced from the plant during operation of plant. The dust pollutes the environment in the area with the blow of wind. No mitigation measures were adopted to control air pollution, he said./Arshad pointed out that health and precautionary measures like masks, boots, helmets, gloves and safety dress etc were not seen in the plant. So the labourers at the plants, other people and environment around the plant are exposed to pollution threat that may cause different diseases like silicosis, cough, respiratory tract diseases, irritations to nose, eyes and skin./He also reported that the operator of the stone crushing plant did not show any ownership document or licence of Mining Department and TMA concerned./When contacted District Officer Environment (DOE) Naseem Shah said that the District Environment Protection Agency has initiated action against 58 stone crushing plants and eight gypsum crushing plants that are violating the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (PEPA)-1997 (amended 2012)./The cases have been referred to Environmental Protection Agency, Lahore for legal action under the law to bind the owners for the installation of dust control system to protect the environment of area./When contacted, District Officer Labour and Human Resource Department Shahid Hameed Leghari said that without receiving a complaint, the department cannot take action against the owners of these stone crushers units. However, he said that Inspector Labour will visit Sakhi Sarwar in a few days to inspect unites."
Pollution is causing diseases," I want to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for cleaning the environment./The people are spreading pollution in the environment which is very dangerous for our health./Many people are suffering from several dangerous diseases such as cancer and blindness that are the responsible for thousands of deaths./Air pollution has viruses and bacteria which are very harmful for our health./Pollution is the biggest enemy of a clean environment./If pollution is not controlled, it will destroy our lives./Pollution is also the biggest enemy of cultivation which is very necessary for us./I request the government to warn the industries and companies who are responsible for spreading pollution."
Tyre-burning factories worsen public lives," Dozens of illegal tyre-burning factories in Sanjarpur, Kot Sabzal, Ahmedpur Lamma and Murid Shakh areas have made the public lives miserable as toxic smoke emits during the process has left the residents with eye-burning and respiratory diseases./According to the report of a survey conducted by this correspondent, residents of different areas said that the tyre-burning factories in these localities have worsened the public lives. They said that the factories have not only given rise to air-pollution but the toxic smoke, emits from tyres burning has also left the public with eye-burning, numerous respiratory diseases and even hepatitis. They said that owners of the factories have a large business of producing oil through burning tyre which is sold in the market at high prices./They regretted that indifferent factories owners have never bothered to think about the public health rather they are more interested in making big money only, leaving the public at the mercy of the grave situation./They informed that that the government has banned such kind of factories which pollute the atmosphere. ""But flouting the government's orders, the factory owners are running the factories with impunity,"" they expressed their concerns./Citizens including Amjad Sheikh, Imtiaz Hussain, Munawar Hussain, Tariq Mehmood, Gull Muhammad Khan, Ali Ahmed and Mehr Deen demanded the district administration and to stop these factories from polluting the atmosphere and save the public becoming victims of diseases./AWF holds free medical camp/Around 100 patients were provided free medical treatment at a medical camp, established by the Al-Rehman Welfare Foundation here the other day./According to the foundation information secretary Abdul Majid Sukhera, the medical camp was established under the supervision of AWF tehsil president Abdul Waheed Qureshi./Renowned physician Dr Zulqarnain Akbar examined patients at the camp and provided them free medicines, he said. He said besides patients, notables of the tehsil including Abdul Latif Bhatti, AWF secretary general Hafiz Abdul Ghaffar, finance secretary Ch Shabbir also visited the camp and praised the welfare services of the foundation."
Pollution in Pakistan," To solve the electricity problem, the government of Pakistan is making coal power plants and by doing so is adding to the biggest threat to the world; climate change./In Madrid, half of the vehicles were banned from the streets in order to safeguard public health./It along with Paris, Athens and Mexico City announced to take their diesel vehicles off the road by 2025./These vehicles and power plants produce particulate matter that can enter the respiratory tract which can result in various heart complications along with diseases./In just over the last decade, the number of cars roaming about in Punjab has increased to a mighty 11 million the effect of which can be observed through the prevalence of smog in November last year./Moreover, 2,200 trees have been eliminated from the city in the last year thus increasing the chances of the effects of air pollution to be felt./There is a need to switch to other renewable energy sources./Why don't we move to it and catch all radiations from the sun./Germany and UK are shutting down their plants that are emitters of greenhouse gases by 2050, France is doing this by 2023./Why is Pakistan left behind? "
Air pollution," Air pollution is one of the biggest problems of the modern world./The word pollute, means to make dirty and unclean by harmful materials./Air pollution means that the air that we breathe is made dirty and unclean by things like dust, smoke, harmful gases and chemical vapours./Earth's atmosphere is made up of nitrogen gas (78%) oxygen gas 21% and other trace gases, such as argon and carbon dioxide./This balance is essential to all life here on Earth./Due to air pollution, the lives of humans and animals are in danger./I would like to request all authorities to play their role and address the issue of air pollution."
Oil refinery creating environmental hazards," An oil refinery, Sheikh Brothers Lubricants, has been creating environmental and health hazards for the residents of Syednagar village adjacent to Alipur Chattha district Gujranwala, for the last one decade./The issue was taken up with the Environment Protection Agency several times, it is still unresolved for the reasons that the EPA officials could not explain. The issue has heated up again and the EPA has summoned the complainants and the owners of the refinery to present their point of view on May 10, 2017./The residents blame Sheikh Brother Lubricants said the liquid waste of the oil refinery was being disposed of in a pond nearby due to which the underground water level has been polluted and villagers are forced to use water from a public sector water tank./EPA Deputy Director Waseem Ahsan Cheema told The Nation that investigation was underway. 'District Officer Environment Gujrawala Rana Asghar, after conducting an initial inquiry into the charges, has sent a report to the Environment Protection Agency, Lahore office./'We have sent notices to both the parties and hearing of the case would be on Mary 10, 2017, before the Deputy Director (Research and Investigation) at EPA Complaint Cell,' he said./Zeeshan, a resident of a village in Alipur Chathha, said the oil refinery named Sheikh Brother Lubricants was built just at few hundred yards away from our village in 1997. 'When oil is prepared it produces very bad smell and it moves in the direction of air and causes breathing problems for people living in the village,' he said. /'As result of the acidic smoke directly thrown into air, it makes at times breathing impossible for residents. We have repeatedly complained and request EPA DOE Gujranwala and even the EPA Lahore, but all in vein,' Zeeshan said./Yasir Ali, who is a clerk in a private company and resident of Nawaan Thatta area of the same village, said that despite repeated complaints, EPA has been using delaying tactics./He said in 2007 the oil purification unit was shut off due to strong agitation of public from nearby localities. 'Due to understanding between EPA officials and owner of the unit, it started working again after some time,' Yasir said./Muhammad Arif, a farmer of Syednagar village, said children had to inhale smoke and drink contaminated water. 'Although there are no issues of government-run tube-wells through which we provide water to our fields, the tap water is not usable anymore and this could be dangerous for our children and in near future the situation could be very dangerous,' he said./The EPA closed this unit in 2007 by applying the clause 146/C of Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001. However, after some time the unit again started working./The residents also told The Nation that EPA did not apply 146/D clause of the ordinance which directed demolition or removal of the unit, but they did apply 146/C just to divert simple public's attention for some time. /Even in 2006 when the first complaint was launched against the factory, the then EPD inspector of Gurjawala, Arif Mehmood, in his report sent to the EPD Department, Lahore, stated: 'Village Syednagar is located at a distance of just 1km from the factory and the people of this village feel much disturbance by the air pollution.'/Muddassir Bhatti, a farmer with small land holding in the village Syednagar, said that due to waste extraction of the oil refinery in their village, the underground water has been badly contaminated. 'A few years back we could even drink water from our hand pumps, but now even if we take a bath, it cause itching all over our bodies,' Muddassir said./Villagers also complained that the situation could be drastic for schoolchildren in Government Model School for Girls and Government Model School for Boys. Syednagar village's population is around 10,000./According to clause 146/D of Punjab Local Govt Ordinance, 2001, in case of any serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare or danger to life and property, the inspector may, in his area of jurisdiction, in addition to imposition of fine or initiating prosecution under this ordinance, suspend any work, seize the goods, seal the premises and demolish or remove work./The EPA deputy director stated: 'I am directed to intimate that Environmental Protection Order under Section-16 of Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997, (Amended in 2012), has already been issued to the alleged unit, containing the directions./In 2013, the EPA, after holding a departmental inquiry, issued a directive to the oil refinery to take remedial measures by installing air pollution abatement equipment to control gaseous emissions and bring values of applicable parameters to comply with permissible limits of National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS). It was also directed to save public health and environment to the satisfaction of this agency and dispose of sludge/solid waste in proper scientific manners./Even in 2013, the EPA warned that if the necessary steps were not taken, operation of pollution generating activities at the present site would be stopped./It is pertinent to note that District Officer Environment Muhammad Nawaz Sial stated in a report in 2013: 'This office visited Sheikh Brothers Lubricants Alipur Chattha on 14-10-2013 and a report was forwarded to Director General EPA Punjab, Lahore, for further necessary action under the provisions of Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997, (amended in 2012)."
7m Pakistanis suffering from asthma," Yet another World Asthma Day will be observed today (Tuesday) with the usual rituals of holding walks, seminars and free medical camps but without concrete measures to check ever increasing pollution, one of the leading causes of asthma./Like the previous years, the events will be day specific and nothing after that till the next year. There is little or no hope of controlling polluting activities both at the government and individual levels. WAD is an initiative begun in 1998 by the Global Initiative for Asthma, an organisation that sets medical guidelines for the control of the disease. The purpose of the event, arranged on first Tuesday of May, is to raise awareness of the causes and effects of this bronchial condition, which affects approximately 235 million people worldwide./At least seven million people are suffering from asthma in Pakistan. The number of patients of bronchial asthma is increasing particularly in big cities like Lahore because of worst air pollution due to traffic and factories' smoke, large scale digging and cutting of trees for development purposes, burning of garbage and smoking./WAD focuses on educating the public on what research has found to be the most effective ways of controlling and treating asthma./Asthma is a chronic infection of the lungs which create problems while breathing. The symptoms of asthma include breathlessness, coughing, wheezing and a feeling of tightness in the chest. These symptoms will change in frequency and severity. When the symptoms are not under control, the airways can become inflamed making breathing difficult. While asthma cannot be cured; the symptoms can be controlled by taking precautionary measures and proper medication. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning./Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) stated that the exact causes of asthma were still unknown but factors such as heredity, modern living including carpeted surroundings, use of reupholstered furniture, heaters, humidifiers and air conditioners could trigger asthma attacks. Excessive pollution and severe weather conditions and fumes can also cause asthma. Old people, infants and children are more vulnerable to the disease. Chronic Nasal allergy can also be resulted into asthma. Parental smoking is also a major contributing factor producing asthma, rapid urbanization, industrial and traffic pollution, burning of garbage, overcrowding, environmental degradation is further aggravating asthma suffering./Experts have advised balanced diet, regular exercise and proper medication to reduce the gravity of this disease. Prevention is better than cure, so people are advised to follow the preventive measure to avoid asthma and its complications./PMA demanded the government to control environmental pollution and implement the no smoking ordinance 2002 to reduce the sufferings of the Asthma patients."
Negligence turns Kasur locality a waste dump," Pakiza Colony of Kasur city depicts the look of a waste dump due to heaps of garbage and accumulated sewage on streets and roads./According to a survey report conducted by The Nation, the sanitary workers remain absent from duty and are rarely witnessed in the area. Talking to The Nation, a local, seeking anonymity, alleged that the sanitary workers 'pay monthly' to the area supervisors and do not perform duty. 'Instead of removing garbage, the sanitary workers set it ablaze which caused air pollution in the area,' he said. He added that the locals, time and again, argued with the sanitary workers over burning of the garbage in the area. 'Locals urge the sanitary staff not to set the garbage on fire as the emitting smoke causes respiratory diseases among residents but in vain,' he regretted. The correspondent also approached notables of the area who said that sewage system of the area has also destroyed due to indifference of the authorities concerned. They said that it has resulted in sewage blockage which has turned streets of the locality into ponds of dirty water. 'Residents of the locality have reportedly been fallen victims to diseases due to mosquitoes' bites, who are growing in the area due to sewage accumulation,' they expressed their concerns./They demanded Deputy Commissioner Ammara Khan and TMC Chairman Haji Ayaz Ahmed Khan to look into the grave situation and order the officials concerned for cleanliness in the area."
Villager martyred in Indian shelling," A Pakistani citizen was martyred by unprovoked mortar shelling by Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) on Sialkot border villages in Phookaliyaan and Bajwat Sectors of Working the Boundary here on wednesday./According to the local people, the people were busy in their routine life when the Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) resorted to shelling in Sialkot border villages, targeting the civilian population./A mortar shell, fired by Indian BSF, hit the house of Zahur Elahi (45) in village Diyaarwali-Kaliyaal, in Phookaliyaan-Bajwat Sector of Sialkot Working Boundary, killing him on the spot, the local officials confirmed. Two cattle were also killed and several others injured by the Indian shelling in Sialkot border villages. Several houses were also damaged by Indian shelling there, said the local people./Indian BSF continued the unprovoked firing on Sialkot border villages for an hour intermittently. The Punjab Rangers responded instantly and gave answer to the enemy in befitting manners making the Indian guns silent, said the local officials./Trash burning draws residents' ire/SADIQABAD-People living around Sadiqabad Railway Station are faced with a great misery due to burning of garbage near the railway crossing by the local bodies' workers./Talking to The Nation, residents of the locality said that the LB workers collect garbage from across the city and dump into the ground near railway station. Later on, the garbage is set ablaze which emits toxic smoke and causes air pollution in the area. They said that people have reportedly been falling victim to the respiratory and skin diseases due to trash burning. They complained that burning of garbage has become a daily routine and adding that the Municipal Committee high-ups were informed time and again about the practice but in vain. They flayed negligence of the MC authorities and demanded immediate steps for solution to their problems."
Pollution," While other countries of the world have advanced in many fields and maintained their development, but Pakistan continues to suffer and its people continue to lift the burden of its shortcomings./It's very common if we suffer from diseases which we don't know about and only find out when it brings us to terminal stages./It is because of the pollution in the air which has disturbed man on a large scale./There are various kinds of pollution, not just one./Hazards such as air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution are dangerously affecting the health of people./The most disturbing and devastating of all is air pollution./When we move on the roads, we see that the atmosphere is full of smoke and dust that not only causes allergy to the people but also destroys the natural beauty and people suffer from bad diseases./On the other hand, water pollution is all the same where people are dying from drinking poisonous water./Water is a basic necessity, it's common sense it should be pure and easily accessible, yet the case is completely the opposite for Pakistan./It is about time the government starts taking an interest in saving the lives of people by making efforts to minimise dangers such as these."
(In)visible steps taken," Punjab Environment Minister Zakia Shahnawaz has said that instructions have been issued to all field formations of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and relevant departments for adopting measures to control air pollution and smog as per their role specified in the Smog Policy./Addressing a press conference at Directorate General Public Relations Friday, she said that 197 FIRs have been registered for stubble and solid waste burning. Environment Secretary Saif Anjum, Special Secretary Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department Faisal Zahoor, Additional Secretary Environment Muhammad Zaman Watto, Additional Secretary Technical Dr Salman Shahid, Director EPA Naseem-ur-Rehan Shah and President All Pakistan Brick Kiln Owners Association Shoaib Khan Niazi were also present./The minister said that 175 polluting industrial units have been sealed. She said that 15718 smoke emitting vehicles have been challaned, imposing fine of Rs4.3 million. She urged all Chambers of Commerce  and  Industry to issue instructions to all industrialists to stop use of substandard fuel and install pollution abatement equipment./Saif Anjum briefed media about causes of smog and possible measures to overcome the crisis./'Smog is a type of air pollution, originally derived its name from the mixture of smoke and fog in the air. Photochemical smog is derived from coal, vehicular and industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions. Stubble burning in agricultural areas is another major cause of smog especially in Punjab. The ideal conditions for the formation of smog are calm winds and air pollutants. Depending upon the tranquility (calmness) of air, the Smog once formed can stay there for several days hence causing severe health problems and road accidents due to reduced visibility. Highly populated cities and agricultural areas of Punjab usually witness smog during winter season when air pollution from vehicular emission, solid waste burning and stubble burning reacts with calm air to form smog./He urged Home Department and Deputy Commissioners to implement ban on stubble burning. EPA officers have been directed to take action against industries and brick kilns using substandard fuel and running units without emission control devices like wet scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators and fly ash arrestors, he said, adding, EPD was working for introduction of environment friendly brick kiln technology with the collaboration of All Pakistan Brick Kiln Owners Association./Shoaib Khan Niazi said that the association was working with EPD to explore cost effective and environment friendly technology.

Exemplary punishment to an acid thrower," An anti-terrorism court (ATC) gave a historic verdict in an acid attack case last week. ATC Judge Sajjad Ahmad awarded 60-year imprisonment to a man after he was found guilty of throwing acid on a 21-year old girl who had turned down his marriage proposal. Nobody linked to an acid attack case was given such a punishment in the past. The court also imposed a fine of Rs3.9 million on Asmatullah, the convict. The court handed him down 25-year imprisonment twice under Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and Sections 324 and 336/B of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. Beenish Sharif, the victim, lost her eyes and face after the convict threw acid on her body when she was going to her home along with her father Muhammad Sharif in Defence A police precincts. The convict was at large and was hiding somewhere in Bhakkar from where police arrested him./Advocate Gull Hassan Abbas, the lawyer who represented the victim girl, told The Nation that Asmatullah and Beenish had been engaged for a couple of years. However, the girl's family came to know that Asmat was not a man of good character and announced that they did not want to marry their daughter to him. Abbas said Asmat, who belonged to Bhakkar, had been working with a local store in Defence for quite some time and did not have his own house in Lahore. The girl's family asked him to buy a home first, but he said he had no money and borrowed Rs500,000 from the family to buy a home. The lawyer said the convict did not buy a home and rather deceived the family that he had paid Rs500,000 in cash and taken a house on mortgage. On this, he said, the girl's family broke the engagement and this angered the convict. He then planned to carry out an acid attack on the girl, the lawyer said./Interestingly, the court decided the case with no delay; the incident took place in September and the decision came in November./Another important case, which overshadowed all cases last week, was the case of smog and environmental pollution. Usually, courts work until 4pm, but Lahore High Court Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah held his court in the evening and summoned officials of health and environment protection departments./The chief justice heard the case of smog two times; first time in the early hours of the day and second time in the evening./Announcing the judgement in the case, the chief justice held the Punjab Environment, Health and School Education departments responsible for a lack of coordination on formation of public health emergency policy to deal with the smog problem./Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah gave three months to the Punjab government and held that the 'new revised policy will assign a role to the Health Department as well as School Education Department to tackle the smog issue and pollution'./The judgement says, 'Smog touched the highest levels..., but no tangible steps were taken by the Environment Protection, Health and School Education departments for protection of health or safety of residents of Lahore, including children, pregnant women and people of old age.' The chief justice observed, 'This is most disconcerting and disappointing.'/Walid Iqbal, grandson of national poet Dr Allama Muhammad Iqbal, had moved the petition through Advocate Sheraz Zaka against failure of the Environment Protection Department to control smog and environmental pollution./The judgement says, 'As per the Smog Policy, when PM 2.5 concentration rises above 300 it is considered a severe health situation, which may have an impact on respiratory health of people and serious impact on health of people with lung/heart diseases. This impact can be experienced during light physical activity.'/The officials of the Punjab Environment Department told the court that they had been analysing and tabulating the data in order to formulate an action plan. EPD officials said they did not have written correspondence among the departments, including health and school education./The health secretary told the court that they had been holding meetings on a daily basis for two weeks. However, readings of air monitoring machines were not discussed with his department, he said. The Health Department submitted the steps it had taken to educate people about the challenge of smog and environmental pollution. The health secretary said his department ran awareness programmes through newspapers and in the streets./Barrister Sarah Belal and Fahad Malik, amici curiae, submitted that if the level of PM 2.5 crosses 300 ug/m3 it calls for declaration of health emergency and in support of this contention refers to the Public Health Emergency provisions) Ordinance, 1944. Ahmad Rafay, another amicus curiae, had brought a portable air monitoring indicator in the court and submitted that the level of PM 2.5 in the court was 494 ug/mg and outside the court it was slightly over 500 ug/m3./After hearing officials and lawyers, the chief justice directed the secretaries of the aforementioned departments to sit together to formulate an emergency action plan to challenge smog and environment pollution. The chief justice sought progress report on 'revised policy', including the role of Environment, Health and School Education departments. The court adjourned the hearing until Dec 18./Cases relating to Model Town inquiry report, detention of Hafiz Saeed and torture on hearing and speech impaired children remained prominent last week. In the Model Town inquiry report case, the Punjab government presented the inquiry report on the incident along with two other counter reports to a full bench of the Lahore High Court for in-camera perusal./The bench headed by Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh and consisting of Justice Shehbaz Ali Rizvi and Justice Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmad took up the appeal moved by the Punjab government, challenging release of Model Town inquiry report./Victims' lawyers will argue at the next date of hearing, which is Nov 21. The Hafiz Saeed case was adjourned when a law officer had said that a provincial review board consisting of judges of the high court was scheduled to take up the detention matter of Saeed on Nov 21. He said the court should adjourn hearing of the petition till decision of the review board. The judge accepted the request and deferred the hearing until Nov 22./However, in case of torture on hearing and speech impaired children, the chief justice ordered the Punjab Police inspector general to appoint two unarmed guards at every bus of Special Education Department carrying special children./Moreover, the Supreme Court was requested to announce without further delay a verdict reserved seven months ago on a case about the multi-billion project of Orange Line Metro Train in Lahore. Barrister Zafarullah Khan of Watan Party made this request by filing a civil miscellaneous application at Lahore Registry of the Supreme Court, pleading that people of the city had been facing severe difficulties due to inordinate delay in completion of the metro train project. He claimed that over 100,000 cars, buses, auto rickshaws and bikes could have been out of roads reducing air pollution in the city if the project was completed in time. He submitted that a great loss to national exchequer had been caused by delay in the decision as construction work on the project stands suspended for almost a year./He asked the court to announce the reserved judgement within the shortest possible time keeping in view difficulties of the citizens and public interest. He requested the court to allow him to become a party to the Orange Line Metro Train case./A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan had on April 18 reserved the judgement in the case."
KMC parks to be opened for public soon: Waseem," Karachi Mayor Waseem Akhtar said on Monday that renovation and restoration of parks managed by Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) had started and these historical parks would soon be opened for public after completion of these works./He said KMC was using its own resources, including engineers and labour for their renovation and restoration in order to preserve them./He was talking to the media during his visit to ST-5 Clifton, which is now being converted into Pakistan's first road safety park./He was accompanied by the parliamentary leader in city council Aslam Afridi, parks committee chairman Khurram Farhan, land committee chairman Arshad Hassan, director design SM Taha, director municipal Services Nauman Arshad, director technical SM Shakaib, SSP Traffic South Aijaz Shaikh, SSP Traffic Korangi Aijaz Hashmi, DSP Traffic Clifton Mohammad Tahir and other officers on this occasion./The mayor further said it was essential to increase the number of trees and plants in the city to deal with the air pollution and save the citizens from various diseases./He said KMC had already started a tree plantation campaign in the city and so far thousands of plants had been planted in different parks , including Amir Khusro Park, Bagh Ibne Qasim, KPT Flyover and alongside Sharae Faisal, Korangi Main Road and in other areas of Karachi./He said the traffic police was fully cooperating with the KMC and awareness in public about road safety rules and other such rules would be provided in this park./He said the elected local government leadership was fulfilling the people's expectations./He also directed the parks committee to survey all the parks and submit the report on their rehabilitation and renovation."
Due to MC negligence Kasur gives look of waste dump," Heaps of garbage and the crippled sewer system of Kasur city speak volumes about negligence of the Municipal Committee./The report of a survey conducted by The Nation reveals that Kasur city depicts the look of a landfill due to piles of rubbish and accumulated sewage. It had been learnt during the survey that sanitary workers remain absent from duty and are rarely witnessed in the area. Residents of different localities told The Nation that the sanitary staff does not bother to dump the trash properly rather it collects garbage at an open place i.e. playground and set it on fire. It pollutes the atmosphere and causes air pollution, they complained. 'We, time and again, complained and even argued with the sanitary workers for preventing them from setting the trash on fire but they always lent a deaf ear to our complaints,' they regretted./Sewerage system of the city has also destroyed due to indifference of the authorities concerned, they said. The crippled sewer system has resulted in sewage blockage which has turned various localities of the city into ponds of dirty water. 'People have reportedly been falling a victim to diseases due to mosquitoes' bites that are growing due to sewage accumulation,' they expressed their concerns./They demanded Deputy Commissioner Saira Umar and Municipal Committee Chairman Haji Ayaz Ahmed Khan look into the grave situation and order the officials concerned for cleanliness in the area."
Deforestation," I want to draw the attention of Government towards the dire issue 'Deforestation' in Pakistan. According to census, Pakistan's population has increased two to three crores and because of the shortage of land to live trees are cut or burn. Further, trees which release fresh oxygen for us and making us healthy are being cut. Cutting down the trees lead to ever greater quantities of carbon mono oxide which is a dangerous gas and because of it countless peoples are being victim of diseases. It is a source of increasing air pollution too. Lastly, I just want to request the government that serious actions should be taken towards this issue."
Environmental pollution and healthy Pakistan," The phenomena of smoke and smog is created when tiny particles become concentrated in the air. These particles are commonly referred to as PM10. PM10 refers to the size of these particles, i.e.; the particles are less than 10 microns in diameter - that is less than a fifth of the width of a human hair. These particles are commonly produced as by-products of combustion and can come from vehicle exhausts, industry, outdoor burning and domestic fires (coal and wood). There are also 'natural' sources of PM10, which include sea spray and dust particles. PM10 is a problem in winter because domestic heating in the form of wood and coal fires increases. /Wood is a valuable fuel source for Marlborough and its urban centers, but in order to ensure clean air and warm homes more efficient, cleaner methods of burning wood are required. Winter is also when Marlborough experiences inversion events. Inversion events are characterized by cold, still, frosty nights. An inversion layer acts to trap air pollutants, in this case PM10, and thereby increases its concentration. Normally, hot air rises and disperses pollutants upwards but during a temperature inversion event a layer of warm air traps the movement of pollutants, effectively creating a ceiling and concentrating the pollutants close to ground level. The height of the inversion layer is not fixed and can vary. Often an inversion layer can be visible when a plume of smoke is seen to rise and then stops and moves sideways as though it has just hit an invisible ceiling./Smog is composed of a mixture of air pollutants which can endanger human health. Various human health problems such as emphysema, asthma, chronic bronchitis, lung infections, and cancers are caused or exacerbated by the effects of smog. The effects include: Coughing and irritation of the eyes, chest, nose and throat: High ozone levels can irritate the respiratory system leading to coughing and wheezing./These effects generally last for only a few days after exposure, but the particles in the smog can continue to damage the lungs even after the irritations disappear. Aggravation of asthma: Asthma conditions are severely worsened by smog and can trigger asthma attacks. Breathing difficulties and lung damage: Bronchitis, pneumonia and emphysema are some of the lung conditions linked to the effects of smog as it damages the lining of the lungs. Smog also makes it difficult for people to breathe properly. Premature deaths because of respiratory and cancer diseases: A 2013 WHO report indicated that cumulative exposure to smog heightens the chances of premature death from cancers and respiratory diseases. Thousands of premature deaths in the United States, Europe, and Asian countries are linked to inhalation of smog particles. Such chemical particles include benzene, formaldehyde, and butadiene which are all comprised of cancer-causing carcinogens. Smog inhibits the growth of plants and can lead to extensive damage to crops, trees, and vegetation. When crops and vegetables such as wheat, soybeans, tomatoes, peanuts, cotton and kales are exposed to smog, it interferes with their ability to fight infections thus increasing susceptibility to diseases./As originally coined in 1905 by Des Voeux, a natural fog contaminated by industrial pollutants, a mixture of smoke and fog. Today, it is the common term applied to problematical, largely urban, air pollution with or without the 'natural fog', however, some visible manifestation is almost always implied. The word 'smog', described stagnant, pollution-laden air masses. Smog is produced as automobile exhausts build up when weather conditions produce stagnant air masses that do not allow exhausts to disburse. Hence cars are the basic cause of smog. Nitrous oxides and hydrocarbons are given off by the combustion of petroleum. Harmless at first, exposure to sunlight for an hour or so creates an interaction between the two that produces the photochemical oxides popularly referred to as smog. In simple words smog is a form of air pollution , resulting from chemical toxins dispersed into the atmosphere./By purchasing renewable energy, it helps in the reduction of emissions from power generating plants that heavily depend on fossil fuel. In other words, the use of renewable energy not only reduces environmental impacts but also trims down the presence of smog causing pollutants in the air./As much as smog is easily visible when it's present in the atmosphere, the use of appropriate smog detectors and monitoring systems can act as early warning systems. Respective metrological departments can help with this by installing monitoring equipment that consistently records the amount of emission and particulate matter in the air./Among the socio-economic impacts of smog on human health that can be quantified are medical treatment costs and lost worker productivity associated with hospital admissions and emergency department visits due to respiratory and cardiac illnesses. Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif has reached out to his Indian counterpart and invited him to enter a regional cooperation agreement to tackle the issue of smog and environmental pollution . In a healthy vision towards healthy nation and universe on November 19, Shahbaz Sharif addressed that the people of Pakistani and Indian Punjab have been facing the problem of smog during the months of October and November and getting fully illness by influenza, chest  and  eyes infection  and  people are not recovering good health with the ordinary medicine due to smog and they have to spend a huge money to maintain the health of himself and their full family because poor people are unable to have all the vitamins for the healthy life./In this Regard the labor power cannot make a good survival for giving good technical working gesture towards industry and industrialization, consequently the worth of national capital in the shape of spending energies like electricity and gas that get turned into molesting shape and unable to draw the productive result with their setup of industry and gradually 48 gusted holidays and economic instability reference political dharnas (Strikes) the Pakistan cannot make the successful survival even FBR cannot recover the tax from the country although they focus tax collection by their electricity bills but unfortunately the corrupt LESCO revenue officers do not maintain their billing accordingly and over billing causes tax collecting department as a burden of those people which really suffered by their meter reading and revenue department as well as this problem is same in our neighbor countries so in subcontinent the dialogues of South Asian regional cooperation need to get mature for the common interest of an ordinary man to make the better survival of their countries resources or environmental resources strictly play their vital role to get rid of this type of situational moments which can harmful for the growth of a country and the health of a common man."
UPLIFT WORKS BECOME NUISANCE," The ongoing development works in Gujranwala city, particularly at Ladhewala Warraich have become a nuisance for public. Streets are dug for the laying of water or gas pipelines but are left unplugged. Contractors also disappear, leaving the work incomplete./It causes dust and air pollution in the environment. People are reportedly becoming patients of respiratory diseases due to dusty atmosphere. The uplift works left incomplete also cause water accumulation in streets which cause difficulty in commutation. People demanded solution to the problems they are facing due to negligence of the officials concerned."
Dry spell reduces underground water level in Buner," Owing to prolonged dry spell in parts of the country especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the water level has reduced significantly causing a wave of fear of water scarcity among the dwellers and forced the people in mountainous areas of Buner to migrate to other parts of the district./Even deep water bores i.e. 150-feet, which were constructed by the people on their own expenses, have been dried and clogged to provide more water to the residents while water lakes and springs were already dry to supply clean drinking water to the people./'The water level disappeared from our own tube-well after the recent earthquake of 6.1 magnitudes and we hardly manage water for ourselves and for our cattle to bring it from far-off areas. This dry spell in the winter season is a horrific one and it might be the result of our wrong deeds and injustices of the rulers committed in various parts of the country,' Bakhtiar Khan, a local Zamindar, and resident of the area told The Nation./'The wheat crops which were in the brittle state has not received a single rain in two months in every part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, however, no decision has been taken under government patronage to hold Namaz-e-Istesqa(special prayer for rain), a common religious practice ,' said Habibullah, another persons of the area./Zahor Ahmad, Assistant Metrological Officer in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Metrological Department told the Nation that it never happened in the past that there was no rain in the winter season and this persistent dry spell caused a severe water shortage./However, he predicted that rain is expected in next two days and hoped that this dry spell will break with light rain shower in various part of the country./A week earlier, the met office had also predicted rain in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but that time only Swat received light rain which was insufficient to increase water level of the long dry spell ./The constant spurt of dust and pollutants in the air also causing different diseases due to prolonged dry spell and that was the reason that patients influx has increased in the hospitals with each passing day. A medical specialist Dr Naeem while commenting on the impact of long dry spell on human health told that shortage of rains has considerably amplified the disease ratio like throat and chest infection./He said that there is some direct and indirect impact of dust on the human body, as the direct inhalation of dust causing throat infection and skin allergies while the indirect connection in the form of contaminated food having dust particle also causing many diseases./He said that the public needs to be sensitised to cover their mouth, hairs and other parts of the body to protect it from the poisonous impact of the air pollution. He said that one could minimize these impacts if they stop exposing themselves in bazaars and other polluted zones./He said that daily bath is extremely important in this situation, as in most cases skin is affected due to pollutant air. He said that there is no humidity in the air at daytime and even lighting electric heater in houses open water are needed near the heater and stove to be evaporated for keeping a constant level of humidity in the room./It is pertinent to mention that ratio of rainfall has been significantly decreased and the last rain recorded in northern areas of the country was December 11, 2017, however, the met office now predicted rains in some parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which could contribute to improving underground water level if it showered for a long duration."
"Industrial Zone, Mandi Morr found worst polluted areas"," The Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency has found the Industrial Zone in sector I-9, parts of sector I-10 and Mandi Morr as the worst pollution-hit areas of the federal capital, it has been learnt./The levels of some poisonous gases and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the air were found to be exceeding the acceptable standards in these areas of the city, according to the recent study by the EPA. EPA is a department of the ministry of climate change responsible for the protection, conservation, rehabilitation and improvement of environment, for the prevention and control of pollution, and promotion of sustainable development. The study pertaining to the air quality revealed disturbing facts./According to the sample taken from sector I-9/3 (Location-15) during February 1 to March 3, the presence of Suspended Particulate Matter in the ambient air was recorded at 114 µg/m3 against the standard 35 µg/m3. Presence of Nitric Oxide (NO) was recorded at 76 µg/m3 against the standard 40 µg/m3 while Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) was recorded at 112 µg/m3 against the standard 80 µg/m3./Similarly, the sample collected from Mandi Morr (Location-5) revealed that SPM was recorded at 267 µg/m3 against the standard 35 µg/m3, Nitric Oxide (NO) at 216 µg/m3 against the standard 40 µg/m3 and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) at 282 µg/m3 against the standard 80 µg/m3./Data of Location-16, sector I-9 Markaz revealed that SPM stood at 130 µg/m3 against the standard 35 µg/m3, Nitric Oxide (NO) at 42 µg/m3 against the standard 40 µg/m3 and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) at 91 µg/m3 against the standard 80 µg/m3./This was the first study pertaining to the air quality after year 2011 due to the equipment getting dysfunctional years back. The present EPA management recently got the equipment functional so as to access the quality of air in the capital city. According to the EPA officials, the air at IJP road is also not fit for human health due to excessive SPM./According to the EPA officials, 30 locations were identified in three most vulnerable areas of the city including sector I-9, sector I-10 and Kahuta Triangle (Industrial Zone). Sector I-9 was monitored at 10 locations, sector I-10 at 13 locations while the Kahuta Triangle was monitored at 7 locations where newly-overhauled machinery kept functioning for almost 24 hours without any break so that accurate data could be collected. The federal capital, with its greenery and trees, might have been expected to have a relatively lower level of air pollution compared to other major cities but this is not the case./According to the medical specialists, the top illness 'Ischemic heart disease' is caused by air pollution. The gases, which are the most common air pollutants, can trigger asthma attacks. SPM are tiny particles found in smoke, air and dust which can easily make their way into the respiratory system. Heavy dust particles settle soon while the tiny dust particles takes longer time to disperse./Similarly, smoke is composed of gases and fine particles, which go deep into lungs when one breaths in it. The industrial units in sector I-9 are producing pollutants of dangerous proportion./These pollutants are produced by vehicles, industry, burning of solid waste, brick kilns and natural dust. According to the officials, there are 12 steel mills running their business in the I-9 Sector. Similarly, around 200 brick kilns operating in the vicinity of the twin cities burn thousands of tonnes of coal for brick production and the smog produced by these brick kilns results in health issues."
Katas Raj: Shiva's Tears dry up," Excessive groundwater extraction in Kahoon Valley has changed the scenario at Katas Raj and now water is pumped into the pond that was previously catering to needs of nearby localities and loquat orchards./The spring continued catering to water needs of nearby localities for centuries, but dried up in 2012, a few years after establishment of cement factories nearby despite hue and cry of people residing in lush green Kahoon Valley./As the issue gained attention due to significance of natural spring for Hindus, the government started pumping water in the dried pond and the situation was the same during visits of journalists from Lahore./Deputy Commissioner Chakwal Dr Omar Jahangir said that there was no water shortage as pond was filled through alternative source. He, however, said that long term solution was stopping cement plants from extracting groundwater./'They (cement plants) will have to look for alternative of getting water from Chenab riverbed or move businesses to somewhere else', he said./According to a Hindu legend, Shiva cried on the death of his wife Sati and his tear formed Katas Raj pond. Temples of Shiva, Ram and Hanuman were built around this pond. Situated in Kahoon Valley of Salt Range near Kallar Kahar, the Katas Raj Temple complex is considered the second-most sacred worship place for Hindus. The pond spread over 2.5 kanals, with at least eight feet depth./Temples built at least more than a century ago are connected to one another by walkways. The name of the temple complex is derived from the Sanskrit word 'kataksha' which means 'tearful eyes' and every spring and autumn, Hindu pilgrims from Pakistan and India visit the pond to bathe and 'wash off their sins'./Hindu community has divergent viewpoint on sanctity of water after filling the pond through alternative source. Some people say that it was not tears of Shiva while others believe that the place was sacred and hopefully the situation would improve after cement factories stop extraction and water table will rise when the valley receive good rains./'This is not tears of Shiva. The water is not coming from springs and the pond is being filled through alternative source, nearby coal mine. We want concrete measures for revival of the pond to its original shape', said Ravindar Kumar Chibbar, Member District Council who is a member of the only Hindu family living in Krriala, Chakwal./'Excessive water extraction by cement factories has depleted the pond. This water is not pavitar for us as it is not coming out of springs and is recharged artificially. Cement factories should make alternative water arrangements', he said./Nawand Kumar Sharma, performing duties at Katas Raj as Pandit, however, differed with the viewpoint of Mr Chibbar./'The entire place is sacred for us. We appreciate the government for filling the pond through alternative source. Cement factories should be stopped from extracting water from the valley. Hopefully, the pond will return to its original shape after good rains', he said./Locals have thanked Katas Raj for reviving the issue of considerable drop in aquifer level in the Kahoon Valley. People complained about the water bores going dry, rise in diseases due to excessive air pollution, losing grazing areas for cattle, contamination of ponds, developing cracks in roofs and walls of houses due to blasting for extraction of limestone and decrease in crop yield./'Bor Wali Bun, pond near a cement factory, is contaminated due to discharge of industrial waste. Animals used to drink water from this pond spreading over 64 kanals. But now the animals get sick and in certain conditions even die', said Muhammad Banaras, 48, a cattle breeder in nearby village Malkana./Saeed, a resident of Malkana, is finding it difficult to cultivate land as springs have dried due to excessive pumping of water by cement factories./Hammad Sher Afghan, Dalailpur, said that his four out of five children were suffering from Asthma and skin allergy due to excessive air pollution./'In a week at least 2-3 blasts are carried out by cement factories to extract limestone. This has made cracks in various homes', he said./Abdul Jalil, Badshahpur, said that water depth before setting up cement factories was 120 feet and now it was more than 400 feet./'Now 402 feet deep water bore has stopped working', he said./Nisar Ahmad, Badshahpur, complained about hazards of one cement factory using garbage as fuel./'The waste is coming from Lahore and other cities on 22 wheelers which block the traffic and also create breathing issues in the area', he said./Muhammad Yousaf, principle of a private school at Tatral, complained about drop in water level, fertile land going barren due to quarrying and ever increasing air and noise pollution;/'Poverty has increased as fertile land has turned barren due to quarrying. Now people have to buy wheat and milk', he said./Malik Ashraf, Tatral, said that pastures of locals were encroached for quarrying and building access roads. Khizer, a property dealer from Wahula, said that even drinking water was not available./'People are left with no option except to purchase 1000 gallons water tanker which cost Rs 1000 and only lasts for 2-3 days', he said./DC Chakwal Dr Omar Jahangir said that lack of rains and excessive extraction of water by cement factories and locals have caused drop in aquifer level. He acknowledged that the water consumption of factories was too high./'75 per cent of the groundwater is used by factories and remaining 25 per cent by local people. Choa Saidan Shah normally receives the highest amount of rainfall in the entire Potohar region. The average rainfall has decreased and last winter there was no rains at all that resulted in worsening the situation', he said, adding, the locals have the first right on groundwater./'The cement factories have to make alternative arrangements for water. Then can get water from Jehlum riverbed. They will not be allowed to get water anymore. The need to make alternative arrangements or shift businesses to somewhere else', he said./DC Chakwal agreed that springs of Kahoon Valley were drying due to cement plants./'There are engineering solutions to every problem which are expensive. Now an environmental crisis has developed and it has to be catered for', he said. When asked about one cement plant using garbage as fuel, he informed that the waste is taken from from Lahore (Mahmood Booti) and other cities. The waste is at first segregated (organic and inorganic separated). Using inorganic waste as fuel is economical and environment friendly, he said."
Another plea of Sharjeel dismissed," The Sindh High Court (SHC) Wednesday dismissed another appeal of Sharjeel Inam Memon for allowing him to shift to a private hospital. Sharjeel's lawyer moved another application for the modification in earlier court judgment regarding bail application./A two-judge bench headed by Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro heard the arguments. Sharjeel's lawyer in is arguments pleaded the court to modify the earlier order and allow his client to shift to private hospital. The counsel also argued that the apex court in its order did not restrict Sharjeel to move out for the medical treatment, as well as the trial had also allowed him to move outside the jail in this regard. Therefore, he should be allowed for the medical facility outside the prison./Sharjeel counsel also stated that NAB did not challenge the trail court's order and they had no any objection in this regard. Before the apex court order, Sharjeel was provided proper medical treatment but was shifted back to the prison./Earlier, a bail application of Sharjeel Inam Memon, former Sind information minister was dismissed by the same bench, in a reference pertaining to corruption of Rs5.77 billion in government advertisements. Sharjeel Memon had submitted the bail plea on medical ground by saying that he was suffering from severe backaches and a medical board had advised him to seek treatment abroad. He pleaded to grant him a bail on medical grounds. Memon, a former provincial information minister, was arrested in October last year by federal anti-graft watchdog officials from outside the SHC after his interim bail plea was revoked. The bureau had booked him and 11 othersincluding the former provincial information secretary, other officials of the information department and heads of different advertisement agencies for allegedly embezzling Rs5.77 billion./Final arguments sought in coal-handling terminal case/The Sindh High Court on Wednesday directed the parties to submit their final arguments by May 23 regarding a coal-handling terminal in Shireen Jinnah Colony, Clifton./Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi was hearing the case. The counsel of Karachi Port Trust (KPT) submitted a statement regarding storage capacity of coal at KPT yard and said: 'KPT has no objection if the coal lands at the yard or released by the court.'/The petitioner submitted that due to the coal terminal and its dumping, inhabitants of the area were facing serious environmental effects, which fuelled respiratory diseases in the locality. They said that tonnes of coal berthed every month and about 200,000 tonnes of the coal was handled at the terminal located at Shireen Jinnah Colony, Clifton. Earlier, a report was presented by Sepa that stated that the whole process from unloading of coal to its dumping and transportation to different industrial units involved serious environmental hazards./It said that during inspection, it was noted that the coal material found on the berth and jetty flowed into the port waters during washing or rain, adding to marine pollution./The report said that during the transportation of coal from the terminal to the coal yard, a distance of three to and four kilometres, the coal dust flew into the air from the open trucks, causing air pollution throughout the route. 'It is obvious that hundreds of people in this particular location could be affected from respiratory, eye and other diseases due to the air pollution containing coal dust particles,' it added. The report said that coal dust was found in the houses situated in the densely populated area of Keamari and areas in close proximity to the terminal./It further said that environmental issues relating to storage of coal were significantly adverse in nature as a huge quantity was being stored at the coal yard. The report further said that in view of the coal storage site and its handling in highly densely populated area in a highly crude manner, the entire area suffered an environmental disaster./The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency had also informed that the Karachi Port Trust was operating a coal handling terminal in Shireen Jinnah Colony without adhering to the environmental laws which not only constituted an environmental hazard but also posed a serious threat to the health of the workers and people living in the vicinity."
A Dying Peshawar," Tussle between the arch rivals Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) is adversely affecting life in the city of Peshawar. The area of Hayatabad which was known to accommodate green belts and provide fresh air to the residents is now home to giant structures mainly because of the construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). It is a huge loss for the city, already war torn, that the construction of this line which was supposed to ease the traffic gridlock is now a hassle for the commuters because the federal Pakistan Railways did not grant permission to the provincial government to use the most feasible route./This is a huge question mark on both the parties, which are so blinded by their agendas that the comfort of the citizens does not matter. If Pakistan Railways did not grant permission to go ahead with the plan, the party should have handed the project to someone competent enough to understand the planning required to make the project a success for years to come. The fact that the British were able to design cities accommodating life and green belts and this is a concept alien to the lawmakers in Pakistan is a huge shame. At this point, the air pollution is so much that is causing respiratory diseases. Land which was allotted for agriculture use is being granted for developmental projects without any regard for the environment. If the provincial government was on a time crunch, halting the project should have been considered. There is no accountability for the losses incurred by the business community and all demands fall on deaf ears./The ruling party is also to blame here. There is no denying that for the construction of the orange line in Lahore, the party disregarded several legal conjectures and demolished heritage sites in order to build a structure that was indeed needed by the city but could have been done in a manner which did not harm the heritage. The same negligence was also shown when deciding whether or not to grant the land to Peshawar authorities for the BRT. It is a shame that Pakistanis at the end of the day suffer because of these rivalries. PTI was able to effectively carry out the billion tree tsunami project but these hindrances have marred a project which would have actually improved the outlook of Peshawar."
Speakers emphasise on climate awareness among youth," Increase in temperature has changed the life style of the residents of Islamabad so climate awareness among the youth would help in sensitizing citizens on the issue, speakers said on Friday./Environmentalist Munir Ahmed in a seminar organised by the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) said that according to a study conducted by the Devcom-Pakistan recently 95.4 per cent residents of Islamabad have seen radical changes in the city over a period of three decades./The changes included the loss of vegetation and green belts, shortage of water, increase in traffic on the roads that has created a mess , little or no space in parking lots and increase in air pollution that has led to several diseases including breathing, inhaling and eye infections./Munir Ahmed said the increase in temperature has drastically changed the life style of the residents. The use of electric home appliances and room-cooling machines has immensely enhanced the emission of the greenhouse gases while on the other hand the loss of green cover has enhanced the impact of the increased local temperature./Referring to the study, he said the rise of various diseases in the city of Islamabad is also one of the effects of climate change. The shortage of public hospitals has multiplied the miseries of locals. The unavailability of clean drinking water has further deteriorated the health of the poor and marginalised living in the suburbs of the federal capital. According to residents the availability of clean drinking water has decreased up to three-time less than what they had been getting 10-20 years ago./About 44 per cent of the residents of Islamabad are well-aware of the impacts of climate change mostly through TV channels but they don't know what to do and what not to do. Only less than 40 per cent have heard about the Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) including the development experts and those who are working with the civil society organizations, said the environmentalist."

Managing Smog," The Punjab government is planning to combat the upcoming smog season after last year's spell. Air pollution has become one of the most imminent threats in the region due to the lack of awareness regarding the effects of climate change. The basic aim of the government has been to reduce crop burning, emissions from vehicles and the industry, along with garbage. If the new government is able to successfully implement the policies put forth by the last government, we might actually witness better circumstances in the winter this year./The government has ample amount of time to understand what causes the problem and the ways to combat it as well. The first step involves working on the part of the government, which needs to utilise its machinery to reduce the effects of climate change in the region. We have witnessed adverse circumstances due to the inaction of the government, which included thousands of lives lost due to smog in the provinces over the years. The numbers of respiratory diseases have increased in the region and this is primarily because of the lack of ecological concerns in the developmental policies of the authorities. If the pace of plantation is not matched with the pace of development, the result will always be smog./At the same time, there is a dire need to educate the masses regarding smog. The lack of information results in people walking about in smog without realising the consequences and mistaking it as fog. A lot can just be achieved if the masses are educated. Areas which can help them are learning to assess air quality via mobile phone applications, minimising their outdoor activities in cases of smog, and the use of smog masks can help in protection against respiratory diseases./The government must be commended for taking up the issue of environmental pollution seriously, however, the execution part will not only be tricky but also difficult to implement."

207 farmers booked for burning stubble," As part of its anti-smog steps the city administration fined Rs600,000 to an unspecified number of farmers and booked another 207 on the charges of stubble burning./Stubble is the remains of crop harvest which farmers burn to save their time and money. But this action adds to air pollution and causes smog during winter. Smog causes respiratory and eye-related problems and other environmental issues./The district government has imposed Section 144 banning stubble-burning. The government sprang into action a week ago when it fined a farmer in Minhalla village of Lahore for burning stubble./Lahore Commissioner Dr Mujtaba Piracha has said countering smog is his top priority and no violation would be tolerated. The administration has taken action in four districts of the provincial capital so far./Farmers alleged the government has failed to devise a proper policy to counter smog that was why they were being singled out. Environmentalists have stressed the need for taking indiscriminate action against all those contributing to environmental pollution. They urged action against the brick-kilns that are still operating on old method and continuously emitting dense smoke in the air./Ban on brick-kilns being extended/App reported a meeting at Environment Protection Department (EPD) Thursday decided to extend ban on brick-kilns for one more week to ward off the threat of smog during the first week of November./Smog Commission Chairman Dr Pervaiz Hassan chaired the meeting while (EPD) Secretary Zafar Nasarullah and Brick-Kiln Owners Association President Shoaib Khan Niazi were also present./The representatives of Local Government, Agriculture Department, Transport Department, Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and Meteorological department also attended the meeting./The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the steps taken to tackle the smog threat in Punjab as per the data provided by SUPARCO, EPD and MET departments./The SUPARCO representative briefed the participants on the current situation of smog, saying that weather conditions were favourable now. He said that due to wind direction, the pollutants emitted from stubble burning had concentrated mainly to the eastern border of India, which gave respite to Pakistani areas from smog-like conditions. Meteorological department also briefed the participants about weather conditions./Last year, the government woke up to devise a policy to fend off smog after the court reprimanded it. However, environmentalists rejected the policy, saying it lacked implementation mechanism. Lahore Bachao Tehreek (LBT) representative Imrana Tiwana told the media that air quality monitors installed by EPA were substandard. She said that these equipment were not calibrated to measure fine particulate matters (PM2.5), the most hazardous air pollutant. College of Earth and Environmental Sciences Principal Dr Sajid Rasheed complained about lack of interest on the part of authorities."

'Pneumonia kills 1m children globally'," Every year Pneumonia takes the lives of nearly one million children globally, which is more than the deaths caused by HIV/AIDS, malaria and measles combined, said health experts on Monday. Every year, November 12 is marked as the World Pneumonia Day and Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) held a seminar to create awareness on the disease./Dr Atiya Aabroo, Deputy Director Programs on behalf of Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination with reference to the event said that government is cognizant of the fact that investment in the health sector is of utmost importance. She said health is one of the foremost underlying factors that define the welfare of a country's population, and children, as the building blocks of society has equitable access to quality health service./The interventions for tackling pneumonia are integral to achieve overall child health, and are needed to reach Sustainable Development Goals. In its resolve to fight Pneumonia, Pakistan has made improvement in Child Health indicators as under five mortalities have decreased to 74/1000 live births from 89/1000 live births, as quoted in the latest Pakistan Demographics and Health Survey (PDHS) 2017-2018, she said./In Pakistan, 14 percent of children under five years of age suffer from Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), which can cause Pneumonia, if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Many deaths result from a failure to take the sick child to a health facility on time. Cris Munduate, Deputy Representative United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Pakistan, said that UNICEF under the Integrated Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) recommends protecting, preventing and treating infections through proven interventions for improving management of pneumonia, and increasing child survival./'UNICEF believes that every child, regardless of where they are born, deserves access to life saving vaccines and medicines,' she said. The Ministry of National Health Services Regulation and Coordination, and National and Provincial health authorities are working in collaboration with UNICEF and with the financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to prevent, protect and treat cases of Pneumonia among children under five. Through this initiative, essential commodities have been provided in all districts in Sindh and five districts of Punjab along with strengthening of services for better diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia./The project is contributing towards reduction of deaths in children aged under five in Pakistan. Preventive measures for pneumonia in children has also been included as an essential component of the National Routine Immunization Strategy and within its framework, the Pakistan Expanded Program on Immunization provides free of cost vaccines for prevention against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) diseases in all government health facilities. Speaking on the occasion, Dr Haider Shirazi, Associate Professor Neonatology Department, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Islamabad said 'Pneumonia is the number one killer disease in children. We, in Pakistan are losing around 250 children each day due to this deadly disease. We can protect our children by breast feeding and immunization. Deaths due to pneumonia can be controlled by early treatment and referral'./Meanwhile, a seminar was held at Paediatric Department of Benazir Bhutto Hospital in connection with World Pneumonia Day and was attended by Medical Superintendent (MS) BBH Dr Tariq Mehmood Khan Niazi, Head of Paediatric Department Prof Dr Rai Asghar, senior doctors including Dr Muhammad Hussain, Dr Khushdil, Dr Mudassir Sharif and members of PPA./The expert panel of PPA including Prof Samiyah Naheem Ullah, Prof Mehmood Jamal, Gen (R) Salman Ali, Prof Asifa Murtaza, Dr Ejaz Ahmed Khan, Prof Parveen Akhter Tariq, Brig (R) Shahid Aziz, Brig (R) Munir Akmal Lodhi, Prof Shahzad Munir, Prof Jai Krishon, Dr Mazhar Abbas Rizvi and Dr Ghazala Mumtaz delivered lectures for prevention of childhood pneumonia./Prof Rai Muhammad Asghar, while addressing the seminar, said pneumonia is the number one infectious killer of children under the age of five globally./He said pneumonia is still a single leading cause of child mortality, killing a child every 35 seconds. 'Pneumonia causes 16 percent of total deaths among children under five years of age, 5 percent of which are neonatal,' he said./He further said that Pakistan is even far behind some low profile countries in preventing deaths of children under five years of age by this decease. 'However, the prevention from pneumonia is possible,' he said adding that the effected children could be vaccinated with EPI injection course./He said initially children suffered with fever, flu and cough. 'Prevention is very easy and moreover very effective vaccine is available in the hospitals. One can protect our children from cold by wrapping them in warm clothes.' he said. He said it was very important to give awareness to community to protect their children from pneumonia./The other speakers of the seminar said that exposure to household air pollution almost doubled the risk for pneumonia and exclusive breast feeding for the first six months of life is an effective way to protect children from pneumonia, resulting in a 23 percent reduction in incidence./There is a 15.1 times greater risk of health from pneumonia if the child is not breast fed in the first 6 months. 'Good nutrition for older children, adequate Vitamin A supplements, hand washing, clean water and good sanitation can also help protect children from the lethal decease,' the panel experts said.

In Pakistan only more than 6.9 million people suffer from COPD. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death by 2020. Only last year, more than 3 million people died of COPD./Globally, the COPD burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the population./Dr Javaid said, 'Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation'./Whereas, 'COPD is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs,' he added./Identifying the causes, Dr Nadeem Ahmed Rizvi, Professor and Head of Pulmonology at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College said: 'There is a difference between causes of Asthma and COPD. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways. On the other hand, smoking is the biggest cause of COPD,' added Dr Nadeem./Allergens that trigger asthma include indoor allergens, house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander and outdoor allergens such as pollens and tobacco smoke, chemical irritants in the workplace, urbanisation and air pollution./He suggests that appropriate management can control the disease and enable people to enjoy good quality of life. They urged patients on compliance of controller medication and relievers for best outcomes./'Factors such as education and skills in order to effectively manage asthma and COPD, are crucial. It can be achieved through a partnership between the patient and their health care providers. Similarly, written action plans on how to recognise and respond to these diseases along with regular review by a healthcare professional is vital to fight them,' he concluded."
Experts for creating awareness about respiratory issues," 'Change in weather has aggravated suffering of asthma and COPD patients. Awareness about requirements of changing weather and excessive pollution, right management and long-term treatment are important. Patients must ensure compliance and adherence to prescribed medication,' said leading pulmonologists./They were speaking at a press briefing at a local hotel on Thursday. Pakistan Chest Society arranged the briefing in collaboration with GSK Pakistan to create awareness about respiratory diseases, precautions and benefits of early and proper treatment. President of Pakistan Chest Society Prof Khalid Waheed, Prof Saulat Ullah Khan, Prof Khalid Chaudhry, Prof Shamshad Rasool, Prof Ashraf Jamal and other pulmonologists and members of PCS spoke on the occasion./They said, 'Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are two of the most common respiratory diseases in Pakistan, posing a serious challenge.'/Highlighting disease burden, they said that according to WHO estimates, 235 million people suffer from asthma worldwide while COPD is affecting 210 million people worldwide. In Pakistan more than 6.9 million people suffer from COPD. COPD is currently the 4th leading cause of death in the world and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death by 2030. Only last year, more than 3 million people died of COPD./Globally, the COPD burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the population./Experts said, 'Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation.

A Smog Of Lies," Just as the toxic sludge that descends on northern Punjab each winter has become almost metronomic in its regularity, so has the government 'response' to the environmental hazard that is smog. Bold claims, self-congratulatory initiatives, blame games, followed by a meek surrender into the night; the pattern has become far too predictable. In the final months of this year, as Lahore once more ranks high among the most air polluted cities in the world, the government's commitment to fixing this problem is once more under the spotlight and it is severely found wanting./Many in government circles are flippant when it comes to this problem, often allocating only miniscule resources to hastily formed bodies to find a solution. Smog thought of as a mild inconvenience is easily relegated to the lower rungs of government priority. There cannot be a graver mistake. Pakistan loses an estimated 135,000 people every year to air pollution. Smog intensifies this pollution close to the surface, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases, stroke, and cardiovascular episodes. Our healthcare system already bursting at the seams: cannot handle the added pressure./Even more disappointing than the lax attitude is practice of simply lying to the public regarding what is to be done. Press conferences declaim 'task forces' and fancy 'air pollution monitors' to give and impression of proactivity alas it is all a sham. First comes the blame game; smog is caused by crop burning in Indian Punjab. That is partially true, but other pollution sources contribute too./Even if we believe that crop burning is the prime cause, what is being done to stop this practice in our Punjab? Take any road leaving the provincial capital, the M-2 to Islamabad, the GT Road to Gujrat, or the Multan Road to the south; you can spot the black smears of burned crops stretching across farmlands after farmlands./What was done to stop this? Why was nothing achieved? The government has to answer these questions as the province chokes in toxins."
Al Gore urges environmental action before it's too late," 'Future generations will ask us one of two questions: why didn't we act when we had the time or how did we find the moral courage to do the right thing?' said the climate activist and former vice-president of the US, Al Gore, to a packed hall at COP24 in Polish city of Katowice on Wednesday./His one hour long presentation highlighted the destructive impacts of rising temperatures across the globe, and it included many references to Pakistan which is suffering from heatwaves and floods as a consequence of climate change. He mentioned the town of Turbat in Balochistan which recently set an all time nationwide record of 54 degrees Celsius on May 28, 2017./In Pakistan 'they say summer is coming, let's start digging the graves before the heatwaves claim their victims' Al Gore said. Those who are the most vulnerable are the poor, the homeless, the elderly and infants/children. He also cited air pollution, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, as another major killer in this region./The former US president explained that climate change will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic diseases, disputes over refugees and resources and destruction by natural disasters in regions across the world. In fact, global warming in large parts of the Middle East and Africa could render some regions inhabitable which will surely contribute to the pressure to migrate. This year the World Economic Forum will designate the climate crisis as the number one risk to the global economy, he said./He concluded that solutions to the crisis are available in the widespread availability of increasing low cost wind and solar energy and the use of electric vehicles. 'We are in the early stages of a sustainable revolution but it is not happening fast enough,' he said./Under the Paris Agreement the world has to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century but right now these emissions are on the rise. According to the Germanwatch annual report launched at COP24 last week, Pakistan now ranks No 8 globally in terms of its vulnerability to climate change. The Long-Term Climate Risk Index: 10 countries most affected from 1998 to 2017 from climate related disasters listed Pakistan as number 7 last year so there has been a slight improvement in ranking./According to PM Imran Khan's Adviser on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam: 'Unfortunately this is not a list that we want to be on'. The report states that Pakistan has suffered 145 disasters with 512 deaths and total losses of $3,826 million over a 20 years period. 'We are one of the 'continuous affectees' of climate change as over the 20 year period, we are 4th in terms of the number of climate triggered events and 2nd in terms of the total climate losses,' said Aslam./At a recent side event on climate induced migrations at COP24, Abid Suleri from the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad spoke about how 74 percent of labour inputs in Pakistan's agriculture are contributed by women and with increasing migration of men to cities to find jobs this will place an even greater burden on them. Women will suffer the most from the out-migration of men from rural areas being hit hard by climate change./Unplanned migration also puts pressure on urban resources, urban poverty and the growth of slums, he said. Migration is always a multi-causal process but will be made worse by climate change. He added: 'the local administration capacity should be enhanced to manage population flows'./Migrant populations would need skills training and jobs. According to experts the world might see 1 billion climate migrants by the end of the century."
Clean Lahore," Natural environment means all living and non-living things that are naturally on Earth. In a narrow sense, it is an environment that is not influenced by people. The environment that is influenced by humans can be called 'the built environment' or cultural landscape'./Air and Climate: Both the natural ecosystem and human health can be adversely impacted by declining air quality and climatic change. Communities can preserve air quality by limiting or eliminating the discharge of harmful chemicals into the air and by minimizing the sources of air pollution. This section contains resources and approaches that address air quality and climate change./If we want to clean our natural environment than we have to clean ourselves first. We should clean our air by painting our houses with latex paints. We shouldn't burn our yard waste. It's also illegal in many areas. We should park the car. Walk, bike or use mass-transit whenever you can. Vehicle traffic is a major contributor to smoke. We should use less fertilizer on your lawn. When it rains, excess fertilizer runs off into storm sewers and pollutes streams. We should also recycle. If your community does not offer a recycling program, ask local officials to start one. We should also take a part in volunteer parties to clean our natural environment and we should cooperate with political agencies which are engage in to protect our environment like 'Clean Lahore' and 'Environment Protection Agency'."
The Fifth Season," Hailed as the fifth season in Lahore, smog returns every year ever so diligently and with more severity. In a bid to control the situation, the previous government came up with short-term solutions to the problem. This included the imposition of a ban on crop burning and the use of brick kilns. However, to avoid penalisation, farmers and workers now tend to indulge in these activities at night because of lack of supervision. No government till date has managed to understand the problem in its entirety and come up with policies which improve the situation in the long run. The development plan of Lahore has choked the air quality and the growing increase in private transport due to the lack of public one has added to the air pollution in the city. This year alone, Lahore ranked as the city with the worst air quality./Along with the current scenario, there is no solution provided or postulated for the crop burning that occurs across the border. With issues that affect nations equally, both countries need to join hands and be accountable for adding to the deteriorating health conditions. Last year alone, smog resulted in the death of 60,000 people in Lahore and its adjoining areas. The number of people suffering from respiratory diseases has increased and no awareness campaigns have been launched for people who neither worry about mobility in this smoke nor use any preventive methods to save themselves from the smoke that people smell and see. There are no messages from the government asking people to remain indoors due to the bad weather conditions and like the general population, the government itself is waiting for the rain to clear out the situation. The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) this year failed to update its air quality monitoring systems. At the same time, people also do not have a direction on how to assess air quality on their own./The solution requires the government on all levels to be vigilant. The committees formed previously for the task have failed to provide a comprehensive analysis. At this point, there is a need to control the increasing number of cars, and the increasing investment in real estate and infrastructure contracting without any regard for the environment. Urbanisation at the cost of the environment along with the health of the people should be discouraged at all times."
Hamstring smog: avoiding the haze of Lahore," Last year residents of Lahore have seen the thick swath of smog that deluged the entire city within its crippling venom. This extreme incident made us realise that when environmental issues are left unaddressed, nature's vengeance could be savage. Supposedly, the nature and intensity of that smog was completely different from other episodes because its impacts goes beyond to the health and everyday life disturbance with multiple deaths./Moreover, excess amount of particulate matter and toxic gases within the air made people suffocate with high horizons of respiratory and throat problems. According to the Environment Protection Department, last episode of smog made us economic loss of 25 billion rupees./Second largest city of Pakistan, Lahore is growing at a rate of 4% annually and is regarded as one of the most polluted city in Pakistan when it comes to its air quality. Due to the uncontrolled urban expansion and settlements, Lahore got plagued with smog every year. This city is facing uncontrolled increase in the vehicles, large scale losses of trees, unabated growth of industries and most importantly, vicious cycle of unending development converting the city into whole concrete./As we are living in the centre of the city, my whole family is facing exacerbation of asthma, allergies, eye infections, respiratory tract infections and cardiac pathologies. Due to the uncontrolled development and excessive emissions, we can actually see and smell the smoke, while actually touching the filth, say the residents of the Lahore./Level of dangerous particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream reached to the alarming level of 1,077 micrograms per cubic meter which is 30 times more than the safe limit. Although, air quality of Dehli hit the headlines worldwide in recent days, experts claim that air quality of Lahore is competing Indian capital. What is more alarming is that the problem is not only confined to the city but according to the figure from the World health Organisation, almost 60,000 Pakistani died due to the bad air quality and high level of fine particulate matter./Now let's dig into the managerial instruments at place to deal with the air pollution in Pakistan. Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency and other provincial EPAs are dealing with the air pollution monitoring and management. In 2010, formulation of the National Air Quality Standard was a real breakthrough, however, it didn't made any difference since we are facing deadly episodes of smog even when the proposed mean level of PM 2.5 and PM 10 were higher from the prescribed figures of the World Health Organisation guidelines. Recent study which was conducted in Lahore over the period of five year showed annual average rate of PM 2.5 was between 136.5 ± 34.1 µg/m3 which is almost 14 times higher than that which is prescribed by the WHO guidelines and was comparable to the world polluted megacities./At the same time, when emergency measures were needed, government showed its most vigilant performance by buying six air quality monitors but didn't install them since long and was closely monitoring the air quality situation at the same time. Furthermore, the fact that only around 1% of the country's industrial establishments report their emissions shows serious lack of implementation of environmental laws and regulations./In January 2017, Pakistani Brick Kiln Owners came to know about the Zig-Zag kilns through International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Pakistan when representative from the National Energy Efficiency  and  Conservation Authority gathered all stakeholders for an awareness session in synergy with Ministry of Climate Change  and  EPA in Islamabad. The concept which captured attention of brick kiln owners was the fuel savings and resulting profit increase also including the profit from more quantity of A-Grade quality brick with ZZK technique-technology-adaptation. In synergy with NEECA representative role of President Brick Kiln Owners Association in supporting this transition is commendable along with ICIMOD, EPD Punjab and representatives from the MoCC./The partially sponsored Pakistani kiln-owners visit to Nepal was arranged and onsite briefings were given to Pakistani Brick kiln owners by ICIMOD. Knowledge gained through visit and training enabled owners of brick kiln in construction of first Zig-Zag kiln in Raiwind Lahore. It is pertinent to mentioned that the operation of that kiln was made successful with team work of brick kiln association, ICIMOD Expert and NEECA. Now there stand more than 40 ZZKs under construction and about 10 Zig-Zag kilns are already constructed. NEECA in collaboration with MoCC through ICIMOD  and  UNEP is trying to mobilize resources for bring quick transition and facilitate brick kiln owner. One HEC proposal on R and D on ZZK also stands approved which NUST developed NEECA./Likewise, afforestation projects such as commercial afforestation initiatives are another way which can bring us out of the bleak environmental landscape. Keeping the above mentioned statistics, government should promote such pioneer projects instead of destabilising them due to some filthy political moves and status quo. For instance, South Punjab Forest Company which is facing survival battle is indented to utilise the abandoned government land for forestation by involving private investors. This initiative will bring socioeconomic benefit with persistent GDP growth, environmental sustainability and increased forest cover. India and China have already increased their forest cover by 35% and 45 % respectively. Why should Pakistan, which is already facing scarcity of resources and climate change issues, not follow suit? The tree plantation campaigns in Punjab are facing serious disruption mainly due to the flawed political approach of the ruling PTI. And this is happening despite the demonstrated conviction of PTI Government for Green Pakistan programme launched on its successes in KPK during the last four years. This is so ironic that government is shutting down an initiative which is already working on the same lines of Green Pakistan Programme- its budget has been increased from 1 billion to the 32 billion while not considering the annihilation of millions of dollars already invested./In order to address the smog issue and to show that EPD Punjab has taken some initiatives, they were quick to start promotion of Zig-Zag Kiln and developed the policy to stop the operation of conventional kiln in the smog season keeping in view the directions of the Supreme Court Smog Commission. However the Brick Association voluntarily agreed to stop operations during smog period but they kept asking about the days for which closure was required in different districts of Punjab specifically on scientific basis. However no other Province developed such policy which could have at least moved the brick kiln owner towards the ZZKs. However the brick association did invite brick kiln owners from different provinces for trainings arranged by NEECA/ICIMOD primarily. For the brick sector in Pakistan, there is still a long way to go and lot of support and enabling environment is required. The sector roughly consumes 20-25 million tons of coal and has a lot of mitigation potential. It is the need of the hour that government should highlight such project like other green projects recently launched by the new government./The sense of urgency has to be sustained as besides sensitivity of the topic, there is lot of media interests and public resentment in the current smog story. In this scenario many emergency measures are being taken but long term solution doesn't seems to be the priority. By keeping the damage any further smog episodes can bring, it is imperative to involve environment regulatory authorities at the front foot with specialised equipment's, standard protocols, trained personnel. Real solution would requires much more serious and long term measures like nationwide switch towards renewable energy sources, large commercial afforestation projects, phasing out fuel gulping cars, improved and planned infrastructure development."
Air pollution becomes world's biggest environmental health risk," The air pollution impacts on mortality and health are a significant public health issue worldwide. The population-based studies have documented health risks resulting from short term exposure to air pollutants./The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that air pollution has become the world's single biggest environmental health risk, linked to around seven million humans, nearly one in eight deaths in 2012./Around 80 percent of the 3.7 million deaths from outdoor air pollution came due to stroke and heart disease, 11 percent from lung diseases, six percent from cancers. The Southeast Asia is now the most polluted region globally, with 2.6 million deaths related to the outdoor air pollution . These new estimates are based not on a significant increase in pollution, but on improved knowledge of the links between air pollutants and cardiopulmonary diseases./These views were expressed by Dr Haider A Khwaja from Wadsworth Centre, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University at Albany, NY, USA while delivering one of the plenary lectures at fifth international conference on environmental horizon jointly organised by the Department of Chemistry and Office of Research Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC), University of Karachi and International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), KU, on Sunday./The three-day long event was scheduled at Professor Dr Salimuzzaman Siddiqui Auditorium, ICCBS, KU, from Friday till Sunday. The Professor Emeritus and former federal minister for science and technology, Atta-ur-Rahman, shared with audience that knowledge is not the single most important factor for socio-economic development and science and technology are great equalisers. Countries that have realised this and invested heavily in developing their human resources to the highest possible levels have leaped forward, leaving others far behind./Meanwhile, the Director ICCBS, KU, Professor Dr M Iqbal Choudhary, mentioned that biodiversity is an outward manifestation of chemical diversity and plants contain a fascinating array of highly evolved, specific and effective gene products. Their diverse structural and stereo-chemical characteristics make them valuable templates for exploring novel molecular diversity./Another speaker, Parisa A Ariya of Department of Chemistry and Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, shared that the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and the WHO have identified airborne particles as a research priority of the utmost importance./She mentioned that the IPCC points to the importance of the aerosol-cloud processes due to their impacts on the absorption and scattering of irradiation, altering the earth's climate whereas the WHO predominantly considers aerosols as to be health hazards./Sheryl H Ehrman from Davidson College of Engineering, San Jose State University, USA, informed the audience that over the past two decades, anthropogenic pollutants have been successfully reduced in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, resulting in improved air quality./However, she said that parts of the mid-Atlantic still are considered non-attainment regions and ozone remains the main criteria pollutant of concern. The ozone is a secondary air pollutant, formed by reactions between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Ozone precursors are mainly emitted by power plants, motor vehicles, industrial operations and biogenic sources./'In the past several years, a new influx of emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing based production of natural gas in the Marcellus shale play may be counteracting the benefits that have been gained. On the flip-side, low cost natural gas could replace coal as fuel for power plants, potentially reducing emissions.'/The Director, Wisconsin State laboratory of Hygience, Peterson-Rader-Hawnn Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dr James J Schauer, mentioned that the association of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) with the adverse health effects has been well established and has led to the promulgation of PM standards and the implementation of control measures to reduce OM concentrations./He elaborated that given the complex nature of the source of PM, there are different strategies that can be used in air pollution control programs targeted at reducing the impact of PM. From a public health perspective, the sources of air pollution that have the biggest impact on the burden of disease should be targets for control but ability to link specific sources to health impacts is not well established./According to him, for this reason, there is a need to develop collaborative efforts between atmospheric science studies and epidemiological and toxicological studies to establish has human exposure to specific sources of air pollution impact then pathogenesis and burden of disease."
9.6m lives lost last year," World Cancer Day observed globally on February 4, every year. Ithighlights the need for urgent action to increase early stage cancer detection, screening and diagnosis to significantly improve cancer patients' chances of survival./This year's theme is 'I Am and I Will', to inspire action from individuals, the health community, and governments to improve public awareness and access to early detection, screening and diagnosis./According to Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), 2018 saw more than 18 million new cases of cancer worldwide of which nearly 5 million cases of breast, cervical, colorectal, and oral cancers could have been detected sooner and treated more effectively, improving patient survival rates and quality of life./The situation in Pakistan is very alarming as after cardiovascular diseases, cancer has the second highest reason of deaths./Approx., 150 thousand to 200 thousand new cancer cases are being registered every year in Pakistan, andin most of the cases, patients consult the doctor at a very advanced or late stage and the facilities available to treat such a high number of patients are much less./Under such a bleak scenario, SKMCH and RC is doing its best to treat cancer patients from not just all over Pakistan but Afghanistan also. Incidentally, cancer is one of the most expensive diseases to treat. Almost ten thousand new patients register very year with SKMCH and RC.It is providing financially supported cancer treatment to 75% of its patients since 1994, and more than Rs39 billion has been spent on free cancer treatment till date./As the treatment is very expensive therefore, medical technology at SKMCH and RC is regularly being updated. In 2018 alone, Rs. 80 million was spent on the purchase of four state-of-the-art machines including 3-Tesla MRI, Tomosynthesis digital mammography, Low-dose chest CT scan, Tesla MRI, 160 slice CT system./While Shaukat Khanum hospital is committed to provide best cancer care facilities to every citizen, irrespective of their ability to pay, it is also imperative to spread awareness about the disease./On marking of World Cancer Day, it is important to know about the signs like wheezing or shortness of breath, chronic cough or chest pain, frequent fevers or infections, difficulty swallowing, swollen lymph nodes or lumps on the neck, underarm, or groin, excessive bruising or bleeding that doesn't stop, weakness and fatigue, feeling full and unable to eat, rectal bleeding or blood in stool, unexplained weight loss, upset stomach or stomachache, a red, sore, or swollen breast, pain in the back or lower right side etc./Males or females, both should watch for any unusual changes in their body and energy levels in order to detect any early signs of cancer. The sooner one notices any problem, the sooner one can begin to take the steps necessary to promote healing within the body./Adopting an anti-cancer lifestyle can help the body to stay healthy and balanced and avoiding developing cancer in the first place. A healthy life style includes getting plenty of sunlight exposure to maintain vitamin D level. Reduce processed food and sugar intake. Research has found that a diet high in processed food (especially processed meats) can raise the risk of colorectal cancer./Doing regular exercise along with a healthy diet and avoiding toxins like cigarettes, 'Gutka', 'Chaaliya' etc., is one of the most effective ways of lowering cancer risk. Similarly a good night's sleep is also very important for the body and helps manage daily stress much more effectively, which helps lower the cancer risk. Reduceexposure to environmental toxins like pesticides, household chemical cleaner, synthetic air fresheners and air pollution. Avoid fried food items and instead boil, poach or steam it instead./On personal level, with little effort, these relatively simple risk reduction strategies can help one to virtually eliminate cancer risk, and radically improve chances of recovering from cancer if one has it./The writer is Consultant Medical Oncologist at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre."
Efficient public transport system need of hour," Air pollution in major cities of Pakistan has surpassed the safe limits set by Environmental Protection Agency in Pakistan (PK-EPA). The deteriorated air quality has dangerous health repercussions as it aggravates lung, heart and respiratory diseases./It disproportionately affects the health and productivity of the poor who live in urban areas. Low-quality air alone has caused thousands of hospital admissions per year. Moreover, it also has caused respiratory diseases in children. According to (State of Global Air, 2017), Pakistan has the 5th largest number of deaths because of PM 2.5 exposure and is ranked 6th in the world for the most number of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2015./The present trends in industrialization, urbanization and motorization suggest that air quality in Pakistan will be further worsened unless targeted measures are not taken./Transportation in big cities is considered one of the most important contributor of the air pollution. It is a major user of energy and burns most of world's petroleum. Road vehicles especially older vehicles emit different types of gases like Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Suspended Particulate Matter(SPM).Although environmental regulations in advanced countries have reduced emission from individual vehicles, however, this reduction is offset by the sheer increase in the number of vehicles. The Asian Development Bank report 'Reducing Carbon Emissions from Transport Projects, 2010' recommended a complete transition from air and road transport to rail and human-powered transport system. Pakistan also needs to transform its transport model urgently. Urbanization and motorization has generated sever environment problems and there is an urgent need to develop public transport systems to address these issues./In this backdrop, Orange Train Lahore and Peshawar Circular Railway are right steps in right directions. However, these projects are being criticised based on the wrong priority of the respective governments. Most of the criticism considers only direct cost and benefits of the project. It ignores the indirect benefits of these projects in terms of their impact on the air and noise pollution. There are two main reasons of this criticism./First, the governments did not convey to the public the complete cost and benefit analysis of these projects by highlighting the social cost and benefits of these projects. The projects not only provide simple transportation facility rather they also reduce number of vehicles on the roads which in turn reduce noise, air pollution and road congestion. They also save time by reducing number of hours that commuters spend on the road to reach their destinations. All these gains lead to reduced air pollution-related diseases, better health standards and increased productivity./Secondly, environmental issues are not given due attention especially in developing countries. People are more concerned with their income and employment opportunities at early stages of economic development. They are least concerned with the quality of the air they breathe in. Environment being a normal good is demanded more at higher income levels. As Pakistan is a low-income country, therefore environmental advantages of public transport systems do not appeal to the people. They are more worried about the other uses of these project's money in education, infrastructure and energy. There is a need to make people realize that quality of the air is as important for them as the quality of food they eat and the quality of the water they drink./Moreover, our cities have not been built in the way to be connected via train system. Our cities are spreading horizontally without any planning. There is need to develop new residential flat system that are energy efficient and can be integrated with shopping malls, offices and educational institutions via efficient transport system. In addition, schools, offices, shopping malls and residential areas must be integrated with the train system/There is also need to discourage the use of private transport by making it costly. There should be a policy to regulate the number of the vehicles on the road. Majority of the people commute via public transport, motorcycles and cycles therefore these commuters should have more space on the roads, but ironically cars occupy major space on the roads. Public policy should not be in favour of those who commute through cars rather, right to walk and right to cycle should be secured through an effective transport policy in major cities of Pakistan./In short, the evaluations of Orange Train Lahore and Peshawar Circular Railway should be made based on their impact on the environment. Moreover, these projects are not effective to curtail the transport and environment problems in major cities of the country unless they are accompanied by a comprehensive public policy to discourage the use of private vehicles."
70pc cancers caused by infections," With a three-year global theme 'I Am And I Will' announced by the Union of International Cancer Control, World Cancer Day is being celebrated across the globe today urging all communities and stakeholders to make personal commitment towards its prevention and bringing down the numbers./Health experts have identified oral cancer in men and breast cancer in women as commonest cancers in Pakistan. Oral cancer is caused mainly by pan, gutka, betal nuts and tobacco. Almost 30 to 50 percent of cancers can be cured if treated at very early stages for which timely diagnosis is crucial./Experts expressed these views at a world cancer day awareness seminar organised by Medionix with support of National Institute of Child Health, Child Aid Association (CAA), Mohammadi Blood Bank, Consumer Rights Protection Council of Pakistan (CRPC) and Brookes Pharmaceuticals at auditorium of NICH./Delivering his presentation, Prof Nizamul Hasan told that they have started cancer awareness program in schools and worried to see very kids using betal nuts and other addictive stuff. Around two percent of children are suffering from cancer in Pakistan, however it can be well managed and treated successfully. Majority of cancer related deaths occurred not because of cancer but infections. Smoke, air pollution and other diseases can also cause cancer, he underlined./Dr Mohammad Ali Memon informed that around 70 percent of cancers are caused by infections which again remind us importance of cleanliness which is also told by our religion. More than 60 percent cancer cases are caused by HIV and hepatitis. We have 13 million hepatitis patients in the country. Pan, betal nut and tobacco are major causes of cancer here in our country. More than 10 million people using tobacco die every year in the world and 1,00,000 people among them are in Pakistan./If you stop using such harmful products, we can save money to construct dams. We can prevent 30 to 50 percent of cases with help of modifiable risk factors including lifestyle, diet and physical activity. Preventable cancers include breast, liver, skin, cervical, lungs, colorectal and oral. For this, role of family physician is very important. They should timely suspect and diagnose cancer patients. Family physicians should advise public to avoid junk food and take healthy diet keeping their surroundings clean, he stressed./Quoting World Health Organization, Dr Mohammad Ali Memon told that 18 to 21 million new cases of cancers are reported worldwide every year while more than 9.5 million patients die of disease. Tobacco alone is responsible for 7 million deaths in the world and 1,60,000 in Pakistan, he told./Dr Qaiser Sajjad showed pictures of patients suffering from cancer and urged public to immediately stop use of tobacco in any form. Oral cancer is number one in men which is mainly caused by pan, betal nut and gutka. People are afraid to undergo biopsy although it can confirm diagnosis. Cancer is not spread by undergoing biopsy. People should get it if advised by qualified doctors, he added./It is very alarming that people don't consider it a bad habit to use tobacco and addictive stuff. Over 40 percent of men and 30 percent of women are using betal nuts in any form in Pakistan. Government should completely ban import of betal nut. Its sale should immediately be stopped within and outside schools. Media should also play its effective role for public awareness, he urged./Commissioner backs/midwifery dept/Metropolitan Commissioner Dr Syed Saifur Rehman said that time is required to make strong the base of midwifery department, adding that mostly people have not aware about the importance of midwifery department./He said that through legislation in law make a strong department to midwifery department to facilitate the affiliated people for promotion of human welfare. This he stated while addressing 11th Midwifery Conference 2019 as chief guest, organised by Sindh Institute of Reproductive Medicine (SIRM)./On the occasion, Metropolitan Commissioner said that people discussing progress but unfortunately no one show their interest to make strong the base of departments in the country, adding that the need of hour to joint work for prosperity of the country, he added./He said that awareness drive is also required among the people with establishing new departments to control the population. 'The rapid increase in population creating hurdles in development of the country', Metropolitan Commissioner added. Syed Saif ur Rehman said that he will play its role to promote midwifery department in KMC's hospital./On the occasion, organisers of the event present an appreciation award to Metropolitan Commissioner, later, Syed Saifur Rehman also present shields among the participants of the event on behalf of the event organizing committee. Dr Sher Shah, Dr Tipu Sultan, Dr Fariha, Professor Dr Rubina Sohail, Dr Shaheen Zafar, students of various midwifery institutions and others were also attended the event."
EPA takes action against 85 illegal plants," The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has initiated action against 85 stone-crushing plants and referred cases to the Environmental Protection Tribunal, Lahore for legal action under PEP Act-1997 (Amended-2012)./Talking to The Nation, EPA Inspector Muhammad Arshad said that all the 85 stone crushing plants situated at Sakhi Sarwar Town were violating PEP Act-1997 (Amended-2012) and were illegally established without getting NOC /licence from the Mining Department, Municipal committee, Labour Department, Industries Department and EPA DG Khan etc./These plants crush big stones into different grade small stones and grinding process is dry, therefore air pollution in the form of dust is produced from these plants during operation. No mitigation measures are adopted to control dust/air pollution i.e. neither wet scrubber, stack chimney or cover has not been installed, nor is any other engineering solution used. Health and safety precautionary measures like masks, boots, helmets, gloves and safety dress etc are not seen in the plants. Labour working at the plants, other people and environment around the plants are exposed to air/dust pollution threat that cause different diseases like silicosis, cough, respiratory tract diseases, irritation to nose, eyes, and skin to these people./Arshad shared that most of stone crushing plants were established on the disputed land of Auqaf Department and do not have ownership of land but Mepco staff have provided illegally electric supply connections to them./It is worth mentionable that The Nation pointed out all these irregularities on April 01, 2018 in the reference of an inquiry report conducted by Additional Deputy Commissioner Revenue (ADCR) Muhammad Iqbal Mazhar who has now promoted as deputy commissioner DG Khan./Iqbal Mazhar as inquiry officer had remarked that criminal negligence and corruption have been committed by the government departments in the establishment of 127 illegal stone-crusher plants in Sakhi Sarwar Town and 5 plants in Tauns Sharif. All the stone crushers were working without proper permission./He also remarked about EPA that the department remained slept till 2016. Even after 2016, there is no effective mechanism to monitor the establishment and functioning of crushing units by the department. Action against defaulting officers of EPA is recommended for their criminal negligence/misconduct./He pointed out that Mepco had provided electric supply connection to 127 crushing units without NOCs. Similarly, Mines  and  Mineral Department issued only five NOCs to crushers owners without permission from EPA. Both the departments: Mines  and  Minerals Department and Mepco: are accountable for it, he said./Regarding Auqaf Department, he remarked that 61 crushing units were installed on the Waqf land controlled by Auqaf Department without any land lease agreements while Auqaf Department acknowledged only three cases of land lease in 2005. Growth of the industry did not happen suddenly, he said./The Auqaf Department has been found incapable to stop the illegal growth./Resultantly the huge number of units has been installed upon the Wafq land, he disclosed./'Only one FIR against some encroachers was registered in 2004 and likewise only 23 cases were registered in seven years during 2011 to 2017. The Auqaf Department has no care as to what activity has been launched and continued on its land,' he regretted./The Stone crushing industry is a big scam in the district as many corrupt high-profile officers are directly involved in the business and silent partners of it."
BRT Soft Launch," Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) government will have its soft launch in a period of three weeks. However, many are worried because the contractor has started dismantling structures along both sides of the main track at Reach-III of the project due to a design fault. While the spokesperson of the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA), Engineer Ikramullah, has reassured that the reconstruction has not costed the government and will be complete in due time for the soft launch, the government needs to provide a thorough analysis of the entire project which has faced several criticisms up until now./Along with the cost of the project, which has relentlessly increased, the residents of Peshawar have also had to face a number of problems due to the construction: the foremost being the air pollution which has increased in the ratio and has contributed to the increase in respiratory diseases. The controversy surrounding the route of the BRT also impacted the green ratio of the city which is the result of the tussle between PTI and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N). Experts are also of the opinion that the selection of contractors on a project base has impacted the delivery of the project./These are grave concerns which need to be addressed, especially keeping in mind what the people of the city have to say about the progress of the project and its impact on the city. An external audit is also required of the project which will clarify all the expenditure and the choice of contractors by the government. This is also a classic case of negligence when it comes to environmental concerns and the provincial government needs to introduce plantation drives to rid the city of the dust that now surrounds it."
Declaration on climate change," Pakistan Red Crescent (PRC) and religious scholars signed first ever Islamic declaration on climate change at Governor House. Governor Punjab Ch Muhammad Sarwar, Chairman PRC Dr Saeed Elahi, Provincial Chairman PRC Punjab Lt Gen (R) Khalid Maqbool and renowned religious scholars from different sects signed the document aimed at raising public awareness about climate change and possible measures to adopt to future scenario. Addressing the ceremony as chief guest, Governor Punjab said that enhancing climate change resilience by building adaptive capacity was the priority. He said that there was need of awareness campaigns for behavioural change. He said that role of religious scholars was important for achieving the desired results./Dr Saeed Elahi said that the purpose of the initiative was to save people from hazards of present day and future challenges. He said that Lahore has been ranked at nine with regard to worst air pollution, cause of several diseases including life threatening condition. He said that sermons during prayers would definitely help in raising public awareness about climate change and possible measures to live a healthy life."
Rapid deforestation," Forestry plays an important role in the development of a country. However due to rapid deforestation, the former seems a fantasy now. Though deforestation takes place around the globe, Pakistan is undergoing a threatening level of deforestation./In the same way in Karki, this act is going on for a long time. Unfortunately, the public of Karki is cutting the trees for fulfilling their own needs and for their benefits. They need to cut trees and earn through wood trade. Furthermore, it is harmful to the environment not only also for pollution. Beside this, forests are the main source to control air pollution and floods. Deforestation results in severe environmental deterioration, which can result in massive destruction if the rate of deforestation remains persistent./Still, people of Karki are cutting the forest to make ends meet without considering the future outcome. If the government will not stop the process of deforestation then humans will be under the grip of several crises. It would be a tough task for the coming generation because it is the source of cleaning the environment with different kind of pollutions and diseases./At last, it is my humble request to the government of Balochistan to tickle an action against those people who are the actual enemy of the environment."
Global warming," Global warming is becoming a significant problem in today's era, and it is hazardous to human lives. However, there are a few causes that can be labelled as the factors responsible for global warming. We, human beings, are responsible for the phenomenon. Moreover, we are involved in practices that can be easily categorised as self-inflicting harms./Although we already know that they are harmful to us and our planet, we still practice them. For instance, we are using cars that run on burning fossil fuel. These fuels create smoke and air pollution by emitting carbon in the outer atmosphere. In the process of saving time by using fast modes of transportation, we have caused irreparable damage to the ozone layer as well, which protects human life from the hazardous rays that hit our planet. Also, because of excessive human activity, the green house effect is increasing, which is among the key reasons for the increase in the temperature of our planet. These gases are extremely harmful. They can even directly kill the people. Gases like methane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide are damaging our ecosystem./On the other hand, because of an increase in the global temperature level, glaciers are melting with unprecedented pace and ocean as well as sea levels are rising at an alarming rate. The rise in sea level will submerge many coastal regions. As a result of this, many people will be displaced. Also, the global temperature is now causing more floods than ever witnessed before./Additionally, deforestation is also a reason for environmental degradation, as we already know that trees can protect us, but still, cut them for industrial use. These are the gifts of capitalism, which is ruling our times and lives. I request every individual to play their part in preventing the planet from becoming a place that can sustain no life. Together, we can subvert the damage done to the mother earth."
Canal turns into waste dump,"- The Municipal Committee (MC) has turned Upper Chenab Canal into a waste dump./A survey conducted by The Nation reveals that both sides of the canal are filled with garbage. The MC workers dump all the wastes, collected from different parts of the tehsil, to this point; making it into a filth depot. A signboard is fixed there with a precaution: 'Don't burn the garbage; put it into garbage box.' But no garbage box is found at the place. It has been learnt that every night, the MC workers burn the garbage which causes immense air pollution in the area. Moreover, THQ Hospital Sharaqpur is not very far from the point where the garbage is set on fire by the MC workers. The practice of dumping garbage into the canal and setting it ablaze is causing several diseases among locals. Too slothful are the authorities as they are doing nothing to prevent this practice. Locals demand that the government took into the matter./MISSING BOY FOUND DEAD/A five years old boy was found dead near Upper Chenab Canal here the other day. According to police, five-year-old Azam, son of Khadim Hussain, a resident of Mahtam village, had gone missing five days ago. His dead body was found near Kukri Pur on the bank of Upper Chenab Canal. The police shifted the body to THQ Hospital Sharaqpur for post-mortem. Azam had gone outside his house the other night but did not come back."
Focusing on climate change," Climate change has significant implications for health. Rising temperatures will likely lead to increased air pollution, a longer and more intense allergy season, the spread of insect-borne diseases, more frequent and dangerous heat waves, and heavier rainstorms and flooding. All of these changes pose serious, and costly, risks to public health. Strong scientific evidence shows that as temperatures increase, more rain falls during heaviest downpours, increasing the risk of flooding events. Higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels, is making oceans both warmer and more acidic. These two effects threaten the survival of marine life. Corals, shellfish, and phytoplankton, which are the base of the food chain, are particularly at risk. Climate change affects a variety of factors associated with drought and is likely to increase drought risk in certain regions. As temperatures have warmed, the prevalence and duration of drought has increased in the western U.S. and climate models unanimously project increased drought in the American Southwest. The resulting dry conditions will increase the pressure on groundwater supplies as more is pumped to meet demand even as less precipitation falls to replenish it./Tens of millions of trees have died in the Rocky Mountains over the past 15 years, victims of a climate-driven triple assault of tree-killing insects, wildfires, and stress from heat and drought./Our aging electricity infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to the growing consequences of global warming, including sea level rise, heightened wildfire risk, and other water supply issues. Spring arrives much earlier than it used to  - 10 days earlier on average in the northern hemisphere. Snow melts earlier. Reservoirs fill too early and water needs to be released for flood control. Vegetation and soils dry out earlier, setting the stage for longer and more damaging wildfire seasons./Temperatures are rising in the planet's polar regions, especially in the Arctic, and the vast majority of the world's glaciers are melting faster than new snow and ice can replenish them. Scientists expect the rate of melting to accelerate, with serious implications for future sea level rise./Rising temperatures and the accompanying impacts of global warming  - including more frequent heavier precipitation in some regions and more severe droughts in others - has significant implications for crop and meat production. Global warming has the potential to seriously disrupt our food supply, drive costs upward, and affects everything from coffee to cattle, from staple food crops to the garden in your backyard. A changing climate affects the range of plants and animals, changing their behaviour and causing disruptions up and down the food chain. The range of some warm-weather species will expand, while those that depend on cooler environments will face shrinking habitats and potential extinction./Greenhouse gases occur naturally and are essential to the survival of humans and millions of other living things, by keeping some of the sun's warmth from reflecting back into space and making Earth livable. But after more than a century and a half of industrialization, deforestation, and large scale agriculture, quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen to record levels not seen in three million years. As populations, economies and standards of living grow, so do the cumulative level of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions./In October 2018 the IPPCC issued a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C, finding that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, the IPCC said in a new assessment. With clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, the report found that limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society. This report also shows that many of the adverse impacts of climate change going to appear at the 1.5°C mark./In 1992, United Nations 'Earth Summit' produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a first step in addressing the climate change problem. The ultimate aim of the Convention is to prevent 'dangerous' human interference with the climate system and then following Kyoto Protocol in 1995. At 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015, Parties to the UNFCCC reached a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius./Pakistan is the 8th most affected country from climate change and has become a water stressed country because her reservoirs can store water equivalent to 30 days of consumption, whereas the standard minimum requirement is 120 days. The heatwave that took more than 1,200 lives in Karachi only two years ago has since been visiting us with greater frequency and intensity. At 50.4oC, Nawabshah in Sindh recorded in April 2018 the highest temperature ever recorded globally. Floods and hydro-disasters since 2010  - when 20 million Pakistanis were directly affected  - have become an annual feature. Riverine communities routinely get wiped away without even a mention by media. And if it is not the floods, the calamity of drought is afflicting misery in Tharpakar and several other regions particularly in Balochistan./Tree plantation is the major factor to focus. As the new government of Pakistan has promised to plant 10 billion trees during its five year tenure. World leaders of governments, the private sector and civil society together must support the multilateral process to accelerate climate action and ambition. The focus must be on key sector where action can make the most difference -heavy industry, nature-based solutions, cities, energy, resilience, climate finance and more research and appropriate adaptation measures are required to counter the negative impacts of climate Change./The writer is medical doctor by profession, a content writer, freelance writer and a poet./Pakistan is the 8th most affected country from climate change and has become a water stressed country because her reservoirs can store water equivalent to 30 days of consumption, whereas the standard minimum requirement is 120 days."
Air quality monitors to be installed in KP," Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Thursday said that Air pollution and climate change are two of the largest public health issues that province is currently facing./Clearly, significant changes need to be implemented to have a strong impact on reducing air pollution rates. While the government has already made efforts through the KP's Green Growth Initiative and the Billion Tree Tsunami afforestation project, but still more needs to be done to curb the air pollution and climate change. The provincial government has decided to install Air quality monitors in Peshawar and other districts of the province affected by air pollution./He revealed this while talking to Pakistan's leading Environmentalist and Lawyer Ahmad Rafey who met him here in Peshawar. The chief minister stated that despite prevailing challenges, ensuring clean air is one of the government's most important jobs and the government is very clear about taking measures to improve air quality in Peshawar and the province as a whole./While talking on the occasion, environmentalist Ahmad Rafey extended full support in providing his expertise to reduce air pollution in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said, among the many environmental challenges faced by urban areas of the country, air quality is especially difficult to manage. The negative impacts of pollution include elevated risk of cardiovascular problems like heart diseases, stroke and acute diseases./He said installing Air quality monitors will distinguish between areas where pollution levels violate the ambient air quality standard and the areas where they do not. Cities can develop smarter and timelier responses to pollution to help ensure clean air for all residents with the help of these monitors."
Asthma disease in Pakistan," Asthma disease is one of the most common and dangerous diseases in Pakistan which effects the lungs of a person. The disease is being increased day by day in our country. According to a report, around 7.5 million Pakistani adults and 15 million children are suffering from asthma due to the urban population, air pollution, enlarging intercity industries and other environmental issues. That is really destroying the young generation of the country. Actually, tobacco smoke and outdoor pollution are known causes of asthma diseases, affecting our children. Because most of the people smoke commonly and do not care about children. This is the reason today 10 percent of children and 5 percent of adults are victims of asthma disease. It creates problems for breathing, symptoms such as breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. It is the responsibility of government and health authorities to implement new laws for stopping environmental problems. Do not let the people smoke tobacco in open places."
Asthma in Pakistan," Asthma disease in Pakistan. Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups. It is to much dangerous disease in Pakistan which is affecting the lungs of the people. Unfortunately, Pakistan is directly and indirectly effect due to asthma disease which is common in Pakistan according to the report round 7.5 million Pakistan adults and 15 million children suffer from asthma disease. Because to due increasing of population enlarging air pollution and some more issue due to them asthma disease is increasing day by day. And according to the global initiative for asthma GINA more than 150 million people in the all over the world suffer from asthma disorder./Last year 260,000 people died only due to asthma disease. Activity, in Pakistan asthma is destroying the lives of small children. Prof Jamal raze said that smoke, dust, mud, some fragrances, pet animals and smells can trigger asthma. finally, effort are needed to control prevalence of asthma disease in children lives."
Air pollution; a grave issue," Air pollution has bad effects on the lives of people. Air pollution causes a number of diseases such as colds cough, lungs and the disease of health and eyes. It is one of the biggest and serious issues in all over the world. Not only air pollution, but also there are many polluted things which are making the world polluted./Air pollution is very dangerous for living and non-living things. Due to air pollution many people have lost their lives and a category of people are suffering from such health problems created by air pollution. It is mostly caused by the excessive emission smoke. But it also one of the reasons of global warming and acid rain because of which the people are suffering from diseases of lungs, eyes and skin diseases. Air pollution can also cause long term damage to human nevers, brain, kidneys, liver and other organs of human body./Moreover, health effects from air pollution is countless that include heart diseases of lungs cancer which are major concerns in the civilized world. It is in fact very harmful for human beings, plants and animals. Air pollution have suspected harmful effects on human health or the environment to air pollution that cause a variety of environmental effects and it releases gasses into the atmosphere and have many negative effects on the environment. Global warming one of the types of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air./Household air pollution the 10 leading causes up to 36,000 early deaths a year in the outdoor air pollution 10 about 11 million cars were designed to cheat air pollution tests. In short, I would like to draw the attention of the Health Department and other respective authorities to take some strong measures to control the rising air pollution to save the future of the country for a great loss."
Smog Descends Again," Lahore welcomes yet another season of smog with all eyes towards Indian farmers burning crops. The narrative coming from the government is that India is to be blamed for this atrocity, however, Indian farmers burning crops is a known fact for a long time now: enough for the government to take action and come up with remedies for the citizens of Lahore and adjoining areas. While the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) government penalised crop burning in their tenure, in order to avoid punishment the farmers started burning crops at night here at this side of the border. This is public information at the disposal of the new government that needs to be vigilant about smog in the country./Air pollution in Pakistan causes 135,000 deaths in the year. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Lahore and adjoining areas at this time has reached 484 according to Amnesty International, which is way past the hazardous limit of 300. Such air conditions are equivalent to residents smoking 14 cigarettes a day and result in the development of respiratory diseases. The government has ordered no directives to the resident to take any precautionary measures nor is there affirmation of how serious the situation is. The Environment Protection Secretary Salman Ejaz on Wednesday contradicted reports suggesting the development of hazardous level smog in Lahore, claiming that authentic data shows much lower levels that are not dangerous at all as yet. Chief Meteorologist Sahibzad Khan also claimed that the situation in Lahore is merely smoke and haze which is a sign of incoming rain. This shows a serious lack of coordination among departments that should be on top of the situation./The Minister for Climate Change Zartaj Gul needs to be alerted and prompted to take swift action in this regard. Smog is not a new issue and the government should have had a steady plan to tackle the situation by now. Shifting blame on the Indian side does not result in the eradication of the problem at hand. The government needs to seek mechanisms that can help ease the situation, and also find ways to admonish the Indian side if crop burning at their end is truly the cause of such weather conditions at this side of the border./It is also equally important to educate residents about the situation and how they can protect themselves. People living in areas affected by smog should be encouraged to wear smog masks and also advised to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary."
Zartaj refutes claim about Lahore's pollution," Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul on Thursday refuted the claim that Lahore was among the top most polluted cities of the world. She in her video message shared on her twitter said Google maps clearly indicate that total air pollution existing in the region comprised 80 percent area of India and only 20 percent of the pollution is indicated in Pakistan's territory./She also claimed that several vehicles as part of political rallies entering in Lahore are one of the reasons of pollution in the provincial capital. She said 'deliberately misinformation is being spread about Lahore air quality. It is as bad as being asserted by vested elements.'/She said the Ministry of Climate Change has taken all steps to prevent smog in Punjab, especially in Lahore through close coordination with the provincial environmental departments. She said Punjab EPD has sealed 155 furnaces or industrial units emitting dark hazardous smoke and overall 261 such units have been shut down across the province to curb serious air pollution. Gul urged the public to consult calibrated and authentic data of Pakistan SUPARCO and EPD Punjab air quality data of Lahore shared through its Wagha Border air monitoring system./She said the winter season is about to start where crop stubble burning would be carried out in the agrarian areas. She advised the farmers to avoid burning stubble as it would directly contribute to generate smog in the province."
Traffic police intensify anti-smog campaign," Chief Traffic Officer Liaqat Ali Malik on Friday directed the traffic wardens to step up the ongoing campaign against the vehicles emitting smoke. A police spokesman said special teams comprising traffic policemen and officials of the environment department have been constituted to punish the drivers for air pollution. The owners of different transport companies have also been directed not to run some-emitting vehicles on the roads. The violators will be issued fine tickets, he said. The city traffic police department issued challan tickets to at least 29,251 drivers since January. As part of the anti-smog drive, at least 9,701 drivers were issued fine tickets during the month of October. The traffic officers are directed to take strict action against the smoke-emitting vehicles during the current month. The CTO further said that environmental and air pollution cause epidemic of viral diseases. Therefore, the transporters are ordered to run the vehicles on roads only after proper repair and checkup. The violators will be taken to task, he said."
Health Emergency," The Indian government has declared a health emergency as the air quality in Delhi reaches hazardous levels. Schools have been shut down till next Tuesday to avoid exposing children to such air quality. Such efforts on part of the Indian government show how seriously the government is responding to the crisis of smog as opposed to its counterpart here in Pakistan. The situation in Lahore right now is worse than Delhi but the government neither recognises the problem nor is coming up with ideas to solve it. Chief Minister in India Arvind Kejriwal on Friday distributed over 50 lakh masks to school children and appealed to other residents to use them too. This is the most simple yet effective step any government can take in order to buy time and manage the situation: a solution our government can look into too./Very similar to the Pakistani government though, the Indian government blamed neighbouring countries for the poor air condition in their own country. Adjoining countries need to take charge of the crop burning that persists within their borders and discourage the activity to prevent any damage within their own land and their neighbour's land. Several countries have also come up with innovative solutions to their smog problem. If we look at our ally, China, their most polluted city, Shijiazhuang, has an annual mean of 305 micrograms per metre cubed. In order to fight this, Dutch inventor Daan Roosegaarde created a seven metre-high 'Smog Free Tower. It is a giant, outdoor air purifier. In much the same way that static electricity can make loose hair stick to a comb, airborne particles are sucked into the tower where they receive a positive charge. The particles are then captured by a negatively charged dust-removal plate and clean air is blown out of the other end./Berlin-based architect Allison Dring, director of Elegant Embellishments, had an alternative solution to Mexico's air pollution. Dring created a coral like structure that captures light and wind from all sides and converts nitrogen dioxide to nitric acid. This nitric acid is then neutralised into a harmless salt that is ultimately washed away by rain. The government of Pakistan also needs to invest in the well being of its citizens. Smog is not a new issue and is certainly not one they can continue to ignore. If Lahore becomes a hub of disease, it will impact economic growth."
"'Health emergency' declared in Delhi, SC demands action"," As per a series of reports by Indian news organization NDTV, the Indian Supreme Court on Monday accused the government in Delhi of not acting enough to address the ""health emergency"" declared by authorities in the Indian capital./A report on the Environment Pollution Control Authority of India stated that much of the pollution in Delhi was being caused by stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana, which has made the court seek action in curbing such fires in the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana./The Delhi government has also implemented an ""odd-even"" traffic rationing system which bars cars with number-plates ending in odd numbers to drive in Delhi. This massive legal procedure has led to 200 teams of Delhi Traffic Police being deployed to ensure no cars with number plates that have been prohibited from using their cars in the health emergency are driving their vehicles./Delhi has surpassed Lahore in international air pollution indices, with air quality index showing the poorest quality in Delhi since 2016. All government and private schools in Delhi have closed till November 5, when air quality is slated to improve./37 flights were also redirected from Delhi because of low visibility attributed to dense and thick smoke.irport due to low visibility caused by the thick blanket of smoke./For the time being, all diesel generators have also been banned in Delhi. Courts have also prohibited electricity providers from any kind of loadshedding in Delhi and adjoining areas during the emergency, and in line with international regulations, have advised parents from keeping children at home."
Asthma," Asthma is a chronic disease that effects the airways which carry oxygen in out of the lungs. If a person has asthma, the side of these airways are irritated and swollen. It can cause shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and tightness in the cheat./According to a report around 15 million adults agony from asthma due to increasing urban population, air pollution and other environmental factors. Commonly the tobacco smoke and outdoor pollution are known asthma triggers in the children./Owing to smoking, around 10 per cent of total children population and 5 percent of adults of total population suffering from asthma disease. It is my humble request to health authorities to consolidate the laws for eliminating the problems of the sake of young generation."
Rain temporarily lessen toxic smog in Lahore," The threat of toxic smog has receded temporarily in Lahore on Thursday due to overnight rain in certain regions./According to Met department sources, the current spell of rain is expected to continue till Friday with wind direction to change within next 24 hours./Currently, strong winds coupled with rain, from east and southeast direction, have blown away pollutants from the provincial capital. However, this is only a temporary relief for the citizens as the fifth season of toxic smog will continue to engulf horizon from November till February./On Thursday, widespread rain/thunderstorm (with heavy falls at a few places) is expected in districts of upper Punjab, Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan and Islamabad, at scattered places in districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and central Punjab./Snowfall over high mountains and hailstorm in plain areas are also expected during the period./Concerns around poor air quality are mounting for the last four years as the smog has deprived the people of sunshine and dusk-hour charm, and unfolded severe health risks with respiratory diseases, particularly for the children and the elderly./Officials and several politicians have claimed that stubble burning in Indian Punjab, and the sudden change of direction of wind last night was responsible for thick layers of smog in Lahore./After a sudden spike in Lahore's Air Quality Index (AQI), which measures the concentration of poisonous particles, from less than 200 to more than 500, the chief minister announced closure of public and private schools on Thursday. This is the first time that smog has forced closure of schools./The city's air quality index (AQI), which measures the concentration of poisonous particles, was recorded at 216 in the ""poor"" category on Wednesday./At the weekend, New Delhi experienced its worst air quality day since 2016 with an AQI of 494, in the ""severe"" category - 500 is the maximum score and anything above 400 is considered hazardous to health./Just before midnight, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar tweeted: 'Due to sudden increase in smog, all schools in Lahore will remain closed tomorrow. We are closely monitoring the #LahoreSmog situation. Administration is already on high alert and have tasked them to escalate actions against crop burning and other factors that contribute to smog.'/As per Lahore US consulate Air Quality Monitor feed, the level of smog was hazardous and at 10pm, Lahore's AQI was PM2.5 - 580./The itching air, complicating respiratory systems of the people, was alarming by the evening. And for that reason, #LahoreSmog was the top trend on Twitter./A group of students have petitioned the Lahore High Court seeking change in the AQI measurement system, and implementation of the Smog Policy./Smog which occurs mainly because of intense air pollution can also be defined as a mixture of various gases with dust and water vapor. Smog also refers to hazy air that makes breathing difficult./Smog can be responsible for any ailment from minor pains to deadly pulmonary diseases such as lung cancer. Smog is well known for causing irritation in the eye. It may also result in inflammation in the tissues of lungs; giving rise to pain in the chest./Other issues or illnesses such as cold and pneumonia are also related to smog. The human body faces great difficulty in defending itself against the harmful effects of smog./The last level of 'hazardous' on the AQI is shown as between 250 to 300 which necessitates the people with heart and lung diseases."
"Smog increases risk of brain cancer, according to McGill study"," Researchers at McGill University in Montreal have concluded that ""smog-like"" conditions can result in the development of malignant brain tumors./Examining the health records of almost 2 million people in Canada over 25 years, they established a direct correlation between air pollution and the incidence of brain cancer./Although the health consequences of air pollution in general are well known - especially pertaining to the similarities between cigarette smoking and inhaling unhealthy air - this is the first study that suggests a relationship between brain cancer and smog./Contrary to what the Punjab government has announced, international protocol holds all air quality with a reporting above 150 is considered ""unsafe"". Any reporting above 300 is considered ""hazardous"", with recommendations to either evacuate such a zone, or to declare a state of emergency./Lahore has, especially in recent days, received reporting that was well above a 500. Until recently, schools were still open, even though children, the elderly, and pregnant women are considered to be most at threat by the effects of smog./As the detection apparatus required to give a reading of the air quality index (AQI) is expensive, few districts in Pakistan have access to an AQI reading. This means that there could be many more towns and cities across the country that have dangerous levels of smog, but no reading. In recent days, both Peshawar and Faisalabad have also risen up in air pollution charts./Lahore and Delhi have become one of the world's only cities to have received readings above an 800 on the AQI./Unless this crisis is addressed, environmental activists and researchers state that a massive public health emergency and an ecological crisis looms over South Asia."
Rain lessens smog intensity in Lahore," Rain and wind on Saturday reduced the density of thick smog that had engulfed the city for the several days after smoke of the burning crop stubble in the adjoining Indian Punjab permeated Lahore and its adjoining areas, alarming the people and government alike and forcing the citizens to take precautionary measures./At 12 noon, the Air Quality Index (AQI) PM2.5 recorded Lahore's average air pollution at 171 - the unhealthy level - that is significant reduction from the previous hazardous level./The Punjab School Education Department on Thursday announced to close all schools in Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad for two days./The Met department has predicted rain, wind/thunderstorm at scattered places in south Punjab, Sindh and northeastern Balochistan, besides at isolated places in districts of upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir in the next 24 hours. Snowfall is also expected over mountain./A spokesperson of Pakistan Meteorological Department told our correspondent that upper parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir will receive more rains during the next twelve to twenty four hours./The spokesperson said snowfall has also been reported on the mountains in Gilgit Baltistan, Kashmir and Mansehra./Besides, intermittent rain is continuing in different parts of the country including Islamabad and Rawalpindi, which has increased the intensity of cold./Since the start of November, Lahore's AQI has witnessed an abrupt spike./Weather pundits told the media that the sudden rise in smog stemmed from the smoke and other pollutants from Indian Punjab's burning crops./As per Lahore US consulate Air Quality Monitor feed, Lahore's AQI was PM2.5 - 220 at 12 noon./In Gulberg, the AQI was 179, the Punjab Assembly vicinity observed PM2.5 at 209, Upper Mall at 173, Sandar Industrial Estate at 189, DHA Phase 5 at 206 and Zeenat Block at 198."
"32,000 smoke emitting vehicles issued tickets"," Chief Traffic Officer Liaqat Ali Malik on Saturday ordered the traffic wardens to step up the ongoing campaign against the smoke emitting vehicles to punish the violators./The CTO issued these directions while presiding over a meeting held to review the performance of the joint teams of the traffic police and environment department involved in the anti-smog drive. Director Environment Department Dr Nusrat was also present on this occasion./The mechanism of action against smoke emitting vehicles was discussed in detail during the meeting. The participants were informed that at least 9 teams comprising 18 traffic wardens were constituted on the directions of Lahore CTO to punish the violators. These special teams are deployed at the entry and exit points of the metropolis for proper checking./On this occasion, CTO Liaqat Ali Malik said the traffic police teams are also delivering lectures at educational institutions on a daily basis to educate masses about the anti-smog campaign. The city traffic police issued challan tickets to at least 32,000 drivers since January. As part of the anti-smog drive, at least 9,701 drivers were issued fine tickets during the month of October./Also, the owners of different transport companies have also been directed not to run some-emitting vehicles on the roads. The violators will be issued fine tickets, he said. The traffic officers are directed to take strict action against the smoke-emitting vehicles during the current month./The CTO further said that environmental and air pollution cause epidemic of viral diseases including respiratory and throat infections."
Another Government Capitulation," There come some moments in any government's tenure when it has to take some harsh decisions. These days when the smog or air pollution has reached critical levels in Lahore and adjacent areas, the Punjab government has had to take some radical steps to improve air quality. One such intervention in this regard was the government's earlier decision to close down old fashioned brick kilns for more than two months. Unfortunate to note that even Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) prefers political considerations to the environment, as its capitulation before the kiln owners' pressure shows./Brick kilns across South Asia have a global warming impact equivalent to that of all passenger cars in the United States. The air pollution from these kilns kills tens of thousands of people each year as a result of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, as one study reveals. Moreover, the new irritant is the smog that is caused by these brick kilns. There are around 20,000 brick kilns in Pakistan. Many are located around urban areas and contribute significantly to air pollution. The government knows this fact as it had decided to close down such kilns in the Red Zone comprising districts of Lahore and Gujranwala./Furthermore, the government needs to understand that Pakistan's brick sector is highly unregulated. Brick kilns are recognised as one of the largest stationary sources of black carbon. It, along with iron and steel production, contributes 20% of total worldwide black carbon emissions. The government has to start somewhere. If it capitulates on brick kilns front, it will capitulate on other fronts as well. True the government does not want to further marginalise the labour in this sector, but that does not mean that the kiln sector should be left the way it is. The government needs to formulate a win-win strategy for the environment and those who earn their bread from brick kilns."
Environmental Pollution," The environment forms a very important aspect of human life because that is where we find the essentials of our existence. Environmental pollution is one of the most critical threats faced by our planet in the present day scenario. This is a global issue, which is seen commonly in all countries, including the third-world countries, irrespective of their developmental status./Environmental pollution has been a challenge in Pakistan. Air pollution has resulted in harm to human health and destruction of the ozone layers in the atmosphere. Water pollution has caused death of aquatic life and acidification. Soil pollution has resulted in unhealthy soil i.e. unbalanced soil pH which does not favor plant growth. Lately Lahore and its adjoining territories have been facing extreme Smog, further deteriorating air quality which is equal to smoking 11 cigarettes a day. Government was forced to shut down schools and discouraged unnecessary exposure, effecting citizens daily routine./Various things pollute the air like gaseous releases from motor vehicle ignitions and industries, burning fossil fuels inside the air. The solid industrial waste, oil spills, plastic dumps, and city garbage that thrown into the water pollutes the river and oceans. Similarly, inorganic procedures of agriculture destroy the fertility of the soil. The diseases that occur due to environmental pollution consist of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, skin cancer, lead poisoning, cardiovascular diseases and stroke, radiation augmented cancers, mercury poisoning, congenital disabilities, allergies, lung diseases owing to occupational exposure to numerous toxin and many more. The list is unending./Global warming has become a major issue as a result of environmental pollution that the world needs to cope up with. The melting glacier in Antarctica has resulted in the rising sea levels. Natural calamities such as frequent earthquakes, cyclones, etc are all due to the havoc caused by the increased environmental pollution levels. Summits like Kyoto protocol and Copenhagen Accord has been in discussion for as long as ever./In response to these disasters, every possible measure is being taken by different countries in the world. More awareness programs are being organized to educate people about the hazards of environmental pollution and the need of protecting our planet. Greener ways of living are becoming popular. Energy-efficient bulbs, eco-friendly vehicles, use of solar and wind energy, are to name some among which Defence Housing Authority like always has taken the lead by banning usage and burning of plastics at all level, providing chlorinated water, conducting self-awareness seminars and promoting healthy community by planting more trees and encouraging the same by setting a precedent. The only community where green belt is mandatory outside every house./Being a resident of DHA I feel extremely proud of the initiative taken by the society towards healthier greener Pakistan and is my appeal to every individual to step forward in contributing their part by becoming a responsible environmental-friendly citizens of this beautiful country. A Concerned citizen,"
"Six factories sealed, 26 held for causing air-pollution"," The district administration claimed to have sealed six factories and arrested 26 persons for contributing to air pollution here on Wednesday./The action was taken during a crackdown launched on the directives of the Punjab government to check all such factories causing air-pollution./Additional Deputy Commissioner (revenue) Dr Zeeshan along with a police team conducted raids on different industrial units. The officials found six factories banned material which caused smog. The officials sealed the six factories and arrested 26 persons including some owners of the factories for violation of section 144 in respect of polluting the atmosphere./Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Sohail Ashraf said that stern action would be carried on against those industrial units, smoke-emitting vehicles and brick-kilns which are massively contributing to the air pollution resulting in 'Smog'. He said due to rapid industrialization smog has become a grave environmental issue and all possible steps must be taken to curb all the sectors cause of this menace./TEACHER TORTURES STUDENT/The teacher of a private school allegedly tortured and damaged the eye of a 12-year-old student here in Dhulley area. Father of the victim boy alleged that Fahad was reading in a private school where his teacher tortured him for not learning the lesson due to which one Eye of Fahad got damaged and he was under treatment in DHQ hospital Gujranwala. He demanded the Punjab CM to take action against the teacher. Meanwhile, the CPO said that no application has been received in this regard. He said the police, however, have started investigation and action will be taken in the light of inquiry report."

Wahab for following environment laws," Adviser to Chief Minister for Environment, Laws and Coastal Development and spokesman for Sindh Government Barrister Murtaza Wahab Thursday said that it was our morally and legally obligation to follow the rules and regulation of environment laws./He further said that elements who violate environmental laws should be correct his direction for healthy and friendly environment. He expressed these views while chaired over a high level meeting of the Environment protection agency Department./He directed the officer to gear up the departmental proceeding against violation of environmental laws and prohibit the manufacturer of non- biodegradable plastic from Karachi to Kashmore at any cost./He also said that the hospital waste recycling factories should be sealed after legal proceedings. Provincial Advisor was informed that operation against smoke and emission vehicles is being carried out till now and hundreds of vehicles owners had been fined./Adviser further said that number of checking point be increased at different place of City and heavy fine should be imposed on a smoke exhausting vehicles. He directed that there should be raided at factories which involved burning tyres as fuel and legal action also taken against them who were spreading air pollution immediately and no pressure must be accepted in these regard. 'Construction Industry should ensure the compliance of Environment laws in the construction of buildings of all kinds' he concluded. The meeting was attended by the Secretary Environment Khan Muhammad Mahar, Assistant Director General SEPA Waqar Phulphoto, Deputy Director SEPA and including all officers of Environment Department."
World challenge," Every individual is smitten in different matters, but the world's biggest challenge in the 21th century is the air pollution and it is the most serious threat to global health. It is estimated that air pollution is one of the fifth leading risk factors for mortality worldwide./Around 7 million people become succumb of it globally. Also, the mortality and life expectancy reduction rates are affected by the air pollution. This is the factor that contributes more deaths than others, like malnutrition, alcohol use, and physical inactivity./The main causes are responsible of it, indoor and outdoor air pollution. Indoor air is the fuel that is burned in homes cooking and heating that creates health problems, such as pneumonia, heart disease, asthma and cancer. On the other hand, outdoor air is energy sources, like transports, energy generation, industry./Mostly, developing countries face these issues than developed ones because they have no proper solution. Also, more users of new technologies and fossil fuels are developed countries that changed the climate that have led the other developing or under developing countries backward. Now, they have/are controlled it, but developing countries have no more source of controlling it. So, the one solution for reducing the pollution is to increase the price of fuels because nowadays fuel is consumed more. In this way, it can be expected a shift of cleaner energy sources."
Full of dirt," According to a report, Lahore is the 2nd most air polluted city in the world. Due to this polluted air, it is estimated that around 135,000 people loses their lives annually./Air pollution is one of the biggest issues faced by Lahore. Lahore is a developing city with a huge number of population. Such a huge population and the factories are polluting the air in a large quantity. The air with a amount of dirt in it can cause many kinds of diseases such as, fever, typhoid, lungs and skin problems, cough, etc./Air is the integral part of one's life. We inhale air in every second of our lives. If we inhale the air full of chemicals, dirt and impurities, we will face numerous problems which can be dangers for the life./Lahore is in danger with such statistics of death in each year due to air pollution only. The government should force the environmental protection agencies to work for the safeguard of Lahore. It is a big city of great importance; it needs a great attention from the concerned authorities."
BRT Probe Halted," The Peshawar government's decision to move the Supreme Court (SC) against the High Court's order directing the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to probe alleged irregularities in the Peshawar Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project comes with a lot of criticism that has been surrounding the project since its inception. The amount of money that was injected into the project surpassed the limit initially decided by the authorities, leaving a sum of multi-billion rupees being spent on the lack of planning  and  designing, negligence in the execution of work, and poor management of the project. The probe would allow the authorities along with the public to understand how public funds were spent and whether or not the project was feasible, to begin with./The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) government certainly wanted to join the list of regimes that provided such services to the masses as opposed to the projects of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) - the only regime capable of execution of such mass projects. The Peshawar BRT controversy started right when the government was not able to choose the right track for the bus service, as the path right now chokes the entire city, leaving very little green patches and increasing air pollution by manifolds, resulting in inconvenience for the public along with the inception of respiratory diseases caused by dust and pollutants from the traffic./The government should allow the probe as it will help them improve their own governance and planning. Governments in power need to be able to accept where there was a mismanagement of projects and a lack of effective planning to be able to execute these mega plans. If the SC decides against the order of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), this will give the impression that the government is misusing power to manipulate verdicts in their favour - a precedent that PTI government does not want to set./Opening up to scrutiny is one of the core principles in a democratic setup - where no party is above the law. This was one of the first promises of the PTI government and it is important for them to set the precedent according to what they promised the people of Pakistan. Governments are bound by the law of the country - A BRT probe has been pending for a long time as several pieces of research have pointed towards the inadequacy of the project.  "
Pneumonia Epidemic," Pneumonia is the world's deadliest child killer with a forgotten epidemic, claiming one young life every 39 seconds./However, this disease killed more children 800,000 under the age of five years last year. Everyday nearly 2,200 children under the age of five die from Pneumonia. The numbers make grim reading and compare with 437,000 under five dying last year due to Diarrhoea and 272,000 due to Malaria. Furthermore, five countries accounted for more than half of the child pneumonia deaths. In Nigeria 162,000 children died, India 127,000, in Pakistan 58,000, in Democratic Republic of Congo 40,000 and in Ethiopia 32,000./It is most caused by bacteria, uirvses or fungi and leaves children fighting for breath as their lungs fill with pus and fluid. Children with weakened immune systems and those living in areas with high levels of air pollution and unsafe water are most of risk. So, it is my request to the governments to tackle air pollution and save their water. Lahore is considered the 2nd most air polluted city, this can bring death to thousands of children. The government can do a lot to save the people of Lahore along with other cities."
PMA demands increase in health budget for better service delivery," The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) on Tuesday urged government to increase health budget in order to improve the health delivery system in upcoming year. In a statement released, the PMA expressed concerns over the performance of government in the health sector in 2019 and demanded an increase in health budget allocation as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations./According to WHO recommendations, the health budget of any country should be at least 6 per cent of the national GDP. In our case, the health budget, despite repeated PMA pleas and reminders to the government, has remained less than 1 per cent, said the statement./It said that in 2019 the polio infection remains endemic despite over 100 rounds of vaccination being carried out in the past decade. Our polio programme has deteriorated as compared to the last year's polio vaccination programme, which seemed to be on the brink of eradicating wild poliovirus transmission./The statement further stated that during the current year as many as 117 cases have been reported (KP 83, Sindh 19, Balochistan 9, Punjab 6) as compared to 12 cases in 2018. This is very unfortunate that the International Monitoring Board (IMB) has declared the polio programme and the importance of delivering polio vaccine as 'Political Football' in the country. It also observed that there is a lack of political unity behind polio resurgence in the country./The PMA said that the outbreak of dengue across the country seems to have been particularly vicious during the outgoing year, adding that approximately 50,000 cases have already been reported. This is almost double the number of people infected with the virus in the past decade. This shows the negligence of our rulers, who have done nothing to combat this disease./It said the number of HIV/AIDS patients in Pakistan currently stands at 165,000 and 9,565 new cases were detected this year. During the year, Rato Dero, a small area in Larkana city of Sindh, alone reported 895 cases of AIDS, of which, 754 constitute children and 141 adults. From April to November 30, about 37,558 people had undergone HIV screening in Larkana, out of which 1,195 were reported with suspected presence of the virulent germs./The PMA said there have been confirmed cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Balochistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab, which is widely spreading in Pakistan. The deadly Congo [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic] virus has 'attacked' Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan, killing at least 20 people this year./Over 15 million people are affected with hepatitis B and C in Pakistan. Thousands of new patients are added every year due to lack of prevention, testing, and treatment resources as well as poorly screened blood transfusion, improperly sterilised invasive medical devices and unsafe injections. According to WHO report, the main reason for the rising number of hepatitis C cases in Pakistan, is the presence of a large number of quack doctors. The World Bank estimates that Pakistan's annual burden of disease due to outdoor air pollution accounts for 22,000 premature adult deaths and 163, 432 DALYS lost, while that for indoor pollution accounts for 40 million cases of acute respiratory infections and 28,000 deaths/year."
Air pollution," Air pollution is a problem that will put the world to an end. Still the mankind does not go for any remedy for it./In Pakistan, air pollution is increasing day by day non-stopping. The people are facing a lot of problems due to this and the ecosystem is being damaged by this./According to WHO, every year more then 4 million people die early because of air pollution . Mostly, it has become a worst issue in Pakistan. It is causing the diseases, such as, heart and bloodsteam or caners. Not only the human health but also the planet is in danger due to air pollution ./The people mostly burn the garbage for getting rid of them but they do not know that the smoke is much more dangerous then the garbage./Recently, scientists have said that if air pollution is not controlled, it can destroy the world. So, I suggest to the public to not burn garbage on the roads and near to homes also I request to the government to take serious action about air pollution ."
Electric vehicle policy to be announced next month," The government is working on 'electric vehicle policy' that would be announced next month; during the first phase, all two and three wheelers (rickshaws and bikes) would be switched over to electric batteries in Lahore, a government official said./In second phase, public transport would be switched over to electric/hybrid technology, said Advisor to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam. He said this while exclusively talking to The Nation. He said electric batteries would not only reduce the pollution but will also reduce the running cost of the vehicles by 70 percent compared with other fuels(petrol, diesel) operated vehicles ./PM's adviser says green index has been launched at 300 places in Punjab so far/He said , govt under its third initiative will ensure clean green index to change environmental behaviour in all the cities and said that green index had been launched at 300 places in Punjab so for./Malik said , govt was adopting adequate measures to combat environmental pollution nd will switch over to Euro 5 fuel gradually as use of upgraded fuel would reduce pollution caused by smoke and heat emiitted from vehicles. Govt was making preparations to launch Electric Buses across the country to combat air pollution and in this context an MOU has been signed with a private company and said that govt is also installing vehicle inspection system. Malik Amin  While talking about his efforts for the development of his native district Attock said that planting of trees over an area of ten thousand kanal on the bank of Ghazi Barotha Power Channel , restoration of scholarships for the students of Comsats university Attock , approval of building for Allama Iqbal University Campus , solution of Arid University Attock issues , approval of ten cricket grounds on the bank of Ghazi Barotha channel , Suigas and electrity connections in different villages and last but not the least is approval for 35 water filteration plants . He said , this govt under the dynamic leadership of Imran Khan is taking country on the right trackof development and said that specially 2020 will be harbinger of prosperity and development."
High Ranking Pollution," Pollution in Pakistan is yet another challenge for the government of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI). The second consecutive smog season during their government was not managed properly due to the blame on India. However, there needs to be an awareness campaign geared towards equipping citizens with protection techniques in such polluted conditions along with reforms that can be made on an individual and state level. The current statistics show Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and Lahore as three of the most polluted cities in the world. This pollution is not just limited to smog season: an understanding, the government and its bodies need to develop. The quality of air needs to be monitored in order to ensure that citizens remain protected at all times./The lack of attention towards environmental policies will pose a threat to the state as it exposes a lot of citizens to respiratory diseases: a phenomenon we have witnessed due to the gross mismanagement of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Peshawar. The city of Peshawar now entails several stories of passersby who have developed respiratory diseases. In order to avoid such scenarios in the future, the first task the government needs to perform is to initiate accountability in its own network to improve the outputs that they are performing. People living in such an environment are neither aware of how polluted their air is nor do they have any information regarding how much pollution impacts their own bodies. These mutations will impact future generations as well, and the cities being mentioned in the Global Air Pollution Report are the epicenters of economic and business activity in Pakistan. The government needs to engage in planned urbanisation and help improve the living conditions of the population by urging them to invest in masks and air purifiers and also finding means to share these resources with the less privileged./This is an emergency and should be treated as such by all political parties in order to help protect the environment."

Anti-smog measures to be implemented across Punjab," Minister for Environment Muhammad Rizwan chaired the meeting of cabinet sub-committee on Smog for implementations of anti smog measures at S and GAD's committee room on Thursday./Minister for Industries Mian Aslam Iqbal and Chief Secretary Punjab major(r) Azam Suleman Khan also attended the meeting./Secretary Environment Protection Department Zahid Hussain briefed the participants about the follow up of actions taken in pursuance of decisions reached in the second meeting to ensure adherence to the timelines assigned for conversion of old technology brick kilns to zig-zag technology, installation of air pollution control systems in industries, controlling vehicle pollution, checking air pollution from stone crushing and cement mixing plants and installation of dust control systems./He also briefed that according to the final timeframe decided with the brick kiln association, all brick kilns would be shifted to latest technology till December 2020 step-wise. He further said that various awareness drives were being continued by Environment Protection Agency and 30 stone-crushers of Margalla hills were being sealed on the directions of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Secretary Industries briefed that a meeting had held with Pakistan Re-Rolling Mills Association to arrive at an time-barred action plan to curb violation of environmental laws.  Representative of transport told that a letter for release of funds had been sent to the federal government for installation of two-way catalytic convertors in existing vehicles. Representative of traffic police told that IG Police issued instructions to all DPOs and CTOs, taking action against smoke emitting vehicles./Representative of Agriculture informed the meeting that as many as 620 FIRs had been registered against violators of environmental laws and to avoid such violations for future an action plan was being finalized./Representative of Health told the meeting that the health department had installed incinerators at district level and had directed to hospital administrations for proper disposal of hospital waste.  Representative LG and CDD informed that water was being sprinkled on the both sides of roads on daily basis.  Punjab Minister Industries Mian Aslam Iqbal said that activities directed to create awareness should be increased . He said that there was a lot needed to be done by all the relevant departments to control the situation. He said a comprehensive strategy should be adopted by the departments for the abolishment of resource recovery units and to eliminate fuel adulteration in Lahore. He directed to secretary EPD to develop a proposal to form to speed up pending cases of departmental inquiries./He said that for achievement of the goal of clean  and  green Pakistan, had to perform proactive role and need to take on board all the relevant stakeholders."
Anti-Smog Measures," Growing concern for the environment has mobilized the government to take measures, particularly in reference to smog in certain areas of Punjab. This is certainly a step forward from last year's strategy of shifting the blame to India, to a more proactive role this year. The government with its anti-smog measures is doing everything to ensure that all those actions that can prevent and reduce the current amount of pollution can be taken instantly. Certain goals set by the concerned department include the conversion of old technology brick kilns to zig-zag technology, the installation of air pollution control systems in industries, controlling vehicle pollution, checking air pollution from stone crushing and cement mixing plants and the installation of dust control systems./This allows us to see the range of the work currently taking place, and due to the meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on smog for the implementation of anti-smog measures, we can identify how proactively this is being pursued. As many as 620 FIRs have been registered against violators of environmental laws. DPOs and CTOs have been instructed to take action against smoke emitting vehicles. Proper waste disposal is also included in the ambit alongside a commitment to devise a strategy for the abolishment of resource recovery units and to eliminate fuel adulteration in Lahore./These are significant changes in the system which, if they materialise, can improve the environment overall. Once these short-term goals are met by the government and all the stakeholders, plans should also be made for the long-term so that the overall setup is less harmful to the environment. This can include the development of a proper public transport system, so there can be fewer cars on our roads adding pollution along with the continuation of the plantation drives, that can naturally improve the environment."

Environmental degradation and its effects on Pakistan," Environmental degradation is the depletion or deterioration of environment in terms of reduction of resources. The natural resources are being used continuously and unnecessarilywhich isleading to the habitat deterioration, ecosystem disturbances, extinction of specie, and depletion of water, soil, and airthat is graduallyaffecting the environment in an undesirable way.In simple words, there is a decline in world's natural resources which is instigating environmental degradation. Depletion and degradation of natural resources,fuel wood deficiency, air and water contamination, soil erosion,extinction of specie are among the consequencesof many man-made inventions to fulfil their needs and demands./Environmental degradation has become a threat globally, nationally and individually. It is one of the biggest problems that the whole world is facing right now. This obstacle is not only confronted by a single nation or undeveloped countries, but the developed countries also.Every nation is concerned about this degradation of natural resources in context of prosperity, wellbeing and good quality of life.The environmental degradation has come to a point where it has become a threat to human existence./Pakistan is a developing country.Therefore, itmust take steps to improve its manifestation all over the world. Pakistan is rich in natural resources like natural gas, coal etc.but is still victim of environmental degradation. Many circumstances may beresponsible for this disastrous decree in natural resources. Among all, the mostly involved factorscan be the day-to-dayincrease in population of Pakistan, increasing needs and demands, increased deforestation, increased use of goods and services and the highlighting cause is the use of polluting technology that is causing air and water pollution, climate change, global warming, ozone depletion, carbon dioxide contamination in the atmosphere, acid rains, natural disasters like floods and droughts, wildlife extinction and many more./Climate change, an environmental hazard, is one of the biggest global issues that the world is facing.Another devastatingoutcomewhich in return is also contributing to environmental degradation is the disruption of ecosystem. Ecosystem is biological community where organisms interact with one another.The natural disastershave forced the population of one community to migrate from one placeto the other. These immigrants also known as refugees are not only deprived of their basic human rights like clean water, sanitation, health and housing but are also losing their cultural identity which emerges from their homeland. The environment of such lands is affected badly and is destroying gradually because of lack of resources, over-population and unemployment which has forced humans to move towards unusual natural resources for food, shelter and living./Pakistan is a developing country and the most population lies under the rural state. Either due to non-availability or absence of natural sources, different communities have moved to inadequate use of the already available resources such as the rural community cuts trees to use them as source of firewood due to non-availability of natural gas. They are also using trees for the purpose of construction. Trees are also used for the furniture purposes. Pakistan is moving towards urbanization because of its increasing population, more trees are being cut and places are becoming overcrowded that is negatively impacting the environment. /All these have led to increased air pollution, floods, soil erosion, and increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Many people in Pakistan donot have access to clean water and healthy food. Even though Pakistan is quite a rich country when it comes to natural resources that is fertile soil, rivers etc. but as per recent climate changes and global warming, everything is getting destroyed day by day. Lack of cleanliness, a major throwback, is making environment contaminated. /There are many open sewers that add to the pollution, many factories dump their toxic wastage in the sewers, many discharge toxic chemical into the air thereby polluting the air and water, making it hard for the animals to live.All these determinants and environmental threats are not only worsening the health of Pakistani's,but they also pose a threat to country's economy. An example of environmental degradation can be seen in Lahore where smog has been a constant problem for the past few years. Smog is a combination of smoke and fog which is due to burning of large amount of coal. Smog is an intense polluted air that not only affects the respiratory system but also the visibility of an individual that affects the activity of daily living./To overcome environmental degradation in Pakistan, we must take actions to surmount all the risks and to promote healthy environment. For healthy environment we should plant more trees and avoid deforestation. Pakistan should implement valuable strategies and efficient policies to decrease the effects of global warming and greenhouse gases on environment. New and improvised ways should be developed for proper sanitation, cleanliness and clean water provision. /A better procedure should be followed for disposal of toxic waste materials released by industriesand for the disposal of wastes from houses, streets and institutions. Pakistan should utilise its resources to remove poverty and make economy of Pakistan better day by day. All these actions are to be taken not only by the government, but every individual should put forward his efforts to minimise the risks and further degradation of natural resources."
