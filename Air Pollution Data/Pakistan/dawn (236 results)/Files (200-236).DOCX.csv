"'Karachiites are victims of tussle over power, city resources'"," The prolonged war over power and resources has left Karachiites in unending pain and misery as civic conditions of the city are getting worse with each passing day. Only good governance can save Karachi./This was stated by speakers at a seminar titled 'The priorities and solution to the festering civil problems of Karachi' organised by Karachi Citizens' Forum (KCF) at PMA House on Friday./In her opening remarks, KCF convener Nargis Rahman regretted failure of successive governments to transform Karachi into a liveable city despite announcing ambitious projects./'They were [talking] about making Karachi the envy of South East Asia, a smart city for tourists. Budget allocations were made and large sums were also borrowed from international donor agencies, but little materialised,' she added./Despite massive budget allocations, Karachi is still an unliveable city, seminar told/Karachi, she pointed out, over the past few years had degraded in international indices and become one of the most polluted cities in the world./'There is little realisation that more people are dying in the city from diseases caused by air pollution than Covid-19.'/Seasoned architect Arif Hasan, also a keynote speaker, said main problems of the common people in Karachi were scarcity of water, blocked drains, undeveloped coastal belt and delay in the Malir Expressway Project./'The K-4 project is not the solution to Karachi's water issues and the authorities should find out new ways to overcome this problem in consultation with stakeholders,' he noted./The continued water scarcity, he told the audience, had led to an alarming drop in groundwater levels that had gone beyond 2,800 feet as people's reliance on this water source had increased./Talking about poverty and housing, he said the poor were forced to put their lives in danger and build their homes alongside nullahs./'These slums are often destroyed by the government for completion of projects that see growth of new slums without any planning and facilities, where children are deprived of education,' he said./He was of the opinion that the government should develop vacant land in the city and use it for poor people's housing. He demanded that the government prepare proper housing policy for poor people and the elite should prepare a memorandum in this regard and submit it to the government./Former Karachi administrator Faheem Zaman Khan said the only problem the city faced was poor governance. 'There is a war of power between authorities. During the military rule, local governments were empowered but they were constrained to function in democratic set-ups. If we merge these institutions or bridge their differences, we can overcome the civic issues of Karachi.'/Senior economist Dr Kaiser Bengali said: 'We cannot achieve the goal of development unless there is coordination among institutions. There is an imbalance of power between local and provincial governments. Constitutionally, provincial governments are more empowered for local development works. Empowerment of local bodies can only be achieved through a constitutional amendment.'/Urban planner Farhan Anwar said it's unfortunate that in the last seven decades successive governments couldn't decide who was responsible for city's development work, often initiated without proper planning./The dispute among authorities over city's responsibilities had become more intense after the 18th Amendment, he added./Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro of PMA also spoke./Earlier, KCF deputy convener Dr S.M. Qaiser Sajjad welcomed the guests, while sharing concerns over the state of civic conditions of the city."
Fuel plant sealed for polluting environment," A tyre-derived fuel plant in Bun Bhola in Thatta Khalil union council was sealed by the local administration and health authorities after public complaints that the plant was polluting the environment and creating problems for the nearby population./The raiding team led by Assistant Commissioner Shahzad Mehboob found out that scores of workers were working without safety equipment and no fire safety arrangements were in place. Mr Mehboob said under law, consent from the local population was mandatory to set up a tyre-derived fuel plant./In response to a question, he said tyre-derived fuel was being used as an alternative to furnace oil./The owners of the plant were also issued notices, he said, adding that, 'the process of extracting fuel from tyres creates a foul smell and a gas is emitted during the process that may cause respiratory diseases among nearby residents.'/Local administration officials told journalists that action was taken against the unit because burning tyres for fuel releases large quantities of carbon, sulphur and dust pollutants into the atmosphere, many of which are carcinogenic./'The oil extracted from tyres was transported to industrial areas in Taxila and caused air pollution when these industrial units burned it. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has already issued directions to stop these tyre-derived fuel plants,' said Aftab Hussain - office bearer of a local NGO./Local residents, including Shahid Suleman, Waqar Khan, Zaki Abbas and Dr Ramzan Abdullah said serious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis and heart ailments were spreading in the area because of pollution and hazardous fumes emitted by these plants. Stone-crushing plants and other industrial sites have already made life in surrounding villages miserable because of the unchecked dust, smoke, noise and water pollution./This tyre-derived fuel plant was first sealed by the district environment department in March 2014 and later in May 2019, but resumed operations allegedly with support from officials concerned."
High court seeks marble city progress report," The Peshawar High Court has directed the provincial government to produce a report of progress on the establishment of a marble city in Buner district which, it claims, will help address environmental issues in the area./A bench consisting of Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Ijaz Anwar issued the order after several government officials appeared on the court's notice and said the government had been establishing the Buner Marble City for which over 1,000 kanals of land had been acquired./The industries secretary, commissioner of Malakand division and Buner's deputy commissioner appeared before the bench during the hearing into a petition of lawyer Shamul Hadi, who sought orders for action against marble units harming environment in the district./Officials promise early release of funds for Buner initiative/The officials said the government would release funds in near future for the proposed marble city./They claimed that the project would ensure the proper disposal of the waste generated by marble units and check environmental degradation in the area./The bench, which is called the green bench for dealing with environment-related cases, directed the government to submit its progress report providing details of the developments on the project./The next date of hearing will be fixed later./The present petition was filed by the petitioner over a decade ago and from time to time the court has been issuing different orders for addressing the environmental issues./In 2015, the court had ordered temporary closure of 45 marble units in the district for non-compliance with the environmental protection orders of the provincial Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)./The said marble units were involved in the poor management of effluent and thus, posing serious threats to the environment./The petitioner has said there're hundreds of marble units in Buner district that caused water and air pollution./He said in order to control environmental pollution in the district, the EPA had constructed a model of settling tanks in one of those units, while the rest were asked to replicate it./The petitioner, however, said several of the marble units had not followed the directives./He said that for the last many years, the governments had been announcing the setting up of the marble city but the project had yet to be executed./The petitioner said that it was need of the hour that the factories should build underground tanks so that the marble sludge did not flow into rivers and water resources would be saved from contamination./He said that currently, those marble factories had been directing contaminated water to streams and rivers, which polluted water./The petitioner said that water pollution also led to the spread of diseases in the area and affecting the quality of agriculture products./He requested the court to direct the relevant officials for the early establishment of the marble city to resolve the environmental issues."
Survey finds Korangi's air quality worst amongst city's districts," Air and noise pollution levels across the city, particularly in Korangi district, are worrisome and there is a dire need for urgent intervention to minimise their adverse impact on environment and public health, said participants at a consultative meeting held at the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) on Monday./The meeting on Karachi's air quality and noise levels was jointly organised by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) and KATI./Presiding over the meeting, Sepa director general Naeem Ahmed Mughal gave a presentation, highlighting the current status of the city's air quality index, particularly the concentration of PM2.5, and noise pollution levels./He shared figures of a survey conducted last year at 93 different locations of the city prior to the lockdown and said the overall city situation with respect to air quality, particularly PM2.5 concentration and noise levels, depicted a bleak picture./'Deteriorating air quality and worsening noise pollution would have direct impact on human health'/Referring to environmental quality standards, he said air quality and noise levels in most areas of the city were beyond permissible limits, which would ultimately have health implications, including respiratory diseases and lung cancer./'Deteriorating air quality and worsening noise pollution levels would have direct implications on human health, particularly on vulnerable groups,' he said./The findings of the survey, he said, showed that Korangi was the worst district in terms of deteriorating air quality. 'The list also includes some spots in the city, particularly the main traffic corridors, including the one in the area of Liaquatabad 10. The air quality index in these areas was found to be far beyond the permissible limits,' he noted./The Sepa director general further shared that noise pollution levels in almost all districts were beyond permissible limits except in district South./Suggesting ways to tackle the problem, KATI president Saleem-uz-Zaman urged Sepa to pursue a policy for importing electrical vehicles as, he said, Pakistan had electricity in surplus./'This would help reduce air pollution since vehicles are the main contributing factor to air pollution,' he told the audience./Dr Zafar Fatmi, representing the Aga Khan University, floated the idea of a pollution-free Korangi as a pilot project, which later could be replicated on a mass level in the city. He described the different modalities in that regard./Environmental consultant Jahangir Asad underscored the need to ascertain the sources of pollution, which required detailed monitoring of air quality and noise levels in the city./Senior environmentalist Shahid Lutfi shed light on the ambient air quality management and suggested strategies to curb air pollution. He also emphasised the need for redefining Sindh environmental quality standards with respect to different sectors./'For the betterment of the environment, we need a sustainable mechanism for air pollution management,' he recommended./Concluding the meeting, Sepa director general spoke of the agency's commitment to the environment despite having limited human and financial resources./'The department is trying its utmost to improve air quality and noise pollution levels in the city. It has increased its monitoring activities as well as focusing on mitigation strategies. What, however, we need is cooperation from all stakeholders.'"
CLEARING THE AIR: THE INDO-PAK BATTLE TO BREATHE," In early November, 10 kilometres from the border with Pakistan, Shinda Singh stood at the edge of his field in Bhura Kohna village in Indian Punjab, watching it spew columns of black smoke into an already hazy sky./Just the day before, he'd finished harvesting his rice crop, leaving behind clumps of straw-like stubble a foot high. That morning, he had poured kerosene across his land and set fire to it. Within an hour, most of the stubble had caught fire, turning it from yellow to a deep, charred black./His eyes stung in the smog, but he felt no remorse. After all, what choice did he have?/Across the border, in the village of Sirhali Kalan, the fires abated days ago. In Pakistani Punjab, the agricultural cycle is roughly two weeks ahead of the one on the Indian side. But even when you can see evidence of the burning of crop residue - that tell-tale blistered stubble - no one will admit to it. Only 'outsiders' burn their fields, the villagers insist./Year after year, Indian and Pakistani politicians blame crop-burning across the border for the crisis of air pollution in their countries. Research has busted this myth, but the lack of free-flowing information between the two states makes it easy to spread misinformation. Can cross-border collaborations between citizens help clear the air?/Last year, the mosque broadcast reminders from the pulpit: crop burning is banned under provincial law, with penalties of up to 50,000 Pakistani rupees and possible imprisonment. In Indian Punjab, in 2019, officials tried a different tack: they offered compensation to farmers who did not burn crop residue, about 2,500 Indian rupees per acre for expenses incurred in manually clearing the land. And yet, by November 15, the state had recorded 74,000 incidents of stubble burning for the season - the highest number in four years./In recent years, the field on fire - an intuitively horrifying image - has become the face of air pollution in the Subcontinent, and Punjab, on either side of the India-Pakistan border, an easy scapegoat. Most experts will tell you, however, that it is not the main cause of the problem. Farmers on both sides of the border say this too, a knowledge borne from instinct. Crop burning, after all, is not a new phenomenon; at the very least, it predates the occurrence of smog in Punjab: a portmanteau of smoke and fog, increasingly described as 'a fifth season' in the region./Air pollution is a year-round problem. Smog is seasonal. It is the result of a temperature inversion in the Punjab plains during winter: cold air, trapped under warm air, prevents pollutants from dispersing into the wider atmosphere./First coined in the late 19th century to describe low-hanging pollution smothering London - the result of burning coal - the smog of today is different. Photochemical in nature, it is produced when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides - from car exhausts, coal power plants and factory emissions - and at least one 'volatile organic compound,' released from gasoline, paints, many cleaning solvents and open fires./When sunlight hits these chemicals, they form airborne particles and ground-level ozone. The ozone layer high up in the atmosphere protects us from ultraviolet radiation, but ozone close to the ground can damage lung tissue, irritate eyes and endanger people with respiratory illnesses such as asthma./The farmers in Punjab do not dispute the existence of smog. They feel it. One farmer in the Pakistani district of Kasur describes how, on smoggy days, it feels like someone is rubbing chilies in your eyes. Gurcharan Singh, in the border village of Nurwala on the Indian side, says that, during November and December, it became so difficult to see clearly that accidents occurred. Ghulam Mustafa, on the Pakistani side, says there were days when it felt as if the sun had set at noon, light so scarce it was affecting crop height and yield./Jagwant Singh, aged 46, is a farmer in the Indian village of Mastgarh, but his family owns land - a total of 12 acres - on both sides of the border. The days he crosses over to tend to his fields in Pakistani Punjab are anxiety-ridden. He sleeps fitfully the night before. Some days, the border guards ask him to remove his shoes to check for packets of drugs. On other days, Singh readies everything only to find the border gate closed. After the militant attack against Indian security forces in Pulwama in February 2019, the gates were closed for months, causing massive crop losses for many farmers./The time that Jagwant Singh spends in Pakistan, however fleeting - he reaches his land by noon and must leave by 3pm - has made him more attuned to the transborder nature of smog than most. Crop-burning, he notes, is common among poor farmers on both sides of the border. And yet, every November, the smog crisis devolves into a well-practiced blame game: Pakistani ministers attribute poor air to farmers burning stubble in India, while their Indian counterparts hurl the accusation back at farmers in Pakistan - or, occasionally, China./In 2017, Shehbaz Sharif, then chief minister of Pakistani Punjab, wrote a letter to his Indian counterpart, Amarinder Singh. Sharif expressed his belief 'that it is in the interest of the people of both Punjabs to make a collective effort towards identifying technologies and business methods that may eliminate the need to burn rice-stubble and help control smog formation.'/The letter was interpreted in a variety of ways, depending on who was reading it. Some saw in it an explicit acknowledgment of air pollution as a shared, transborder crisis. Others read it as a political attempt to position stubble-burning - specifically, stubble-burning in India - as the central cause of a complex problem. Whatever the intent, the letter never received a response./The focus on crop-burning in the discourse on air pollution in South Asia has ebbed slightly in the past two years after a report by the American think tank RAND Corporation concluded, using NASA data, that, while fire activity is more prevalent in Indian Punjab during winter months, it is not scientifically possible, given atmospheric patterns, for smoke in India to carry to Pakistan./What hasn't changed, however, is the seasonal nature of coverage of the topic: because the effects of air pollution are most visible in the form of winter smog, the crisis usually only receives attention between November and March. Moreover, macro-level myth-busting of the sort put forth by RAND is rare, in large part because information - comparable data, transborder research - does not flow freely between India and Pakistan./At the moment, exchange only occurs in fits and starts and in piecemeal form: on WhatsApp groups of concerned citizens residing in either country, and at occasional meetings between researchers at conferences in some third country./Given the dimensions of the crisis, these efforts are not enough. After all, more than 500,000 Indians and Pakistanis die every year due to air pollution. Ninety-one of the 200 most polluted cities in the world are located in South Asia, and Delhi and Lahore rank highest in terms of air toxicity among the globe's megacities. Bad air is a shared existential threat for Indians and Pakistanis (new research shows it may even be linked to greater Covid-19 mortality). A small but determined group of Indians and Pakistanis are working - separately and together - to push for change, hoping, in the process, to create templates for cross-border collaboration that are not necessarily beholden to changing political currents./In 2017, Abid Omar moved back to Karachi after five years abroad in Beijing. Living in China, he often circumvented the country's Great Firewall to access Twitter, which remains officially blocked there. In 2008, the US embassy in Beijing had installed a rooftop air-quality monitor and begun automatically tweeting out hourly data on the concentration of PM2.5 particles - among the most dangerous types of air pollutants./Omar recalled dark and overcast days in the city, the sun barely visible; the embassy data on Twitter warned him that the PM2.5 count was spiking, but when he would bring it up with his colleagues, they would look at him as if he were mad./He remembered them saying that it was just a beautiful foggy day./Those overcast days in Beijing reminded Omar of Lahore: how highways into the city would shut down on winter nights because of poor visibility, and flights would be frequently delayed. From what he remembered, this was not the norm even 10 years ago. Was it pollution? Was it merely fog? He wanted to know./In 2016, he bought a handful of low-cost air quality monitors and persuaded friends and relatives in major Pakistani cities - Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Islamabad - to keep them in their homes. The monitors went 'online' - that is, they began reporting air quality data - in early 2017. What motivated Omar, who is primarily a businessman and was still living abroad at the time, was that he saw the role of public data - including from the US embassy in Beijing - in galvanising ordinary Chinese people to pressure their government to monitor and subsequently address air pollution in their cities./As he began collecting data, Omar approached journalists, both local and foreign, hoping to raise awareness - but initially he had little luck. 'A lot of journalists told me the numbers had to be world-record shattering for it to be reported as news,' Omar recalls./By the time winter rolled around, the situation was bad enough that the world was taking notice. The environmental lawyer Rafay Alam - one of the 'hosts' of Omar's monitors in Lahore - petitioned the Lahore High Court to step in. The court set up a commission to look at the sources contributing to smog and find ways to mitigate the problem./'This little monitor became quite famous,' Alam says, laughing. 'It was entered in the court record, it appeared in the papers.'/Compared to Pakistan, air monitoring in India is relatively more advanced and widespread. Ronak Sutaria is the founder of Respirer Living Sciences, a real-time air quality monitoring startup based in Mumbai. His company has installed about 500 low-cost sensors across India to monitor ambient air quality and understand long-term pollution trends. There are numerous other initiatives of this kind too./But, Sutaria points out, there is very little on-the-ground data on air quality in rural India. Research using satellite imagery and other sources has confirmed that rural air pollution is a severe problem too, especially across the Indo-Gangetic plains. Besides outdoor pollution from such things as burning agricultural waste, another major factor in rural areas is indoor air pollution, caused by wood-burning stoves - and women suffer the most from it./Sukhwindar Kaur, a 65-year-old resident of Rodawala Khurd village in Indian Punjab, is so accustomed to breathing in the smoke from her stove that she scarcely notices it. Though her family bought a cooking-gas cylinder in August 2019, it lay covered by a tarp near the entrance of her home. Her husband owns a small plot of land 1.5 acres in size, where they grow only enough rice and wheat to feed their family of eight./To supplement their income, her husband works as a porter at the Indian border, carrying sacks of goods that come from Pakistan, to make 200 Indian rupees a day. To refill the gas cylinder would cost 670 Indian rupees each month and, so, like most families in the village, they continue to cook with wood./'I have spent my whole life using this kind of stove,' Kaur says. 'How can I say now that it causes me any difficulty? Of course, if the cylinder were cheaper then I would prefer to use it.'/For now, concerned citizens like Sutaria and Omar are doing what they can in the cities at least. In 2019, the two happened to attend a workshop together in Kathmandu. Realising that air quality is still difficult to compare across their two countries, the two decided to conduct a pilot project, installing air quality monitors of the same kind on both sides of the border./Even this relatively straightforward initiative had to contend with geopolitical hurdles: it is prohibitively complicated to ship anything directly from Mumbai to Karachi./For this and other reasons, Sutaria believes citizens' initiatives like this are ultimately limited in their impact. 'A lot of data- and knowledge-sharing can happen if the right government bodies are mobilised,' he says. 'Citizen initiatives can, of course, happen independently of government work. That can have an impact, but it will take much longer.'/Those initiatives also include collectives of concerned urban mothers on either side of the border - Facebook groups Warrior Moms in India and Scary Ammi in Pakistan - that are attempting to start a conversation about the lack of clean air for their children. While both groups have managed to create a sizable following on social media, translating that mobilisation into change on the ground has proven difficult in both countries. And the coronavirus pandemic has made it even tougher to galvanise action on this issue./'Everytime I approach the government, they say, we're on an emergency footing,' Ayesha Nasir, who launched the Ammis Against Smog campaign in Lahore in 2019, says. 'And obviously I understand - people are dying, hospitals are overwhelmed, we're running out of ventilators. To go and talk about smog seemed insensitive. I mean, smog is killing us, but it's killing our tomorrow. Corona is killing us today.'/Other activists in Pakistan complain that government officials spend far too much time trying to undermine their work, and precious little addressing the issues they point to. Last November, for instance, the country's environmental protection agency circulated a video on WhatsApp, demonstrating that steam scrambled the readings on the low-cost sensors that Alam and others have been using to track air pollution./The intended implication, it seemed, was that these devices could not be trusted. 'As of the last year and a half, there's a hundred-thousand-dollar monitor in Lahore - and that reports even higher air pollution,' Alam says. He is referring to the reference-quality monitor installed on the rooftop of the US consulate in Lahore in 2019 - a replica of the initiative in Beijing, as part of a US government push for 'green diplomacy.' 'I feel like we're those mice in a lab - running but not going anywhere,' Alam says./The environmental agency itself has only three monitoring devices for the entire province of Pakistani Punjab, says Alam - one of them stationed at Wagah, to closely monitor the air over the border-crossing with India./In April 2015, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck central Nepal, killing nearly 9,000 people and destroying nearly all the coal-burning brick kilns in the Kathmandu Valley. When the kilns were rebuilt, they adopted a new design, employing 'zigzag' technology. This allows for more efficient burning of coal, and reduces pollution output by around 60 percent, according to experts at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development [ICIMOD]./What hasn't changed is the seasonal nature of coverage of the topic: because the effects of air pollution are most visible in the form of winter smog, the crisis usually only receives attention between November and March./ICIMOD, based in Kathmandu, works in countries all along the arc of the Himalayas, including Pakistan and India. It had spent years trying to convince brick kiln owners in Nepal to transition to zigzag technology, but it was only with the earthquake that it made headway./Bidya Banmali Pradhan, who leads ICIMOD's work on atmospheric and air pollution, says the organisation reached out to kiln owners in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, invoking Nepal's example. Rather than hearing from activists, it was the positive experience of their Nepali peers that convinced many to adopt zigzag technology too. Now, Pradhan says, kiln owners across South Asia exchange notes and share ideas on an active Whatsapp group./Governments in both Punjabs have now mandated the use of zigzag technology, with penalties and indefinite closures for any kiln owners who refuse. For 27-year-old Kumar, a wiry young man from Uttar Pradesh who has been working in brick kilns in Indian Punjab for the past six years, the new technology has meant his face and arms are no longer constantly covered with fine black powder from the coal fires./In winter seasons past, Kumar's throat would itch from inhaling thick black smoke all day; invariably, he would develop a cough. 'Earlier the work felt very dirty,' he says. 'Now this is clean, dignified work.'/On the Pakistani side, as in India, the smoke stacks that punctuate rural farmland are now emitting dainty plumes of white smoke. Others stand dormant. At a kiln along the motorway in Kasur, owner Mudassir Ali has switched over to zigzag, he says, but he knows many others that cannot afford to. They fire up at night, he claims, when the tell-tale black smoke from their kilns blends into the night sky./Pallavi Pant, a scientist based in Boston who studies the health implications of particulate matter and also tracks public engagement on the issue of air pollution, says the proliferation of zigzag technology is a good example of effective information-sharing across the region./Not all trends are positive, however: she worries, for instance, that other countries may copy India's enthusiastic embrace of the 'smog tower,' a structure designed as a large-scale air purifier that experts rubbish as a pseudoscientific waste. 'It's become a nuisance, this idea,' Pant says. 'The concept just can't work outdoors, in the open air, and the concern is that it might take away from other initiatives trying to reduce emissions at source.'/Delhi inaugurated its first such structure in January last year, mere months after a panel decided the city's notorious air pollution could be combated by erecting 231 smog towers. By November, Lahore announced it would install 15 smog towers./'One thing that's getting a little lost in translation,' Pant says, 'is that we see people demanding we monitor air pollution, everywhere and all the time, but there's relatively little thought put into how we will use this data, what the quality is. There's higher priority given to technological solutions - we'll install all these fancy sensors, we'll have all this data - but then you don't know what to do with it./'People are catching on now, though: they're saying, okay, we want you to monitor the air quality - but then we want you to use that data to see if your actual interventions are working.'/For the past 60 years, the governments of India and Pakistan have been exchanging information on another shared resource: water. The Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank and ratified in 1960 by Jawaharlal Nehru and Ayub Khan, allocates 20 percent of the water that flows through the Indus and its five tributaries to India, while allowing Pakistan to retain rights over the remaining 80 percent. It is often pointed out that, despite multiple military conflagrations, India and Pakistan have not engaged in any water wars since the treaty was signed, opting instead for legal redressal within the framework it defines./The Indus Waters Treaty is often touted as one of the most successful water-sharing endeavours in the world, and one of the few examples of India-Pakistan collaboration - yet numerous observers are leery of holding it up as a template for tackling the issue of air./'It's not an example,' the environmental lawyer Rafay Alam emphasises. 'I think it was sold to us as a successful treaty because it was a World Bank product … and you're not going to have admissions of failure on their part./'With the construction of environmentally destructive hydropower plants and replacement canals,' he explains, the treaty 'has created incredible wealth inequities, monopolies and political instability, alongside damage to the ecosystem.'/The treaty's mechanism for conflict resolution is not worth emulating either, Alam argues. It comprises a number of distinct procedures: 'questions' are handled by a permanent Indus Commission; 'differences' are to be resolved by a neutral expert; and 'disputes' are to be referred to a seven-member court of arbitration./A current point of contention is India's construction of the Kishanganga and Ratle hydroelectric power plants on the Jhelum and Chenab Rivers. Pakistan wants to set up a court of arbitration to resolve the matter; India wants to appoint a neutral expert. 'The treaty isn't working,' Alam says. 'The two parties can't even decide where to disagree.'/'The thing is,' says Shazia Rafi, president and convener of the international advocacy group Air QualityAsia, 'our governments have already made commitments to improving air quality in two agreements: the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which aren't legally binding, and the Paris Climate Agreement, which we've ratified. Those targets are very clear.'/Other platforms for state-level cooperation include environmental mechanisms under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the ponderously named Malé Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and Its Likely Transboundary Effects for South Asia, a ministry-level regional agreement that includes India and Pakistan./'While the agreement is still there, it is a bit dormant,' Pradhan admits. 'I think if we could revive and really try to work towards it, this is a very good platform, not only for Pakistan and India but the whole of South Asia.' It is worth noting, however, that the Malé Declaration is not legally binding, and includes no accountability stipulations or mechanisms./There are some promising precedents for regional air quality treaties in other parts of Asia - for instance, the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, ratified by all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - but most observers are not optimistic about something similar for South Asia./The ASEAN agreement works, observers say, because it involves several countries of comparable economic size that, crucially, are not mired in the same level of political animosity prevalent between many South Asian governments./When it comes to India and Pakistan, Rafi says, even if there is air pollution that crosses over from one country to another, it may be more fruitful for each country to focus on reducing emissions originating at home. 'And to rely on the thought - it's a difficult thought - that within, say, India, there's enough pressure from their own citizens for a reduction in their air pollution levels. That is the better model.'/Brick kilns and crop-burning, Rafi adds, are low-hanging fruit. More than 40 percent of urban air pollution is the result of using poor fuel, particularly in the transport sector. As of 2021, the Pakistani government has banned imports of diesel that falls short of the Euro-V standard - though not out of environmental concern, but because the country's main diesel supplier, Kuwait, ceased production of lower-standard diesel altogether. There have also been efforts towards promoting electric vehicles, in order to further reduce emissions./'I think there's been further movement on the Indian side in this regard,' Rafi, originally from Lahore and now based in New York, says. 'There's been a much more active civil society working on environmental issues there, and a fairly robust business sector that's seen a business opportunity in both the electric vehicle and the renewable energy market. So they are moving faster. But India has already invested decades into coal plants and pulling back has its own costs. We haven't gone too far down that road.'/Rafi continues, 'What we need is a combination of civic and legal activism that says, here is what is being promised at the global level. The governments' first question is going to be, where will the money come from to transition - and our answer to that is, the money is already leaking out of your GDP./'In the US, enforcement was the result of lawsuits against polluters. It didn't happen through government subsidies - businesses have already invested in equipment, in producing without emission filters. They're not going to transition just because their heart tells them to.' But, Rafi warns, 'court cases take a long time, penalties take ages to enforce. It took the US 30 years. We don't have that. We have less than five.'/In February, long past crop-burning season, after the government said that more than half of local brick kilns had converted to zigzag technology, smog descended upon Lahore once again. Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, Pakistan's then federal minister of science and technology tweeted, 'Primary reason for fog in Lahore is burning of agricultural waste in East Punjab'- that is, Indian Punjab. 'Evidence of this fact is meters show air at Wahga is much more polluted than Lahore city.'/Hussain added that his ministry 'is planning to install fog towers in Lahore to reduce smog,' and promote electric vehicles 'to help in [the] long term.' It was a triple whammy: misinformation, bad science and poor priorities, all rolled into one./'We are back to zero point,' a member of a WhatsApp group of concerned citizens declared.

Brick-kilns in Punjab shifted to zigzag technology: PM's aide," Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Mailk Amin Aslam on Sunday said all brick kilns in Punjab, which accounted for a significant portion of choking air pollution, have been shifted on zigzag technology./He described it as a move that will significantly help mitigate the province's air pollution woes./According to a press statement issued by the Ministry of Climate Change, 7, 896 traditional brick kilns, which ran on smog-causing fossil fuels, in the province had been converted in a period of six months to the environmentally-smart zig-zag technology that would help reduce breath-choking carbon emissions by 60pc and save energy by 30pc./Mr Aslam, who pushed the province to switch to better environment friendly techniques, said: 'It's an important milestone the Punjab government has achieved in such a short period of time to fight spiking air pollution in the province.'/All other provinces, where air pollution has become a leading cause of premature deaths and various health diseases, should also follow suit to fight environmental degradation and protect public health, he added./There are around 20,000 traditional brick kilns in the country, which use mainly coal, rubber and shoe soles as fuel, emitting lethal back carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Most are located around urban areas and contribute significantly to air pollution. The country's brick sector is highly unregulated and uncoordinated but is responsible for around 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product./Mr Aslam said the traditional brick production consists of handmade bricks, which were baked in fixed chimney bull's trench kilns, a widely used brick firing technology in South Asia. It is ranked as the most contaminating technique for brick production, resulting in a myriad of adverse social and environmental effects including air pollution, climate change, cardio-respiratory diseases, land use impacts and deforestation./The traditional kiln type and fuels burned made it difficult to accurately identify the make-up of air pollutants emitted by the sector./They likely include sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), forms of particulate matter, including black carbon, and additional compounds released by burning coal and other fuels./The PM's aide said black carbon (a major component of soot from the brick klins) was produced as a result of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass. Besides, it is known for planet-warming impact on climate 460 to 1,500 times stronger than CO2./When accumulated on ice and snow, the black carbon was so adverse that it spiked both atmospheric warming and increased the melting rate, and hence was a threat to glaciers in the country's north, he elaborated./However, melting glaciers reduced dry-season water availability and exacerbate the risk of glacial lake outburst floods while increased climate variability and changes in rainfall and monsoon patterns could threaten regional water and food security as well as change the occurrence of landslides and floods, Mr Aslam remarked./He said given the backdrop, efforts were taken for introducing the zigzag technology to mitigate the issues of not only black carbons that caused black smog issues but also overall air pollution in the country under Prime Minister Imran Khan's vision for clean green Pakistan./'The incumbent government embraced zigzag technology-led brick kilns because it helps fight air pollution, save both public lives and the environment. Also, that these new kilns running on zigzag technology offer hope as they are environment friendly and make a strong business case, ' he added."
Brick kiln industry and air pollution," THIS is apropos the article 'Clearing the air: the Indo-Pak battle to breath' (April 25) which discussed three topics - crop burning, brick kiln industry and Indus Waters Treaty - in relation to their impact on the air quality of the subcontinent./Of the first two, which were dubbed as low-hanging fruit, the brick kiln industry plays a major role in air pollution, particularly in Pakistan. There are more than 18,000 brick kilns in Pakistan, with about 90 per cent of them being in Punjab and Sindh, producing about 45 billion bricks every year, making it the third largest brick producer in South Asia, behind India and Bangladesh./Coal is a major source of fuel for brick kilns. However, mostly cheaper materials are used for firing the bricks, such as waste plastic material, discarded material of rubber and leather products as well as medical waste./Brick kilns emit various kinds of air pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, arsenic, chromium, lead and cadmium. These cause adverse effects on human health and contribute to the air pollution as well as to the long-term issues of global warming and climate change./Though there are strict directions of the Supreme Court of Pakistan to install environment-friendly zigzag technology in brick kilns in addition to a Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) crackdown on brick kilns causing environmental pollution in the province, ground reality suggests the level of environmental pollution is not going down./The situation paints a dismal picture and suggests that hardly five per cent or less of the plants have made the switchover, mostly in Punjab and Islamabad. The reluctance on the part of the plant-owners to go for zigzag technology in place of the traditional fixed-chimney Bull's trench kiln method stems from the possibility of incurring huge financial burden, despite the fact that the said technology is not only environment-friendly, but also process-efficient./When it comes to the problem of air pollution, exacerbated by brick kiln smoke in both Pakistan and India, 'crossing over from one country to another' is, technically speaking, not an authenticated statement owing to dual effect of the variable smoke chemistry and its characteristics as well as typical atmospheric systems and their limitations./The bottom line is that the functioning of unregulated brick kiln industry must be regulated for the greater good of all concerned, particularly in Sindh in terms of the boiler feed being cleaner fuel rather than the one that is a pollution-spreader."
Not a bad idea, THIS refers to the letter 'Electric vehicles may not be good' (April 5). The arguments made against the use of electric vehicles in Pakistan are not tenable. The writer claimed that the electricity loadshedding would increase./I wish to remind that there is no routine loadshedding as we have surplus power for quite some time now. This unutilised surplus power is costing the country dearly./The smoke emitted from diesel-powered vehicles causes air pollution which remains one of the biggest challenges for the country. The introduction of electric vehicles will go a long way towards eliminating or at least reducing the pollution level to acceptable standards.
Love of nature," HOW many of Pakistan's 225 million like to habitually connect with nature? Unsurprisingly, not many. Most of the urban population lives in man-made subhuman conditions while those in the villages lead a brutish life of want imposed on them by feudal leaders. Not being educated, people are unaware of their own rights, let alone the significance of the environment./Against this backdrop, to publish the magazine Wildlife  and  Environment with the avowed objective of creating awareness about nature is indeed a 'herculean task'. That is how the editor/founder of this quarterly, Khurshid Ali, describes his undertaking./The general indifference to the environment is something quite expected. And Khurshid Ali, to his credit, is not bitter about this oblivion. But his friends resent it. They call him an 'unsung hero' whose work is not acknowledged. Hence the failed 'promises of profits'. The fact is that true commitment is not valued in monetary terms./Khurshid Ali explains his unconcern for fame and money by saying that a love of nature has been in his genes. His family came from Amroha which was a centre of fruit and vegetable cultivation in India. On migration to Pakistan, they settled in Malir which was once the fruit basket of Karachi. In his youth, he had plenty of opportunity to soak in the beauty and calm of the environment./Human development needs an integrated approach./The magazine he launched in 1992 was his brainchild and he has done it virtually single-handedly on what amounts to a pittance. It is a labour of love. Before he starts work on an issue he sends out scores of emails requesting parties for advertisements. No one responds but he carries on with minimal support. His readership? Very 'specialised and influential', he says, mainly the establishment such as the navy, the army (at one time), some university libraries, etc./But any publication that draws its clout from such sources would inevitably face challenges of another kind. It cannot be critical of the hand that apparently feeds it. Small wonder that nowhere are the powers that be held accountable for the excesses, action and inaction that hurt the environment. The ills are identified clearly but it is left to the readers to guess who is at fault./As an environment magazine, this is an elegant and eclectic publication. It is informative, profusely illustrated, as it should be, and beautifully laid out but technology has played tricks by joining up words randomly./Khurshid Ali identifies a number of environmental ills that plague Pakistan, such as climate change and the melting of the glaciers, air pollution, the contamination of our rivers, water scarcity, deforestation, and so on. But there is no criticism of the official agencies. And this stance can be carried to extremes. Thus he defends the Arab sheikh's killing of 'a few' houbara bustards for sport although these birds are a protected species. He blames the critics of having 'a hidden agenda' of concealing the fact that the 'sheikhs of Abu Dhabi have spent billions of dollars on the uplift of the people of Cholistan. The Sheikh's Rehabilitation Centre isn't just an eyewash. It is something wholesome'./It may be so but many will ask why that would give the sheikhs the right to hunt down houbara bustards - at times in larger numbers than their permits entitle them to./The problem with this approach to the environment and wildlife is that issues are pigeonholed and there is no attempt to connect them. It is not a holistic perspective; it is one that finds little connection between the state of the environment and the Covid-19 pandemic or between the hunting of a 'few' houbaras by Arab sheikhs and the extermination of the species./But now it is better known that human developm¬ent calls for an integrated appro¬ach. The pandemic reminds me of Thomas Malthus and his Essay on the Principle of Population that he wrote and revised six times between 1798 and 1826. I reread it digitally when a reader reminded me of it. I had read it earlier in the population context. But it now appears to be equally relevant to the environment./Malthus believed that the population grows in geometric proportions when food production increases arithmetically. There comes a time when agriculture fails to sustain the population. Then a section of the population is reduced to poverty and is in distress. There comes a time when disaster and events such as wars, disease and food shortages reduce the population and restore the balance. The process keeps repeating itself./Were Malthus alive today, he would certainly have included the environment among the factors that sustain the human race. It is plain that man's abuse of the environment has reached the point of no return. The earth has reacted saying 'enough is enough'. We will have to wait and see at which point and how this struggle between man and the environment will end and the balance is restored."
"'Exercise, socialising help slow down Alzheimer's disease'"," While Alzheimer's disease can't be cured, the pace of the disease can be slowed down with the help of medication, exercise, creative work and positive social activities, said experts in an online seminar held recently in connection with World Alzheimer's Day./The event was organised by Aga Khan University's neurology section, part of the department of medicine./The speakers discussed ways to diagnose Alzheimer's, its treatment, care and side effects of its medication, emphasising the need for creating awareness of the disease./About the disease burden, they said about 50 million in the world and some 200,000 people in Pakistan were suffering from this disease./Explaining the disease, experts said Alzheimer's is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out simplest tasks, such as moving around, swallowing and feeding yourself./Citing some studies, experts shared that a slow decline in memory begins as early as age 30. In the case of Alzheimer's, however, the process is rapid, brain cells break down quickly and nerve connections in the brain are destroyed. As a result, health complications occur due to decline in brain function that led to death./Highlighting the role of family members in patient management, they said that they needed to be trained to help the patient who became inactive and completely depended on others as the disease entered its last stage./According to experts, while the exact causes of the disease are not fully understood, risk factors include air pollution, blood pressure, vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes, persistent lack of sleep, obesity, late sleep, depression and smoking./The diagnosis could be made with the help of a mini-mental test and a magnetic resonance imaging scan./The speakers included Dr Sara, Dr Abdul Malik, Dr Arif Harikar, Dr Sajid Hameed, Dr Mohammad Wase, Dr Bushra from Pakistan and an expert from India."
Punjab govt declares smog a calamity," As smog reemerges in the provincial capital and the city's air quality is declared 'very unhealthy', the authorities have woken up to the phenomenon and decided to take certain actions to control it./The US Consulate Lahore's monitor recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) score between 223 and 231 from 8am to 10am on Wednesday after which the quality improved slightly to 'unhealthy' levels by the night./Responding to the situation, the Punjab government declared the phenomenon a calamity and directed the administrative secretaries concerned, commissioners and deputy commissioners (DCs) to make concerted efforts for mitigation of this health hazard across the province. The DCs have already been delegated powers of the relief commissioner to take all necessary measures to control smog./Since at least 2014, smog has been a routine affair in the provincial capital from October to January. In November last year, smog levels reached hazardous levels in Punjab with Faisalabad and Lahore even topping the list of world's most polluted cities. Till February this year, Lahore was among the most polluted cities in the world with the city's AQI score exceeding 500 to hazardous levels./While the authorities are quick to point out incorrect readings by air quality monitors and stubble burning in Indian Punjab being behind the alarming smog levels, environmental experts stress that it's one of the causes, and not the only. Experts as well as UN and World Bank reports have placed the transport sector as the biggest contributor to pollution in Punjab, followed by the industry and agriculture./The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had been repeatedly instructed to contain crop burning, but the practice continues unabated as the government has been unable to ban it completely./Another measure the government has been struggling with is ensuring conversion of all brick kilns to zigzag technology. In the last few years, the government cracked down on kilns not converting to the new technology by ordering they be shut down for at least a month, however those efforts never produced the desired results as several kilns continued to operate./Punjab's Environment Protection Department also failed to follow the Smog Commission's recommendations from 2018 to procure the required number of air quality monitors./Experts had also expressed concerns over the lack of action on Punjab relief commissioner's recommendations in October 2020 to ban stubble burning, vehicle emissions beyond admissible limits, disallow industries without emission controls and brick kilns operating on the old technology by the end of the year. Except for ordering conversion of brick kilns to zigzag technology and imposing fines on polluting vehicles, the remaining recommendations were largely ignored by the authorities./The PDMA acknowledges that the relief commissioner had imposed a complete ban on burning crop residue and other such activities that may cause air pollution in the province. The Punjab Local Government Act 2019 also instructs all municipal authorities and waste management companies to ensure water sprinkling on roads, streets and construction sites producing fugitive dust./The PDMA also directs that only zigzag brick kilns are allowed to operate in the province and any violation is to be slapped with a fine of Rs50,000 to Rs100,000 under a Lahore High Court order. The court had also imposed a fine of Rs50,000 on any person caught in the act of stubble burning./It has asked the administrative secretaries concerned to issue strict directions to the respective field formations for making concerted efforts for smog mitigation and implementation of order of the relief commissioner./All the DCs have been requested to ensure implementation of the orders of the relief commissioner in letter and spirit. They have also been requested to exercise powers of the relief commissioner and impose fines as directed by the LHC on the persons involved in stubble burning./The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) director general has been requested to ensure strict action against the brick kilns violating rules as per the LHC and relief commissioner's orders./The activities causing air pollution have been identified as vehicles emitting visible smoke and pollutants falling into inadmissible limits; industries without emission control systems; stone crushers operating without wet scrubbers; burning of all types of solid waste, tyres, rubber and plastics; sale and use of sub-standard fuels; encroachments that cause hindrance to smooth flow of traffic; parking that may obstruct the traffic flow; activities without proper safeguards that contribute to generating fugitive dust; uncovered and open dumping/storage of construction material; and uncovered transportation of construction material like sand, soil and cement."
Air quality crisis and response of business," 'The air we receive at our birth and resign only when we die is the first necessity of our existence,' said an article in The Times Newspaper, in 1881./To have access to clean air is a fundamental right of every human being. Despite being a vital ingredient to life, concerns about inferior air quality have been around for decades without being taken seriously. Perhaps historically, the most documented air quality problem is from the United Kingdom during the 12th century. In 1273, a Royal proclamation was issued by Edward I to prohibit the use of sea coal in open furnaces because of the harmful effects to health from smoke emissions. In the subsequent centuries, however, little or no attention was paid to anthropogenic air pollution and its subsequent impact on human health and the economic costs associated with it./Interest in air quality in Pakistan increased when the urban smog and air pollution became so inferior one could visibly see its detrimental impact. Lahore, due to its landlocked geographical location, is submerged in smog from September to March, not only impacting the air quality but also restricting economic activity resulting in a huge financial loss./Higher levels of pollutants in the atmosphere also lead to temperature change that changes the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Direct emissions of air pollutants (eg, black carbon), or those formed from emissions such as sulfate and ozone, can also influence this energy balance./Pakistan ranks as the second most polluted country in the world with an average Air Quality Index of 153 in 2020, falling in the unhealthy category under the WHO guidelines/Pakistan ranks as the second most polluted country in the world with an average Air Quality Index of 153 in 2020 - falling in the unhealthy category under the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. A study conducted by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency with the assistance of the Japan International Cooperation Agency revealed that the inhalable suspected particulate matter was ten times greater than the WHO specified limits. Thus, climate change and air pollution management have consequences for each other. One does wonder, knowing all that we know, why is there is still a lack of action?/Unlike climate change, the air quality of a particular region is dependent on the local practices of air emissions, types of industrial and agricultural practices, and the geophysical conditions. Because in the short to medium term, bad air quality is the direct result of human activity around the local area making it easier to monitor and control. Therefore, theoretically managing air quality, identifying the source(s) of pollution ought to be the easier part. It is the unavailability of up-to-date air quality standards and lack of compliance with existing pollution control legislation that has gotten Pakistan to these current levels of air pollution./In a webinar hosted by the Pakistan Business Council on 'Business Leadership on Air Quality', existing environmental legislation was criticised for being archaic where the allowed limit for sulphate in petroleum is one of the highest in the world. These relaxed policies catered to the 90s where the ambient air quality was much better than what we have today./Suffice to say the legislation needs to be updated with stricter quality standards and mandatory reporting of emissions across all sectors. Unfortunately setting regulatory frameworks is as much technical as it is political in nature. All provinces have autonomy on how strict they want to be and what allowances they want to grant. The politics of it all, along with the real costs associated with changing policy standards, makes this task even more daunting. But it is very clear that in the long run the benefits of clean air far out way the initial cost of clean air policy change./Building on this, the private sector needs to work closely with their stakeholders in order to develop more effective and efficient programmes keeping WHO clean-air guidelines as benchmarks. Furthermore, private companies, public institutions, and sectoral experts can also play a role in this through their commitment to 'Race to Zero' carbon emissions. Some private sector companies in Pakistan have joined the Climate Ambition Alliance and have set science-based targets to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In this respect, businesses can lead the way in changing the course of our response to the air crisis by injecting a sense of urgency and encouraging other private companies to join in by showcasing that it is possible to be an environmentally responsible business while showing strong profits./Investors are interested to know which companies are likely to face reputational and compliance risks related to pollution, which are best prepared, and which are taking action. These practices can help a business find sustainable practices that translate to market advantages by enabling access to new capital, cost savings, and a better reputation - hence creating a clear business case for improving air quality."
CM to inaugurate open air theatre project next month," Chief Minister Usman Buzdar will launch the project for upgrade of the Open Air Theatre, Bagh-i-Jinnah, in the first week of November. The project would cost Rs300m. The open air theatre works under the purview of the Punjab Council of the Arts (PAC)./PAC Executive Director Muhammad Abrar Alam told Dawn actors, singers, instrumentalists, intellectuals and the people from different walks of life would be invited to the ceremony. He said the upgraded Open Air Theatre would have a new state-of-the-art complex, featuring a 200 seats hall, green rooms, make-up rooms, a shop for arts and crafts, a performing arts academy and a coffee shop. There would be art gallery for visual artists and the parking area, he said./'We have invited the CM for this grand, in a way ground-breaking ceremony, as the upgrade work would kick off after the ceremony,' he added./The PAC officials told this reporter that the summary for upgrade of the Open Air Theatre, an 81-year-old structure, having a great historical and cultural significance, was sent to the CM in January 2021 and later Rs300m funds were allocated for it./The Open Air Theatre was constructed in 1940 on the Greek theatre pattern and it had been central to the cultural activities since its inception. The theatre was constructed for stage plays and other cultural activities with the efforts of GD (Guru Dutt) Sondhi, the then principal of Government College Lahore./When asked when the PAC would hold Punjab level yearly talent hunt programme, Abrar Alam said a meeting regarding the programme was scheduled with the CM on Wednesday./'After the meeting, we shall announce the dates of the talent hunt programme, which would be held in all over Punjab,' he added./Anti-smog bodies: In compliance with the directions of the Punjab government, the Environment Protection Department (EPD) has notified district anti-smog committees all over Punjab under the convenorship of respective deputy commissioners (DCs) to combat the apprehended smog, Dawn has learnt./Sources in EPD Punjab told the Dawn on Tuesday that 36 committees have been notified in which a DC is a convener while the deputy director of the environment is the secretary and deputy directors of health, agriculture and local government, the secretary of the District Regional Transport Authority, and in charge of the security branch of police are the members of the committee./As per the notification available with Dawn, these committees will undertake prevention measures before and during smog, in addition to regular reporting to the Anti-Smog Unit of the EPD on a weekly basis./Talking to Dawn, EPD Secretary Syed Mubashir Hussain said that the committees would work in coordination to address the major issues which contribute to smog./Mr Mubashir added that the basic purpose of committees was to address every segment which played any role in smog, such as industrial pollution, brick kilns, smoke-emitting transport and stubble burning./Talking to Dawn, spokesman for the EPD Sajid Bashir said that so far dozens of factories, violating the air pollution PEQS (Punjab Environment Quality Standards) have been checked and their cases have been forwarded to the legal directorate for further action. Similarly, zero-tolerance policies have been adopted against the brick kilns that are not operating as per Zig Zag technology and dozens of FIRs have been lodged."
Weather warning as Karachi air pollution goes dangerously up," The city witnessed 'very unhealthy' levels of pollution in the air on Saturday, which the meteorological department said could continue for another day or two pushing health experts to warn that such weather conditions could lead to several infections and people should avoid exposing themselves to such an atmosphere to avoid 'lasting effects'./The US Consulate Karachi's Air Quality Monitor Feed posted multiple tweets on its social media platform and in the last tweet weighed air quality to 204 US AQI [air quality index] at 6pm in the city./Amateur meteorologists and officials said that it was the second worst air quality recorded in the whole country after Bahawalpur's where the air quality was recorded at 180 US AQI. The weather experts and officials termed it an impact of change in the wind direction and sounded confident that although it was unhealthy, it was not a new or any abnormal phenomenon./'It often happens whenever wind changes its direction,' said Sardar Sarfaraz at the Met office while explaining the reasons behind fresh weather experience for Karachiites./Health expert urges citizens to avoid exposure to dusty air/'You can call it hazy or dusty weather and there's a very obvious reason for such a trend. There's a high wind pressure from Afghanistan and Central Asia side that led to wind direction from northwest. Since that particular side has desert area of Balochistan's Chaghi, we see there're dust particles making it hazy and unhealthy.'/Not the smog seen in Lahore/Responding to a question about any comparison between the current weather conditions of Karachi and Lahore, which often witnessed unhealthy levels of pollution in the air mainly during the winter season, Mr Sarfaraz ruled out any parallels between the weather conditions of the two cities calling the current trend in the port city 'a temporary one'./'In Lahore, it's actually smog which affects the air quality index and the situation often turns worst,' he added./'That smog is basically emerges as combination of smoke and fog which ultimately creates that atmosphere which lasts several days and we often see it in winter in Lahore. But here it's not new whenever there's a change in the wind direction, the city witnesses such dusty or hazy weather conditions. It's a temporary thing and we hope it will be over within a day or two.'/Lahore in winter often witnesses worst air quality which normally stays from October to February in the Punjab capital when farmers are blamed for setting light to the remnants of their crops, producing smoke which adds to smog./The situation worsened in November 2019 when Lahore was spotted second after Delhi as the world's most polluted city on several major and globally recognised air quality ranking sites./Although the Met office forecast about the prevailing weather conditions may bring a sigh of relief to Karachiites, the health experts warned that even a temporary phenomenon of 'very unhealthy' air quality could leave a lasting effect./'So the best possible thing is that one should avoid exposure to such air,' said Dr Qaiser Sajjad of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA). 'We have already started witnessing rise in the number of patients of common cold and flu. For those who have to go outside for different reasons, mainly bikers, must take protection and keep their face covered. This weather condition can lead to rhinopharyngitis, throat infection, bronchitis and lungs infection. Those who suffer from nasal allergy should also take care of themselves in these weather conditions.'"
5 anti-smog squads formed to curb pollution in Lahore," The district administration on Saturday constituted five 'anti-smog squads' to monitor pollution levels in the provincial metropolis and take action against those contributing to the hazardous air quality index./Commissioner retired Capt Muhammad Usman issued the orders for constitution of anti-smog squads while presiding over a meeting at his camp office on Saturday. Deputy Commissioner Umer Sher Chattha was also present./Addressing the meeting, the commissioner said the anti-smog squads would comprise officials of the environment department, Metropolitan Corporation Lahore, Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), police, district administration and Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco)./The move came days after Punjab Minister for Environment Muhammad Rizwan, in an interview with a private TV channel, claimed that there was no smog in the province for the last two years./Teams authorised to seal industrial units, penalise violators of regulations/'I wanted to tell all my friends, including the journalists, that they do not know how to fix air quality monitors,' he said and added that the government was starting a plan to educate all the people about air quality./'The environment department recorded Lahore air quality index at 134 while Town Hall has 192 and Model Town 186,' he claimed./However, as opposed to the claims of the minister, DC Chattha issued a notification for forming anti-smog squads./According to the notification, available with Dawn, 'In pursuance of directions of PDMA wherein smog has been declared as calamity in terms of Punjab National Calamities (Prevention and Relief) Act 1958 and considering worsening situation of Air Quality index in Lahore, it is decided to make five special squads for 30 days to control smoke-emitting industries and to enforce Punjab Environment Quality Standards (sic)'./The deputy director (Environment) would be focal person of the squads and inspector (environment) would lead them. The notification further stated that every squad would visit 60 industrial (furnace/boilers) units in a week and seal the industrial units using substandard fuel or generating smoke. The squads would check the status of the pollution monitoring devices and compliances of Judicial Environmental Commission measures while those burning of solid/green waste would be penalised./The violation of building by-laws, misuse of water connection and electricity theft would also be inspected and those using substandard fuel and non-operative scrubbers and emission control units would be penalised./The commissioner said and 305 factories were using boilers and furnaces in Lahore and each squad must check 12 units per day and 60 units per week. He claimed two teams were taking action against smoke-emitting vehicles in the provincial metropolis./Mr Usman said a special squad would seal the industrial units using the substandard fuel or generating excessive smoke. He said seal breakers must be arrested and writ of administration should be established. He stressed that zigzag brick kilns must be rechecked and revisited./Environment experts Dr Javed Iqbal said air pollution was causing health issues and the citizens must use face masks and take other precautionary measures to remain safe from smog."
Smog: no end in sight," LAHORE and several other cities of Punjab are choking on smog, or winter air pollution. The provincial capital is especially suffering due to soot, dust and industrial pollutants trapped in the environment by the dropping temperature as it is being repeatedly ranked at the top of the list of the most polluted cities of the world owing to its hazardous air quality. Even though smog has become a regular feature of winter life in Lahore in recent years, the government has not taken consistent action to fight off what the WHO has termed as 'new tobacco'. Instead, we have recently seen provincial ministers refusing to even acknowledge the existence of the menace. Multiple factors such as the increase in polluting industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust and construction dust, as well as the burning of cheaper fuels and urban and agricultural waste have aggravated the problem in recent years./The government has responded with ad hoc actions to firefight the problem on a temporary rather than a sustainable basis. The utter failure of the administration to take durable measures to improve the air quality has inflicted severe, long-term harm on public health, putting people at greater risk for heart and lung diseases. For example, the authorities have achieved no success at all in dissuading growers from burning crop stubble, a major reason for the smog. A long-term, sustainable solution to the winter air pollution is not simple. It requires a massive and decisive shift in government policies, and in the way the private sector does business. While the government must tweak its policies and invest heavily in renewable energy sources and public transport systems in the cities, the private sector needs to realise its responsibilities towards society and adopt technologies to reduce its carbon emissions. That will not be possible unless the government takes the required action. If the government procrastinates further, citizens should have no qualms about coming together to demand immediate action on an ongoing serious public health issue."
No quick fix," MORE than once this season, Lahore has had the dubious distinction of topping the daily ranking of the city with the worst air pollution compared to other cities across the globe, as indicated by the environment think tank IQAir. Beating Shanghai and New Delhi, both of which are far larger in terms of population and geographical spread, is no mean feat. But, as has been the case for successive years during which the problem has exponentially been growing, this has left the authorities seemingly scrambling to offer defences. On Thursday, the Punjab IGP announced that over the year, his force had issued tickets to 40,618 'smoke-emitting vehicles' and detained 4,508 'others' in a province-wide crackdown to fight the problem. But in that very statement lies the rub: given that the stakeholders that have by now become involved range from the Lahore High Court to political party activists, the environment lobby, the media, and private citizens, there is no reason to believe that the umbrella accusation of 'smoke-emitting' does not enclose in its fold myriad other violations./This in itself demonstrates the problem with the authorities' efforts to fight smog in Lahore, an issue that first began to manifest itself before the turn of the millennium. Sporadic efforts are made now and then, such as in late November when the Punjab police registered cases against and imposed heavy fines on various industrial units under the anti-smog operation. But over two decades, no cohesive policy has emerged to counter what every citizen knows they will experience in winter. Each time, the authorities appear to be taken by surprise. Such patchy measures are doing nothing towards the resolution of a crisis growing in intensity. Cleaning up the air has to be a sustained, well-directed, and over-the-years effort. There is little that Pakistan can do about pollution-carrying winds coming from across the border. But at the very least it can make a sustained effort at getting its own house in some sort of order."
EPA finds air unsafe in some Peshawar areas," The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has found air quality in some parts of the provincial capital to be injurious to the people's health saying the particulate matter (PM2.5) has exceeded the permissible limits there./The EPA monitored the capital's air quality from Dec 29, 2021, to Jan 2, 2022, at the request of its KP counterpart, reveal the official documents./According to a report, during the air quality monitoring period, PM2.5 level constantly exceeded the NEQS limit of 55.3 to 220.8 (µg/m³) at all points, especially roadside locations./'Though it was not toxic, long-term exposure of citizens may cause health problems to general public,' said an official dealing with environment-related matters./He added that the concentration of PM2.5 up to 150 was acceptable but beyond that, it caused health issues./The report said in Peshawar, PM2.5 was generated and released by industries, vehicles emission, roadside BBQ and other seasonal factors such as biomass/agriculture burning said./Says particulate matter beyond permissible limits/It said the vehicles' emission was considered to be one of the major factors of PM2.5 in Peshawar./The number of vehicles in Peshawar has exceeded 774,961, including over 300,000 motorcycles and 30,000 rickshaws and taxicabs, according to the Development Statistics of KP 2020 report./The transport department said unregistered rickshaws in the capital totalled around 35,000./According to it, PM2.5 is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets that get into the air. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects./The provincial authority had conducted a survey in 2016 that revealed that the level of PM2.5 was four times higher in the air of Peshawar than the NEQS limit, which was alarming and recommended joint efforts to reduce the level of air pollution./The last report said vehicular emissions, waste burning, construction work, debris, dust, broken roads, poor collection of waste, smoke discharged from brick kilns were the main contributors to air pollution in the provincial capital./Officials told Dawn the JICA had donated three mobile air quality monitoring labs to the Pakistan under a project from 2008 to 2013. One of the labs was given to the Sindh government and one to Punjab, while the then KP government laid claim to the third one for Peshawar./However, it was given to Islamabad on the condition that it will facilitate the KP EPA when needed./The latest report said PM2.5 was the best indicator for health effects of the ambient air pollution./During the four days period, a mobile air quality monitoring station was placed in six different areas of Peshawar city, including Northern Bottling Company Limited (a franchise of Pepsi Cola), Hayatabad, ARAR Services Limited, Hayatabad, Peshawar Development Authority, Officer Club, Hayatabad,, Food Department (Haji Camp) GT Road, Environmental Protection Agency, SDU Building, Khyber Road, and NTFP forest department, Shami Road, Peshawar./It said the SO2 level was from 12.6 to 131.4 (µg/m³) exceeding NEQS at the food department, while the CO (carbon monoxide) levels also went up at the location./The report said the US EPA had defined the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide as/nine parts per million averaged over an eight-hour period, and that threshold couldn't be exceeded more than once a year or an area would be violating the standard./According to the air quality survey, the ozone level was satisfactory at 9.3 to 44 µg/m³ and that of nitrogen dioxide within the NEQS limit at all locations."
"11,000 brick kilns converted into environment-friendly technology in Punjab, says ministry"," All the 11,000 traditional brick kilns running on smog-causing fossil fuels in Punjab have been converted into the environment-friendly zigzag technology in six months./The new technology would help reduce carbon emissions by 60pc and help save energy by 30pc, said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Climate Change, Mohammad Saleem Shaikh./Talking to this agency, he said the zigzag kiln technology had been established to embellish fuel efficiency, energy savings and lessen emissions by 60pc compared to the traditional brick kilns./The remaining brick kiln owners, who have not yet installed the pollution control technology, have submitted affidavits with Pak-EPA Islamabad to convert their kilns into the zigzag technology./'Conversion of all traditional brick kilns to new technology in Punjab province has helped reduce air pollution by about 15pc,' he added./Other provinces should follow suit to fight environmental degradation, protect public health, says official/The spokesperson said converting the traditional brick kiln system to modern technology was a difficult task which required investment and training./He said many kiln owners were not ready to take the risk but efforts and hard work of their representative organisation helped improve about 11,000 kilns./Other provinces should also follow suit to fight environmental degradation and protect public health./There are around 20,000 traditional brick kilns in the country, which use mainly coal, rubber and shoe soles as fuel, emitting lethal back carbon into the atmosphere, he said./Most of them were located around urban areas and contribute significantly to air pollution./Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency Islamabad, the Environment Protection Department, Punjab and National Energy Efficient Conversation Authority (NEECA) are working closely with the All Bricks Kiln Owners Association of Pakistan to introduce the cost-effective brick kiln technology./The country's brick sector is responsible for around 1.5pc of the gross domestic product./The traditional brick production consists of handmade bricks, which are baked in fixed chimney bull's trench kilns, a widely used brick firing technology in South Asia, ranked as the most contaminating techniques for brick production, resulting in myriad adverse social and environmental effects including air pollution, climate change, cardio-respiratory diseases, land use impacts and deforestation./The traditional kiln type and fuels burned make it difficult to accurately identify the make-up of air pollutants emitted by the sector but they likely include sulphur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), forms of particulate matter (PM) including black carbon and additional compounds./Efforts were made a couple of years ago for introducing the zigzag technology to mitigate the issues of not only black carbons that caused black smog issue but also overall air pollution in the country under Prime Minister Imran Khan's vision for clean green Pakistan."
IUB to conduct research on air quality index," The Islamia University of Bahawalpur (IUB) has embarked upon a plan to conduct research on the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city./The research will be undertaken on the directive of the Higher Education Department (HED). IUB Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Athar Mehboob has constituted a five-member committee headed by Dr Ghulam Hassan Abbasi, Director Institute of Agro-Industry and Environment, to identify the reasons of poor Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city./Bahawalpur city mostly appears second only to Lahore in the list of the cities with the worst AQI in Pakistan. According to experts, while AQI up to 50 is considered satisfactory, Bahawalpur city's average was recorded around 150-200 on most of the days, which puts general public, especially the vulnerable groups such as the sick and the elderly, at a risk of contracting respiratory, cardiac and other diseases./Higher Education Department Secretary (South Punjab) Dr Ehtesham Anwar told Dawn that poor air quality index was a matter of life and death for the inhabitants of the city whose lives, with this level of air pollution, might get reduced by up to seven years./He was of the view that whereas the poor air quality index of Lahore could be attributed to certain identifiable factors such as overpopulation, vehicular traffic, industrial emissions, certain agricultural practices and more, the case of Bahawalpur was intriguing as none of such factors was much relevant in its case./He further said the university was going to acquire air quality sensors and other such equipment to scientifically research the phenomenon. Initially, the university would look into the veracity of the data and accuracy of the process through which it is being collected by the international agencies, and if the data is found to be correct, the underlying factors leading to such poor air quality would be identified for corrective actions./Dr Mahar further said even otherwise too the universities in south Punjab were being repositioned to act like think tanks on the pattern of developed countries where they would undertake necessary research and development in social, economic and other issues being faced by general public and guide the decision makers for appropriate policy formulation./IUB Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Athar Mehboob told Dawn that the committee so constituted was hopeful of the prospects of doing something in an area where other departments had not chosen to take any action yet on this important issue confronting the general public's health."
AIR POLLUTION," The poor air quality in metropolitan cities of Pakistan is causing health hazards. If the government fails to take action and ban polluting vehicles and factories, there will be a huge burden on the healthcare system because of respiratory diseases. The government should also apply the artificial rain procedure adopted by many countries, including China which is taking radical measures to control air pollution. The people, on their part, should grow more plants to lend a helping hand to the government in this regard."
Cardiac health," HEALTH organisations in many countries, especially in the United States, recognise February as the month of heart health awareness. The importance of heart health and significance of celebrating this month has been increased in the last few decades due to rising number of deaths resulting from cardiovascular diseases./Around 80 per cent of deaths are reported from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Heart Federation and the World Health Organisation endorse the month of heart health to bring forward accelerating factors for these non-communicable diseases and control them./The main risk factors for the heart are sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, smoking, and air pollution. Physical activity is a foremost step for strengthening heart muscles, controlling weight, and keeping away high blood pressure, cholesterol and elevated blood sugar which are the leading causes of heart attack and stroke. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week for a healthy lifestyle./The role of a healthy diet in reducing the risk of developing coronary heart diseases, diabetes, blood pressure and in controlling weight is imperative. A balanced diet is the only way to get all the nutrients necessary for growth and maintenance./Smoking is a primary risk factor for heart disease; one out of every five smoking-related death is due to heart disease. According to AHA, quitting smoking can reduce 50pc chances of repeated heart attacks and other heart ailments./Policy changes and public health actions by the government and private sectors are essential to create awareness for the masses to prevent heart diseases. Healthy physical activities and competitions, such as walking, running or cycling, should be promoted. Parks and community centres need to be equipped with exercising equipment to attract youngsters. A modified healthy lifestyle is the key to cardiac health./However, there is also a need for early screening of heart diseases for public, while dietary guidelines should also be provided to support cardiovascular health and general wellbeing at all socio-economic levels for a healthy Pakistan."
Uplift schemes worth over Rs500m okayed for Bannu," The district development committee (DDC) approved development schemes worth Rs547 million for Bannu on Wednesday./The committee met with Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Zubair Niazi in the chair. The meeting was attended by heads of line departments. It discussed a number of development schemes in different sectors and approved several schemes in irrigation, education, livestock and other sectors./An official privy to the meeting said that Rs33 million would go to irrigation sector and Rs15 million to traffic management plan. He said that government would spend Rs800 million on uplift schemes in education sector while livestock sector would get Rs20 million./He said that government would also spend Rs70 million under Janikhel package as per the promise made with local tribal elders./SEMINAR: Experts at a seminar said that owners of brick kilns should use modern technology to fight environmental pollution effectively./The seminar was arranged by environment department in Bannu city on Wednesday./Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) director general Mohammad Anwar Khan, deputy director Afsar Khan, regional director Zakir Khan, Prof Mehmood Ahmad Khattak, assistant commissioner Attaullah Khan and office-bearers of association of brick kilns owners spoke on the occasion./Speakers said that the new zigzag technology was eco-friendly and helped to reduce air pollution and respiratory disease. They said that government was making all out efforts to protect the environment./The office-bearers of the association asked the government to assist them in adopting the new technology./ARREST: Police have arrested scores of drug traffickers during an operation in parts of Lakki Marwat on Wednesday./An official said that police raided the hideouts of drug pushers in Lakki, Naurang, Tajori, Ghaznikhel and Pezu towns and arrested 38 drug peddlers./He said that police seized 23 kilograms of hashish, fie kilograms of heroin, 1,676 grams ice drug and 10 bottles of wine and two assault rifles and ammunition from the arrested men./The official said that the arrested drug traffickers were shifted to relevant police stations and cases were registered against them."
Toxic waste," PAKISTAN is advancing in research, science and technology. It has numerous laboratories dealing with biological, material and chemical stuff that often has hazardous substances. A significant amount of toxic waste containing acids, chemicals, grease and oils is being produced in these labs. This waste has occasionally been disposed of improperly that can damage the environment./Proper handling of laboratory waste is of core importance for environmental safety. Improper handling of such waste can cause water pollution and waterborne diseases as the pollutant enters the sanitation system. Moreover, it contributes to solid waste and air pollution. The liquid waste may block the drains resulting in sewage malfunctioning./The government should devise a national laboratory waste management plan to handle all waste produced inside the laboratories. A licensed disposal facility with proper transportation system should be employed for this purpose./Each category of waste should be addressed differently as per its packaging requirements. Well-labelled and leakage-proof containers should be placed inside each laboratory to collect waste separately. It will avoid intermixing laboratory waste with other waste materials./These containers, after having been properly labelled and sealed, should be transported from each laboratory to a temporary storage site. It should later be taken away by a licensed waste management agency for proper dumping./Prolonged storage of waste in residential areas should be avoided. All the managers and staff involved should be given proper training to reduce possible dangers. Documentation and record-keeping of waste should be encouraged./In a nutshell, proper waste management practices will be helpful in reducing pollution, conserving natural resources, and minimising environmental harm. It will also help us accomplish the targetted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
South Asia most vulnerable region to climate change: experts," Climate change experts on Wednesday said South Asia was the most vulnerable region to climate change and therefore collective efforts were needed to deal with threats posed by the changing weather patterns and increasing risks of natural calamities./They said this while sharing their views at a hybrid seminar titled, 'Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability: IPCC Working-II Report 2022 lessons and way forward for South Asia' organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI)./Senior economist and food systems specialist, livelihoodsfrom Nepal Dr Abid Hussain asserted that almost all the findings of the report were very relevant to the South Asia region./He was of the view that environmental sustainability was a cross cutting theme for all types of sustainability. Referring to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, he said 54pc of Pakistan consisted of mountainous areas and hence, inclusion of the mountains ecosystem in the report is of high importance for Pakistan./Climate scientist Dr Fahad Saeed highlighted that the IPCC report enforced the risk for South Asia as one of the hotspots./The report showed that water had been the most stressed resource which the climate change had ensued. Changes in climate have already impacted the lives of the people living on higher mountains, and mangroves in the coastal areas were also depleted./'Besides, climate change has triggered heat waves in urban areas and has been impacting food viability, and increasing incidence of diseases, such as dengue and malaria,' he said./Earlier, SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said governments and scientists need to dwell on the magnitude of the problem presented by the IPCC report./South Asia was first time declared as the most vulnerable to the climate change and with impacts so glaring on all aspects of life as this report has mentioned, he added./Director, Climate Action Network South Asia, Sanjay Vashisht, was of the view that the IPCC report says that climate change had already done substantial damages. Now is the era of adaptation and loss and damages control, where 50-75pc of the global population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions./The IPCC report says that by 2030 the number of people living below poverty line will increase manifold due to climate change./Chief Executive Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change Pakistan, Aisha Khan highlighted that the report covered all forthcoming impacts of the climate change and the needs for adaptation./'We need to create a synergy among the mitigation and adaptation plans and work as a partner in face of the climate change,' she added./Director WWF Pakistan Dr Imran Khalid suggested that the cross-cutting themes for the region like the air pollution and water should be dealt with on priority./Research Fellow SDPI Dr Hina Aslam informed the participants that energy transition laid at the centre of the climate change adaptation./Hydropower generation and cooling water demands have decreased, which critically analyses the impacts of climate change on the energy."
Pakistan Medical Association for steps to control air pollution," Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) has voiced concerns over the recently released World Health Organisation's (WHO) air quality database 2022 that shows that people around the globe are breathing unhealthy air./According to the report the particulate matter, PM10 and PM2.5, has raised six fold as compared to the data base 2011 which is very alarming./The report also shows the presence of soaring level of NO2, which is the outcome of burning of fossil fuel at high temperature./Particulate matters and nitrogen dioxide are able to travel deeply into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs and bloodstream can cause severe respirator, lungs, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and other diseases./According to a statement, PMA has been continuously raising its voice and demanding to take necessary steps to control environmental pollution in Pakistan to save the health of people./In this regard the Sind High Court has thrice ordered the authorities concerned to take immediate steps to overcome pollution but unfortunately nothing has been done to improve the situation./PMA Secretary General Dr Qaisar Sajjad said air pollution was a major problem confronting Pakistan, with cities like Lahore and Karachi ranking among the most polluted worldwide./'According to the latest global environment performance index (EPI), Pakistan ranks in the list of countries which suffer from poor air quality. This shows the poor environmental condition of country which is deteriorating day by day. The emission of carbon from vehicles, factories, generators and burning of garbage is polluting environment and making cities unliveable,' he said./'In Pakistan, one in 10 deaths in under-5 children is caused by air pollution. Due to this air pollution diseases of ear nose and throat (ENT) and chest are increasing geometrically including nasal allergy, sour throat, sinusitis, laryngeal cancer, nasal obstruction, bronchitis and lungs cancer./'To lessen our environmental issues we need to have a proper sewerage system. Hospitals and factories should properly dispose of their waste to prevent environmental pollution and serious health issues./'Proper areas should be allocated to throw waste. Untreated water should never fall into oceans, lakes and rivers. We need to plant more trees and conserve our forests./'Cutting of trees should be stopped to prevent air pollution, noise pollution, global warming and to reduce the sides effects of climate changes./'Forestation should be increased in cities which are overcrowded to prevent environmental pollution./'The laws regarding environment should be implemented strictly with letter and spirit,' Dr. Sajjad said."
Ministers set themselves lofty goals on first day at office," On their first day in office, a number of newly-minted federal ministers took charge of their ministries and set themselves lofty goals, which include addressing systemic issues related to law enforcement, climate change and social welfare./Nearly all of them, however, blamed the previous PTI government for mismanaging the affairs of the state and predicted a hard road ahead for themselves./But some tasks are more important than others, and this was demonstrated on Wednesday when Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, as one of his first acts in office, ordered the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) not to tolerate the defamation of individuals through social media and ordered them to strengthen the cyber crime wing and make it more efficient./The orders come on the heels of a social media campaign targeting the military establishment for not supporting Imran Khan's erstwhile government and siding with the coalition of opposition parties which now sits on the treasury benches./FIA ordered to crackdown on social media defamation; Ehsaas programme to be renamed 'BISP'/Following his appointment a day earlier, Rana Sanaullah had assured that the government would proceed by the book and would not implicate people in false and fabricated cases./The interior minister also received a briefing from Interior Secretary Yousaf Naseem Khokhar and issued directions to all concerned officials to ensure durable peace in the country. He also asked for the establishment of a coordination mechanism between the centre and the provinces so they could keep a track on the law and order in all parts of the country./Rana Sanaullah stressed that protecting the lives and property of the people should be the government's primary responsibility, adding that the present government would make all-out efforts to address their problems them on priority basis./He claimed that in the name of change, the previous government had destroyed all national institutions by adopting flawed policies and regretted that its leadership had continuously lied to Pakistanis for more than three years./A change of climate/At the headquarters of the Climate Change ministry, Senator Sherry Rehman regretted that Pakistani cities ranked highly on the air pollution score in the world, where one in ten deaths amongst children under five were caused by air pollution and 128,000 people died from airborne particulate matter yearly./Speaking soon after taking office, she listed the problems facing Pakistan: 'As much as 80 per cent of the urban population lacks access to clean drinking water. We need to rethink our policies and coordinate priorities quickly.'/Outlining her priorities, the ministers said: 'First and foremost, a policy roadmap beyond planting trees is needed... Our population needs to be made aware of the ever-increasing danger we face at the hands of climate change.'/'Pollution of our water and air, temperature rise, have caused incalculable costs to the country, to its soil, to its people and exposed us to disease and vulnerability,' she said./The minister pointed out that while Pakistan contributes only 6 per cent of the world's emissions, yet it is one of the countries consistently ranked amongst the most vulnerable to the harmful effects of climate change./When speaking about the water crises she stated, 'Pakistan is primarily dependent on the Indus River system which supports 90 percent of the agricultural industry. It is immensely affected by climate change, resulting in frequent flooding. We rank third in the number of countries facing severe water shortages. Our four major crops such as cotton, wheat, sugarcane and rice are all water-dependent.'/Restoring BISP/Over at the offices of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Minister Shazia Marri, the PPP loyalist declared that the federal government had decided to change the name of the Ehsaas Programme to the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) - the original moniker for the famed social welfare programme first launched by her party's government./She said that it was only due to the PTI's ill-intent and an attempt to avoid recognizing former prime minster Benazir Bhutto that the name change had been made./It is worth noting that the PTI government had introduced the Ehsaas Program and BISP was made one of its components./However, the PTI government also expanded the Ehsaas Program and various sub programmes were started under this banner, such as Ehsaas Kafaalat programme, the undergraduate scholarships programme, a school stipend scheme, the Rehri Baan initiative, panagahs (shelter homes) and the Ehsaas Koye Bhooka Na Soye programme etc."
"Punjab notes: Early summer: water, birds and animals"," We humans have been hunting birds and animals since time immemorial. In the primeval forests they were found in larger number than homo sapiens but now their number seems to have quite dwindled./Increased human population, advances in technology and socioeconomic system based the notion of consume more triggered a process of destruction of nature sanctioned my religious, metaphysical and legal superstructure. A visible result is that our current world with its remaining species of birds and animals is like the unknown soldier described by poet Brecht: 'But when we had killed him / We handled him in such a way that he lost his face under the marks of our fists / This was how we made him unrecognizable...'./Like the battered unknown soldier our earth has become unrecognisable. But by eliminating other species from the face of earth, we risk life and limb. The planet isn't meant for our comfort alone as we erroneously tend to think under some ill-conceived ideological constructs. It's a hugely complex and delicately intricate network of interconnections that sustains life in all its forms. Man is not nature's preferred creature. It's indifferent to his destiny. It is concerned to protect or destroy what it creates and surely punishes those who upset its balance by interfering in it for their exclusive advantage./When we weren't too many we understood better the organic links that existed between things, animate and inanimate. We were less powerful but more humane. Remember Valmiki? He is highly venerated as Adi Kavi (the first poet/ the immortal poet). He is the author of one of the most revered poetic compositions known as Ramayana./Valmiki went to have a dip in the river and saw a pair of mating cranes singing by the river. A Nishada hunter came and killed the male. The hen cried in pain when she saw her mate wreathing on the ground in agony. Valmiki was overwhelmed by his feelings of compassion. He thought that it was against Dharma to kill a bird without rhyme or reason. He muttered imprecations and said that the hunter would never have peace since he had killed the male crane at the height of his desire. We kill, for example, thousands of Siberian cranes every year with no fear of being cursed. So anthropocentric we are in our ignorance. Cranes land here at the start of winter and get shot down but now we have summer with its scorching sun and sizzling air. The landscape is bone dry, the colour of white heat. Rivers and streams have nearly gone dry. Small ponds and lakes have a look of ugly mud after losing stored water to relentless evaporation. One can see birds falling; dehydrated and exhausted. The heat is so intense, in the words of a village elder, that man and wife prefer to behave like siblings./The worst hit are arid regions and rainless deserts such as Cholistan and Thal in Punjab, Thar in Sindh and vast swathes of countryside in Balochistan. In Cholistan, the traditional ponds (Toba) which offer a lifeline for the water scarce sprawling desert have gone completely dry as if hit by a terrible drought. The herds are disoriented due to the impact of searing heat. Some animals simply collapse and die while others are rattled by diseases. The sand dunes appear like graves, mouths agape. The administration which consumes a huge chunk of public money is horribly ill-prepared to face the crisis and bring succour to the people as it has neither the will nor the skill to be up to par. It would do what it's best at; covering up its failures. It's not just the deserts, the canal-irrigated areas are more or less equally hit as the water channels and canals have been closed due to low level of water in the dams adversely affecting the sowing season and crops. If you sow less you shall reap less. It's as simple as that. And yet things are not as simple as they look. The present water crisis is not something natural. It's a man-made disaster. Exponential population growth, denuding of soil, deforestation, destruction of animal sanctuaries, horizontal urban expansion and above all injudicious use of water resources have created a situation that would have dire consequences./The rich love to build golf courses. Most of the upper, middle and lower class houses are partially washed daily. New SUVs and old bangers are generously washed with clean tabbed water every morning. Ground water is fast depleting. The situation forces all and sundry to buy an automobile since there isn't even a semblance of efficient public transport. This adds to air pollution and raises temperature. None of above is a product of nature. It's on the contrary actions against nature or gross interference in the working of nature. Nature is only reacting against what we do to it. We in our supreme wisdom, which is thinly concealed hubris, think that we do all this for the sake of development forgetting that in our interconnected world exclusive development is counterproductive. And if it takes place at the expense of others, it becomes disastrously self-defeating. Just look around and see the fallout of what we have been doing./Rapid glacial melting in our northern areas as a result of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions has started taking its toll. Ablation causes freakish weather and erratic seasonal cycles that turn into routine phenomena with far-reaching impact on myriad forms of life. The real question is; one, whether we can develop in isolation, two, whether we can have exclusive privileges from nature. The answer is no. The planet is meant for all it has. Hence it's a shared asset. We cannot claim it exclusively for ourselves. If do so in our stupidity and greed, the cost is going to be unimaginably high; extinction of human species./In not a distant future we shall be confronted with a situation forcing us to make a crucial decision about our future as a species. Nature has one simple principle; all or none. Now it's up to us to decide whether we want all dead or to be living together with all."
CDA asked to 'prioritise' climate change angle in town planning," The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday ordered the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to adapt climate resiliency and sustainability into their town planning and policies for protecting the constitutional rights to life, dignity and property of the residents./'It is high time that our urban planners prioritise the climate factor in their development approaches to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, air pollution and loss of biodiversity,' observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in his judgement. The bench consisted of Justice Shah and Justice Aminuddin./In the face of grave existential threat of climate change, adaptation, climate resilience and sustainability assume the role of a constitutional necessity and of an overarching constitutional obligation, observed the SC ruling which came on an appeal against the Islamabad High Court's (IHC) rejection of a plea on Feb 16, 2021 regarding the non-conforming use of residential properties in G-9/4 sector./The matter concerned the Feb 13, 1995 decision by the CDA board of directors to commercialise the residential properties situated in front of the Industrial and Trading Centre, G-9/4./SC says urban development plans need to support adaptation, climate resiliency and sustainability/Later the board realised that Feb 13 decision violated the capital's master plan and rescinded its decision on Oct 5, 1995. It also issued notices on non-conforming use to the owners of such properties, which they challenged before the IHC./Upholding the high court order, the SC directed to dispatch the judgement to the CDA chairman for compliance. In urban living, the judgement emphasised, climate change could impair the quality of life of a person, offend his dignity and deprive him of his property or the right to fully enjoy his property./Incorporating adaptation, climate resilience and sustainability in the policy decisions by the urban development authorities are essential to actualise the fundamental rights of the people, the judgement outlined./Justice Shah emphasised that the urban development authorities needed to ensure that their urban development plans supported adaptation, climate resiliency and sustainability. The authorities need to consider the climate change angle before proposing a development scheme or changes to the master plan, the judge added./Any conversion of residential neighbourhoods into commercial zones is likely to lead to adverse environmental consequences on account of increased human and vehicular activity, the ruling said, adding that such an action should not be permitted without proper investigation and remedial measures./The importance of regulating land use for orderly urban development cannot be understated in the interest of organised growth of cities, according to the ruling./It is an exercise based on scientific research and experience which recommends in a comprehensive manner from social, economic, environmental, infrastructure capacity, aesthetic and other relevant aspects, the best present and future uses of geographically-specified land areas called zones, Justice Shah observed./Public welfare would naturally encompass the pressing issues of the time i.e. climate change; environmental degradation; food and health safety; air pollution; water pollution; noise pollution; soil erosion; natural disasters; and desertification and flooding having an appreciable impact on public health, the judgement said./Any initiative to revise land use regulations must be based on these considerations in order to ensure that urban development standards stay relevant to current issues of the community, it added./Climate change poses a series of interrelated challenges to the country's most densely populated cities, it added. Many cities depend on infrastructure, like water and sewage systems, roads, bridges, and power plants, that is ageing and in need of repair or replacement, it said./Climate change and its impacts threaten the well-being of urban residents, the judgement said, adding that nation's economy, security, and culture all depend on the resilience of urban infrastructure systems./Climate changes affect the built, natural, and social infrastructure of cities, from storm drains to urban waterways to the capacity of emergency responders and increases the risk, frequency, and intensity of certain extreme events like intense heat waves, heavy downpours, flooding from intense precipitation and coastal storm surges, and disease incidence related to temperature and precipitation changes./The vulnerability of urban dwellers multiplies when the effects of climate change interact with pre-existing urban stressors, the judgement said, highlighting that Pakistan falls among the countries most vulnerable to climate change."
Healing oneself," IT'S tough to see Pakistan falling apart as it faces the pressures of global food and fuel shortages and a plethora of domestic challenges, from non-existent institutional and administrative arrangements, poor infrastructure, and physical environmental challenges, such as the recent rains. This, in turn, is prompting our worst basic survival instincts to rise, promoting an 'every man for himself' type mentality./It does not help that one research paper in 2021 (conducted in 2019, before the global challenges arose) estimated that 52 per cent of the entire population of Pakistan was vulnerable to falling back into poverty./What can we do about it? Let's be real. People are feeling powerless, and so it is just becoming a blame game. But the reality is that we are in a complete mess. It's not due to any one action but to a whole series of actions by many people over many decades. This includes not only people in charge who run the country, but also people at every level, including you and me. Why? By not doing what is in our own hands./To solve a problem, one has to first admit we have a problem. I think Pakistan is at the stage of finally realising it has a problem. Actually, many. The question is which problems are the priority?/Even in the highest income quintile group, 22pc of children under five years are stunted./I have worked on development policy with many countries over the last 30 years. The one common thing that I took away was that every person, in every country I have been to, whether rich or poor, actually has one thing in common. They want their children to have better opportunities than they have had in their own life./In today's Pakistan, sadly that is not a possibility. Pakistan's own demographic health survey 2017-2018 has a startling graph on stunting. It shows that 57pc of children under the age of five years in the lowest income quintile are stunted. Stunting is due to a child being unable to absorb nutrients in the first two years of life. It does not only mean that the child is shorter in height (the indicator of measurement for stunting) on average, but it also means a reduction in cognitive abilities, ie IQ. This cannot be fixed later in life. It is a permanent disability. It means a permanent loss in productivity and means that a child will never fulfil his or her God-given potential. It means that a child's opportunities will be less than his or her parents' - after all when the brain itself is affected, no schooling, job opportunity or money can fix that./That same data also tells us another hard truth. As expected, the percentage of stunting reduces as income increases. So, the poor definitely have it worse than the rich. But it does not reduce to zero. In fact, even in the highest income quintile group, 22pc of children under five years are stunted. That means that almost a quarter of the children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces and nephews of the people reading this article also have lower IQ. Everyone is affected./But surely the children of the rich in Pakistan have enough to eat? Why are they stunted? Actually, lack of nutrition can be both from not eating enough, or the right thing, and also from the inability of the body to absorb the nutrients when you eat them. That is the case when you have pneumonia and diarrhoea. And it is no surprise to learn that the number one killer of children in Pakistan is pneumonia and the number two killer is diarrhoea. In fact, on the pneumonia front, Pakistan is one of four countries which together comprise the majority of pneumonia deaths in the entire world./The Global Burden of Disease study, which is carried out every 10 years, attempts to put all diseases on an equal footing and to understand the risk factors underlying those diseases in every country in the world. In Pakistan, the disease burden has changed over 10 years, between 2009 and 2019, and is now 60pc non-communicable diseases. These diseases cannot be cured, only managed, resulting in health costs across a lifetime. Alternatively, they can be prevented altogether by tackling the underlying risk factors. These are diseases such as strokes, heart disease, kidney diseases, and diabetes. The same GBD study looks at risk factors underlying the national health burden. In Pakistan's case, malnutrition is number one, and air pollution is the number two risk factor. There can also be overlap - air pollution increasing the chances of pneumonia and hence the inability to absorb nutrients, having much the same effect as not having enough to eat./Tackling stunting will require an effort across many fronts, and merits a fuller discussion. These could include both public health and household-level actions, such as better understanding the underlying causes of stunting, raising awareness about them, and putting in place measures to address them. It will also require renewed focus to make further advances on the improved water and sanitation and clean drinking water fronts. Improving air quality, which continues to get progressively worse at a national level, is also crucial./This is a tough conversation. After all, there is already plenty to be depressed about. But it is needed. We need to set one or two priorities as a country, and then work together to solve them. It will help to get us out of this 'helpless state' where we can only think about our survival. It will give us something to work on together. It will make us feel proud if we can truly address this problem together, as a nation. It will help us to start to heal. Best of all, we will be giving our children a better chance to make the most of their lives."
400 people die of stroke daily in Pakistan: experts," Expressing concern over the growing number of stroke cases in Pakistan, experts at a press conference held on Thursday stated that the situation in the country was so worrisome that the government should immediately initiate a national health programme for stroke prevention and set up facilities at all tertiary care hospitals for its care and management./The event was organised in connection with World Brain Day, which is observed every year on July 22./The theme of this year's campaign is 'brain health for all'./'An estimated 400 people die of stroke every day in Pakistan while another 1,000 suffer from paralysis. Yet, this serious life-threatening condition fails to attract due state attention,' seasoned neurologist Dr Muhammad Wasay told the gathering./Highlighting its risk factors, he said it included high blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco consumption and high cholesterol. 'We come across many patients that have all the four major risk factors. Unfortunately, in our society, people don't value health. They think that it's a given thing and make no effort to improve their quality of life.'/According to Dr Wasay, one third of our 40 per cent population has high blood pressure while 10m people live with diabetes./The diseases often go undiagnosed as people generally don't get their blood pressure and sugar levels tested even once in a year./'It is highly recommended that people must have their blood pressure and sugar levels checked at least once in a year when they hit 40 years of age,' he suggested, adding that consumption of tobacco and gutka were all hazardous for health./Speakers at the event regretted that disease prevention was neither in the government list of priorities nor a popular concept with citizens./Dr Abdul Malik pointed to an acute shortage of neurologists in the country and said presently there was one neurologist available for a population of one million while the WHO guidelines suggested one neurologist for 1,000 people./Prevention/Simple diet, regular walk and exercise, tobacco avoidance, they pointed out, could help prevent stroke./In this respect, they referred to WHO's 10-year programme for advocacy and inter-sectoral intervention for promotion of brain health which was being actively pursued by member countries and needed to be implemented in Pakistan./Air pollution factor/Speaking about the connection between air pollution and brain health, Dr Nadir Ali of Pakistan Parkinson's Society said air pollution had become a major source of concern across the world and studies had also linked it with several neurological illnesses./'But, the government seems to be oblivious of this situation as we see that no effective measures are being taken to address the problem,' he said."
Give us clean air," RECENTLY, we shared data on stunting. This week, we turn to the second highest risk factor underlying Pakistan's health burden - air pollution. According to the Global Burden of Disease 2019 report, after malnutrition, exposure to air pollution increases the risk of diseases that cause both premature death and illness in the country - this is a sobering fact, one we can no longer afford to overlook or dismiss./Pakistanis are exposed to hazardous levels of both indoor air pollution and outdoor air pollution, raising the incidence of ischemic heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, neonatal morbidity, lower respiratory infections, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Experts refer to these diseases as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which we can prevent only by eliminating risk factors that cause them. Otherwise they need to be managed over a lifetime, incurring substantial costs./A recent paper from Aga Khan University Hospital notes that about 1,000 people in Pakistan suffer a stroke every day. Out of these, about 400 people die within 30 days. The authors suggest that limiting air pollution exposure alone can prevent 30 per cent of strokes in Pakistan. Yet, the Punjab government's NCD Unit does not even list air pollution as a risk factor for NCDs. This suggests that we require significant efforts to raise awareness of air pollution's health impacts./Besides health, air pollution also directly and indirectly affects cognitive ability - that is, our IQ, logical thinking, and our ability to reason, form ideas, and retain information. Air pollution directly affects the brain's neurological function, leading to cognitive degeneration. On the other hand, the inability to breathe properly affects one's focus. We all know that when we cannot breathe properly, focusing on basic tasks becomes difficult, let alone physical chores and schoolwork./Ensuring clean air is a public service. Yet improving air quality does not involve quick fixes./Air pollution thus increases school and job absences and performance. Researchers have found strong evidence demonstrating that an increase in pollution levels leads to higher school absences. Similarly, improvements in air quality improves school attendance. Even if students make it to school, studies from California and Israel show that exposure to air pollution in the classroom can noticeably decrease students' test scores - keep in mind, these settings have vastly superior air quality compared to Pakistan./Pollution exposure even before birth can lead to permanent, lasting consequences. Research from various countries suggests that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy results in the child in later life having lower scores on language and math tests in school; depressed earnings later in life; high unemployment; lower probability of college attendance; reduced high school completion; and higher chances of incarceration./Since pollution exposure affects the brain, it leads to poor decision-making and fosters aggressive behaviour. Evidence from China shows that air pollution reduces investors' performance. More disturbing evidence from the UK suggests that air pollution exposure leads to more traffic accidents. Studies from the US reveal that air pollution leads to a considerable increase in violent crime. Shockingly, the rise in violent crime due to air pollution occurs at levels well below stipulated air quality standards./Given the above research, we shouldn't be surprised that governments in many countries take air pollution seriously and voters demand this from their elected officials. In Pakistan, however, the same urgency is not evident./An important area of concern - which often goes neglected in Pakistan - is indoor air pollution (IAP), which results from cooking and heating with solid fuels on open fires and traditional cookstoves. Since women mostly carry the burden of cooking, and their children often spend time with them, IAP disproportionately affects women and children. Almost all women and children exposed to IAP belong to low-income households, which overwhelmingly rely on cheap solid fuel to meet their energy demands. Many other countries have investigated and addressed IAP since the 1980s. However, Pakistan remains conspicuous by its lack of research in this area./In most developed countries, a shift away from biomass fuel burning to natural gas and electric options has reduced the IAP risk factor. However, according to the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey 2019-2020, only 37pc of Pakistani households have access to clean fuel technology for cooking and lighting./Ensuring clean air is a public service. Yet improving air quality does not involve quick fixes. Pakistanis already have a constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment. Under the 18th Amendment, air quality management is a provincial government responsibility. To improve air quality, we need to devise an overarching national-level clean air plan - after all, air does not respect provincial boundaries. The federal government must ensure that provincial governments keep their end of the bargain. We also need stakeholders across the board - including citizens, the private sector, and local governments - to band together to fix this problem. In short, we must prioritise air pollution./Tackling air pollution is not impossible. A national clean air plan could include the following measures: 1) devising and implementing a household energy strategy to facilitate the transition to cleaner fuels, a priority for the poorest households; 2) monitoring and reporting on air pollution and raising citizens' awareness of its impacts; 3) putting in place air quality standards linked to health effects; 4) requiring companies to use new monitoring technologies - such as those adopted by pollution regulators in several Indian state governments - that transmit real-time pollution data to create public pressure and increase compliance; 5) addressing transport-related emissions, often the major source of emissions in cities; and 6) developing pollution tax instruments./Poor air quality affects all Pakistani households, regardless of income. However, it disproportionately affects poor households, deteriorating their health, raising their health expenditures, and thus dragging them back into poverty. Given that more than half of Pakistan's population is vulnerable to falling back into poverty, and that much of the country's population is already exposed to dirty outdoor and indoor air, this makes for an explosive mix."
CS orders anti-smog measures," Punjab Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal on Tuesday ordered action against those causing environmental pollution as part of measures to control smog./The chief secretary issued the direction during a meeting held at the Civil Secretariat./The additional chief secretary (home), administrative secretaries of various departments, including environment, industries, agriculture, local government, and other officials concerned participated in the meeting./Mr Afzal asked the secretaries concerned to take strict action against those causing air and environmental pollution through industrial and vehicular emissions, burning crops stubble and garbage. He said to mitigate the factors causing smog, there is a need to adopt preventive measures and enhance awareness./He said the ban on the use of substandard fuel in steel mills and factories be strictly enforced./He added that progress in this regard would be reviewed regularly./The CS also issued instructions regarding the formation of special squads to check industrial units and brick kilns for pollution./Environment Protection Department secretary gave a detailed briefing at the meeting, saying an action plan had been devised to control smog./According to a study, 43 per cent of contributors to air pollution are from the transport sector, 25pc from industry, 12pc from power and 20pc are from the agriculture sector./He said this year, more than 4,000 industrial units were inspected, 79 cases registered, 19 people arrested and 88 units were sealed for causing pollution./Similarly, 11,000 brick kilns were inspected, 736 cases registered and 19 people were arrested over similar charges./The authorities also took action against 29,200 smoke-emitting vehicles, lodging 7,000 FIRs and impounding 17,600 vehicles."
Master plan to deal with smog threat okayed," The Punjab government on Friday approved a master action plan to deal with the danger of smog, and decided to strictly implement the Calamity Act to curb the environment hazard instead of imposing Section 144 in the province./Chairing a meeting, Minister for Environment Protection and Parliamentary Affairs Muhammad Basharat Raja approved the plan at a meeting./Addressing the meeting, he said the provincial government was taking concrete steps to deal with air and water pollution on the Punjab chief minister's orders./'As compared to the past, measures have been initiated since May this year to deal with the danger of smog,' said the minister./He blamed the practice of burning of crops residues in Indian Punjab for '90 per cent of the smog in Pakistan'./'However, the intensity of smog can be reduced by taking measures at the local level,' he added./The minister said there was a need to launch an awareness campaign for the public, especially among school students about the issue./Emphasising the need to increase tree planting, he said that all relevant departments should take practical steps in this regard./'Focus on the problem of air pollution throughout the year instead of just in this season,' he directed the officials./On the occasion, the Environment Protection Department (EPD) secretary said special squads were impounding the vehicles emitting excessive smoke and heavy fines were also being imposed for violations. The minister directed that the documents of smoke-emitting vehicles should be seized and not be returned until the vehicle's fitness was ensured./He said burning crops residues and solid waste could not be allowed. 'All deputy commissioners should task patwaris and village lumberdars with ensuring prevention of crop residues burning in their respective areas,' he said./The minister called a video-link meeting of all commissioners and DCs next week and said that to discourage the crop residues burning, farmers should use straw cutters and happy seeder machines./'Small farmers will be given loans through cooperative banks for purchase of straw cutters and happy seeders,' he announced./He said that the cooperatives department should ensure that no housing society was established without getting NOC from the EPD. Every year, instead of mere symbolic planting, housing societies should practically work for planting trees and ensure survival of the plants./The EPD secretary, while briefing the meeting, said no brick kiln would be allowed to function without zig-zag technology. 'Legal notices have been issued in this regard' he told the meeting.'"
Harmful decibels," NOISE has become synonymous with big cities. Far from being a simple irritant, noise pollution has developed into a public health problem, affecting human health, and disturbing the daily life of millions. From New York and London to Karachi, Jakarta, Dhaka and Mumbai, the daily hustle and bustle of crowded streets and the rumbling of vehicular traffic, rail tracks and busy skies are contributing not just to a rise in emissions in megacities, but also noise pollution./The WHO puts the acceptable level of noise in residential areas at 55 decibels and 70 decibels for all other areas. Population growth and urbanisation have blurred the distinction between residential and commercial zones in many developing countries. The problem has reached alarming proportions as heavy traffic, construction works and industry located in the proximity of human settlements push noise pressure to levels far exceeding WHO guidelines./Experts now estimate that the consequences of noise pollution on human health are second only to air pollution. Hearing impairment and effects on sleep, quality of life, mental health and well-being are associated with noise. UNEP's report Frontiers 2022: Noise, Blazes and Mismatches analyses the harmful effects of noise. The report singles out traffic noise exposure as a 'risk factor for the development of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as elevated blood pressure, arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes' and adds that 'a conservative estimate indicates that long-term exposure to environmental noise contributes to 48,000 new cases of ischemic heart disease and causes 12,000 premature deaths annually in Europe'. A recent study in France found that noise pollution affected the health of around nine million people in the country, while up to 156 billion euros was the estimated cost of dealing with the effects of noise pollution in France./Noise pressure levels across Pakistan have risen exponentially./Noise pressure levels in cities across Pakistan have risen exponentially in recent years as unplanned and unmanaged urbanisation continues to swell the urban sprawl. Small towns are also becoming unlivable. In violation of municipal bylaws, residential areas are commercialised. Except for some posh townships, it is difficult to differentiate between a residential and commercial locality. Offices, shopping plazas and auto-repair workshops surround even schools, universities and hospitals - places which should always be protected from noise pollution. Ear-splitting noise from unmuffled motorbikes, auto rickshaws and public transport is harmful in more than one way. Besides causing physical impairment, excessive noise leads to psychological effects, and changes in social behaviour by interfering with daily routines./In developed countries, municipal authoritarians strictly enforce regulations to protect people - especially schoolchildren and patients in hospitals - from most sources of noises. The general public is alert and closely monitors any deviation from noise control measures and regulations. In contrast, the lack of public awareness, inadequacy of noise emission standards, and poor enforcement of existing laws and regulations are compounding noise pollution challenges in some developing countries. Current rules offer little by way of effective control measures or penalties for polluters./The answer to addressing this growing menace lies in adopting a comprehensive and consistent policy approach to noise pollution management which combines the principles of precaution, prevention and polluter pays. Environment and health authorities will need to collaborate with the civic administration to monitor noise levels, compile data on the sources and effects of noise pollution and raise public awareness thro­u­­gh the electronic and social media. Local governm­e­nts must take ste­ps through the strict enforcement of regulations and new laws to hold noise polluters accountable./Cities can also take practical steps by installation of road or rail noise barriers and reducing noise at source from construction and industry. Other measures that can contribute significantly to noise reduction in cities include the pedestrianisation of streets, taking old vehicles off the roads, promoting cycling and putting in place infrastructure for electric cars and electric motorbikes. Trees and green belts serve the dual purpose of filtering dirty air and absorbing noise. It was not without purpose that in days past, city roads were lined with trees and buffered with green belts./By 2050, 68pc of the global population will be living in cities. Pakistan has the highest rate of urbanisation in South Asia, portending a rapid increase in urban population in the next decade. Unless managed, noise pollution could contribute to a public health crisis. Ensuring reduced noise levels, especially in our cities, must become a priority."
Un-stirring the sugar in the milk," 'SHEER-O-SHAKAR' is a lyrical Urdu phrase that literally means milk and sugar but actually describes a blending that's impossible to un-stir. Once mixed, you can't take the sweetness out of the milk, like it or not, hence the phrase. That's how Nehru explained to an American journalist about more Muslims staying back in India after the partition./It is Dussehra tomorrow (Wednesday). Effigies of Ravana, the 10-headed demon king of ancient Lanka will be reduced to cinders again. Up to a year after the advent of Narendra Modi as India's ruler in 2014, there would be human interest stories, in what used to be a less polarised media, of Muslim artisans who assembled the paper-and-reed effigies that would be occasionally towering at more than 200 feet (approximately 60 metres). If Muslim artisans are still earning their seasonal income from the art of effigy-making for Hindus, there's perhaps no one around to replace the skilful workers who travel distances to create the effigy of the demon king and his two brothers every year./The duo Meghnaad and Kumbhakaran would flank Ravana come Dussehra, and they would be destroyed first before someone dressed as Lord Rama would shoot an arrow into Ravana's navel and he would go up in flames amid exploding firecrackers placed around his body. The story goes that Vibhishana, Ravana's younger brother, defected to Rama's side on moral grounds, a story that could be the basis of the curious saying: 'Ghar ka bhedi Lanka dhaaye' (Was a traitor that destroyed Lanka.) Did Vibhishana share the secret of his brother's Achilles' heel, the navel, for Rama to shoot at? Like scores of Rama stories, the version of Vibhishana helping his brother's slaying is disputed. A feature of Hindutva is that, in the mould of the more puritan traditions of West Asia, it seeks to destroy alternative explorations of Hindu traditions and their multilayered lore. Respected historian A.K. Ramanujan's brilliant collection of Rama legends in the Three Hundred Ramayanas, was attacked and its copies destroyed by right-wing hoodlums in the Delhi University. In Ramanujan's collection, there are myriad versions of the Rama story, including the Jain and Buddhist variants, which can only be retrieved when bigotry is reined in./As for the firecrackers that go off on Dussehra in Ravana's effigy, it's well known that gunpowder was invented in China and came to India likely with Mughal emperor Babar in 1526. It is clear at least that the noise and smoke in the evolving tradition, the source of considerable dispute and court orders for the pollution they cause in northern fog-clad seasons, were a recent addition. You could call it a Muslim contribution to India's problem with air pollution./A feature of Hindutva is that it seeks to destroy alternative explorations of Hindu traditions and their multilayered lore./Of the three popular Hindu deities - Shiva, Rama and Krishna - Rama alone appears to have no musical instrument assigned to him. Shiva was an accomplished dancer and played the hand-held percussion, the damru, to entrance the listeners. Krishna played the flute to similar effect. Saraswati, Lord Brahma's consort, too, excelled with the veena. And yet, Rama is the hub around which countless musical compositions have come into being. My very favourite is the South Indian Raag Kharaharapriya composed by the venerated 18th-century musician Thyagaraja, particularly the version rendered by Ustad Karim Khan./It was purely by accident that one found the composition sung by the founder of the renowned Kirana gharana, a style of classical singing popularised among others by the legend's daughters Hirabai Barodekar, Saraswati Rane and son Sureshbabu Mane. All three had a Muslim name each, which music critics usually shun. Roshan Ara Begum was Karim Khan's disciple for 15 years and probably his cousin too. Bhimsen Joshi, Feroze Dastur and Gangubai Hangal were disciples of Karim Khan's other famous pupil Sawai Gandharva. I'm not sure how many of them had the reach or the capability of Karim Khan to delve into the intricacies of Karnatic music, the exacting South Indian genre. The Kharaharapriya composition is a heart-tugging tribute to Lord Rama, which Karim Khan sang with devotion as only South Indian maestros could, which he wasn't./'Ramani samanam evaru/ Raghu vamsoddharaka'. Roughly, the full verse says: 'Peerless Rama! The Raghu race attained supremacy thanks to your advent. Your beloved Sita is like a tender and fragrant creeper on your bosom. You have brothers whose words drip with sweetness of honey. We are privileged to have you as our family (kula) deity. You are gentle and soft in speech.'/Another Karim Khan composition from the south is a song for the Marathi musical theatre, the Natya Sangeet. Listen to Chitti Babu's veena playing Raag Devagandhari. And then hear the three-minute theatre song Chandrika hi janu in the same raag. It is said Karim Khan passed away on a railway platform in Pondicherry on his way to meet his muse, the dancer-singer Balasaraswati and her mother the great singer Dhannamal./There's no dearth of Muslim singers and poets who've embellished the Rama legend with their prowess. Hindutva seeks to undermine their work. Rasoolan Bai's angst at the loss of the heroine's very precious pearl is stark in the song - 'Yehi thaee'n motiya herai gaeli Rama, kaha'n wahka dhoondoo'n?' The petition to Rama could not stop her house in Gujarat from being gutted in 1973 by tone-deaf bigots. Allama Iqbal's tribute to Rama as the imam of India is brushed aside with an embarrassed silence. Likewise, with Sangeetha Kalanidhi Sheik Chinna Moulana, Karnatic music's naadaswaram exponent. Gosaveedu Sheik Hassan Sahib, a former disciple of Sheik Chinna Moulana, served as the resident guru of Bhadracharam Sitarama Temple for about 45 years. Sitarama Temple! Bismillah Khan played the shehnai at the Varanasi temple, now a hub of Muslim-baiting. The poet and constituent assembly member Hasrat Mohani would visit Krishna's Mathura every time he returned from Haj. Hindutva bigots are busy un-stirring the sugar in the milk there. It would, of course, need a miracle for them to succeed."
