Solid waste for generating power," SOLID waste management has become a nightmare in Pakistan. Municipalities are equipped with centuries-old and outdated methods as they lift only 60 per cent of the waste generated in cities./In the absence of professionalism and proper waste disposal system, most of the garbage lifted from cities is crudely dumped in open spaces. These dumps attract mosquitoes, rats, cockroaches, houseflies, birds as well as stray animals. Such dumps spread all sorts of diseases which badly affect health of the residents of the city./Karachi, with an estimated population of 20 million, generates around 12,000 tons of waste a day. The city has been experiencing an urban sprawl and industrialisation that is leading to the production of enormous amount of waste./Owing to the inadequate waste collection and disposal system, much of it goes into drains or burned in open space, causing air pollution, along with environmental degradation. The remaining waste is transported to government-designated landfill sites where it is segregated by scavengers and burned to separate precious metals, bones and other recyclable material, which is later on sold at nifty prices in local markets./Waste management is of particular importance for mega cities to use urban waste in the most resource recovery and energy-efficient manner considering that landfill is not a sustainable option for waste management in general. It is even less of an option for mega cities where energy demand is high and space for the landfill is limited./Like the other mega cities of developed countries which are using their municipal solid waste for generation of electricity for inhabitants and other utilities for neighbouring industries, Karachi is demanding the same due to the energy crisis. It is now essential to think of energy recovery and recycling, besides disposal of waste as sustainable solution./But the situation is outrageous in Karachi. Open dumping and open burning are the usual methods of solid waste disposal which cause environmental degradation and great threats to environmental sustainability in Pakistan./The government has to work on the development and implementation of a standardised solid waste management system./Environmental legislation is still not well developed in Pakistan and the existing rules and regulations dealing with solid waste management are inadequate and outdated./Besides, people and the private sector's involvement through NGOs could improve the efficiency of solid waste management./Public awareness should be created at primary level so that future generations know the connection between solid waste and environment."
Heart diseases linked to air pollutants: study," A striking rise in emergency room visits and hospitalisation for cardiovascular diseases are linked to higher levels of air pollutants in Karachi, a recent study has found./The study, ""Effect of air pollution on daily morbidity in Karachi"" was conducted by a team of experts at the Aga Khan University's department of community health sciences and was printed last year in the Global Journal of Health Science./Prior to this, no studies have been conducted in Pakistan examining the association between levels of air pollution with daily morbidity due to cardiovascular diseases./The research covered a period of 12 months (August 2008 to August 2009) and the population under study consisted of all people who belonged to various communities residing in Karachi and who visited emergency rooms and/or were admitted to two major tertiary care hospitals; National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) and Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) with primary diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases./At the same time, air pollution monitoring for PM2.5 (small particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) was conducted at two fixed stations located at Korangi (industrial, residential areas), the second largest industrial area in the city with about 2,000 industries including that of refineries, textile, chemical and tanneries, and Tibet Center (commercial/residential) located on M. A Jinnah Road over which approximately 300,000 vehicles ply daily./According to the study's findings, particulate (existing in the form of minute separate particles) levels were extraordinarily high, with the great majority of days falling into the ""unhealthy for sensitive groups"" or ""very unhealthy"" categories./The mean PM2.5 levels in Karachi exceeded the WHO's 24-hour air quality guideline almost every day and often by a factor of greater than five-fold. Frequent peaks at levels as high as 279 ìg/m3 were also recorded on a 'good day'./Though particulates were measured at two sites, one more industrial than the other, the patterns over time in general were similar. ""Our study shows that higher levels of PM2.5 are associated with a striking elevation in rates of ER (emergency room) visits and hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases./""Because of the striking levels of air pollution that we have documented, it is imperative that further investigation of health outcomes in mega cities of developing countries be performed,"" the study says./A total of 24,124 (68.6%) ER visits and 11,023 (31.4%) hospital admissions (HAs) due to cardiovascular diseases among adults and children living in various communities in Karachi occurred in the study period. Overall, there were more male hospitalisations than female./The hospital data indicated that the leading causes of cardiovascular disease are ischemic heart disease (37pc), hypertension (25pc), and myocardial infarction (12pc)./Background; Highlighting the research's importance, the study says that ambient air pollution is a significant factor shaping public health. Recent epidemiological studies in developed countries have highlighted an association between urban concentrations of air pollution and health effects, which primarily include pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases./""Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10m (PM10), especially less than 2.5m (PM2.5) and total suspended particulate matter (TSP) have been identified as major pollution factors affecting health,"" it says./The focus of research on health effects of air pollution, according to the study, has shifted to smaller particles (PM2.5) because they could be deposited deeper in the lung alveoli where they cannot be removed by the ciliary action (a process that removes larger particulates) and consequently have negative effects on the lungs./""Due to the large surface area of PM2.5, toxins (for instance, organic compounds and heavy metals) can be absorbed onto the surface. Organs such as the lungs and heart, cells, and DNA can be damaged by the toxins. The PM2.5 particles are, therefore, regarded as being more toxic than PM10 and TSP,"" it says./Most studies investigating an association between levels of air pollution and rates of human disease have been conducted in developed countries where concentrations of air pollution, climatic conditions, and many other factors are significantly different from those in most developing countries, it says./""Air pollution is a critical problem in Asian cities with possibly serious health impact. The WHO estimates that urban air pollution contributes each year to about 800,000 deaths and 4.6 million healthy life-years lost worldwide but the burden is not equally distributed: approximately 65pc of the deaths and lost life-years occur in the developing countries of Asia.""/On Pakistan's situation, the report points out that the concurrent increase in the population, industrialisation, energy use, and the number of automobiles on the roads every year is giving rise to a threateningly high rate of increase in air pollutants in the urban areas of the country./Citing another study on air pollution levels in major urban centres, the paper states that it found that two major cities (Karachi and Islamabad) in Pakistan had one of the highest TSP (total suspended particulates) loading recorded so far in any mega city of the world./""Karachi with a population of 18 million is one of the most heavily polluted mega cities in the world with serious human health risks. The city is congested with a large number of motor vehicles (over 1.3 million) and has a large industrial base in and around the city,"" it says./The Wadsworth Centre, New York State Department of Health, Albany, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Albany, Institute for the Health and the Environment, University of Albany and Chemistry Department of KU had also collaborated in the research."
"Drive against noisy, smoky rickshaws"," The Environment Protection Department (EPD), Punjab, will launch a drive against two stroke rickshaws and motorcycle rickshaws to control noise and air pollutions, officials told Dawn./Of the 39 squads formed for the operation, four will operate in Lahore./The decision was taken at a meeting on Tuesday which was attended by rickshaw unions, traffic police, EPD and City District Government of Lahore officials./Each squad will consist of two traffic wardens, a motor vehicle examiner and EPD inspectors./Earlier, the EPD has launched two such drives time to time to address the environmental issue, and the third would begin in a week./In the phased drive, the squads will educate rickshaw drivers on the issue in the first phase. In the second phase, action would be taken against the violators and motorcycle rickshaw drivers will be told to use original silencer. They will be told to not dilute exceeding amount of mobil oil in petrol because increased oil mixing in petrol generates smoke./The squads will take action against the buses which have multi toner horns./The meeting learnt that there were 80,000 rickshaws in the city and the pollution created by these vehicles was highly hazardous for the health of the public."
Dangers of pollution," Karachi is among many cities of Pakistan which suffers from pollution of different kinds. This is a major issue for our government which is not able to manage this menace. Noise pollution is created by rickety buses, rickshaws, cars and all other varieties of vehicles./People are not aware of the basic civic sense and are thus used to honking all over the city but the worst is when it happens near hospitals and so patients suffer the most.The government should organise a series of seminars in Karachi on creating basic civic sense among the people of why they should not honk whenever they are driving near a hospital or a clinic. This will spare patients from the noise pollution of honking./Air pollution is caused by gases and smoke coming out of vehicles./Also, thick smoke emitting from the chimneys of factories is a problem not only for Karachiites but for the whole mankind./The ozone layer is being removedslowly from the earth as a result of such smoke./Immediate steps should be taken to control air pollution./Those buses which emit dark smoke should be banned while industries should be punished for air pollution./Another dangerous problem is water pollution due to which thousands of people die every year./In some areas of Karachi people are so unfortunate that they do not get any potable water at all. There is no will to redress the grievances of thepeople./The government should build plants for purifying water so that people in Karachi can drink pure water, which is their basic right./Another problem that adds to the pollution of Karachi and is a source of all sorts of diseases and ailments is overflowing sewerage./The KWSB sits over this problem unmindful of its responsibility towards the taxpayers. Anybody listening?"
Sindh yet to tackle non-communicable diseases challenge," With the highest urban population than the rest of the country, Sindh faces severe challenges of non-communicable diseases, it emerged on Tuesday. A report prepared by the provincial health department said the demographic changes in Pakistan were most prominent in urban areas and the urbanisation rate had grown steadily from 17.8 per cent in 1951 to 37pc in 2010./""Sindh is particularly affected by demographic challenges as an estimated 48.7 per cent of its population is urban-based, which makes it the province with the highest urban population and resulting double challenges in shape of spread of diseases,"" said the report./It said Pakistan was in the early stages of the demographic transition with rapid increases seen in the proportion of economically productive age group comprising young adults and middle-aged population; and their accompanying health problems. The proportion of the population in the 15-64-year age group has increased from 43pc in 1998 to 61pc in 2010 with estimates of reaching 67pc in 2030./The non-communicable diseases (NCDs) burden has overtaken maternal, newborn and child health and communicable disease burden in Pakistan and is on the rise in Sindh./The NCDs currently account for 59pc of diseases in Pakistan, while the proportion for Sindh is expected to be even higher as it has the largest concentration of urban population among all the provinces./The only population-based survey on the NCDs was conducted in the mid-1990s showing unexpectedly high levels of the NCDs and the incidence had risen since then, said the report. However, since then there is no reporting by the health management information system showing lack of efforts to provide new population-based estimates./The report said the NCDs had worrisome implications as they affected the economically productive rather than the elderly aged group, and the high treatment cost of advanced disease was likely to be crippling given the scarcity of resources, underscoring early prevention and control./The number of patients in urban areas is higher in Sindh than in the other provinces since the urban areas are more heavily populated here than the rest of the country. The most prevalent condition is said to be the ischaemic heart disease, followed by mental health disorders and trauma, while chronic obstructive lung diseases and various forms of cancers make up the remaining percentage. The analysis also reveals that non-communicable diseases mostly affect the urban poor./It said Karachi had one of the highest global rates of particulate air pollution and breast cancer. Despite high prevalence levels, it added, most patients were unaware of the onset of diseases which were also inappropriately controlled./It said cerebro-vascular diseases (CVDs) accounted for 12.5pc of the NCDs. It is estimated that one in three adults over 45 years is hypertensive across Pakistan while data from urban Sindh showed a prevalence of 40pc in adults over 40 years of age and alarmingly higher levels in illiterate population./About 70pc people with hypertension across Pakistan 'are unaware of their condition, and less than 3pc have adequately controlled blood pressure."
Tree plantation demanded to fight pollution," President of 18 Villages Committee, Nashpa Malik Azizur Rehman Khattak on Saturday said poisonous gases emitted from oil and gas dehydration plants were causing the spread of skin and respiratory diseases in the area and therefore, massive tree plantation should be carried out as a corrective measure./Addressing a news conference here, Mr Khattak said under international laws, trees should be planted within 40 kilometers of the location of oil and gas dehydration plants to decrease the impact of gases generated by them./He said other steps should also be taken to protect environment and wildlife in the area./Mr Khattak said water ponds should be built in Nashpa, where operations of oil and gas companies had disturbed the wildlife./He warned that the local residents would agitate if the companies didn't take measures to control air pollution./COMPENSATION DEMANDED: The labour union leaders on Saturday demanded payment of compensation to the families of labourers, who died in salt mines of Karak district./They threatened to stage sit-in outside the offices of the Kohat labour commissioner after a week over non-payment of compensation./Coal and Salt Mines Labour Union, Karak president Naveed Khattak, general secretary Taj Mohammad and senior vice president Dunya Gul told reporters here that salt mine labourer Gul Daraz Khan, a resident of Lakh Kani in the district, died and his colleague, Mir Afzal, seriously injured when the mine caved in a few months ago but no compensation had been paid to the injured and the family of the deceased./They said the collapse of mines had also been reported in Bahaderkhel and Narri Panos areas./The speakers complained that most mine owners didn't provide labourers with safety gears in violation of the law./They said their repeated requests to the Workers Welfare Board, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for payment of compensation to injured or dead labourers had fallen on deaf ears./The speakers demanded that labourers be provided with all required facilities inside mines and properly compensated in case of mishap."
Rickshaws: environmental terrorism," THIS is with reference to the letter 'Environmental bombshell' (Sept 10) by Cdre (r) Sajjad Ali Shah Bokhari. Nowadays, there is a strong voice against smoking and the effects it entails on the smoker and the people around him. It has created awareness in the public regarding the negative effects of smoking and in return is going to prove good for the coming generations./But there is another environmental 'terrorism' which needs to be talked about even more strongly so that the authorities concerned may take notice. It is smoke emitted by rickshaws and burning of the waste in residential areas./Policymakers and law-enforcers just need a motorbike ride in any urban area to get the idea of agony every citizen bears on a daily basis. Smoke from rickshaws causes cancer, allergies and inflammation in the respiratory tract. The same is true for the smoke from waste burning which is a habit of our sanitary workers./What prevents the district and tehsil management from stopping these crimes is beyond my comprehension when we have Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997, Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965, and Motor Vehicles Rules, 1969./No smoke-emitting vehicle can enter the cantonment area of Lahore, which is also a part of Pakistan. If this can happen in that specific area, where more than 90 per cent of residents have airconditioned vehicles, which saves them from smoke and air pollution, why is it not happening in other localities?/The assistant commissioners of all tehsils should be entrusted with the duty to eradicate this menace immediately. No further delay regarding it is acceptable, as it is a matter of public health and lives."
Power park: an ill-conceived project," THE severity of Karachi's environmental problems, chief amongst them air pollution, are well known. If the government goes ahead with the proposal of establishing the Pakistan Power Park Company (PPPC) in Gadani, Balochistan, the health hazards faced by millions are certain to intensify./On Aug 19, a week before announcing his plans for the PPPC, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif criticised the earlier government for starting construction on the Neelum-Jhelum power project without having laid down power lines to connect it to the national electricity grid. But his own government's plan betrays similar irrationality./The PPPC would generate 6,600 megawatts of electricity through 10 coal-powered plants using imported coal. Gadani is a bustling commercial town barely 20km west of Karachi. Already located there is the Hubco Power Plant, generating 1,200MW of electricity and sending up massive plumes of smoke and emissions. Nearly all through the year, the wind blows directly from Gadani towards Karachi./While the proposal has been made public, neither the government nor Wapda have initiated the environment impact assessment (which would also be required before approaching multilateral donors for financing a project tagged at an initial cost of $14 billion). On the ground, however, eviction notices under the colonial-era Land Acquisition Act, 1894, have gone out to the villages of Mauza Janobi Mawoli and Mauza Kund to make room for the PPPC./According to Dr Moazzam Ali, director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at Karachi University, ""coal-fired power plants generate massive quantities of greenhouse gases, toxic airborne particulate matter and tons of residual ash./Globally, these plants are considered amongst the worst environmental polluters./""A typical 660MW coal-fired plant draws up to three billion gallons of water annually for its cooling systems, adversely affecting marine ecology. Global dependence on coal-fired power plants is, therefore, steadily going down, except in China.""/Dr Shahid Naseem, PhD, a geogenic disease expert, observes that the emissions by the PPPC could easily set new records for greenhouse gasses and airborne particulate matter, adding acidic and toxic pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, arsenic, boron, lead, selenium, mercury, chromium, etc, into the environment./Just 1pc emission of sulphur by the PPPC would mean the annual addition of over 312,206 tons of sulphur in Gadani, Hub and Karachi's micro-climates. Once these pollutants start to dissolve in the waters of Hub Dam, Haleji and elsewhere, the fallout in terms of health and habitat can be estimated. Existing sulphur and other particulate emissions from Hubco, together with those from the Byco Oil Refinery, mean that the maximum permissible threshold has already been breached in the Gadani area.Several other questions need to be answered too./One of these is financing. Leading global sources of capital have announced a major shift away from financing coal-fired power plants./Since South Africa in 2010, the World Bank has not committed to fund a single coal-fired power plant, and even the South African venture was opposed by several countries on the grounds of environmental concerns./Eminent physicist and environmentalist Dr A.H. Nayyar grudgingly accepts that ""coal continues to be an attractive fossil fuel because of the much more rapidly increasing prices of furnace oil, diesel, etc. But it should only be allowed under the strict condition of using clean-coal technologies. Clean-coal technologies obviously increase the cost of energy production, which cannot be helpful in attracting investors.""/Then, sustainable industrial growth demands powerful regulatory mechanisms - a capacity that Pakistan has yet to demonstrate. Many experts fear that in absence of a tough and informed regulatory body, old and inefficient plants (commonly known as grandfather plants) that are being decommissioned all over the world could start popping up at the PPPC. The 2009 gift of a 320MW thermal power plant, built by General Electric and originally installed in 1973-74, would be a good example. After 35 years of service in the UAE it became obsolete and is currently collecting dust at Karachi port./Another challenge to the establishment of the PPPC is posed by the imported coal that is to be used. Experts at the National Institute of Oceanography concede that detailed oceanography studies specific to the project are yet to be carried out. Yet they suggest that extremely long jetties and coal-conveying systems would be required to achieve considerable depths for incoming Panamax and Capesize class cargo ships - a prerequisite for the daily import of 85,000 tons (31 million tons annually) of coal needed./To accommodate such ships, the government would have to construct breakwaters to protect jetties, and coal-conveying systems./The prime minister was briefed that Gadani could be suitable location because it was already connected to the national power grid at Jamshoro. But, crucially, the current transmission system has no surplus capacity; an additional system will be required./The bottom line: Gadani is not the rational choice for the power park, and the proposal should be revisited."
Of black carbon and brown clouds," A conference highlighting ""Italian science and cooperation at the shadow of K-2"", took place in Islamabad this September. Organised by the Italian supported Ev-K2-CNR and SEED (Social Economic Environment Development) Project, it focused on ""Karakoram resources and climate change: glacier, water and ecosystem"". The goal was to present the latest findings by Italian and Pakistani scientists (along with other European scientists working in the area) on the fragile state of the Karakoram mountains' ecosystem. Regarded as the water towers of the country, the Karakorams are climatically, geologically and ecologically sensitive and are significantly affected by climate change./What are the main threats to the Karakorams? Firstly you have black carbon (emitted from traditional cooking stoves and diesel engines) and ozone (which is the third most powerful greenhouse gas that makes up urban smog) concocting what is called Atmospheric Brown Clouds or ABCs. These are often visible as the brownish haze seen during dry seasons, especially in the winter months. ABCs end up affecting regional climate change, impacting the hydrological cycle and causing glacial melting in addition to their adverse effects on human health (from inhaling large amounts of air pollutants). According to scientist P. Christofanelli from the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate in Italy, who conducted studies in air pollution in the Karakorams recently, ""air pollution levels in the Karakorams are lower than in the plains, but transport along the valleys can have an impact on the environment (from black carbon emissions)""./The other main threat to the Karakorams is from the steady increase in global temperatures, and Ghulam Rasool from the Pakistan Meteorological Department noted that the warmest 18 years in recorded history have occurred in recent years. In the high mountains due to the increase in temperature the snow line is going higher. ""In the past they would get lots of snow in the lower altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 metres, but not anymore ... there is also now a heat wave frequency over the Northern Areas."" In recent years, temperatures in Gilgit have touched 40 degrees Celsius and heat waves have persisted for almost five days. The snow cover has also shifted - instead of January there is more snow in February. ""There is now a sharp rise in February snow cover and there is not enough time to convert the snow into ice on the glaciers."" There has also been a shift in monsoon patterns - they are getting stronger and reaching higher altitudes./Climate change is also impacting the agricultural production of Gilgit-Baltistan where less than 25 per cent of the land is arable. There is also more land-sliding, soil erosion and flooding due to increased rains and lots of pest attacks due to warmer temperatures. Apples, pomegranates and grapes are susceptible to these pest attacks, according to researcher M. Hussain from the Karakoram International University in Gilgit./The high mountains of Pakistan are responsible for much of the water flows that go into the Indus River, Pakistan's lifeline; hence it is very important to know how climate change will affect these water flows. There are 11,413 glaciers located in the Upper Indus Basin, with the largest glacier around 1,000 sq km in size. For a few years now, the Karakorams were thought to have been stable, with the slight advancing of glaciers (attributed to increasing winter precipitation)./Scientist D. Bocchiola, from the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, installed hydrometric stations on the Shigar River (which feeds into the Indus) to study the discharge of water near the Karakoram glacier zone. By comparing flow levels and other information, he developed hydrological modeling. Using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prediction of a warming of five degrees Celsius by the end of the century (if carbon emissions are not cut significantly), he found that in the Shigar River there would be ""increasing discharge ... while the ice volume will decrease drastically. After the first 50 years there would be slight decrease but towards the end there would be consistent decrease in water in the river"". So there would be more water for a number of decades but also an increase in extreme events like floods./But need we worry if our glaciers are stable or even growing due to the ""Karakoram anomaly""? According to the German Professor Winiger who has worked on Pakistani glaciers for several years now, the answer is not that simplistic. ""You have to go down to the local level. Each glacier is an individual, each valley is different and we have to understand them""./Glaciologist C. Mayer from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Germany who has been studying the large Karakoram glaciers for several years now, noted that the increase in glaciers in the Karakorams is mainly due to surging activities (redistribution from higher parts to lower parts). ""The glaciers in the Karakorams are more stable than in other areas, but the glacier changes are due to glacier dynamics. Do not look at area changes, you have to look at elevation changes"". He further clarified that ""the Baltoro glacier is only there because of the debris cover. The debris cover increases close to the snout, hence there is no ablation (melting) - you won't see a climate signal. Ablation occurs higher up where there is no debris cover and goes down to zero near the snout where there is debris cover. Most glaciers are debris covered in the Karakorams. One has to be careful when looking at the signals""./Mass balance measurements are needed to understand what is really happening to the glaciers of the Karakorams, but in his view, ""the future of large glaciers is still negative""."
"Outdoor air pollution causes cancer, says IARC"," The specialised cancer agency of World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that outdoor air pollution is a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths./According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there is sufficient evidence that exposure to outdoor air pollution causes lung cancer and increases the risk for bladder cancer./The IARC points out in a statement that air pollution is already known to increase risks for a wide range of diseases, such as respiratory and heart diseases. Studies indicate that in recent years exposure levels have increased significantly in some parts of the world, particularly in rapidly industrialising countries with large populations./The most recent data indicate that 223,000 deaths from lung cancer in 2010 were caused by air pollution./""The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances,"" said Kurt Straif, head of the IARC's monographs section. ""We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths.""/The IARC's Monographs Programme, dubbed the ""encyclopaedia of carcinogens,"" provides an authoritative source of scientific evidence on cancer-causing substances and exposures. In the past, the programme evaluated many individual chemicals and specific mixtures that occur in outdoor air pollution. These included diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals, and dust. But this is the first time that experts have classified outdoor air pollution as a cause of cancer./""Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,"" said Dana Loomis, deputy head of the monographs section./""The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.""/The main sources of outdoor air pollution are transportation, stationary power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions, and residential heating and cooking. Some air pollutants have natural sources, as well./""Classifying outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans is an important step,"" stressed IARC's Director Christopher Wild. ""There are effective ways to reduce air pollution and, given the scale of the exposure affecting people worldwide, this report should send a strong signal to the international community to take action without further delay."""
Release of toxic waste in Phuleli canal discussed," Speakers at a seminar on Tuesday highlighted the damage to the environment and people's health caused by release of untreated domestic and industrial waste into the Phuleli canal and other water channels, warning citizens against the danger of consuming this toxic water./In a seminar, titled 'Effects of chemical wastage on environment, human health and livelihood', organised by the Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO) and Development and Management Network (DAMN) at the Darbar Hall in Badin, it was pointed out that irrigation and drinking water in canals and other channels is turning murky and has begun giving off a bad odour due to indiscriminate discharge of untreated sewage industrial effluent, and was also consequently giving rise to a number of diseases as well./The speakers expressed concern over what they described was 'criminal attitude' on the part of certain entrepreneurs and factory owners whose units continued to discharge large amounts of effluent into main water bodies./They pointed out that a fairly large number of people in Badin district and its adjoining areas suffered from skin, respiratory and stomach illnesses caused by environmental pollution and emission of poisonous gases from industries./Speakers criticized the role of departments concerned and also the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to implement the ban on released untreated sewage into main water channels which put thousands of lives at risk./Pakistan People's Party (PPP) MNA Sardar Kamal Khan Chang in his presidential speech expressed great concern over the release of toxic waste from sugar mills and air pollution and termed them as violation of existing environmental laws. He announced forming a five-member committee, to be headed by him, to help resolve the matter./PPP MPA Allah Bux Talpur said he was glad to see that people had finally woken up to the menace of pollution which remained unchecked./Badin deputy commissioner Muhammad Rafique Qureshi said that it was not only the responsibility of industrialists to check environmental degradation but people were also equally responsible. Being the district head, he said, he would try to quickly address these problems./Meanwhile, EPA assistant director for the Hyderabad region, Imran Abbasi, informed the participants that notices had already been issued to authorities concerned for violating environmental laws by disposal of industrial effluent into the Phuleli canal./He said that cases against sugar mills were also pending before the EPA tribunal."
Pulmonary diseases," Chief Executive of Lady Reading Hospital Professor Arshad Javed has said that chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases were very common not only in Pakistan but the world over after the age of 40./Mr Javed, who is also head of the pulmonology department of LRH, said that such diseases were the fourth leading cause of deaths among people worldwide. ""According to WHO, more than 500,000 deaths were caused every year by chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,"" he added./He was speaking at a seminar organised jointly by Pakistan Chest Society, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter, and International Primary Care Respiratory Group, Pakistan chapter, on Sunday./Professor Javed stated that chronic illness led to shortness of breath, cough with expectoration, whistling of chest, and inability to walk or exert through life./He further stated that the leading causes were tobacco use, smoke inside homes, air pollution and use of wood by female inside poorly ventilated houses at hilly and rural areas."
A tale of two trees," Despite what you may imagine, large swathes of Sindh were once enriched with a wide variety of tree species but, over the years, the land has become denuded. Apparently, only two foreign species i.e. eucalyptus and conocarpus dominate regeneration programmes in the social and agro-forestry sectors./In 2003, when the Sindh minister for local government and special development, Muhammad Hussain, had directed the authorities concerned to plant eucalyptus in parks and along roads to eliminate pollution. Environmentalists then too, had voiced their concerns about eucalyptus being unsuitable for the environment as it consumes large quantities of underground water, hence destroying growth of native species, causes asthma in humans and repels insects and birds because of its scent./""Other than ornamental plants, eucalyptus and conocarpus have a high demand because they grow faster,"" says Noor Muhammad Qambrani who runs a forest nursery at Tando Muhammad Khan./But Nihal Khan Marri, an agricultural researcher disagrees. ""Farmers are increasingly removing eucalyptus from their lands because on the one hand it takes up entire available water which results in reduced crop yield and on the other its fallen salt-rich leaves cause degradation of fertile soil.""/It's ironic that a species which was introduced to reclaim degraded soil is now destroying fertile soils. Abid Hussain Rind, forester of Mirpurkhas endorses Marri's view. ""Earlier eucalyptus may have proved to be the most successful species, but now ruled out due to high water consumption and its timber being less useful because of fibre twist property.""/Learning no lessons from the previous disaster, the million-tree target of conocarpus plantation was initiated in 2009 by the City District Government Karachi and the species native to Africa and South America took Karachi by storm./While the conocarpus plantation was in its initial stages, a scientific research was conducted by Karachi University botanists in 2010, which revealed that massive release of pollen from Conocarpus in the months of October and November can cause asthma and eczema among humans. The imported alien species depletes water and soil along with giving rise to pollen and seasonal allergies when transplanted in Karachi./Why were exotic trees given preference over indigenous ones?/Dr Surayya Khatoon, Chairperson of the Botany department at Karachi University, sees it as a manifestation of an inferiority complex that our people seem to suffer from where they prefer imported things as opposed to local ones. The same, she says, is the case with trees./Another factor could simply be the relative difficulty involved in harnessing local species. Dr Surayya commented, ""Our horticulturists and foresters would have to collect their seeds from the wilderness, tend them carefully and they definitely take longer to grow. In their quest for faster growing plants, they opt for exotic species, which in an unfamiliar ecosystem dominate the other indigenous species which continue to grow at their normal pace.""/Presently, conocarpus is greening the areas around Shahrah-e-Faisal and Karsaz, Bin Qasim Park, Beach Park, DHA and University Road. It grows up to 20-40 feet and spreads around 15-20 feet in a short span and the bush-like appearance needs extensive trimming but can be groomed to an assortment of various shapes and sizes./""It is a popular residential street tree; can successfully grow in urban areas where air pollution, poor drainage, compact and saline soil, and/or drought is common,"" says Dr Tahir Qureshi at IUCN/However Dr Surayya points out that conocarpus is known for spreading pollen in the air in the same way as paper mulberry in Islamabad. ""Studies show that it can cause severe respiratory tract diseases and allergic reactions in humans.""/But Tahir Qureshi has refuted the claim and says ""no distinctive increase in allergy related disease has been noticed since the plant is vegetated for almost 10 years now."" Others believe that conocarpus releases some kind of chemical which hinders the growth of other variety of plants and trees, and also repels birds. ""This also is just a rumor or controversy and needs more research to prove it"" he added./The unchecked assimilation of these two less eco-friendly species is clear indication that research in forestry sector in the Sindh is in doldrums. Although two major research institutes i.e. Miyani Research Station and Agricultural University are located in the close vicinity at Hyderabad, their scientifically proven research-oriented contribution in the forestry sector is yet to be seen."
Air pollution and cancer," MOST commuters in Karachi have experienced getting stuck in traffic jams for an extended period during evening rush hour. The main concern of commuters at that time is reaching home in the shortest possible time. But now, the commuters have to worry about a potentially life-threatening side-effect of getting stuck in gridlock./In October, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the specialised cancer agency of the World Health Organisation, announced that it has classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans./The IARC concluded that there is sufficient evidence that exposure to outdoor air pollution causes lung cancer. It also noted a positive association with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Particulate matter (PM), a major component of outdoor air pollution, was evaluated separately and was also classified as carcinogenic to humans./While it is already known that increased exposure to air pollution causes health impacts like lower respiratory, cardiovascular, and reduced lung function problems and probably lung cancer, this is for the first time that the agency has given definitive and confirmed findings of lung cancer caused by outdoor air./So, as it turns out, the most widespread environmental carcinogen in Karachi, or for that matter in Hyderabad and Sukkur, is the air we breathe!/Components of air pollution that are major threats to human health in causing lung cancer are PM2.5 and PM10./To put a better perspective on the particle size, the size of a single hair from a person's head is about 70 micrometers in diameter. That means a single hair is 30 times larger than the largest fine particle./A large number of anthropogenic and natural sources contribute to airborne PM. These include cement industries, quarries, power plants, smelters, motor vehicles, buses, minibuses, trucks, solid waste burning, dust and tobacco smoke./While a systematic air quality monitoring network is not in place in Karachi, the level of PM2.5 in the city's ambient air during traffic congestion and at busy spots like Empress Market, Plaza (M.A. Jinnah Road) and Gurumandir, must be around 70 micrograms per cubic metre (ìg/m3). The WHO guideline value is 10ìg/m3 annual mean./In addition to the threats posed by PM, airborne lead is also of major concern. A study conducted in 1989 in Saddar found blood lead levels in schoolchildren as high as 38ìg/dl (micrograms per decilitre). A study conducted in 2002 in Karachi showed that over 80pc of the children have blood lead levels of more than 10ìg/dl. Airborne lead is due to the use of leaded gasoline in vehicles./Lead is implicated in neurological problems in children, including impaired cognitive, motor, behavioural, and physical abilities. Normally, a blood lead level of 10ìg/dl is taken as a maximum permissible concentration./Road traffic noise is also a nuisance in Karachi. Buses, minibuses, rickshaws and motorcycles produce noise of more than 100 dB(A) - decibels on A-weightage scale. Noise level of more than 65 dB(A) causes heart rate variability, hearing impairment, psychological problems, neurological complications including depression, sleep disturbance, ringing in the ears, annoyance and irritation./There are a number of technical strategies that can be used, quite often in combination, to improve the ambient air quality in Karachi. An efficient and decent bus rapid transit (BRT) system is a long-term solution that will take people away from their cars and put them in decent public transport./Other strategies include improved condition of roads; synchronisation of traffic signals; vertical extension of exhaust pipe; regular engine tuning and maintenance of ageing vehicles; car-pooling in schools and in offices; preventing on-street parking; staggered working hours (say in offices located along I.I Chundrigar Road) to lessen the traffic peaks; no-drive days (for example, no cars should be allowed in Saddar one day a week) and use of bicycles./The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) has the mandate to control air pollution in the province. It needs to take action against the smoke-emitting and noisy vehicles, polluting industries and departments responsible for burning solid waste out in the open."
Foggy days," THE density of the fog that has been blanketing parts of Pakistan for some years now has been steadily increasing. Steps urgently need to be taken to mitigate its effects./Many mistakenly think that the fog that has become the norm during the winters is the natural outcome of falling temperatures and relative humidity. However, fog created in this manner is localised and vanishes as the temperature rises./The persistence and intensity of the haze currently enveloping parts of the country is actually the effect of the deeper problem of air pollution. While automobile exhaust, the burning of dried leaves and other polluting activities are contributors, the single biggest factor is the use of coal for the generation of electricity in thermal power plants./In terms of air pollution, South Asia is amongst the most badly affected areas in the world. Unchecked industrial activity that uses fuels that endanger the environment has brought about severe changes in climate, including fog./Regions that don't have such polluting industries are not spared either: the levels of gases such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter have been increasing with pollutants being carried by the wind for thousands of miles. Consequently, pollution is an issue not just for the country that produces it but for other states as well./The phenomenon of persisting fog during December and January has been increasing in Pakistan over the past 15 years. Its range also includes the Indo-Gangetic plain that stretches from Peshawar to Kolkata and beyond. The single largest contributor to air pollution in South Asia is coal-run thermal power generation./The consumption of coal in South Asia during 2012 was around 685 million tons in total, out of which 98pc was used in India; the majority of this coal was consumed by the power sector. The share of electricity generated using coal as fuel in India is 71pc, 3.2pc in Bangladesh and 0.1pc in Pakistan. A report by the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy in Bangalore reveals that the quality of Indian coal is very poor, with 35-45pc ash content and low heating value. Thus, the generation of one unit of electricity emits one kilo of carbon dioxide; annually, almost 200 million tons of ash are generated by the use of coal in the power sector./Energy is vital for growth in India and consequently, the fog that envelopes Pakistan over the winter months has kept pace with its generation and grown thicker. Indian reports on the energy statistics of 2013 say that today India is the ninth largest economy in the world driven by a real GDP growth of 8.7pc. This has placed enormous demand on its energy resources./The demand and supply imbalance in energy is pervasive and requires serious efforts by the government of India to augment energy supplies. The country faces possibly severe energy-supply constraints. Nevertheless, India is violating transnational environmental laws by creating negative externalities for the countries it shares borders with./Indian scientists concede that coal-based thermal power plants are major air pollutants, including small particle pollutants - the aerosol./Recent studies using satellite modelling show a significant increase in aerosols in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Several reports also conclude that the coal supplied to power plants is of the worst quality. This factor, coupled with the low efficiency, results in more pollution. The emission of other, more hazardous gases, fly ash and suspended particulate are responsible for aggravating the greenhouse effect./Pakistan is suffering from dire changes in its climate. Many projects have been envisaged and some even pursued for remedying global warming, but the lack of clearly identified goals and effective strategies have resulted in zero gains./Like the fog that envelopes much of Pakistan, these efforts have been draped in a shroud of failed promises and never accomplished aims. Climate change has evolved into an industry in the country but the only effort is in terms of getting funding. Ensuring the implementation of practical measures is hardly on the agenda of any non-governmental organisation working in the climate change sector in Pakistan./While I appreciate the efforts of the present government for increasing cooperation with India, there is a need to augment these by taking steps to prevent environmental degradation. Pakistan needs to follow the model of the Asean agreement to come up with a `Transboundary Haze Pollution' model in South Asia. At the same time, other countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, have to find the courage to ask India to replace its coal-power plants."
University of Peshawar a suffocating garrison?," It's three in the afternoon and I am holed up with my laptop in my office at Khyber Medical College./The mere thought of venturing out at peak hours sends a shiver down my spine. Who in the right mind can drive on the smoke filled, congested bumper-to-bumper traffic during the peak hours on Peshawar roads? Particularly the Khyber Road, which was once an idyllic tree lined Grand Trunk Road originally conceived and constructed by Sher Shah Suri./Welcome to the modern world of noise and air pollution and never ending race for newer automobiles and SUVs competing in a mad rush with an assortment of rickety rickshaws, smoke belching buses, and four wheelers that could have been on the roads since the turn of 19th century!/In this light, it certainly not a pleasant experience for me, besides others, teaching in various professional institutions while commuting to work without wasting a good measure of precious time travelling from Hayatabad which is merely four kilometres in distance./If this is modern luxury, I would be a happier person living in some remote countryside without so called development and not exposed to the daily grind of hazardous travelling taking a heavy toll on my mental and physical health./WHO defines health as the state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing. For the hapless people living in Peshawar, this definition of healthy lifestyle does not hold true./The air and noise pollution statistics have tripled above the WHO permissible limits; unplanned urban development has defaced the renowned city of gardens and flowers, within last two decades./The University of Peshawar is a sorry reflection of the bygone glory as well./Designed on the 'grid iron' town planning pattern with Mughal, Greek, Indian influences, it was renowned for its clean and cool environment, shady boulevards and gardens./The architecture itself lent it a graceful ambiance. The ongoing development and mushrooming of several universities within the UoP campus has cramped the open spaces and destroyed natural and built environment. UoP is no more an oasis of tranquility and bliss./On February 14, things took a worse turn as the rival student organisations clashed on the celebration of Valentine's Day by the Pakhtun Students Federation and Modesty Day by the Jamiat zealots./Things got further flared up the next day, as students set on fire rooms of rival factions. Belatedly the UoP administration woke up from slumber and charge sheeted 17 students of opposing groups for arson and hooliganism./As a consequence, all roads, with the exception of Road No 2 leading to the UoP with as many as 50 institutions and universities have been permanently sealed. The students, faculty members, employees of these institutions thus suffer the daily humiliation of ending up on long queues not only during the peak hours but even normal times./Thus visiting the UoP for academic or other purposes is no less than a torture./While the gates at Islamia College should have been open for outgoing and incoming vehicles with university identification cards or stickers, blockading the entire campus from all directions is nothing less than turning it into a suffocating garrison and not the bygone academic institution of learning./The exponential growth of institutions and lack of dependable public transport has compounded the existing blockade as lines upon lines of slow moving vehicles move to and from Road No 2 contributing to the stress and anger of commuters./When I asked the lone policeman guarding the coffee shop gate at Islamia College, he complained of over work and stress./According to him he was on duty since 12 pm last night and shall continue till 12 noon. Where are your fellow policemen i asked? They have been summoned for ""other tasks"" as UoP is ""under staffed"" without adequate police force to guard all posts 24 hours. Given the level of security threat this is the most glaring example of unprofessionalism at UoP./Instead of closing down all roads and entry points of UoP why not install metal detectors, increase surveillance and check faculty ID cards/ car stickers? And lastly, get on with some more boots on ground before another violent breaking news erupts on this front./This is one reason given by the insiders for turning UoP into a garrison compound./P.S: I have thus taken to taking a public transport to and from UoP and avoid the humiliation at the suffocating and life threatening Khyber road, dug up for yet another expansion (a yearly futile exercise by C&W department) and uprooting a few existing trees and grassy lawns nearby. And making traffic worse!"
"Industries, hospital sealed for environmental degradation"," The Punjab environment protection agency (Punjab-EPA), on Wednesday, sealed two small industrial units on the charges of extracting oil from used tyres, in Taxila./The oil was being used as an alternate for furnace oil./District officer environment, Mian Mohammad Nawaz, told Dawn that it was reported to the district coordination officer (DCO) that two units of TDF were working in Taxila and producing sub standard fuel./""The process of extracting fuel from tyres creates a foul smell and a gas is emitted during the process, which may cause respiratory diseases among the nearby residents,"" he said./""The oil extracted from tyres was transported to industrial areas in Taxila, and caused air pollution when these industrial units burnt it. Oil and gas regulatory authority (Ogra) had already issued directions to stop these TDF plants,"" he said./He added that the team inspected the site and immediately sealed these two units of TDF, and launched a survey to find similar units in the Rawalpindi district./Meanwhile, Punjab EPA also sealed a private hospital and issued notices to 26 others in a campaign against hospitals, pathological laboratories and private clinics for polluting the environment due to improper disposal of the clinical waste./The team served the notices to 26 hospitals and sealed a private hospital, at Chakri Road, for dumping syringes and infectious bandages in the solid waste, instead of disposing them off separately to avoid the spread of infectious diseases./Mr Nawaz told Dawn that the Punjab-EPA recently surveyed the city and found that most of the hospitals and clinics failed to dump the hospital waste properly./""They had been asked to separate the infectious waste and other waste, and transport it to the incinerators installed at the Holy Family Hospital and at Morgah,"" he said./He said two incinerators were working at the Holy Family Hospital and the Attock Oil Refinery at Morgah, and some private and government hospitals were utilising them./When contacted, the Holy Family Hospital officials said that an incinerator worth Rs 20 million was installed in the hospital, but it was not being fully utilised by the private sector."
Strawberry fields forever," Mango may be the king of fruits, but strawberries reign supreme in the vale of simple pleasures. Their vibrant pinkish-red colour, delicate summer-fresh fragrance, and juicy sweet tartness all combine to make the beautiful berries impossible to resist./There was a time when some of us wistfully used a red crayon to fill in countless plump strawberries strewn over the pages of a colouring book which featured the cartoon character Strawberry Shortcake who lived in Strawberry Land with her cat, Custard. Meanwhile others stared longingly at television screens as spectators in Wimbledon enjoyed bowlfuls of strawberries and cream as the titans of tennis came face-to-face each summer./Not anymore. The succulent fruit is no longer confined to colouring books, television screens or lyrics sung by The Beatles in 1967. Instead it is fast becoming a common sight in Pakistan, particularly during spring and early summer. Fruit vendors on city streets will incite you to buy the luscious berries that are now cultivated in both the northern and southern regions of Pakistan./enter image description here/In ancient times, the strawberry was essentially a wild plant. It was used as a symbol for Venus, the Goddess of Love, because of its heart shape and red colour. Many centuries later, in Christian art it symbolised purity and righteousness, and many medieval stone masons carved strawberry designs on altars and around the tops of pillars in churches and cathedrals./This probably explains why in the language of flowers used by English poets and writers the strawberry symbolised perfection and sweetness in life and character. It also represented modesty because the berries are often found under the leaves. In Shakespeare's Othello the faithful Desdemona's handkerchief is ""spotted with strawberries"" (Act 3, Scene III)./The native Americans were already eating strawberries when the first European pilgrims arrived on their shore. They particularly enjoyed eating their berries mixed with cornmeal, which may or may not be a precursor of the baked Berry Crumble as we know it today. The natives believed that wild strawberries are a special gift of nature to children and women./This belief was shared by the Norse-speaking tribes which lived across Scandinavia and northern Europe. According to one particularly beautiful Norse legend, the spirits of children enter the afterlife by hiding in strawberries that are taken to heaven. Meanwhile in the court of Emperor Napoleon in France, Madame Tallien, who was a close friend and confidante of Empress Josephine, was famous for bathing in the juice of fresh strawberries./Not just pretty to look at, these delicate berries are one of nature's healthiest foods and contain a plethora of benefits. They are rich in Vitamin C and fibre, promote eye health, strengthen the body's immunity against cancerous cells, reduce inflammation of the joints, fight bad cholesterol and reduce blood pressure. Due to their antioxidant value strawberries are included on the list of super foods that protect the body's cells against damage that occurs due to aging but is often accelerated by external toxins, particularly air pollution and cigarette smoke./There are many tasty ways to enjoy this healthy fruit. Those who are watching their calorie intake can try to be content with strawberry milkshake, strawberry lemonade, or sliced strawberries and baby spinach salad. The rest are free to choose everything from strawberry shortcake and strawberries with cream mentioned above, to strawberry tarts, strawberry jam, and last, but certainly not the least, the very scrumptious option of whole fresh strawberries dipped in melted dark chocolate./Health leads to beauty and strawberries are packed full with natural beauty aids. They are abundant in salicylic acid which removes dead cells while tightening the pores and ellagic acid which combats skin damage to maintain its youth and freshness. They also help to protect the skin against the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, clear acne and reduce oil. Thus strawberries are a common ingredient in commercial anti-acne products, face toners and moisturising creams./Behold the berry best of summer/Treat yourself to a home spa treatment for stress relief. First make a nourishing mask by mixing some honey and lemon juice in a cupful of mashed fresh strawberries. Then spread it evenly over face and neck. Sit back, close your eyes, relax ... and resist the temptation to lick your face./Living is easy with eyes closed/Misunderstanding all you see/It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out/It doesn't matter much to me/Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields/Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about/Strawberry Fields forever/(Lyrics by John Lennon and Paul McCartney)"
"SAU, NGO sign accord for training of 300 youths"," The Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Sindh Rural Partner Organisation (SRPO), an NGO, for training of 300 youth from 12 union councils of Mirpurkhas division./SAU vice chancellor Dr Mujeebuddin Sahrai and NGO chief executive Zahida Detho signed the MoU at a simple ceremony in the senate hall of the university on Wednesday. Under this pact 300 youths would be imparted training by the SAU./Speaking on the occasion, the VC said people in Mirpurkhas, especially in Tharparkar, were dependent on livestock, but generally not aware of different diseases in animals. They lacked knowledge about marketing of diary products, he said, adding that this MoU would benefit these people and other stakeholders./He said that SAU's experts would share their skills to train youths, expressing the hope that these people would help other needy persons./Zahida Detho said the training was part of the Community Development Programme of the Sindh government under which 300 youths would be selected from 12 UCs of Mirpurkhas division for six months training./She said that many people in Tharparkar used traditional methods to counter different diseases among animals on account of insufficient number of veterinary experts. She said that after the training, youths would be able to earn money to support their families while farmers would get knowledge about marketing of meat, dairy products and by-products of milk./Dr Shamsuddin Tunio, Dr Noor Muhammad Soomro, Dr Maqsood Anwar Rustmani, Dr Sagheer Ahmed Shaikh, Dr Zaheeruddin Mirani and other officials were also present on the occasion./Web portal/Meanwhile, inaugurating a new web portal of the SAU, the VC said the university lagged behind in development, but with sincere efforts, it would join ranking of the top universities of the country./He said social media had changed values of the world and added that programmes would be designed in which paper free environment would be introduced and correspondence would be entirely through email./He said that speedy communication tools like video conferencing, satellite and internet for contacting other world universities/organisations had become an integral part of universities. There was a time when sharing of research used to take years, but in the present era of information technology, it had become a matter of a few seconds./He said the university faced difficulties on account of insufficient budget./MUET, Chinese varsity sign MoU/The Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (Muet), Jamshoro, and Beijing Technology and Business University, China, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to promote educational and academic exchanges between the two institutions,/Muet's Vice Chancellor Dr Mohammad Aslam Uqaili and Chinese varsity Vice President Prof Li Chaoxian signed the pact in Beijing on May 28./The two institutions would make every possible effort to encourage direct contact, educational and research cooperation between students, faculty members, departments and research institutes. They would endeavour to cooperate in the field of environmental and chemical engineering./According to the MoU, both institutions are interested to collaborate in the areas of air pollution and control, waste water treatment, solid and hazardous waste treatment, environmental management and chemical engineering./They agreed on cooperation in joint educational and research activities, exchange of academic materials and academic publications, exchange of faculty members for research, lectures and discussions and exchange of students for study and research./Implementation of the MoU wou­ld commence immediately and continue for five years. It could be revised or modified by mutual agreement./Programme postponed/The ceremony for fee reimbursement among students of less developed areas, which was to be attended by the prime minister in Sindh University on Thursday, has been postponed due to the law and order situation. New date would be announce later on, said a SU announcement."
"KPT's coal handling wreaks havoc on public health, environment"," The Karachi Port Trust's Keamari coal terminal operating in violation of environmental laws poses serious threat to public health, a visit to the site showed on Saturday./Enveloped in dark dust, the entire place with blackened streets, shops, mosques, historical buildings and other infrastructure was an evidence how the pollutant had ruined the port area once thriving with business and tourist activities./""Look at our faces and clothes. Can you believe that I had worn a clean dress in the morning?"" said a fruit vendor, pointing to his clothes./According to another person, the number of people suffering from respiratory diseases in the locality had increased dramatically over the past 10 to 12 years when the coal terminal had started its operation./""And it's not just Keamari residents who are being affected. People living on nearby islands also inhale polluted air and fall sick when the wind starts blowing towards their towns in the winter,"" said Abdullah, a Keamari resident./The place, he said, was used to be popular with local and foreign visitors who came in droves to see the nearby islands. But now even local people had stopped visiting the place./""Nobody likes to breathe in polluted air and spoil clothes,"" he said, adding that improper handling and transport of coal had seriously affected life and livelihood of the people living in the vicinity./What added to their troubles, according to him, were rashly driven dumpers whose numbers had significantly increased in recent months and, at times, the coal terminal operated even on holidays./One could see partially covered dumpers spilling coal while they transported it from the vessels to the yard where it was kept in the open./Terminal workers Dawn spoke to said that they were directly exposed to coal and no safety gadgets were provided to them./""I get Rs500 per day for a 10-hour job and that is to clean coal dust from the road,"" said Abdur Rehman, a recently employed worker whose face was blackened with coal dust./Area residents have protested many times against the authorities over the operation of the coal terminal and demanded that it be shifted away./""One of our colleagues also lost his life during a demonstration but all has gone in vain. Historical buildings such as the Karachi Port Trust tower built in 1913 and the Cowasjee building are also being destroyed by the heavy pollution at the site,"" said Murtaza, a social activist working with the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum./On the impact of coal dust on health, executive director for research and development services, Saquib Ejaz Hussain said that coal dust added to a range of health problems, including respiratory illness, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer./""Fine particles penetrate deeply into the lungs and are difficult for the body to expel. Over time these particles accumulate and do more damage. Epidemiological research suggests that there is no threshold at which health effects do not occur,"" he said./According to him, experts recognised (particulate matter) PM2.5 from the coal dust as a major air pollutant and health hazard./Violation of law/Replying to questions on coal terminal's operation, director general of the Sindh Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) Naeem Ahmed Mughal said that though he had 'informal knowledge' about the terminal, the KPT was operating the facility in violation of law as the organisation had never sought approval for the project from the provincial department./""The KPT is violating both the federal and provincial environmental laws. No Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report has ever been submitted to us. I will visit the site with my staff soon and examine the ground situation. The KPT will be asked to provide details on the terminal's operation,"" Mr Mughal claimed./Another important factor, he said, was to know the companies that were importing coal and its use. ""These companies are also required to have Sepa's approval for processing coal,"" he said./Giving the KPT's version, its public relations officer Shafique Faridi said the organisation had carried out a number of steps to ensure safe coal handling and transportation./""We have carried out plantation near the terminal area, besides building a protected wall to prevent spread of flying dust. Water is also sprinkled on the coal to reduce air pollution./""The KPT is considering two options to make the terminal operation safe; first is to build a conveyor belt from the vessel up to the yard and discard use of dumpers and the other is to shift the terminal to the site where deep water container terminal is being built and dedicate two berths for this purpose at the site that would be connected to a railway link.""/Regarding the use of safety gadgets and unsafe transport of coal in dumpers, he said that terminal workers were not under direct control of the KPT and were hired by different private companies. The organisation, however, monitored their activities and fined the companies violating the safety rules./As for open storage of coal, he said that most developing countries were using the same method for storing coal as it was considered safe./About 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes of coal, he said, was being brought daily at the port from different countries, including Australia, Indonesia and African states. It was largely meant for use in cement factories and now for plants generating electricity./""The government decision to use coal for electricity generation in the country will increase the scale of terminal operation,"" he said./On Sepa's approval for setting up a coal terminal, he said the company importing coal needed to submit an EIA report for processing coal and not the KPT."
Inaction makes air pollution stay in I sectors," Residents of I sectors of the federal capital have long been suffering industrial air pollution./Now, Pakistan's chief environmentalist has promised action against the polluters after seeing the enormity of the problem during an early morning drive through the area on Sunday./""I was simply shocked,"" said Dr M. Khurshid, Director General Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (EPA) about the grey smoke that greeted him on the drive that steel factories in the area start belching out around 5am every day./Dr Khurshid plans to serve notices on the owners of the steel mills ""immediately""./Citizens skeptical of latest plan of action against polluters/But the residents of the area are skeptical about government translating its plans into action. Inaction has been the hallmark of all such plans in the past, according to the residents./A senior official of the Climate Change Division of the federal government confirmed the citizens' skepticism./""EPA had forced the steel mill owners to install air filter bags but the agency failed to follow it up and monitor the levels of emissions from the mills and ensure that the filters were working properly,"" the official confided to Dawn./He explained how Environment Protection Agency never checked if the owners of the steel mills operated the filters that were supposed to absorb noxious content from burning and melting of scrap to produce steel./The smell around the mills is so toxic that it forces drivers to roll up windows of their vehicles while driving past and pedestrians and cyclists cover their faces instinctively./The official explained how all steel mills used low-grade bundled scrap to produce steel./""The low-grade bundled scrap is more often than not contaminated with oil and grease and even paint. And the reason we see thick black smoke is because the mill owners do not operate filters because operational costs run as high as the cost of one melting process of scrap that lasts three to four hours roughly,"" the official explained./""The Supreme Court ordered the shutdown of two steel mills in 2007 and then another two four years later for violating the environmental laws.""/Retired government officer Abdul Haq takes an early walk every day and has been doing so for many years./He wears a wet handkerchief across his face like a bandana./""I can't help it. The smell is just too strong sometimes. The mills operate non-stop round the week. Our children breathe the same contaminated air,"" said Mr Haq, who lives across the greenbelt from one of the steel mills./The residents in the neighbourhood complained that the smoke was so thick in the early morning that it seemed to be choking the whole Islamabad./""It is easy to conclude that the city managers lack resolve to deal with this problem,"" said a shopkeeper in the I-10 Markaz./And the working conditions in these steel mills are so bad that they sap the life out of the work force./""If the smoke is so dangerous for the residents in the area what about the workers in the mills? We deal with it everyday,"" said Abdul Razaq, who has been working in a steel mill at I-9 for three years without proper gear./""Working in a steel mill is hot and hard,"" said Mohammad Ramzan./As serious as the problem of air pollution from these mills is, there are no quick fixes, said the EPA director general./""With the environment tribunal non-functional, there is little EPA can do except serving notices on the owners./""However, we intend to come down hard on the violators of the environmental laws. It is imperative that the media highlights the problem and creates awareness about how steel mills in the sectors are contaminating the air,"" said Dr M. Khurshid, arguing that it was about time the government relocated the mills far away from the residential sectors./The air pollution caused by the mills is intolerable. It is affecting the quality of air in Rawalpindi and Islamabad alike,"" said Dr Khurshid./When two steel mills were approached, the security and even some labourers became hostile. ""Photography is not permitted. The owners of the steel mills do not approve it. Several reporters from TV channels came time and again and were dealt with accordingly,"" said one watchman of a steel mill at the I-9 sector."
"City air heavily polluted with lead, cadmium and CO"," The air of the city is polluted with high levels of lead and cadmium that pose a grave risk to public health, says a recent study that also points out that the average concentration of these trace metals found in residential areas of Karachi is higher than those found in Delhi and Beijing./The study conducted by the Pakistan Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's (PCSIR) Centre for Environmental Studies was authored by Durdana Rais Hashmi and co-authored by Dr Akhtar Shareef, Dr Alia Munshi and Farooq Ahmed Khan./Know more: Gasping for air/Under the study, 108 samples of particulate matter (a small discrete mass of solid or liquid matter that remains individually dispersed in liquid or gas emissions) were collected from main roads, roundabouts and open places along the busy roads of Karachi and these locations were categorised as commercial (54 sites), residential (36 sites), industrial (14 sites) and urban background (four sites) zones./Particulate matter includes a mixture of solids and liquid droplets. Particles come in a wide range of sizes. Those less than 10 micrometres in diameter (PM10) are so small that they can get into the lungs, potentially causing serious health problems./Ten micrometres is smaller than the width of a single human hair./According to the study's findings, the average concentration of lead in PM10 samples found in the city is 1.163 µg/ m3 and that of cadmium 0.008 µg/ m3 whereas the limit suggested by the WHO is 0.500 µg/m3 for lead and 0.005 µg/m3 for cadmium./Further analysis of the data shows that the maximum concentration of lead and cadmium found in the commercial zone is 3.5µg/ m3 and 0.019 µg/ m3 respectively. Maximum concentration of lead and cadmium in residential areas is 3.1 µg/ m3 and 0.024 µg/ m3. Maximum concentration of lead and cadmium in the industrial zone is 2.34 µg/ m3 and 0.020 µg/ m3./The urban background zone that covers areas having sparse population with low vehicular traffic, the maximum concentration for lead and cadmium is 0.12 µg/ m3 and 0.005 µg/ m3 respectively./The research provides a comparison of metal concentrations in particulate matter observed in the present study with other parts of the world. For instance, the metal concentration in Delhi's residential zone was found to be 0.01-0.02 µg/ m3 (cadmium) and 0.27-0.46 µg/ m3 (lead) and Beijing 0.005 µg/ m3 (cadmium) and 0.33 µg/ m3 (lead)./The US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines on lead and cadmium levels in particulate matter are 1.500 µg/ m3 and 0.006 µg/ m3./""Growing number of vehicles, consumption of leaded gasoline and poor road conditions are major causes for high concentration of lead and other trace metals in Karachi's environment, which is a great threat to public health,"" the study says./In recent decades, according to the research, there has been a growing concern over the potential contribution of ingested dust to metal toxicity in humans. Some trace metals are harmless in low concentrations such as copper and zinc, but some metals like lead and cadmium are toxic even in extremely low concentrations and are potential cofactors, initiators or promoters in many illnesses including cardiovascular diseases and cancer./A number of studies, it says, have linked particulate matter with a rise in premature deaths, hospitalisation, asthma symptoms, bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses. Senior citizens and persons with existing cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses appear to be more sensitive than the rest of the population./""Due to lack of air quality management capabilities, Pakistan is suffering from deterioration of air quality. Evidence from various government and non-governmental organisations has indicated that air pollution is a significant risk to environment, quality of life and human health,"" it says./Carbon monoxide (CO) threat/The scientists at PCSIR told Dawn that the institution had been studying air pollution levels for some years and an earlier research (published in 2011) focused on the threat of carbon monoxide./""A highly toxic gas, carbon monoxide is a major air pollutant. It can seriously affect human aerobic metabolism as it reduces the capability of the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues. Some studies suggest that reactivity of carbon monoxide with haemoglobin is 240 times greater than that of oxygen,"" says senior scientific officer Durdana Rais Hashmi./The results of the study (titled Investigation of carbon monoxide at heavy traffic intersections of Karachi using geographic information system to evaluate potential risk areas for respiratory and heart diseases) showed that average concentration of carbon monoxide at 20 locations out of 30 sites was very high and much above the permissible limit of 9 ppm./""Frequent traffic jams and congestions, old vehicles with poor maintenance and narrow roads with uneven surfaces that hamper traffic flow and rash driving are vital factors that increase levels of carbon monoxide in air,"" senior scientific officer at PCSIR Dr Akhtar Shareef said, adding that long-term exposure to low concentration of the gas had effects similar to short-term exposure to high concentrations./An increase and decrease in carbon monoxide concentration in air, according to Dr Shareef, is found to have a direct link with traffic flow./""There is a dire need to formulate regulatory laws to limit emission of gaseous pollutants from vehicles. Traffic geometry also plays an important part in avoiding congestion on the roads,"" he concluded."
D-Chowk cleaned to the relief of protesters," A private firm on Saturday removed garbage from the sit-in site and sprayed the area, much to the relief of the protesters sitting at D-Chowk for the last two weeks./Thousands of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Pakistan Awami Tehreek activists had been complaining about the heaps of garbage and the foul smell in the area./The Capital Development Authority (CDA) was supposed to collect the garbage, but it failed to do./Finally, a Lahore-based private sanitation company took the responsibility and removed the waste./""We have volunteered so that the protesters are provided a healthy environment,"" said Yasir Ali, the company's supervisor./When asked whether the company's owner had any affiliation with the PTI or PAT, Mr Ali denied that he was associated with either party./To a query, he said: ""No doubt, some of our workers are wearing PTI's badges, but that is their individual act.""/After the anti-littering campaign, D-Chowk gave a new look./""I'm very happy as it was getting difficult for us to bear the stinking smell,"" said Rehmat Khan, who came from Swabi to take part in the protest./Around 35 professional workers of the company took part in the campaign./""Today, we cleaned D-Chowk, tomorrow we will sweep the Constitution Avenue, where PAT workers were staging the sit-in,"" said Jamil Akhtar Bhatti, an official of the sanitation company./The Constitution Avenue, where thousands of PAT workers have camped since August 19, have lost its beauty, with garbage lying on the greenbelts, and giving out a stench./At the moment, the protesters, who have a one-point agenda of ""revolution"", are least concerned about their health./""There is no doubt that it is becoming difficult for us to stay here, but we will not go back till our demands are not met,"" said a PAT worker Mohammad Ilyas, who came from Sargodha./Another protester, Rizwan Mughal, a resident of Rawalpindi, said: ""We have tried to keep the area clean, but it is a difficult task as thousands of protesters have been living here for the last many days,"" he said./Mr Bhatti, the officer of the sanitation company, said the waste in the area was not only leading to air pollution but also spreading diseases among the participants of the sit-ins./The sanitary workers of the private firms dumped garbage in various corners of the D-Chowk./""We will dispose of this garbage at various dumping sites of the federal capital as soon as our van is allowed to enter the area to pick this pile of garbage,"" he said."
Sepa yet to take action against polluting sugar mills," The Sindh EnvironÂ­mental Protection Agency (Sepa) is yet to take action on a last year report that highlights high levels of pollution being caused by sugar mills./The report prepared by private consultants of the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority was part of the water sector improvement project phase-1. The objective was to help make a regional master plan for the left bank of the Indus delta & the coastal zone./The 19 sugar mills whose water samples had been tested were: Habib Sugar Mill, Sanghar Sugar Mill, Mirpurkhas Sugar Mill, Al Abbas Sugar Mill (Mirwah), Digri Sugar Mill, Ansari Sugar Mill (Badin), Seri Sugar Mill, Sindh Abadgar Sugar Mill, Shah Murad Sugar Mill, Dewan Bhudo Talpur Sugar Mill, Army Sugar Mill (Badin), Mirza Sugar Mill Kadhan, Khoski Sugar Mill, Pangrio Sugar Mill, Bawani Sugar Mill (Talhar), Farm Sheikh Bhirkio, Tharparkar Sugar Mill, T.M. Khan Sugar Mill and Mitiari Sugar Mill./""The effluent discharge from the sugar mills is highly polluted. The dissolved oxygen level is far below the normal limit that shows it may cause death of biotic life in drains especially fish. Likewise, the biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand are very high than the WHO permissible limits. This explains huge reduction in the dissolved oxygen level./""The total suspended solids are also higher than the permissible limits that hinder sunlight to penetrate into water to help photosynthesis to increase the oxygen level of waters,"" the report says./The samples collected from various locations of Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) & Kotri surface drains in 2012 also showed that all the parameters were above the permissible limits, it says. Therefore, it adds, the analyses of the samples collected from the sugar mills or drains suggest that the release of effluent in the drainage infrastructure is hazardous for human health and livestock. It is recommended that Sepa enforce the Environment Protection Act, 1997, making it mandatory for sugar mills to install in-house treatment plants, the report says./Effluent contains wastewater from boiler and slush from the processing plant and is mainly organic, with a small amount of non-organic substances. ""Of the process wastes, molasses spillage is, perhaps, the most difficult to deal with as it is solid and doesn't disperse easily,"" it says./Sugar mill effluents, the report says, seep through the soil from unlined ponds and drains and contaminate groundwater that people living around the sugar mills complain was their only source of water but they had to abandon its use./""Soils in sugar mills vicinity are found degraded. Villagers complain their livestock suffered from diseases and some of them also died due to the effluent being discharged by the sugar mill into drains,"" the report says, adding that birds were found dead in the drains (which carried effluents from the sugar mills)./According to sources, it's not the first time that concerns have been raised over the hazardous effluents being discharge from sugar mills, many of which have set up distilleries, thus increasing the scale of the pollution manifold./The situation, however, have attracted little official action. This is so because sugar mills are owned by people who are either part of the government or have influence on the government./Sources told Dawn that Sepa received a complaint against Al Abbas Sugar Mill, operating in Mirwah Gorchani, Mirpurkhas, from one of its directors last month. The complaint also carried a letter from mill workers, alleging that effluent discharge from the mill was causing serious health problems to residents of surrounding areas. ""The poisonous waste is destroying freshwater lakes./Drinking water of wells has turned brackish and poisonous due to chemical waste being released from the mill. In addition, the offensive and suffocating smell of chemical waste has forced hundreds of people to leave the area on health grounds,"" the letter says./Raheema Panhwar of Strengthening Participatory Organisation told Dawn that the untreated effluent was playing havoc with environment yet the government was silent. She said the SPO had recently conducted a research in Matli, Badin, where Ansari Sugar Mill operated./""Untreated effluent from the mill has destroyed drains which were once a major source of livelihood for locals. The water bodies [Ameer Shah drain, Phuleli drain and Ansari Sugar Mill drain] used to have ample quantities of fish while grass along their banks served as grazing ground for cattle. All have vanished now,"" she said./She said the effluent also turned the groundwater unsuitable for human consumption. Most of the villagers, the researchers spoke to, said their main loss was contamination of irrigation water. ""They also linked outbreaks of different diseases to the effluent,"" she said, adding that soil in the area was found highly saline, badly affecting crops./Sepa director general Naeem Mughal said though Sida had not shared its report with Sepa, there was no doubt that unsafe disposal of sugar mill effluent was a serious issue. ""There are around 32 sugar mills in Sindh. Of them, only a few have treatment plants. Among environmental hazards caused by the sugar mills a critical one is air pollution caused by flying ash that is released when the mill waste is used as fuel,"" he said./He confirmed that a complaint had been received against Al Abbas Sugar Mill. A body was set up to look into the case, he said, adding that samples collected from the site had been sent for  analysis whose report would be ready within a week./Sugar mills, he claimed, were off and on inspected and, in some cases, were prosecuted for violating environmental laws. ""It's the result of our directives that many sugar mills have set up oxidation ponds to treat waste-water. But this is not enough, as it only helps to reduce contamination to a limited level,"" he said."
Hazards of industrial waste highlighted," As many as 80 per cent of the industrial effluent is going to the canals whereas 20 per cent is becoming part of underground water that is playing havoc with the lives of people./Crops and vegetables being cultivated by using industrial waste can cause serious health hazards to consumers./This was echoed in a meeting between scientists of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad and 16th Senior Management, National Management College, Lahore, to discuss research studies on water and air quality on Wednesday./Southern Punjab Poverty Alleviation Project Director Irshad Husain headed the delegation that comprised Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council Deputy Secretary Hamid Nisar, Establishment Division Director Sharaf Jehan and Ministry of Religious Affairs Director Noor Salam./UAF ViceChancellor Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad said longterm use of such vegetables could expose people to diseases. He said most of the water was being utilised for the agricultural purposes. He said industrial effluent was also contaminating the underground water./He said separate drinking water and household water supply lines were required across the county to ensure the availability of potable water to the people./Faculty of Agriculture Dean Prof Dr Muhammad Arshad said sewerage and industry waste water was being dumped into single source that was aggravating the situation. ""Mixing of household drainout water and industrial waste water is making difficult for experts to treat them and convert the toxic water into nontoxic water.""/He said industrialists were reluctant to set up the waste water treatment plants at their units that was a real challenge. He said law on water and air pollution must be implemented in letter and spirit./Irshad Husain said industrial effluent treatment was essential to provide a healthy environment to citizens. He said it was need of the hour to treat the industrial and waste water./Institute of Soil and Environmental Sciences Director Prof Dr Javaid Akhtar called for adopting the measures to protect environment as per international standards. He said climate changes were posing a serious threat to the people and Pakistan was its worst victim./Prof Dr Ghulam Murtaza said effluent water must be treated at the industrial area."
Pakistan ranks third for pneumonia deaths in the world," Pakistan ranks third in the list of 15 high burden countries where the estimated deaths of children by pneumonia is alarmingly high./According to the latest report, 71,000 children die of pneumonia every year in Pakistan. The report says India is at the top where 174,000 children die annually followed by Nigeria (121,000), says a senior official of the health department while talking to Dawn./The report has been released by the Global Coalition Against Child Pneumonia in the wake of the World Pneumonia Day 2014 which was observed on Wednesday across the world./The health official says the Global Coalition Against Child Pneumonia announced that the theme of the 2014 World Pneumonia Day commemorations will be ""Universal access to pneumonia prevention and care""./71,000 children die annually in the country/Quoting some contents of the ""Pneumonia Fact Sheet2014"", he says Pakistan is even far behind some lowprofile countries in preventing deaths of children under five years of age by this disease. These countries include Ethiopia (35,000), Angola (26,000), Indonesia (22,000), Afghanistan (20,000), Kenya (18,000), Bangladesh (17,000), Sudan (17,000), Uganda (16,000), Niger (15,000), and Tanzania (14,000)./""Pneumonia is the number one infectious killer of children under age 5 globally, killing an estimated 9,350,002 children each year,"" the report says. Pneumonia causes 15pc of all deaths in children under age 5 worldwide  2pc of which are newborns./The report has also issued fresh guidelines for the world, particularly the 15 high burden countries, for prevention and control of children deaths by this fatal disease. It stresses exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life and adequate nutrition up to age 5 improves children's natural defenses, protecting them from pneumonia. It says more than 50pc of pneumonia deaths among children under 5 globally were linked to household air pollution./The World Health Organisation's new guidelines on indoor air quality set targets for reducing harmful household pollutants and offer greater clarity on specific fuels considered unsafe for use in the home. Immunisation against Haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough can prevent cases of pneumonia from ever occurring./Former Dean of Children's Hospital Lahore Prof Tahir Masood told Dawn the major factor behind the enormous ratio of deaths among children by pneumonia was the failure of primary healthcare programmes in Pakistan and lack of commitment to fight the disease./He said the acute respiratory infection programme was launched by the World Health Organisation in Pakistan in order to prevent deaths of children under 5 by pneumonia. He said the programme was later replaced by the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) but after launching it as pilot project in some major cities, including Multan and Quetta, this programme also met the same fate./Also read: Stilled life/""Now the government is addressing all the children diseases under Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health (MNCH) programme which could not bear fruit,"" Prof Tahir said. He said Pakistan's progress towards the MDG4 was desperately less than the target set for 2015./""Pakistan's ratio in the prevention of deaths of children under 5 was reported 1.5 so far, compared to the 3.5 set under the MDG4,"" Prof Tahir Masood lamented./He expressed dissatisfaction with the sorry state of affairs regarding the measures for saving lives of the minors, saying the IMNCI and ARI programmes were significantly getting progress in other countries./He said controlling childhood pneumonia required correct and consistent delivery of an integrated package of interventions to protect, prevent, and treat the disease."
"KPT coal terminal violating environmental laws, SHC told"," The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency informed a twojudge bench of the Sindh High Court on Monday that the Karachi Port Trust was operating a coal handling terminal in Shireen Jinnah Colony without adhering to the environmental laws which not only constituted an environmental hazard but also posed a serious threat to the health of the workers and people living in the vicinity./The bench headed by Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was hearing a petition against the KPT coal terminal filed by residents of the locality./The petitioners, represented by Advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam, submitted that due to the coal terminal and its dumping, inhabitants of the area were facing serious environmental effects, which fuelled respiratory diseases in the locality./They said that on average five ships carrying 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of coal berthed every month and about 200,000 tonnes of the coal was handled at the terminal located at Iqbal Ground in Clifton Block 1./On Monday, the Sepa director general submitted a report which said that the KPT had not obtained its approval for operating the coal handling terminal in the area./According to the Sepa report, the whole process from unloading of coal to its dumping and transportation to different industrial units involved serious environmental hazards./It said that during inspection, it was noted that the coal material found on the berth and jetty flowed into the port waters during washing or rain, adding to marine pollution./The report said that during the transportation of coal from the terminal to the coal yard, a distance of three to and four kilometres, the coal dust flew into the air from the open trucks, causing air pollution throughout the route. ""It is obvious that hundreds of people in this particular location could be affected from respiratory, eye and other diseases due to the air pollution containing coal dust particles"", it added./The report said that coal dust was found in the houses situated in the densely populated area of Keamari and areas in close proximity to the terminal./It further said that environmental issues relating to storage of coal were significantly adverse in nature as a huge quantity was being stored at the coal yard./The report further said that in view of the coal storage site and its handling in highly densely populated area in a highly crude manner, the entire area suffered an environmental disaster./The bench directed the KPT to submit a detailed and comprehensive report on the matter within a month./The court also ordered the authorities concerned to ensure that the coalladen trucks were properly covered. It further ordered the KPT to sprinkle water on the coal dumped in the open to minimise its adverse effects on the environment. The hearing was adjourned to Nov 26./FBR promotion case/Another division bench gave a last chance to the principal secretary to the prime minister, establishment division secretary and others to file their respective comments in a petition of senior officers of the Federal Board of Revenue seeking approval of a summary by the PM./The bench comprising Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Azizur Rehman was hearing the petition of 33 FBR officers who were promoted to grade21 by the department six months ago./Lala Fazalur Rahman, Shafiq Mehesar, Shahid Baloch and others, represented by Barrister Dr Farogh Naseem, submitted that the summary regarding their promotion to next grade was forwarded to the prime minister for approval, but it had been pending disposal before the PM for the past several months./They submitted in the petition that they belonged to Sindh and they thought that they were not being promoted due to a biased attitude of the federal government./The bench gave a last chance to the respondents to file their respective comments, and put off the hearing to a date to be later announced by the court's office."
Punjab-EPA finds noise levels dangerously high," The Metro Bus Project has increased noise levels in the city, forcing the Punjab Environment Protection Agency (PunjabEPA) to recommend establishment of buffer zones between commercial and residential areas./Last week, PunjabEPA conducted a survey in the garrison city under the supervision of Deputy Director Maqsood Ahmed at three points including Raja Bazaar, Committee Chowk (Murree Road) and Pirwadhai and found the noise level much higher than the national standard./A decibel (dB) is the unit used to measure the intensity of a sound. At Raja Bazaar the noise level was found to be at 75 dB, at Committee Chowk (Murree Road) at 85 dB and in Pirwadhai at 90 dB. However, the national standard for the noise level is 4555 dB for residential areas, 5565 dB for Commercial areas and 6575 dB for Industrial areas./After conducting the survey, PunjabEPA sent a recommendation to its head office for the establishment of buffer zones in the above mentioned areas as soon as possible./In its report, the department said that residents in these areas are in at risk for deafness, hypertension and mood swings. ""The local administration had been directed to build parks, plant trees and grass,"" the report said./It also recommended launching a campaign against those vehicles and commercial units which are producing more than the allowed level of noise in an area./This survey caused concern among authorities, as all the main hospitals are also located in these areas and the noise levels may begin to affect patients./There is regular movement of heavy vehicles such as trucks, buses in the Pirwadhai area which emanate smoke. However, neither Parks and Horticulture Authority nor the forest department has take any initiative to plant trees here./District Officer Environment Muhammad Nawaz admitted that noise pollution in the garrison city has reached a dangerous level and causing health problems./""If noise levels increase above 50 dB then it will create health problems in residents,"" he said./He added that there is a dire need to establish buffer zones. ""Between commercial and residential areas, a two kilometer long area with parks, green belts and trees will be created to lessen the impact of noise levels,"" he said./To a question, he said that he agreed that the Metro Bus Project had increased noise levels and that a test will be conducted soon to determine air pollution levels as well./He said that PunjabEPA has begun to take action against noise producing vehicles in city. In the last two days, the two teams issued challans to 14 vehicles and collected Rs6750 as fines."
Official tales of environment protection leave judges unimpressed," Federal and provincial officials tried to impress the Supreme Court with their efforts to stop environmental degradation in the country on Thursday but the justices were not amused./""Islamabad is no more the clean city it used to be a decade ago,"" Justice Ejaz Afzal reminded the representative of the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency Muhammad Arshad Cheema as he narrated to a twojudge bench the steps taken ""to control pollution""./Different judges on the bench, set up in 2003 to look into the allround environmental degradation, have heard the officials on the issue previously in 2009 and 2013./""Islamabad is faced with problems like pollution, smoke emitting vehicles, dust and broken sewerage system and overflowing gutters,"" observed Justice Afzal when Mr Cheema told his bench that stone crushing activities in Margalla Hills had been closed down by the EPA./Similarly, the officer said, oil refineries have been asked to control harmful emissions by installing modern devices to keep air clean. Unfit and smoke emitting vehicles are also being discouraged to ply on the roads./But the bench, not satisfied with these efforts, invited the officer's attention toward excessive denuding of the forests, especially in areas adjoining Khanpur and Mari, resulting in occasional land sliding./The justices noted that overflowing sewage was one of the biggest sources of pollution but was being ignored by the authorities, especially in the capital. They ordered the federal and provincial governments to submit comprehensive reports that effective steps were being taken to control the ever increasing pollution./Simultaneously, the governments should commence awareness campaigns to educate citizens on how to keep sight seeing places and mountains clean and safe./Additional Advocate General Punjab Razzaq A. Mirza said the Punjab government had installed water treatment plants in different cities. But the court observed that clean drinking water was still not available to people living in farflung areas./The Punjab government has also started installing wastewater treatment plants under the administrative control of the Public Health Engineering Local Government and Community Development. This activity will ensure availability of proper sewerage system and elimination of water contamination through mixing with sewage./New environmental laboratories have been established at Sheikhupura, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Rahimyar Khan, the Punjab report said./It also stated that Field Testing Kits for measurement of ambient air quality parametres of vehicular exhaust gases and noise have been procured, and that 164 air pollution control devices have been installed by different industrial units./The environment department is promoting environmental friendly power generation plants by installing solar and bio gas systems./To minimise pollution in urban centres, the department has issued environmental approval to environmentfriendly projects including the Metro Bus, underpasses and road widening projects./Additional Advocate General Sindh Shafi Chandio told the bench that the provincial government was considering launching mass urban transport system that includes metro buses for Karachi. Heavy penalties have been imposed on vehicles not suitable for roads, he said./Unimpressed, the judges asked what was the use of projects not beneficial for the citizens? They also pointed out to the law officer the heaps of garbage seen on the roads of Karachi."
Pulmonary disease claims 2m lives annually," Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is likely to cause more deaths than any other disease in the country as it stems from smoking and pollution./Dr Anjum Naveed Jamal, Pulmonology Department head of the Multan Institute of Cardiology, said this at a press conference on Tuesday./""The nonavailability of data on COPDrelated deaths in the country is also helping the disease go unchecked and increase at a rapid pace,"" he said, adding ""a COPD patient who could be cured through proper medication often gets ignored and labeled with other respiratory diseases.""/Pakistani health professionals do not have an insight due to the lack of data, he said./Dr Jamal said pollution particles such as smoke, dirt, mould or pollen risked human health as they could be inhaled and stuck in the respiratory system./Country's social setup, standard of living, illiteracy, selfmedication and unawareness along with exposure to air pollution contributed towards COPD outbreaks, he said./""Although, smokers are at the direct risk but they can also harm other people as well by sitting in a gathering and creating pollution for nonsmokers. Similarly, air pollution is another risk factor for nonsmokers and it is as dangerous as smoking,"" he said./He said that according to the World Health Organisation indoor air pollution resulting from the use of biomass fuels was responsible for nearly two million premature deaths each year worldwide./""It is of no surprise that any person exposed to pollution might have become a victim of lung disease or COPD for quite some time. People should have themselves diagnosed if they are exposed to pollution,"" he said./He said indoor pollution in the third world countries was playing havoc with the lives of the people. In such countries people are exposed to household air pollution owing to poverty, rural to urban migration and use of nonbiodegradable plastic bags that generate more pollution when burn./""Nonetheless, black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful climate change pollutants. These factors take more lives of adults as over one third of premature deaths from the COPD in adults are because of household air pollution,"" he added./He said that in the developing countries like Pakistan men were at greater risk than women and more frequently caught up by COPD due to smoking habits. It is of no surprise that people who smoke regularly and are exposed to dense indoor pollution are at the double risk of premature death caused by the COPD./He added outdoor air pollution also contributed to nearly 1.3 million deaths each year in the developing and developed countries./""According to a foreignfunded study aimed at delivering quality asthma and the COPD care through primary health care facilities in Pakistan, non communicable diseases are among the top 10 causes of mortality and morbidity in Pakistan,"" he said./He said patients had to take care of their routines and habits. They needed to avoid triggers like cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes and dust./Once diagnosed with the COPD, one needs to take daily medication to fight with it along with shortacting rescue inhalers as the COPD is a chronic disease and has no cure while the only way to counter is through healthy living and using prescribed therapies./""Respiratory diseases are most predominant with a 26.5 percent of prevalence among the patients,"" he said./He said the estimated COPD mortality rate was 71 deaths per 100,000, which was the fourth highest rate among the 25 most populous nations in the world while the current estimated prevalence of asthma was close to 15 percent in the general population with an expected 5 percent annual increase./He said awareness among the family members regarding cleaning up the air would help save children under the age of five and the elderly while slashing risk factors./""We should realise that women and infants who spend more time indoor are at greater risk, so parents should avoid smoking in rooms and children should be kept away from smoke generating by coal and wood cook stoves,"" he concluded."
Margallas in danger," EFFORTS to stop commercial stone-crushing and quarrying activities in the Margalla Hills in and around Islamabad are not new./Conscientious citizens and officials have for long tried to put an end to such activities in the Margalla Hills National Park, where quarrying and crushing were outlawed by a 1979 ordinance. But despite even the Supreme Courts intervention, these activities have continued unabated in the hills./At a hearing on Monday, the apex court came down hard on the Capital Development Authority for failing to protect the national park; it described the Margallas as a ""national asset"" and a ""public trust""./Also read: Besides pollution, stone crushing plant owners violate labour rights/The CDA in the past had said also under court pressure that it would demolish stone-crushing units within the park area. Unfortunately, this has not happened./But the threat such operations pose to the ecological diversity of the Margallas, as well as to the health of the workers employed by the units, and of those living near the plants, calls for concerted action before the lush green hills are forever denuded./Firstly, it must be asked why units have been allowed to operate in protected parkland, in clear violation of court orders and the law./Numerous animal and plant species are at risk due to the commercial activities. Environmental experts also point out that quarrying activities affect the health of the population by adding to air pollution./Particulate matter found in the air in areas where crushing takes place has been found to be much higher than acceptable standards. Labourers employed at the units, apart from working in a dangerous environment, often end up suffering from pulmonary and respiratory diseases./All these factors illustrate the seriousness of the matter. Efforts must be made to immediately stop commercial activities in the protected parkland and to shift these to areas located far from population centres. And wherever quarrying and crushing activities are taking place, dust-suppression methods must be employed to minimise workers exposure to particles and control the level of air pollution."
Feasibility report estimates Rs7 billion for canal brick lining," A feasibility report by the National Engineering Services of Pakistan and two private consultant companies on the proposed brick-lining of Trimmu-Sidhnai (TS) link canal has estimated the project cost at Rs7 billion./It says the gross area affected with water logging due to the seepage of water from the canal banks is 129,239 acres./The report recommended that besides the lining of 120,000-foot long canal and the construction of drains along either side of the canal, 310 drainage tubewells be installed to drain water./It also proposed construction of a parallel channel with a 6,500 cusec capacity on the left side of TS link canal to lower the water level. The report adds that as a result of brick lining, 550 cusecs of water will be saved which is wasted in seepage./The report was prepared on the directions of Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif./The report reads that due to the water logging, water has accumulated in the form of stagnant pond which serves as a breeding ground for mosquitoes, resulting in various vector diseases like malaria and dengue while humidity causes rashes on skin like skin allergy./The report added foul odor of the stagnant water was also a source of air pollution while in rainy season the situation became even worse and people had to move to other areas./Another fact mentioned in the report is that agricultural land has become uncultivable due to water logging. Many people of the area have migrated to other areas and the people of villages along the canal have migrated in masses. The continuous seepage of canal water has impacted agriculture activities because farmers cannot sow any crop due to standing water. If they sow any crop, given the sporadic relief from water logging due to lowering canal water level, the crop is spoiled before the harvest stage as the water logging weakens it./The report also mentioned that buildings were also affected in the area due to water logging and foundations of the buildings remained subject to continuous decay that led to their ultimate collapse./It said that of the 10,744 acres, most had been abandoned as no crop could survive in the area, while 55,650 acres grew low yield crops. The affected areas were in Shorkot, Kabirwala, Pirmahal, Khanewal and Toba Tek Singh. The fodder shortage for animals had forced the farmers to rely on their damaged wheat crop to feed their animals./Animals remained malnourished most of the time and thus their milk and meat productivity was lower than that of the other areas./Pirmahal Farmers Association president Chaudhry Shafqat Rasool said Rs3 billion, of the estimated Rs7 billion, could be saved if the construction of two drains on both sides of canal was dropped. He added that report proposed installation of 310 tubewells but the seepage could be controlled with brick lining only and tubewells were not needed. He said when a delegation of affected farmers had met the then Punjab irrigation secretary Rab Nawaz Bharwana about a year ago, he had agreed with them that an alternate channels construction was not necessary before the start of brick lining of the canal as the water supply in the canal could be supplied through Khanki-Balloki-Ravi-Sidhnai route or through Qadirabad-Balloki-Ravi-Sidhnai route./PML-N MPA Mian Muhammad Rafiq who had led various protest rallies of the affected farmers of his constituency and had raised voice on Punjab assembly floor, told Dawn he had requested the chief minister to allocate funds for brick lining in the annual development programme of the Punjab budget of 2015-16."
Asking for air to breathe," Emissions from the steel mills in the capitals industrial area is polluting the air, residents breathe, and gradually destroying the environment./Early each morning, the dense black and white smoke from these mills combines to become a grayish haze which hangs over sectors I-8, I-9 and I-10 and the areas across I.J. Principal Road, in Rawalpindi./The smog hangs over these areas for a few hours each day. Residents are forced to breathe this polluted air and the stench of smoke is overpowering./Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) Director-General Dr Mohammad Khurshid told Dawn that last year, his agency began a campaign to stop the emissions from the steel mills but not much progress has been made./""The Pak-EPA has been serving notices to these mills and their cases have been forwarded to the environmental tribunal. Beyond this, there is not much I can do,"" he said./But Dr Khurshid is not optimistic about the ability of the tribunal to stop the mills from damaging the environment. He said that the tribunal was only established last November./""The tribunal is ineffective and violators of the environmental laws are aware of this. The tribunal can, at best, impose a Rs10,000 fine on the factories. This amount is pocket change for these giant businesses,"" said Dr Mohammad Khurshid./According to him, fining and arresting violators, on the spot are needed to effectively implement environmental laws./""The weak enforcement of laws is the reason for environmentalists losing every battle against stone crushers, timber mafia, developers and steel mills because the laws are weak. The strongest instrument of the law is the power to arrest people and impound their machinery,"" he said./The Pak-EPA director general said the Environment Protection Act 1997 favoured the chambers of commerce and industry and the agency had suggested amendments to the law./""Environmental violations must be made criminal offences,"" he said./Until the amendments to the law are approved, the Pak-EPA is trying to find ways to address the problem of air pollution on the basis of the existing law. The present Environment Protection Act 1997 includes a provision which allows the Pak-EPA to seek support from the local administration in making arrests./Dr Khurshid said the Pak-EPA had also requested the climate change ministry to establish a regulatory authority like the PTA or Pepra to monitor environmental violations./The Pak-EPA has issued warnings against the harmful effect of poisonous fumes to human health. Short-term exposure to toxic gases can cause the narrowing of airways and difficulty in breathing. The residents of these sectors are also pessimistic about the possibility of the quality of air they are breathing to improve./""We are merely demanding justice. Is clean air and clean water too much to ask for,"" said Suhail Agha, a resident of Sector I-9."
Experts demand efficient transport system for city," Highlighting how public health and safety is being compromised on account of a haphazard increase in the number of private vehicles on city roads, participants in a seminar on Thursday urged the provincial government to introduce the desperately needed bus rapid transit (BRT) system in the city./Air of Karachi, it was pointed out, had become highly polluted and studies had shown that the increase in air pollution was directly responsible for a rise in lung and cardiovascular diseases. Besides, there was a serious threat of mental retardation in newborns exposed to the high levels of lead in mothers womb./Titled Sustainable transport, a solution to traffic issues in Pakistan,"" the event was organised by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as part of its project funded by the United Nations Development Programme and Global Environment Facility./Giving a presentation on the impact of transport emissions on human health, Dr Zafar Fatmi, head of a research group at the division of environmental health sciences of the Aga Khan University, said the impact of outdoor air pollution was much wider than what had been generally believed; it affected not just human health but also natural resources, agriculture and heritage, besides contributing to global warming and climate change./Recently, he said, the World Health Assembly had declared air pollution as the worlds largest single environmental health risk./""That means national health authorities have a key role to play and health concerns regarding air pollution should be integrated in all relevant policies,"" he said./""It also means that member states should develop air quality monitoring systems and set up registries for all illnesses related to air pollution.""/Continued exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter (a mixture of suspended solid and liquid particles in air), carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides, he said, were known to cause serious illnesses./Citing recent studies conducted by the AKU in Karachi, he said the city had been found to have high levels of PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter that are so small that they can be detected only with an electronic microscope. Sources of fine particles include all types of combustion, including vehicles and power plants)./""The minimum and maximum PM2.5 level was 27µg/m3 and 278 µg/m3 while the annual mean was 88.5 µg/m3. However, according to the WHO guidelines, the PM2.5 level should be 15 µg/m3,"" he explained with the help of a slide./Sharing finding of a 2009 study in which the levels of exhaled carbon monoxide among roadside vendors and commuters in Saddar and Gadap towns were examined, he said that it was found that about 70 per cent people had higher levels of the toxic gas./""In 2008, we conducted a study to determine lead levels in newly born babies for which we examined the blood of their umbilical cords. Shockingly, 90pc babies had lead levels above 5 56µg/dL (the standard earlier set for lead presence in the blood but now it is said that there should be zero exposure to the chemical as there is no safe level),"" he said./About the impact of lead exposure to health, he said that it affected intelligence and could potentially cause mental retardation in cases with higher lead levels./Recommending measures, he said that improvement in fuel quality, vehicle technology, traffic management, public transport regulation and control could help control air pollution./Giving a presentation on road safety implications of public transport, Dr Mir Shabbar Ali, head of the urban and infrastructure department of NED University of Engineering and Technology, explained the nature of road traffic collisions and the reasons resulting in crashes./Apart from human factors that included drivers skill, age, judgement, experience and attention, fault/s in the roadway, vehicle design and manufacturing, traffic control devices as well as the weather and visibility situation could also contribute to a traffic crash./Citing an EU report of 2012, he said road fatalities were the lowest for buses (0.4pc), trams (3.3) and bicycles (6.6) while the ratio was the highest for cars (46.4pc) and motorbikes (17.7pc)./On Karachi, he said motorbikes were involved in 67pc accidents, followed by cars/taxi/van (18pc), bus/minibus/coach (8pc) and rickshaw (7pc)./He blamed the increasing use of motorbikes on the lack of an efficient public transport system and said that low- and middle-income group families were forced to use motorbikes as a mode of family transport./The National Highway, Korangi Road, M.A Jinnah Road, Sharea Faisal, Superhighway, Hub River Road and Mauripur Road, he said, were some major roads frequently witnessing traffic accidents./Earlier in his opening remarks, country representative of IUCN-Pakistan Mahmood Akhtar Cheema said the Pakstran project was being implemented with the help of the Sindh and Punjab governments./""The $7.8m project focuses on the development of mass transit systems in Pakistan that are safe, clean and comfortable for citizens. The five-year project is aimed at reducing the growth of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said./Syed Kamran Haider Naqvi and Fauzia Bilqis Malik, both from the IUCN, also spoke."
Economic Survey reveals alarming facts about environmental degradation," Today, as Pakistan observes the World Environment Day 2015, 50 per cent of all human excretion generated by its 200 million people will find its way into fresh water bodies. And 40 per cent of people will die from water borne diseases./These were some of the disturbing revelations made in the Economic Survey 2014-15 launched by the Ministry of Finance here on Thursday./Spread over 180 pages, the Survey states that majority of the country's population quench their thirst from unsafe and polluted sources of surface and ground water. Across the length and breadth of the country, water is contaminated with bacteria (68 per cent), arsenic (24 per cent), nitrate (13 percent) and fluoride (5 per cent)./The survey sketches a gloomy picture of the state of biodiversity in Pakistan and notes that urban development at the cost of environment has made it difficult for the government to meet the challenges of climate change. It is also stated that natural resources are depleting fast./The survey points out that the country's efforts to manage solid waste have failed. In particular, it discusses one of the most dangerous and often ignored aspects of improper waste disposal: medical and industrial waste being treated as municipal waste./From collection to transportation, the mechanism for solid waste management is abysmal, especially in rural areas, where garbage is dumped in open spaces causing environmental degradation and increasing risks of communicable diseases./While Pakistan ranks among the top five countries vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the country has failed to save its forests. Pakistan had committed, under the Millennium Development Goals, to increase forest cover to 6 percent by 2015, which could not be achieved due to financial constraints./And the picture gets even more dismal when the Economic Survey highlights how Pakistan's 5, 000 glaciers are retreating faster than bodies of ice in any other part of the world. The consecutive floods from 2010 to 2012 caused $15 billion in losses affecting more than 20 million people and displacing some 300, 000./However, the Survey neglected to discuss air pollution./In his message on World Environment Day, Minister for Climate Change, Senator Mushahidullah Khan emphasized on how unsustainable patterns of consumption and production were one of the pre-dominant causes of environmental degredation in the country./We cannot afford to waste natural resources at any level. Resources are fast diminishing because of their unsustainable use, said the minister./Mushahidullah Khan highlighted that the goal of sustainable development was to increase the quality of life for all people without increasing environmental degradation and without compromising the resource needs of future generations./The minister said that the World Environment Day should be celebrated by becoming more conscious and aware of the ecological impact of our life styles. We must think about the environmental consequences of the choices we make. Our future will depend on choices we make today, he said."
"Heart, lung diseases linked to pollution"," India, Pakistan, China and Iran are the world's most polluted countries while Karachi is the most environmentally degraded city of Pakistan./This was stated by Prof Mohammad Sharif Shaikh, chairman of the geography department of Shah Abdul Latif University (Salu) Khairpur, while quoting the World Health Organization's (WHO) reports for years 2008-13 at an extension lecture on environmental degradation./The event was held to mark the World Environmental Day, according to a Salu press release issued on Tuesday./He said that from acid rain to global warming, heart diseases, acute respiratory problems and toxic pollution had devastating impact on human health as well as on the environment. The professor said that more than 200 million people worldwide were affected by air pollution. According to an estimate, air pollution caused 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012. Asian countries were leading in air pollution, he added./He suggested that civic bodies, NGOs and individuals put their efforts for plantation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must play its due role in eradication of environmental degradation."
"Environmental problems claimed 45,000 lives in Sindh in 2009"," A World Bank (WB) analysis estimates that 45,000 people died prematurely in 2009 in Sindh from major environmental health hazards, and its economic impact in terms of GDP was 15 per cent of Sindh's GDP, with an annual cost of about Rs372 billion./The analysis is contained in a new publication 'Sustainability and Poverty Alleviation: Confronting Environmental Threats in Sindh'. It has been posted by the World Bank on its website. The report has been prepared by a team led by World Bank environment specialist Ernesto Sanchez-Triana who has previously worked on projects in Pakistan. The World Bank acknowledges Sindh government's fruitful collaboration in compilation of the report./This means that almost one in every five deaths that occurred that year in the province was caused by environmental factors. More than half of these deaths occurred among young children, most of them younger than five. Among this vulnerable population group, three out of every 10 deaths were associated with an environmental risk./In addition, thousands of people also suffered from illnesses that constrained them from studying, working, or going, about their daily lives, resulting in nearly 1.4 million disability-adjusted life years./The assessment of environmental health effects and their economic costs presented in this publication was undertaken in early 2012. Assessment methodologies have undergone several major developments since then, as reflected in the local 'Burden of Disease 2010' project, released in December, 2012./Under conservative assumptions, the cost of environmental disaster in Sindh is equivalent to between 11 and 19 per cent of the province's GDP for 2009. The most important environmental problems are those affecting human health, which have an annual cost in the range of Rs261 to 486 billion in 2009, with a midpoint estimate of Rs372 billion. This cost is equivalent to 7 to 13 per cent of Sindh's estimated GDP in 2009, with a midpoint estimate of 10 per cent./Among the problems, inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene has the highest cost; air pollution, both in urban areas and within households, is another pressing challenge. The problems associated with degradation of natural resources and losses from floods and other natural disasters have a cost equal to 5.3 per cent of the province's GDP./The report suggested that responding to Sindh's most pressing environmental problems will require a major overhaul of the province's environmental management and institutional framework./It says: The country's environmental management framework relies on environmental impact analysis and the ill-enforced NEQS to improve environmental conditions. However, the severity of environmental degradation speaks to the ineffectiveness of these mechanisms and the need to develop other instruments./Moreover, environmental agencies' capabilities are low, and they still need to adopt deep reforms to set up mechanisms for priority settings, efficient resource allocation, and adequate monitoring, evaluation and social learning, as well as mechanisms for enhancing accountability for environmental management. This has to be done while also adapting to the post-eighteenth amendment context, report says./Given the significant premature deaths, illnesses, and economic costs caused by inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene, as well as outdoor air pollution, the report recommended that lead exposure should also be tackled urgently, as it resulted in irreversible effects, including impaired intelligence in children, which have significant and lifelong consequences./According to the report, nearly half of these premature deaths were caused by inadequate household water, sanitation, and hygiene; nearly one-quarter were from outdoor air pollution in urban areas mainly in Karachi; and the remainder by household air pollution, road traffic noise, and road traffic accidents./Young children, mainly those younger than five years of age, are particularly vulnerable to environmental health risks. About 55 per cent of the total deaths were among children, and most of these were caused by diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, and other infectious diseases./Environmental health risks are also the cause of millions of cases of illness, injuries, and cognitive impairments in Sindh. There were an estimated 37.5 million cases of diarrheal disease in 2009 as a result of inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. Diarrheal infections in early childhood are a major contributor to poor nutritional status that leads to children being underweight or stunted./Outdoor air pollution in urban areas, and household air pollution in rural areas, caused an estimated 4.9 million cases of upper and lower respiratory infections in children in 2009; an estimated 330,000 adults have chronic bronchitis as a result of air pollution. Some 1.6 million school-age children experience noise-induced cognitive impairment (NICI), and millions of adults suffer from sleep disturbance and annoyance from road traffic noise. Road traffic accidents caused approximately 6,000 permanent disabilities, 82,000 injuries requiring medical attention, and 445,000 minor injuries in 2009./The majority of DALYs (0.8 million) were among children and were mainly caused by inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene, and by household air pollution. The additional 0.6 million DALYs were among adults, two-thirds of which were caused by outdoor air pollution and road traffic noise."
Resources degradation blights human health: report," The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission in its report on planetary health has called for immediate global action to protect the health of human civilisation and the natural systems on which it depends./The global foundation which worked to promote health and education released its report in Pakistan on Thursday after its launch in various other countries including the USA./The report is being launched in Pakistan at a ceremony in Islamabad on Friday (today). Many global experts are attending the mega activity./The report, Safeguarding Human Health in the Anthropocene Epoch, provides the first-ever comprehensive examination of evidence showing how the health and well-being of future generations is being jeopardised by the unprecedented degradation of the planets natural resources and ecological systems./The report was written by a commission of 15 leading academics and policymakers from institutions in eight countries, including Dr Sania Nishtar, president of Heartfile Pakistan./It demonstrates how human activity and development have pushed to near breaking point the boundaries of the natural systems that support and sustain human civilisations./The commission outlines a range of beneficial policies and actions that can be taken by governments, international organisations, researchers, health professionals and citizens that are good for both health and the environment./Examples include benefits from reduced air pollution, healthy diets with more fruit and vegetables, active transport (walking and cycling), reduced urban heat stress from green spaces, and increased resilience to coastal flooding from intact wetlands and mangroves. In addition, the report identifies some major gaps in evidence and the research that is needed./The commission warns that a rising population, unsustainable consumption and the over-use of natural resources will exacerbate these health challenges in the future. The worlds poorest communities will be among those at greatest risk, as they live in areas that are most strongly affected and have greater sensitivity to disease and poor health./Dr. Sania Nishtar said the health of nations, and the planet are deeply interconnected./""We need a new paradigm of governance to promote collaborative inter-sectoral action for solving sectoral objectives,"" the Heartfile Pakistan president said./The solutions to these clear and potent dangers are within reach, says the report, but the world needs to take decisive, coordinated action to protect the environment and secure the health of future generations./The commission also furnished recommendations stating that policies and initiatives need to be designed to promote more efficient use of current resources./It said the leaders need to take initiatives to reduce the risks to health and vital ecosystems, and implement policies to reduce subsidies that block sustainable practices, encourage behavioral change, incentivise the private sector, support research, and promote public discourse./It further recommended that the environmental health needs must be integrated into health budgeting and purchasing."
State of the environment," RECENTLY, I watched the documentary A Journey Through Pakistan at the embassy in Washington D.C. during an open house event. The film ended at the new deep-sea port in Gwadar, which drew me to find out more about the project. During my research, I found alarming levels of pollution along the coastline, on the ocean bed and in marine life that may cost thousands of fishing jobs and millions of dollars annually from restrictions on export of contaminated fish and prawns./The Pakistani coastline is facing severe pollution from industrial, port, municipal and transportation activities, with large amounts of untreated industrial waste and sewage draining into the sea. Other sources of pollution include ships and fishing trawlers, a situation that can only worsen when the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is completed and the deep-sea port fully operational./Environmental pollution is not unique to Pakistan; all developing countries confront the dilemma of wanting to preserve natural resources and the need to cater for burgeoning populations. In Pakistan, however, environmental issues are managed through ad hoc fixes resulting in problems getting exacerbated to catastrophic dimensions./Solutions to environmental pollution in Pakistan must be implemented without delay./I visited several beaches during my last trip to Karachi; their deterioration was beyond imagination. Sea View and Hawkes Bay looked like municipal waste sites with garbage, especially shopping bags, littered everywhere. The stench and black sand was evidence of untreated sewage, the source of which was only few kilometres away a huge municipal nullah discharging into the sea without any treatment; even raw human waste was visible in the effluent./The situation inland is equally alarming; a survey of Degh Nullah of Lahore and tributaries in Kasur showed extremely high levels of pesticides and heavy metals discharged by factories. In most of the water samples, the levels of lead and mercury were between 200 and 20,000 times higher than acceptable levels. Eighty-six per cent of the samples were highly toxic./Mercury is extremely toxic to humans, especially infants; it affects many organs and causes sensory impairment (vision/hearing/speech), disturbs sensation and coordination. Long-term or high levels of mercury exposure can result in brain damage, even death. For pregnant women, exposure may result in serious birth defects. Mercury is discharged into the environment by non-iron metal, cement, caustic soda, pig iron and steel industries operating along Degh Nullah./Lead is of particular interest due to its adverse impact on children's cognitive skills. Exposure to it causes loss of attentiveness, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, numbness and tingling in the extremities, fatigue, insomnia, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anaemia. Exposure to even low levels of lead can be harmful./Air pollution is the most visible type of pollution, especially smoke from automotive tailpipes. However, it may not be the most toxic. Open burning is currently the most prevalent method of getting rid of solid waste which results in toxic pollutants eventually either getting dispersed into the air or contributing to soil and groundwater pollution. Open burning is considered low-temperate burning that forms yet more toxic chemicals like dioxin (one of the most toxic by-products of the open burning of plastic). Dioxin causes a form of disfiguring acne called chloracne; Viktor Yushchenko, the former president of Ukraine, is a well-known sufferer. Open burning also produces cancer-causing contaminants like polychlorinated biphenyls, benzo(a)pyrene and others./Let's examine some of the pressing environmental issues of Pakistan and possible solutions/remedies. Plastic, especially shopping bags, is by far the most urgent issue. Some of the solutions are: banning plastic bags altogether, which is not possible; however, non-degradable plastic bags can be replaced with biodegradable ones. Another option is to impose a shopping bag deposit like a glass bottle deposit; shoppers pay a sum at the time of purchase that is refunded upon its return. A cheaper and more practical solution is that the government implements and/or encourages purchase of the discarded plastic bags and recycles or burns them in high temperature incinerators along with other solid wastes. This will create jobs and the process can be used to generate energy. Further, removing plastic bags from the environment will prevent clogged sewers, waterways and in the process help conserve wildlife./Legislating on industrial waste can be made easier by making industries responsible for their waste, imposing hefty fines on the polluters, and making them responsible for the clean-up. While it is too early for implementation of pollution limits for an industrial area where they can trade their allowable pollution without impacting the set ceiling, there is no harm in thinking about it./Cost-effective and job-creating solid municipal waste management means maximum recycling, placing non-recyclables in properly-built/lined landfills on hydro-geologically stable areas with leachate collection/monitoring to prevent groundwater contamination. Once the landfill is partly or completely filled, the generated gas from microbial activity may be used for energy generation./For liquid municipal waste, properly designed treatment plants are needed with capacity for the expected population growth. Wastewater plants will work to their intended maximum once plastic bags are removed. Think of the treatment standard of processing wastewater in Singapore which exceeds the WHO drinking water standard./Another source of contamination of waterways is runoff from agricultural farms. Use of less persistent/toxic chemicals according to instructions is needed. Education of farmers about the impact of agrochemical use on human and animal health and the environment as well as the development of resistance among insects and weeds when not used properly, will be helpful./Before and even after the implementation of these solutions, proper environmental monitoring/intervention strategies should be in place with quarterly or at least biannual assessment of samples collected from the areas of concern. Establishment of standard labs for chemical/toxicity analysis is essential./Pakistan needs serious intervention to combat further environmental degradation with proper remediation/restoration for the sake of the coming generations. Pakistanis don't have any other option; non-action will continue to transform the country into a wasteland with consequences that were not seen even a decade ago."
RAWAL NOTE: Poultry farms a nuisance for Chontra villagers," The residents of a small village in Chontra no longer have the luxury of breathing fresh air and strolling in the open places as they did in the past due to the sudden arrival of poultry farms in their residential area./The villagers of Parial used to live in a neat and clean atmosphere. But after the establishment of the poultry farms, they remain almost trapped indoors and unable to breathe fresh air. Besides, when they raised a voice against the setting up of the poultry farms in the residential area, they were baton charged and lobed with tear gas shells by the police. The private security guards of the poultry farms also harassed them./Our elders who used to have a night sleep in the open places such as terraces and rooftops in the summers are now worried because the atmosphere of the village is polluted with stinking odour of poultry feed and chicken litters, Amir Mehmood, the principal of a private school, told Dawn./Even children of my school are perturbed over the polluted air and some of them have been complaining about breathing disorder, he said./Akhtar Mehmood, a longtime resident of the village, was equally worried over the breeding of flies and mosquitoes. But he seemed helpless and said their efforts to get the poultry farms shifted out remained unproductive./I am worried about my children and the elderly parents who always complain about the increasing number of flies in our house. The flies enter the house even though we keep the doors and windows closed all the time, said Akhtar Mehmood who lives with his parents in the village./The residents said when construction activities started in the village about two years ago they were told that a factory was being set up in the locality where the local youth would be provided jobs./Initially, one of the owners used to visit the site on a helicopter, so the villagers thought that it was a government project. However, when chickens were brought to the new buildings, they realised that they had been cheated, said Babar Qayyum, another villager./Last year, the villagers had to stage a protest sit-in against the setting up of the poultry farms in the residential area. But the participants of the sit-in dispersed peacefully when the management of the poultry farms assured them that their grievances would be addressed by taking preventive measures against pollution. As the villagers saw no progress on the fulfillment of the promise, they staged a protest demonstration against the poultry farms on August 26. The participants later clashed with the police and the security guards of the farms./The security supervisor of the project in his report lodged with the police alleged that the protesting villagers were demanding Bhatta from him and also fired gunshots that injured him and one of his colleagues. Later, the police reached the spot and used force to disperse the protesting villagers and arrested 11 of them./Another resident said there were also rumours that one of the owners was a politician who forced the local police and the administration to take action against the protesting villagers./The next day, another case was registered against the villagers but this time on the complaint of the police. The police claimed the protesters damaged their vehicle and also obstructed them from performing their official duty. Finally, the villagers had to retreat despite lodging a counter case against the security staff of the poultry farms who they claimed had detained an 11-year-old boy of the village and tortured him./The issue was also brought into the notice of Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan who held a meeting with the affected villagers on Thursday and assured them that their problems would be resolved./On the other hand, City Police Officer (CPO) Israr Ahmed Abbasi launched a departmental inquiry into the incident to ascertain the circumstances which caused the clash./Dr Shaheen, deputy medical superintendent at the Benazir Bhutto Hospital, said poultry projects should not be located in the residential areas as wings and hair of the birds caused air pollution and respiratory diseases among people after dispersing in the air./Elderly people and children are especially affected form the foul smell emitted from the chicken waste and feed of the birds, the doctor said, adding it also affected the indoor air quality in houses."
A cleaner environment," ON Sept 25, 2015 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif joined other heads of governments at the UN to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which chart the way to a more sustainable future./The SDGs lay out the path ahead with unprecedented detail - 17 goals, 169 targets and specific indicators for each target. Advocates for environmental health have worked tirelessly for strong parameters to reduce air pollution, improve air quality, reduce chemical contamination of air as reflected in SDGs 3, 11 and 12. With no ground-level air-quality monitoring equipment of international standard functioning in any city of Pakistan, implementing these air-quality targets will be near impossible./Japan's development agency, Jica, had funded and installed an environmental monitoring system a few years ago, but the project was held up. Equipment, said Malik Amin Aslam of the IUCN, was rusting. Alternatively, we can ask the United States to include our major cities in the AirNow International monitoring system which was tested in Shanghai 2010 and gives hourly readings in Beijing and Delhi among others./Studies show that 88pc of traffic police in Karachi develop respiratory disease after two years on the job./Imported, hand-held air-quality monitoring devices are being used by some environment consultants and industry to monitor industrial emissions, says Rafay Alam, vice-president, Pakistan Environmental Law Association. Independent studies are also being undertaken by Pakistani hospitals and universities; all showing very high levels of pollution. In fact, a study on Karachi done by the Aga Khan University shows that air pollution, according to pulmonologist Dr Javaid Khan, is five times greater than the safe levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. The Pakistan government's own compendium of environmental statistics 2010 shows air pollution from double to five times WHO levels./There is a resulting rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, including among non-smokers, children and the elderly. Studies by the Environment Protection Agency of Karachi's traffic police show that 88pc develop respiratory disease after two years on the job./The causes of rising pollution in Pakistan are well known - industrial emissions including from small-scale industries in densely populated areas, continued use of diesel and other fossil fuels, weak emission control laws, lack of an adequate garbage disposal system, with burning of plastic bags adding more chemicals into the air./The lack of a national coordination system on environmental health has become the obstacle to solutions. Devolution has created challenges, says Pakistan WHO head Dr Michel Thieren. WHO technical consulting mission is working with the Ministry of Health to set up a national health policy framework ... part of the challenge is how do we read the Constitution in public health terms./The Constitution, however, should not be read as an impediment to national policies ensuring citizens' health. As pointed out by Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah the right to healthy air is within the right to life and dignity under our Constitution./Changing energy systems and environmental bad habits while difficult will be beneficial to the economy. Pakistan does not currently calculate the negative health costs of environmental pollution. The government should commission an opportunity cost comparison - what is the base year (2015) cost of respiratory diseases/ working days lost/ decline in agricultural produce resulting from poor air quality and how does that compare in cost to investing in retrofitting/ new green technologies that will get us to the goals agreed for 2030./For example, in China industrialisation at the expense of citizens' health is finally being turned around after studies showed a year's estimated health cost of air pollution as $535 billion. This amount was found to be much higher than the cost of change to green energy/As the largest solar energy producer worldwide, China has already jointly launched Quaid-e-Azam Solar Power Park in 2014 which is supposed to generate 1,000MW electricity for the national grid by December 2016. Pakistan, apparently, has pointed out a number of solar park sites; and Chinese companies are willing to aggressively invest in this emerging sector due to high demand of clean energy in Pakistan, says Masood Khalid, Pakistan's ambassador to Beijing./New technology for urban mass transit from Europe should also be reviewed; the Netherlands railways, for example, will be completely wind-powered in three years./Pakistan's Vision 2025 does include several of the SDGs, including major sections on energy and water, air quality is however missing. After having adopted the SDGs at the UN, Prime Minister Sharif should order a revision of plans in light of all 17 goals./Pakistan's journey to 2030 must begin by bringing environmental health back up to the highest levels of government responsibility; starting with daily measuring and reporting of the quality of the air we breathe."
Smog causes respiratory problems," Smog which enveloped Kasur and its surroundings on Wednesday caused eye and respiratory problems./It was more problematic for asthma patients./According to Dr Muhammad Ashraf and Dr Faisal Aziz of Ashraf Medical Complex, the number of patients with respiratory disorders increased on Wednesday afternoon due to unusual smoke that gripped the city./They also said that patients with eye and throat problems also visited the health facility. Dr Ashraf told Dawn that the polluted smoke could cause viral diseases and allergies./Health EDO Dr Khalid Mahmood visited the DHQ Hospital emergency and remained there to facilitate the patients./He said the clouds of smoke might be due to some severe air pollution."
Pulmonary disease may become leading cause of death in future," Senior medics say that more than 210 million people worldwide are suffering from the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with Pakistan sharing the burden of 6.9 million people./Talking to the media on World COPD Day on Wednesday, Pakistan Chest Society President and Head of Pulmonology at Services Hospital Dr Kamran Cheema stressed the need to realise the deadly effects of COPD as it will become the leading cause of death in the future ahead of diabetes and depression. He said the worst part was there was a very superficial awareness about this disease and not much attention was paid to fighting it./He said the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as a common preventable disease characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and lungs to noxious particles and gases./Senior medics warn against ignoring symptoms/We have to realise that COPD is a major threat. Being a chronic disease, once a man falls prey to it, there is no point of return. If not controlled, it progresses with time, Dr Cheema said./He said the difficulty in breathing would restrict a patient from performing any stern job. Talking about the signs and symptoms of COPD, he said shortness of breath, persistent cough, coughing up mucus, wheezing, fatigue/tiredness, weight loss, morning headaches are alarming signs of the disease. It is more prevalent in men than women, and increases with age, primarily affecting people 40 years and above./He added that symptoms developed slowly and were ignored by most patients as 'old age' or 'smoker cough', which is a dangerous attitude of patients and by the time it is realised, they lose a significant amount of lung function./Assistant professor at Pulmonology Department of Services Hospital, Dr Ashraf Jamal, shared data on COPD symptoms saying the prevalence rate of COPD-related symptoms was 18.5pc. He said 26.7pc patients came with co-morbidities. Similarly, around 33.3pc COPD patients were hospitalised for their condition and 26.7pc visited emergency department due to their respiratory condition./He said smoking was the major contributor that accounted for up to 75pc of all cases of COPD. Not only were smokers at higher risk, but they also harmed other people through passive smoking. Sheesha and e-cigarettes were also harmful and contributed heavily to the menace. People considered them a safe alternative but they were gravely mistaken. He urged people to stay away from smoking and other air pollutants./Dr Jamal stressed that patients had to take care of their routines and habits, avoid triggers such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes and dust. Once diagnosed with COPD, daily medication was vital to fight it along with short-acting rescue inhalers./The COPD is a chronic disease and has no cure. The only way to counter it is through healthy living and using prescribed therapies, Dr Jamal added."
'Smoking biggest cause of lung diseases'," About 75 per cent lung diseases are caused by smoking. However it is not only smokers that are at greater risk, passive smokers are also affected./Pulmonologist Dr Aftab Akhtar said this at a media briefing organised by the Pakistan Chest Society at a local hotel./More than 6.9 million people have been affected by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Pakistan and it is expected that by 2020 it will be the third leading cause of death from chronic diseases worldwide, he said./He said that COPD was a common preventable disease, characterised by persistent airflow limitation that was usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs./Deaths, injuries and disability from COPD will rise in developing countries, primarily, due to the increased rate of smoking, Dr Akhtar said./Smoking remains a growing public health issue even in Pakistan with the rate of 18.7 per cent and breathlessness alone is the most frequently reported symptom./He said that treatment and awareness of COPD has become a challenge for world as it is one of the most common respiratory disorders worldwide, affecting approximately 210 million people around the world./COPD prevalence is generally higher in men than women. Any patient above 40 who has dyspnea (increasing effort to breathe), chronic cough, chronic sputum production, history of smoking, embracing occupational dusts and chemicals, history of asthma, allergy, sinusitis, family history of COPD or other respiratory diseases, might become a victim of COPD, he said./Experts stressed that patients have to take care of their routines and habits; they have to avoid triggers like cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes and dust./Once diagnosed with COPD, daily medication is vital to fight with COPD along with short-acting rescue inhalers."
Climate change cost Pakistan $20bn in recent years: expert," Stressing the need for stemming the tide of adverse impacts of climate change, a senior economist on Wednesday said Pakistan's economy had suffered $20 billion losses due to the changing weather patterns in the recent past./Speaking at a workshop on 'Climate Change: Raising Threats and Challenges' here, Dr Mohammad Rafiq who teaches at the Institute of Management Sciences Peshawar said Pakistan required to devise comprehensive strategy to minimise the losses from the negative impacts of climate change./The Sarhad Conservation Network and Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF) jointly arranged the event to sensitise journalists and civil society groups to climate change and its impact on the human wellbeing./Referring to a report of the federal government, Dr Rafiq said the country had suffered $20 billion losses due to climate change./He said the climate change was happening and that that change in Pakistan was higher than the global average as major part of the country lied in arid and semi-arid region, which had already been bracketed a heat-surplus zone./Dr Rafiq calls for a strategy to minimise losses due to changing weather patterns/Dr Rafiq while highlighting negative impacts of climate change on the economy and people said the temperature increasing since 1990 had badly affected agriculture, water and health sectors./He said the role of Pakistan in climate change was negligible but still, it would be included among the most affected states./The economist said livelihood were predominantly climate sensitive in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of the country and that adverse impacts were very likely on agriculture, soil, water, forestry, livestock and fisheries./He said Pakistan could face water scarcity in future due to earth warming./Dr Rafiq said Pakistan was the fourth vulnerable state to climate change and if the trend continued on the same pattern, then it would become the second or third vulnerable country in the world by 2020./He said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government's green growth initiative including plantation of one billion trees in the province was a positive step that could help minimise negative impacts of the global warming./Dr Adil Zareef of the SCN said climate change caused the outbreak of infectious diseases, particularly malaria, dengue and cholera, while the environmental pollution spread respiratory, cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases./He said the climate change could cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from 2030 to 2050./Dr Adil said Pakistan's social and public health system was not very efficient and therefore, the people were prone to negative impacts of climate changes./He said situation in Peshawar was alarming due to increase of dust particles in the air and that it had gone beyond the World Health Organisation's standards./The burning of rubber in brick kilns has been banned but tyres are being used in kilns around Peshawar. The rubber, which is burnt in around 400 brick kilns in Peshawar district, has become a major source of air pollution and chest and respiratory illness, he said./Dr Inamullah of the Agriculture University Peshawar said the temperature of the earth was increasing with the average 0.5 degree centigrade in one decade and that after the passage of 100 years, it would reach five degree centigrade, which was alarming./He said the temperature was adversely affecting the growing period of crops and that the production of wheat would become difficult in Peshawar by 2060./Dr Inamullah said the phenomenon of climate change would have adverse impacts on the yield of other crops in the region too."
Environment: Smog - curtain over the cities," Every winter, the cities in upper and central part of Pakistan wear a blanket of fog; which is primarily due to a particular climate zoning, but the problem is getting worse with each passing year. This is because the smoke emitting from the surface adds to the fog and thickens it - creating something called 'smog'. In other words, it is a kind of air pollution named for being a mixture of smoke and fog in the air./The problem has intensified as during the past few decades due to rapid and sustained industrialisation and addition of millions of vehicles which emit smoke in the air. Some experts blame the coal-based industry in India located close to the border, the smoke of which is carried by wind into Pakistan./According to Dr Badar M. Ghauri, of the Institute of Space Technology, through the satellite data on haze, smog and fog it has been revealed that the haze density increases after rice harvesting (October-November) when agricultural waste is burnt in India close to the Pakistani border. The fog / haze cover during during this period ranged from 155,000 - 354,500 sqkm in Pakistan and India which is double from that during 2006-2010./Air pollution in Lahore needs to be urgently addressed as it is now considered amongst the most polluted cities in Asia/In Pakistan billions of rupees have been spent on building motorways for speedy movement of agricultural and industrial products, but during December and January due to smog everything slows down and on some occasions come to a complete standstill. An elderly resident of Narowal, Emmanuel Das said that the fog has decreased the daylight hours over the years./Punjab is a densely populated province and in terms of 'human productivity loss' one can calculate the negative impact on the financial health of the country if a large proportion of the population is rendered unproductive. Lahore also falls amongst the worst smog affected cities in the world. According to the World Bank statistics the cost of urban air pollution in Pakistan was Rs65 billion in 2006./Of late, the flights and land carriers' cancellation frequency increased tremendously, which not only caused loss to the transport industry, but catapulted an array of other sequential effects, i.e. road accidents and loss of human lives due to delay in transporting serious patients to the hospitals owing to low visibility./According to Mushtaq Ahmed Gill, President, South Asian Agriculture Conservation Network Foundation, the residue from cotton, wheat and rice crops is burnt on both sides of the border after the harvesting season during winter. In this season, while flying over this route at night one can see swaths of burning fire and smoke emitting from these fields./Gill says that the residue contains nutrients worth billions of rupees that are essential for soil enrichment. Besides, agriculture-friendly insects and pests that help in the growth of plants are also destroyed along with the residue. Pakistan is an agriculture-based economy and cannot afford this luxury for a very long time. For their own petty savings, the farmers make others liable to pay huge amounts in terms of losses to businesses, trade, crops, and human health and productivity./In the recent past kino crop suffered losses estimated to be in millions when the fruit started falling due to frost. Experts blamed the cold weather and very dense fog during this season./We can learn from the Europeans who faced the worst smog situation in the '60s and '70s. Their corrective measures and legislations prompted technological developments that helped improve air quality. Standards have been set for cars and heavy duty vehicles' engines for better fuel efficiency. Industries are using efficient pollution reduction technology. Switching from coal to natural gas has also helped in improving the overall air quality./Beijing is already going through heavy air pollution presently, and the surrounding cities and provinces have raised their alert levels as northern China is facing the worst smog of the year. Looking at the worsening situation in China and Delhi, one can cautiously predict that Pakistan will face a similar situation in the days to come./Environmental experts suggest that since smog is a common threat to the environment and economies of both India and Pakistan, they need to come together to deal with it through mutual cooperation. Both the countries strictly need to implement environmental laws and keep proper checks on burning of fossil fuels, crop residue and garbage, and application of latest technology in the transport and coal-based industry for carbon emission reduction. They further warn that without practical measures on both sides of the border, the genie of smog can never be brought back into the bottle."
Global warming," CLIMATE change is related to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and is in addition to the natural climate variability over comparable time periods that also create harmful effects like tornadoes, storms, droughts and floods./Millions of people in Pakistan are exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution and millions of people suffer from diseases because they have no access to clean air, owing to which there are 30,000 child deaths every year./Climate change is estimated to decrease crop yields in Pakistan. This, in turn, will affect livelihoods and food production.Combining the decreased yields with the current rise in population growth and urbanisation, the risk of hunger and food security will remain high./The government and the authorities concerned should take drastic measures to save Pakistan from the effects of global warming. May Pakistan progress by leaps and bounds."
Footprints: The glow of Embers," At first glance, you would think these people with blue surgical masks covering their mouths and noses and with one of their arms tied up with tourniquets are subjects of some medical test or experiment, or there is an outbreak of a contagious disease here. But on closer inspection they emerge as part of a big environmental protest against Hubco and China Power Hub Generation Company's upcoming coal-fired power plant./The tourniquets were not really tourniquets. They were black armbands. And the surgical masks signified what is to come in the form of poor quality air loaded with carbon and sulphur with all kinds of other pollutants. The protesters gathered at Hub during a public hearing, called to hear them out on Monday, were bracing themselves for an unwanted mess./And temperatures soared further when they realised that the hearing called to understand their concerns about the environmental hazards of such a project was in fact just a formality to acquire a 'no objection certificate' for starting work on the plant, needed in accordance with the Balochistan government's Environmental Act of 2012./Some 2,000 locals had sent in letters opposing the coal plant for the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment study (Balochistan Environment Protection Agency itself admitted that they had not received a single letter in favour of the project). Those who wrote the letters wanted to attend the public hearing, but they learnt that they weren't welcome. Disappointed, they put up slogans rejecting the project on black banners around the Lasbela Industrial State Development Authority auditorium. But the morning of the hearing they woke up to find most of the banners taken down, reportedly by police. Also the 200 or so factories in the industrial area were kept closed on the day so that the people did not enter the area where the police, Frontier Constabulary and Levies had been deployed to stop them./The public hearing is a sham when the public is not allowed to have their say. The authorities are willing to allow only 60 to 70 people inside the auditorium on the pretext of space constraints. The reality is that since the prime minister wants to bring in coal-fired plants here, the project will go ahead no matter what. The people with objections are a hindrance in the way of that and they are being treated as such, former speaker of the Balochistan Assembly Mohammad Aslam Bhootani said. All over the world, coal is going out of favour. And here we are embracing it./As local and Chinese experts arrived for the hearing with government officials, the protesters who had by then turned into a mob forced their entry. During the scuffle, Mr Bhootani was also manhandled by law-enforcers. Inside, a representative of Hubco termed coal a practicable option when hydel, nuclear, wind and solar electricity generation was either too expensive or took too long to develop. He pointed out how countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, China and India were all generating power from coal./Another official from their corporate social responsibility side shared their plans to open schools, organise free eye and skin camps, vaccinations for children, besides creating jobs, etc. Someone from their technical consultants Hagler Bailly gave a nice talk comparing coal-fired power plants to cars. Harmful emissions from engines don't make us do away with cars altogether. Instead, we look into controlling the emissions. Similarly, there are ways of controlling the air pollution and potential environmental hazards from coal plants such as bringing in the use of windshields, water sprinklers or spray, ash management, treatment plants, provided these measures are implemented, he said./The people had forced their way inside by then were getting really charged. Mr Bhootani climbed up the stage to talk. He reminded Hubco of their forgotten promises like those of 20 to 25 years ago when they first arrived in Balochistan. The three goths situated near their power generation plants, which were promised free electricity by Hubco, are still without power. The jobs promised to locals went to people from somewhere else, too. All Hubco has done so far is deceive the people of Balochistan. The countries they say have turned to coal are in fact turning to alternative sources now. Why go far, in neighbouring India, wherever there are coal-fired power plants, there have been huge increases in stillbirths, infant mortality and chest diseases. And yet, India has a big population. They can still withstand so much loss of life whereas in Gadani, we only have 30,000 people. This coal plant will completely wipe us out, he said. And even then the power generated here is not for us. One transmission line from here is going to Faisalabad and the other to Lahore. What are we getting then? Just a health hazard!/Hearing this, the medical superintendent at the Civil Hospital at Hub, Dr Abbas Lasi, said that before industry came to their area, they only got snakebites and kidney stones as major ailments but now the average age of locals has dropped to around 50 years as they suffered from skin diseases, eye problems, chest ailments, lung and breast cancers. Factory waste in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and mercury has had devastating effects on our people. We are seeing little girls of 10 to 11 years with fibroadenomas. We had seen nothing like it before the 1990s. Still, if you are bent on bringing devastation in the name of progress here, then please do one more thing. Ask Imran Khan to build a cancer hospital here, too, because we are all going to fall very ill very soon."
Fighting pollution," THIS is apropos the article by George Sadiq 'Smog - curtain over cities' (Feb 14). This is indeed an alarming situation which Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa confront in winter. Smog causes a lot of inconvenience to all modes of transport - road, rail and air./There is a dire need to eradicate this menace as Pakistan cannot afford the cost of urban/rural pollution which has increased manifold during the last one decade. Curbing air pollution is the responsibility of both federal and provincial governments./To lessen air pollution we should not burn the residue of cotton, wheat, sugarcane and rice in the open; rather it can be burnt in incinerators which will also generate electricity./There must be definite steps in importing and manufacturing incinerators and providing them to farmers at subsidised rates so that all types of residues can be disposed off in enclosed chambers./There must be strict rules for kiln owners. They should not release toxic smoke in the open atmosphere and must adopt pollution reduction technology i.e., filters, smoke-absorbent chimneys, etc./I also recommend launching a countrywide awareness campaign about the negative effects of pollution./Similarly, South Asian Agriculture Conservation Network can also enforce these measures./Our scientists and engineers must adopt techniques adopted by Europeans in curbing air pollution in the 1960s and '70s. The objective of a pollution-free Pakistan must be attained at any cost."
Air pollution," THIS refers to the apathy of the district administration towards a steel mill being constructed in a densely populated area surrounded by schools, houses and agricultural lands at Sakhakot, Malakand./The district administration has been intimated about the potential hazards this steel mill could pose in the form of air pollution, dried up sweet water wells and noise pollution, to name a few. This steel mill is being constructed against the wishes of the local people who are mainly poor farmers. Protests have been also staged against its construction./But the district administration keeps mum on the pretext that environmental laws are not extended to Malakand district because it is a Provincially-Administered Tribal Area./The Constitution gives me the right to have access to clean air and water, for they are the basic necessities for human survival. Although the environmental laws may not have been extended, at least the dwellers of Sakhakot have the right to a clean environment./There is a mushroom growth of industries at inappropriate places in the region because the area is tax-free. There have been protests and processions by the people, but money and power have all the say./While the provincial government is spearheading a campaign of planting billion trees, people are suffering from industrial wastes in the form of dust and water pollution, which is becoming a source of illnesses and chronic diseases./I request PTI chief Imran Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak and environmental protection agency to look into this rapid and unplanned industrialisation of the area."
Ministry lacks figures as environment monitoring system non-functional," With more vehicles and industrial units, air pollution is on the rise in the federal capital./From colourless, odourless carbon dioxide to oxides of nitrogen to hazardous air pollutant, formdehyde, mostly emitted from vehicles, is what the residents breathe every day, said a reply prepared by the climate change ministry to a question raised in the National Assembly./The response was based on studies conducted by the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and Japan International Cooperation Agency five years ago./The ministry has no updated figures since 2011 after its environment monitoring system (EMS) became non-functional. It also has no mechanism to calculate the increase in suspended particulate matter and emissions from vehicles and factories in the air over Islamabad, said an environment expert in the ministry./The Rs1.2 billion EMS purchased with assistance from the Japanese government has been non-functional since 2011./It was one of the most ambitious projects of Pak-EPA. For the last five years, the machine has only gathered dust and its parts have deteriorated, the official said./According to a source, rising numbers of vehicles were a major cause of emissions and smoke. In Islamabad, the number of registered vehicles in 1998 was just 60,000./According the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the number of the registered vehicles increased to 15.2 million in 2013-14, the expert said./Last week, in response to a question raised in the National Assembly, the ministry said the suspended particulate matter in the air in all major cities, including Lahore, Karachi and Faisalabad, was six to seven times higher than the acceptable level set by the World Health Organisation. It said 40pc pollution was from the increasing vehicle traffic and the rest from industries./The ministry added that the estimated cost of environmental and natural resource damages was about Rs365 billion a year. Urban air pollution was likely to cause around 22,000 premature deaths among adults and 77 deaths among children, putting the estimated costs of health at about Rs62 billion to Rs65 billion./However, despite the release of Rs1.8 million to fix the EMS, Pak-EPA has failed to revive the air quality monitoring machine installed on its premises in Sector H-8./When contacted, the secretary of the ministry of climate change, Syed Abu Ahmed Akif, said: Funds have been released to make the machine operational. The equipment should be up and running in about ten or 12 days."
Change in the air?," PAKISTAN is severely affected by climate-related devastation - floods, drought, food and water shortage. Scientists working with the United Nations have set the global goal to avoid these disasters including keeping a lid on global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above the 19th century average. All countries must reduce their carbon emissions, by switching from fossil fuels to green energy, a costly measure in the short run./In 2014, China and the United States the two largest greenhouse gas-emitting countries pledged to cut their emission in the US-China accord which became the basis for the global agreement in Paris at COP21 in 2015. On April 22, 175 governments, including Pakistan, signed the Paris Agreement at the UN General Assembly./Every country is now in the process of preparing their submission to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, its Nationally Determined Contributions - the actions, including laws and regulations they will be undertaking by 2023 to meet the target./Eschewing bad environmental habits should be a major goal./Pakistan's Ministry of Climate Change has also commissioned a study on the country's greenhouse gas inventory. Increasing the greenhouse gas inventory will be the 10 new coal plants planned by the government before the 2023 reporting deadline. Bilal Anwar of the Centre for Climate Research and Development, Islamabad, posits that coal-based energy is unavoidable in the short term, but that the government should choose the latest, cleanest coal technology available./While the Paris Agreement sets a global target, the UN has also been negotiating, parallel to COP21, on the specific goals, targets and indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals which should successfully help us achieve the global target. On Sept 25, 2015, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif joined other leaders to adopt the SDGs 2030./From 2014, environmental health advocates have worked tirelessly for strong air quality parameters to reduce air pollution and contamination of air by chemicals. They achieved their inclusion in the SDGs. These targets are crucial for South Asia which has the world's most polluted cities with air-quality levels often four to five times the limits set by the World Health Organisation. The World Bank president Dr Jim Yong Kim warned early this month that Asian plans to build more coal fuel plants would be a disaster for the planet overwhelming the Paris agreement./Since the 18th Amendment and devolution in Pakistan, there has been no national coordination system on environment health. Now the Ministry of Climate Change has to use the global target instead./The government's Vision 2025 does include several of the SDGs, including major sections on renewable energy, while air quality is currently missing. The planning minister, Ahsan Iqbal, has said that Vision 2025 is a living document and will be up for review this year. Environmentalists should advocate with the ministry to ensure that the quality of air and measures to improve it are specifically delineated in the revised version./Changing energy systems and bad environmental habits while difficult will benefit agriculture and the economy. Pakistan's national accounts currently do not calculate the negative health costs of environmental pollution. The government should do an opportunity cost comparison - 2015's direct cost in terms of respiratory diseases, working days lost, agriculture losses and how that compares to the cost of expanding green technologies that will get us to SDG 2030 and the goals of Paris./Agriculture and agribusiness are the basis of Pakistan's economy. While a similar study on Pakistan is currently not available, a recent US National Institute of Health study on Indian agriculture 1980-2010 shows potential losses from 36pc to 50pc in wheat production due to SLCP or short-lived climate pollutants./The study recommends regional anti-air pollution measures as air pollution crosses borders. What we call 'fog' in winter is actually 'smog' in India and Pakistan. Pakistan's latest figures on agricultural output are starting to show negative effects. Cotton output fell while wheat showed almost no growth./Coal-fuelled air pollution crosses borders, even oceans; China's position on coal changed after the state of California tied negotiations on trade to reducing coal-based pollution crossing the Pacific. Rand Corporation, based in California, did a study of the annual costs of air pollution in China./Pakistan will have a similar opportunity to open a new track for negotiations with our neighbours in the July 2016 finance ministers' meeting in Islamabad. India has 88 existing coal plants with many new ones planned. No air purification wall can be built along the border./We should propose instead a joint Saarc commission to calculate the monetary value of air pollution and greenhouse emissions to each of our economies; review the results publicly and be open to changing our regional fossil fueled energy plans accordingly. The lives and livelihood of a billion and half people depend on it."
Use of tobacco leading preventable cause of death: expert," The use of tobacco is a leading preventable cause of death in the world as it causes several fatal diseases including lung cancer, heart diseases, bronchitis, emphysema, high blood pressure, stroke and asthma, according to health expert./Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Pakistan Chest Society (PCS) president Dr Arshad Javed said that they would observe 'No Tobacco Day' on May 31by highlighting smoking related health hazards to create awareness among people./He said that smoking was not only dangerous for the smoker's health but also for others as the second hand smoke led to lung cancer, heart diseases, bronchitis, emphysema, high blood pressure, risk of stroke, heart attack, exacerbation of asthma and cancer of tongue, gum pharynx, esophagus, bladder and kidneys etc. Flanked by Dr Sadia Ashraf and Dr Taj Mohammad, Dr Javed said that use of tobacco was a leading preventable cause of death in the world. In the 20th century, more than 100 million people died globally due to use of tobacco and its related products. About 70 per cent of these deaths occurred in the developing countries, estimating more than tuberculosis, HIV/Aids and malaria combined, he added./Dr Javed said that in Pakistan tobacco was used in the shape of cigarettes, cigar, Sheesha, Bidi, Naswar, Paan, Gutka and Chaalia. In most of the developed countries, use of tobacco was on the decline and so was tobacco related diseases, he added./PCS observes 'No Tobacco Day' today to create awareness among people/Unfortunately use of tobacco is on the rise in developing countries like Pakistan, said Dr Javed. He said that major challenge for tobacco control in the country was high prevalence of smoking among the medical doctors. Use of smokeless tobacco in various forms was also high in the country as a recent study showed that 21.5 per cent students used tobacco in some forms (smoke or smokeless) in their lifetime, he said./The PCS chief said that observing No Tobacco Day was aimed at creating awareness among people to protect the present and future generation from devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke./Almost half of children are breathing air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places, the smoke that fills restaurants, offices and other closed spaces, he said./Dr Javed said that PCS developed a clinical practice guideline on causes, treatment and prevention of tobacco. It is a useful tool for the doctors and other health professionals in the country to treat tobacco dependence in various settings including hospitals and clinics, he added./There should be effective alliance against smoking and sue of tobacco by government, health department, civil society and religious leaders coupled with mass awareness including effective communication and social mobilisation by the print and electronic media and effective implementation of laws, said Dr Javed."
"'Air, noise pollution badly affecting hospitals, patients'"," The increasing air and noise pollution is negatively affecting various busy thoroughfares and streets of the city, especially those running along some large hospitals and the pollution is taking its toll on the patients, it emerged on Thursday./The M. A. Jinnah Road hosts many hospitals along its fringes and corners where the situation is getting graver for patients who otherwise needed extreme care and attention. Similar is the condition of Rafiqui Shaheed Road where apart from increasing pollution, the rusted sewerage system brings diseases instead of cure to patients of three major hospitals of the province located on it./Experts said major hospitals like the Civil Hospital Karachi, the Services Hospital and several private hospitals along the M. A. Jinnah Road suffered because of growing pollution./Similar situation could be witnessed on various busy streets in the city where the number of private hospitals is continuously on the rise as the managements are generally least concerned to take seriously the hazards of pollution./Pollution levels in almost all of Pakistan's major cities are nearly 10 times higher than maximum level recommended by the World Health Organisation./A free hand apparently given by the traffic police to rickshaws, taxis, minibuses, coaches and old buses and trucks to emit hazardous smoke - not to mention the noise - is the main reason behind the problems, the experts said./Officials admitted that despite the provincial government's decision to ban all public transport vehicles made before 1976, they were still running on the roads./They said that according to estimates, over 2.5 million vehicles were on the city roads and the number was growing constantly as hundreds of vehicles are registered in Karachi daily./A visit to some of those hospitals showed that due to blaring vehicle horns, the patients are unable to get a sound sleep and thus unable to get speedy recovery. Patients must sleep to recover. It's the significant factor, said a doctor./A patient at a private hospital near Sharea Faisal who underwent an operation recently said he had been unable to sleep at night, while the hospital was filled with smoke emitted by vehicles, particularly during the rush hour.These drivers, he said, have no respect for human life. They deliberately honk horns near hospitals./Another patient said the traffic police had a stake in according free hand to powerful transport mafia, which stopped them taking any positive step to improve the situation./The noise and environmental pollution have assumed alarming proportions in Karachi, and if remedial measures are not taken, the situation may turn from bad to worse, said an expert./The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), Karachi chapter, has expressed concern over the increase in noise pollution in the city. The smoke emitting vehicles have emerged as a major source of increasing respiratory problems for patients, a PMA official told Dawn./Action is required against all kinds of horns and on misuse of loudspeaker in residential areas and in streets where hospitals are situated, he said./The experts said that pollution-related diseases in Karachi were on the rise due to intolerable levels of air and noise pollution. They said that such diseases, including cardiac, lung, eye, ENT, and skin diseases were affecting more than 30 per cent of residents./They said air pollution in the city was exacerbating and almost all its streets were full of dangerous smoke and gases./An expert of chest diseases said the number of people suffering from lung diseases was on the rise while patients of asthma and other chest diseases such as chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) were affecting more fatally than before./At least five per cent of adults and 10pc of children are suffering from asthma in Pakistan and the figures are getting even worse most likely due to growing industrialisation and urbanisation./ENT expert Dr Qaiser Sajjad held the smoke-emitting vehicles, especially rickshaws, as the chief cause of air and noise pollution."
Karachi's air quality monitoring system inoperative for five years," Despite growing global concerns over air pollution and the fact that Karachi has been declared the fifth most polluted city in a World Health Organisation (WHO) report released early this year, the government seems to be in no hurry to re-start environmental monitoring stations that have remained idle for the past five years due to lack of funds, it emerged on Sunday./According to sources, the city has three dysfunctional environmental monitoring stations (EMS); two of them installed at the head office of Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) in Korangi and the office of deputy commissioner of district central in North Nazimabad respectively, while the third is a mobile environmental monitoring station./These systems, they said, were provided to Sepa in Sindh and to other provincial government departments as part of the Rs1.23bn project launched by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with the Japan International Corporation Agency (Jica) in 2007./JICA's share in the project was 79pc (973m) in the project. The federal government bore 21pc (260m) while the Sindh government was to provide technical assistance and environmental monitoring equipment./The project's objective, sources said, was to measure air pollutant levels especially in the city's industrial zones./""The stations did carry out air monitoring for some years before they fell into disuse following devolution under which the project was transferred from the federal government to the provincial government without any financial assistance,"" said additional director general of Sepa S.M. Yahya, adding that the stations operated till 2012./The government, he said, now had approved a project to restart their operation. ""The budget of the Rs140m project titled 'Strengthening of environmental management system' has been approved and the Pakistani representative of the Japanese company earlier involved in the project has been asked to carry out repairs and maintenance of the monitoring systems,"" he said./To a question about the amount required to run these stations and whether Sepa has the technical capacity to run these systems, he said Rs5m was required annually to run them./""Some staff posted at other stations will be called in, besides a few new appointments would be made in the coming months. Hopefully, air quality monitoring will resume within three months,"" he said./It is noteworthy that Sindh environment minister Dr Sikandar Mandhro while responding to some environmental concerns raised by lawmakers in the assembly, had told the house in Feb earlier this year that the EMS would be operational in a few months./Fifth most polluted city/According to a 2016 WHO report, Karachi is the fifth most polluted city in the world followed by Peshawar and Rawalpindi./Thirteen of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world, the report says, are in India. The report ranked 1,600 cities in 91 countries for the quality of their air, which is measured for concentrations of particulate matters (PM 10 and PM 2.5), two major harmful pollutants that can cause serious diseases./The study, sources said, was not the first report showing the alarming levels of air pollution posing a direct threat to human health. In 2013, an Aga Khan University and Hospital (AKUH) study had linked a striking rise in emergency room visits and hospitalisations for cardiovascular diseases to higher levels of air pollutants in Karachi./An independent environmental consultant Saquib Ejaz Hussain observed: ""Karachi is one of the few cities in the world that has no air quality index, a number used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is to become. The air quality monitoring exercises of Sepa were erratic and the agency never analysed or documented its data to predict future pollution levels.""/The government job wasn't just to monitor air pollutant levels but also to take measures to control them, he said."
Climate and health," THE World Health Organisation has estimated that climate change is causing tens of thousands of deaths every year. These deaths arise from more frequent epidemics of diseases like cholera, the vastly expanded geographical distribution of diseases like dengue, and from extreme weather events, like heat waves and floods. At the same time, nearly seven million people each year die from diseases caused by air pollution such as lung cancer and stroke./The WHO experts predict that, by 2030, climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths each year./The COP21 held at Paris has proposed key actions for the implementation of the Paris agreement to reduce health risks linked to climate change. The conference highlighted the benefits of switching over to cleaner energy sources. These will help reduce levels of climate and air pollutants, as well as providing desperately needed power for health facilities in low-income countries. The health sector should themselves make a greater effort to promote low-carbon healthcare facilities and technologies; these can simultaneously improve service delivery and reduce costs as well as climate and environmental impacts./In view of the above, there is a dire need for moving to more sustainable food production and healthier diets to improve the environment and reduce non-communicable diseases. There is a need to have diets rich in fruits and vegetables. Also, a new approach is needed to link health economies assessment and climate change."
"Checking for carbon emissions discontinued in 2009, says ministry"," In a written reply to the National Assembly, the Ministry of Climate Change has said it no longer monitors carbon emissions in Islamabad./According to the reply submitted on Tuesday, the ministry used to check vehicular emissions every day in collaboration with the Islamabad Traffic Police. The practice was discontinued in 2009 due to the non-availability of field staff./Earlier in May, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), which works under the climate change ministry, that the air in Islamabad was polluted with colourless, odourless carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, formaldehyde and other hazardous pollutants./This observation was based on research conducted by Pak-EPA and Japan International Cooperation Agency five years ago./An environment expert from the climate change ministry said the ministry does not have updated figures for after 2011 regarding the quality of air./According to Pak-EPA, Islamabad air polluted by carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, formaldehyde/""The [ministry's] state of the art environment monitoring system became non-functional five years ago. Pak-EPA has no mechanism for calculating the increase in suspended particulate matter and emissions from vehicles and factories in the air in Islamabad,"" he said./The environmental monitoring system he referred to was purchased for Rs1.2 billion with assistance from the Japanese government./""It was one of Pak-EPA's most ambitious projects. For five years, the machine has only gathered dust and some of its parts have been damaged from lack of use,"" the senior official said, explaining that some of the parts needed to be replaced frequently./According to the official, the increased number of vehicles in the city was leading to increased emissions and smoke./""Just 60,000 vehicles were registered in Islamabad in 1998. According to Pakistan Bureau Statistics 2013-14, the number of registered vehicles in the city has increased to 15.2 million,"" he said./In May this year, the Secretary Ministry of Climate Change Syed Abu Ahmed Akif had said Rs1.8 million in funds were released to make the environment monitoring system functional again./However, Pak-EPA officials have yet to revive the machine installed in their offices in H-8. The Rs1.8 fund for the machine has since lapsed./A shortage of qualified staff was also one of the reasons the machine could not be made functional./In its written reply to the National Assembly on Tuesday, Pak-EPA has said that due to the increased number of vehicles on the city's roads, the environment watchdog was finding it difficult to start with testing emissions every day and said this will require funds and human resources./Pak-EPA has claimed that some of the steps taken for reducing smoke emissions from vehicles included phasing out lead from gasoline, the reduction of sulphur in diesel and conversion to compressed natural gas./While most car engines are of Euro II standard, Pak-EPA said it has been unable to convince fuel manufacturers to improve the quality of fuel up to Euro standards."
Three steel furnaces sealed for air pollution," Three steel furnaces were sealed on Thursday for not complying with environmental laws and air pollution in the twin cities./Armed with an order from the Supreme Court, the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration - which provided police personnel - conducted an operation against the owners of the furnaces./The SC's directions said steel mills would be sealed until their owners installed gadgets to control pollution./""From the report of the Director General, Pak-EPA, as well as newspaper stories, it is evident that the pollution in the residential areas has reached dangerous levels and the residents are feeling difficulty in breathing. In this state of affairs, we have no option but to order sealing of all the steel industries in Sectors I-9 and I-10,"" read the court order available with Dawn./Following approval from the climate change secretary, Mohammad Akif, the furnaces have been sealed for three months from August 18 to November 19./""We receive dozens of complaints every month from residents, as well as from other factories - most of which produce food and beverages in I-9 and I-10 - about the air becoming difficult to breathe every minute. We raided three steel furnaces, and will raid and shut down every steel mill and furnace that is not complying with environmental laws and is polluting the air,"" Pak-EPA Deputy Director Farzana Altaf Shah, who led the raid, said./Residents as well as nearby food and beverage producers and other factory owners have complained about acrid, black fumes suspended in the air throughout the day./In her office, Ms Shah pointed to a pile of complaints from food producing companies that have protested against steel mills and furnaces that burn cheap mineral coal dust and plastic containers used to store hazardous chemicals, instead of expensive furnace oil, for fuel./She said the thick, black smoke emitted from these fuel sources was suffocating./""We have recently learnt that owners of some steel mills are now using baggase, a by-product of sugarcane, as a cheap fuel source. The odour is unbearable, and the emissions from burning baggase are deadly to humans,"" Ms Shah said. She said the stench of burnt baggase remained on her for hours after she visited just one furnace./Pak-EPA also suspected that some mill and furnaces were using old tyres as fuel to lower costs, despite restrictions placed on the practice by the government./According to Ms Shah, none of the steel mills had equipment installed in the furnace's chimneys to control emissions, despite repeated requests from the agency to invest in devices that filter out harmful hydrocarbons from smoke."
Burgeoning traffic major cause of pollution in Swat," With rapid increase in the number of vehicles in Swat, air pollution due to vehicle emissions has also increased, which not only contributes to climate change but also affect human health to a great extent, say environmental experts./According to the data available in the district motor vehicle excise and taxation office in Swat, a total of 40,347 vehicles including motorbikes, cars, jeeps, tractors, buses, taxi cabs, rickshaws, trucks and pickups are registered till date./The Swat district Excise and Taxation Officer (ETO) Dawood Shah said that there were many other vehicles registered in other parts of the country and moving in Swat while several vehicles registered in Swat were out of Swat too./Ironically, there are over 12,000 illegal auto-rickshaws plying on Swat roads, but the district government is unable to seize them./About the illegally registered rickshaws, he said that there were two types of registration; private vehicles and commercial vehicles. ""The registration of private vehicles falls under my control which I mark to our inspector for verification, while to register commercial vehicles I mark the case to the motor vehicle examiner who is not in my office. Therefore, we register rickshaws after the verification of MVE,"" Mr Shah told Dawn./However, a large number of non-custom paid (NCP) vehicles in Swat are temporarily registered with the district police office. According to the latest data available in the DPO Swat office, a total of 60,000 NCP vehicles move in Swat./The total population of Swat district is about two million according to the last census and the total number of all the legal, NCP and illegal vehicles in Swat stands at 114,226. It means for every 18 people there is one vehicle available in Swat. Such a large number of vehicles emit high level of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter and other pollution./According to the data from January to June 2016 of the air pollution-related diseases available in the Swat district health office, a total of 17,846 patients of scabies, 11,036 of dermatitis, 216,639 of acute respiratory infection, 8,405 of pneumonia, 1,986 of TB, 1,271 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 9,484 of asthma, 13,624 of depression, 479 of drug dependence, 451 of epilepsy, 4,042 of eye diseases and 15,548 of ear diseases were recorded. This data has been obtained only from the government facilities./Owing to the rapid increase in the number of vehicles and lack of emission control technologies, Vehicle Emission Testing Stations (VITS) were established in 1997 with the technical assistance of GTZ German Agency for technical cooperation equipped with three sets of emission control technology to test and analyse emissions of all kinds of vehicles./Vehicle Emission Testing Station, Swat region, head Imtiaz Ahmad said that the huge number of auto-rickshaws and the other vehicles in Swat were the major contributors to pollution. Two-stroke engines have higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than four-stroke engines in rickshaws./""In 2015-16 VITS monitored 14,000 vehicles in Mingora following National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) and issued pass certificates and stickers to 10,000 vehicles while 4,000 vehicles which failed the NEQS protocols were fined according to the traffic laws,"" he said./Mr Ahmad said that in 2016 exposure of 4.4ppm carbon monoxide (CO), 14.3ppm sulphur dioxide ( SO2), 8.4ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 128 micro gram/m3 total suspended particles (TSP) were measured in Mingora, which all affect human health badly. He said that his team was trying to minimise their exposure in the near future./Air pollution is the major cause of respiratory infection, lung cancer, heart diseases, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, skin diseases and pulmonary diseases./According to the Section 15 of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997, vehicles that produce air pollutants and noise beyond the limit provided by the national environmental quality department should be banned while two-stroke auto-rickshaws should be replaced with that of four strokes./Climate experts say that combustion of gas and diesel produces greenhouse gases that are contributing to climate changes to a high extent./Syed Mushtaq Ali Shah, regional director of Pakistan Meteorological Department, said that the air pollution along with deforestation and uncertain developments in Swat had increased temperature level and also changed the rain pattern to a high extent as the amount of rain not only decreased, but also became erratic. ""The rain pattern has changed completely as now it often showers to extreme level for a day and then for months there is no rain while slight increase has been recorded in the monsoon rainfall pattern,"" he said./Presently, Swat valley is facing severe threats and impacts of the climate change as there is a record high increase in the temperature with flash floods and droughts becoming increasingly common. The main cause of the increasing warm weather is the vehicle emissions along with cutting of forest on a large scale in the valley./A report on climate change and disaster risks in Swat, Shangla and Kohistan districts carried out by Lasoona, a local organisation in Swat, indicates that the mean total precipitation was 19.4 inches (492mm) in 1961 that declined to 17.2 inches (436mm) in 2014, while the mean temperature reveals an increase of 0.2 degree Celsius. ""The increase in temperature and depletion in the precipitation has not only affected the well-being of the local people, but has also reduced the glaciers covered area and water resources in the catchment areas of Swat, Ghurband and Indus River,"" the report states./Environmental experts have stressed the need for controlling the increasing vehicular emissions and the rapid increase in illegal and NCP vehicles in the region for pollution-free environment."
Medical waste dumped in open poses serious threat to public health," Despite being the largest public sector hospital in the city and among the few that have an incinerator, the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JMPC) at present doesn't have a proper system to dispose of its medical waste, a major potential threat to the safety of its staff, patients as well as the community at large, it emerged on Sunday./During a recent visit to the JPMC's incinerator located on its premises, feral cats and birds were found scavenging among the piles of waste, which included hazardous medical refuse such as empty bottles, used needles, syringes, IV bags, blood bags and soiled dressings./The incinerator was found non-operational./Upon contact, deputy director of administration at the JPMC Dr Javed Jamali said the incinerator was operated only when sufficient waste was collected./""It is operated daily but only for two to three hours. There are many healthcare facilities in the city which don't even have this mechanism,"" he said, admitting that hospital waste shouldn't have been thrown out in the open./The hospital incinerator, he said, was too old but couldn't be replaced owing to a shortage of funds./To a question whether the hospital has a system to segregate hazardous and non-hazardous refuse at source, he said: ""This protocol is adopted only for high-risk patients, for instance, those who are diagnosed with hepatitis and Congo virus infection.""/Endorsing the opinion that most healthcare facilities in the city are operating without a waste disposal system, executive member of the Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Society of Pakistan, Dr Altaf Ahmed said that such a mechanism existed at a few private hospitals only./""The Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and the Civil Hospital Karachi, the two major government hospitals in the city, had also bought incinerators a long time back but I don't know whether they are still being used,"" he said./""Waste from hospitals including the Indus Hospital is lifted by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, which, I am told, incinerates the refuse at its two facilities.""/However, there were hundreds of laboratories and clinics operating in the city without any regulatory mechanism, he pointed out, questioning their waste disposal practices./""There are millions of germs in a single bottle used for any microbiological test, which is just thrown away in the open. This reflects our apathy towards our environment.""/Spread of disease/Hospital waste, he said, may lead to the spread of various diseases including those caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria, many of which evolve at health facilities./""Scavengers get the disease first and become carriers of infections for diseases like hepatitis, diarrhea, food-borne illnesses, skin infections, tuberculosis, cancer etc./""Besides, waste dumped in the open is a breeding site for mosquitoes as well as for flies. Liquid waste is routinely discharged into sewerage drains in hospitals that can contaminate drinking water in areas with a faulty sewerage system,"" he added./Hospital waste categorised as hazardous waste should be separated at source and treated in large ""green autoclaves"" that don't cause air pollution./""These not only sterilise the waste but also greatly reduce the size of the solid waste, which is then mixed with other material and disposed of at landfill sites,"" he said, suggesting that the government should set-up such facilities and charge health facilities for the service./Concerns over poor medical waste disposal practices have recently been highlighted by experts in a study carried out on food being sold in and outside 10 public sector hospitals of the city./The Karachi University study has shown that the food was unfit for human consumption and that the germs contaminating it had resistance against a number of commonly used antibiotics./The samples were picked up from the Civil Hospital Karachi, Landhi Medical Complex, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Sindh government hospital, Liaquatabad, Qatar Hospital, Sindh government hospital (UP Mor), Lyari General Hospital, JPMC, Dow University of Health Sciences (Ojha campus), and Sindh Social Security Hospital./The study identified dumping of waste (especially medical waste) in the open, lack of infection control measures at healthcare settings, mixing of sewerage lines with water mains, and poor hygiene practices of food handlers as major contributors to the evolution of these germs and their spread."
Cotton dust related diseases common at city's textile mills: study," Cotton dust related ailments and diseases were found to be common at the city's seven textile mills where a majority of workers neither had safety gadgets to protect themselves from the cotton dust nor had knowledge of the health risks posed by it, revealed a study whose preliminary findings were shared at a programme held at the Aga Khan University (AKU) auditorium on Monday./The study suggests that investment in workers' health and safety in the textile sector could boost productivity and competitiveness of Pakistan's largest industry./A total of 300 workers at the seven mills - with a total workforce of 9,000 - were interviewed under the MultiTex project of AKU's community health department and GIZ (a German development agency) with the objective to look at the severity of health risks employees at work were exposed to, and their understanding of occupational health and safety hazards./The study found that 90 per cent of textile workers who were interviewed during the study were not aware of the health risks posed by cotton dust, while almost 80 per cent of them were not using safety gadgets like face masks that could help them protect against it./""These preliminary findings reinforce our earlier study which found cotton-dust related diseases and ailments quite common at 15 textile mills of Karachi. A total of 372 workers were interviewed during that survey,"" said AKU assistant professor Dr Asaad Nafees./According to her, at least one in 10 textile workers developed byssinosis (a lung disease caused by prolonged inhalation of textile fiber dust), two in 10 employees suffered from shortness of breath, while three in every 10 labourers complained of tightness in the chest./These health risks, she pointed out, reduced quality of life and resulted in absenteeism and lost productivity for the textile industry./""With 10 million or more employees in this sector [in Pakistan], this represents a significant loss in human capital and potential manufacturing output,"" she observed./During the study, researchers used special indoor devices to measure air pollution in different parts of the mills. Workers also wore personal air monitors (to see the level of cotton dust being inhaled) and were given lung function tests before and after shifts to assess the seriousness of the daily impact of pollution./Speakers also noted the significant contribution the textile industry was making to the country's exports (58pc) supported by an estimated 10 million strong workforce. Productivity, they said, could be enhanced multiple times if steps were taken to improve health and safety conditions at work./Mr Olaf Petermann representing German Social Accident Insurance said that investments in occupational health and safety would boost competitiveness of Pakistani businesses./""The research findings shared today will help build a case for textile industry stakeholders to improve health and safety since it will benefit both workers and the financial performance of companies.""/The event ended with a panel discussion featuring representatives from the Sindh labour department, a technical consultant from SGS Pakistan and officials from non-governmental organisations, HomeNet, Pakistan Institute of Labour, Education and Research, and business associations."
PTI's 'tsunami' hits shisham trees on University Road," AUTUMN is almost coming to close yet it appears the hot weather is here to stay. Is it climate change or global warming? I guess both but somehow our policy makers are missing the point here./In this backdrop, the ongoing ""beautification"" has destroyed several green belts, several indigenous, shady trees and public spaces. Under the stewardship of PDA, innovative traffic management strategies seem to have somewhat improved traffic, but these eye catching reforms mask the greater threat to sustainable and green solutions, which remain unfulfilled. There is hardly any breathing space for pedestrians or lanes for cyclists. The motto seems to be ""Drive or Die!""/The corporate development model has shifted the focus from an inclusive (public) policy towards profit making (elitist) model. Thus money making mega projects like flyovers and multiple lanes for vehicles is a preferred government policy rather than investing in environmental-friendly alternatives like affordable public transport system for a larger population that would also reduce vehicular traffic and air pollution affecting millions. One is destined to choke with pollution if not driving in the comfort zone of an air conditioned vehicle./Large indigenous trees are considered ""lungs of the earth"" being natural air conditioners, reducing heat but also absorbing large quantities of toxic gases like CO2 and CO etc. Instead of protecting precious trees as national assets, a concerted effort is on way to make extinct the rare species, instead opting for exotic palm species and other decorative plants, that worsen the environment besides unsuitable for local climate./The WHO reports that polluted air is a public health emergency, nine out of 10 people globally breathe bad air that is blamed for more than six million deaths a year. The UN agency warns that nearly 90 per cent of air pollution-related deaths occur in low and middle-income countries. ""Pakistan too is suffering, with experts blaming unsustainable development, warning that proposals for more coal-fired power stations will further worsen air quality,"" it adds./Comprehensive study into increasing cases of malignancy, IHD, COPD, cardio vascular diseases and host of respiratory ailments would point a finger towards the highly toxic vehicular and industrial emissions. More scientific research on quality of air is needed for informed decision by public policy planners to factor in the health and wellbeing of a large adversely affected population./As in previous governments, the remaining old shisham trees have again come under axe of PDA, along University Road opposite BISE and Islamia College Peshawar. This is another ill-advised project for adding up fourth lane to ease traffic./Despite repeated expansions in 2008, 2010 and 2013 with loss of many precious trees, traffic has increased exponentially, quickly outpacing the added lanes. Civil organisations have long expressed their reservations about felling precious heritage trees for short sighted development policy. PDA had given an undertaking that further road expansion would not be carried out on University Road and would protect the existing (few) heritage trees, in response to a stay order filed in PHC by five CSOs in 2010. This undertaking has been violated again by ongoing PDA road expansion./Increase or adding up more lanes may give temporary relief, but exacerbate traffic congestion, being quick fix and not a long term solution. It is allegedly meant to benefit the powerful timber lobbies (for furniture export) of expensive and rare shisham (rose wood). Some officials are allegedly linked to this business. Shisham trees predating 1947 have become extinct for their high economic rewards for all involved in this sordid business in Pakistan./With climate change and global warming around the corner, Pakistan should be conserving and not felling large indigenous trees, essential to fight emerging 'heat island effect' in large (polluted) cities like Peshawar. There appears to be a criminal disregard. The rise in temperature in the otherwise moderate autumn (October) is a signal that all is not well. An inclusive (public) environment policy should top the policy agenda./PTI's billion-tree tsunami project appears far-fetched to general public as it is not grounded in local political and social milieu. A disconnect between policy making and public demand cannot be more acute in all major cities when left at the mercy of a ubiquitous timber mafia and increasing air pollution, Peshawar being no exception./Peshawar needs development of alternative (available) road routes other than further expansion of University Road being the main artery. Besides, policy on alternate transport systems like mono rail or MTS is long overdue and slow in implementation./Policy makers need to work ""out of the box"" solutions and include experts from Institute of Architects of Pakistan (KP chapter), senior citizens and CSO forums for a sustainable (green) solution rather than destruction of (last) remaining heritage trees in Peshawar./Therefore, to begin with, an immediate halt to ongoing road expansion, upgrading EPA and giving it powers to vet development projects sans political pressure, besides, setting up of independent expert advisory boards in KP each district, is the answer to get out of the destructive vicious cycle./Finally, besides measuring success in terms of GDP growth, the government needs to also factor in ""quality of life"" and ""physical and mental health"" as major indicators to measure development."
Smog descends on provincial capital," As fog enveloped the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway on Friday, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has issued an advisory to the district administration across the province to sensitise the people and communities to smoggy conditions./The advisory was issued over the reports of fog blanketing Lahore and other parts of the Punjab and creating problems for the public./On Thursday, 16 people were killed in traffic accidents caused by fog in Punjab, while 12 people died a vehicle pileup on the motorway due to zero visibility./A Pakistan Meteorological Department official said visibility was slightly affected as the haze descended on areas close to rivers and other water sources./""Conditions will deteriorate as the temperature plunges during the coming days,"" he said./The PDMA officials said the two advisories were issued on Nov 3 to all deputy commissioners across the province in light of the PMD's smog advisory issued on November 2. They said smoggy conditions was likely to affect the province as there had been no rain for past many weeks and the situation was likely to linger on for several more weeks./Advisory a copy of which is available with Dawn notes that due to stable atmospheric conditions, smoggy conditions were likely to persist and that a shallow westerly wave would produce light to moderate rains in northeast Punjab and upper parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and snowfall over the mountains and thus, bringing little relief./""Less than average rainfall is expected during the months of November and December and therefore, smog, fog and mist will remain prevalent phenomenon,"" it said./The advisory said higher concentration of smog was expected in urban areas./""Smog containing pollutants may cause eye and throat irritations as well as difficulty in breathing,"" it said, adding that the people should take precautionary measures./The advisory pressed deputy commissioners for sensitising the people and communities to exercise all precautionary measures such as avoiding unnecessary movement, wearing of protection masks and eyewash during intense smoggy conditions./Also the PMD's fog update for Friday said it would be hazy on Peshawar-Swabi and Swabi-Islamabad sections of the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M1)./Syed Mushtaq Ali Shah, director regional metrological centre in Peshawar, told Dawn that smog possibility was higher in areas where there was a higher percentage of moisture in the air./He said suspended dust particles and chemicals when mix with air moisture was called smog./Mr. Shah said Peshawar and its neighbouring areas hadn't received rains over the last one and a half months and that there was little chance of rains in the coming weeks./He said foggy conditions would continue developing in the province during the current month./""Smoggy conditions impact are likely to be higher in the areas like Dera Ismail Khan, Charsadda, Nowshera, Swabi districts and parts of Mardan and Lakki Marwat district, where air moisture is in greater percentage compared to other areas,"" he said./The weatherman said higher percentage of air pollution caused by large number of vehicles and industrial units was likely to create smoggy conditions in the provincial capital as well./He said smoggy conditions would not have much effect in districts of Hazara and Malakand divisions."
Why Punjab's smog has aggravated this year," The latest smog situation has left Lahore in a choking haze, but even in the past environmental experts and activists have been vocal about air pollution issue. Now NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has pointed out that burning of crop stubbles may be a major reason for a smog blanket in New Delhi, and also in Lahore, as the map shows several places in West Punjab that have thermal emissions./Both East and West Punjab have two growing seasons - one from May to September and the other from November to April. In May and November, Punjab farmers typically sow crops and vegetables for the next season; but before sowing, they often set fire to fields to clear stubbles of previous crop and make them suitable for next sowing./Experts' views vary on the matter./""While burning is a major problem... I don't believe this is the reason why the smog has seen a spike this year,"" says environmentalist Aleem Butt. ""Action should definitely be taken for burning crop stubbles, but in the meantime we are being invaded by noxious gases from coal power plants. Another very big cause which is being ignored is the high level of deforestation this year. Too many trees were cut down first for the Kalma Underpass and now the Orange Line.""/As for an alternative method for crop stubble burning, the best method is to plough the stalks back into the earth where they can decompose into humus./Environmentalist and researcher Noman Ashraf says that labs of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are not operational, and without any empirical evidence, there can hardly be any crackdown on factories and other offenders./""There are third-party labs which are doing this work, but the EPA has not bothered to renew their collaborative licences with them either,"" he says./According to him, the Air Quality Index monitors were installed at five points during the last decade, but because the instruments were not calibrated they eventually became useless. ""If we look at China and India, they at least have figures to go by,"" says Mr Ashraf./""If the EPA claims to have regular readings then, under the public's right to know, these figures should be uploaded on a website or publicised through media.""/EPA argues that it has state-of-the-art labs and regular readings. ""We only had one purchasing issue... otherwise all our equipment is working just fine,"" says an official of the EPA. Now with air pollution levels high enough to cause concern, EPA has worked out readings of between November 2 and 4./And these reveal some startling figures./For example, nitric oxide should not be more than 40mcg per cubic metre but during this period Mall Road saw over 306mcg/cubic metre, and Mohlanwal (near Bahria Town) 332mcg/cubic metre./Particles less than 2.5µm (micrometres) are called PM2.5. They are approximately 1/30th the average width of a human hair. The benchmark for PM2.5 should be 35mcg/cubic metre, but none of the figures recorded during the period fell within this range./Readings were similar for PM10, whose levels should have been below 150, but were recorded to be higher in Shahdara area (264). However in other places levels were below 150./Sulphur dioxide, which should be well below 120mcg per cubic metre, was seen highest in Mominpura, an appalling 1,373mcg per cubic metre. The carbon monoxide levels, which should have been below 5msg/cubic metre, were recorded at 21mcg/ cubic metre on Mall Road, and 17mcg/cubic metre at Mohlanwal, while at other places the levels were slightly higher than 5./Meanwhile, Ashraf says the issue of crop stubble burning may have been misinterpreted. ""This is nothing new in the region and has been happening for decades. But this recent spike is because farmers in East Punjab, who had originally been selling their wheat stalks for biomass plants, burnt their agri-waste this year after their requested price was turned down by the biomass plants.""/A sharecropper farmer of Okara area says that seeds and other agriculture inputs are so costly nowadays that it is inconceivable to buy more land only in order to plough the stalks back in the ground. ""Burning is much more convenient for us.""/Naseemur Rehman Shah, a spokesperson for EPA, says his department has urged the agriculture department to take notice of the problem, but no action has so far been taken./He too doesn't agree with the view that crop burning is the major reason behind the smog. ""Climatic change is happening at a global level, and every region is affected. Smog or fog that used to come later in the year has happened earlier this time.""/But when asked about the trees cut down in Lahore because of various development projects, Rehman says the EPA did not disallow it because that was the last resort. ""The government has announced that for every public sector project one per cent of the total cost has to go into tree plantation,"" he says./He adds that even corridors like the Motorway are having trees planted along them. ""Sometimes tree cutting has been allowed because it was the need of the day,"" he says./There are also other factors contributing to air pollution and one of these is factories, he says. ""While crop stubble burning is a serious issue, most of the fumes are coming from East Punjab; but at the same time from within Lahore, we have factories that cannot use natural gas and therefore burn all kinds of materials including rubber to create fuel.""/He says that around 300 units have been shut down by the Punjab government in the recent past and these include large- and small-scale industries./Regarding air pollution, Rehman says that currently there are about 3,000 cases under trial in environment tribunals from all over Punjab./But apart from industries, there is the huge issue of traffic as well./Rehman says that traffic congestion, bad roads, increasing number of vehicles, old vehicles with bad engines, and banned vehicles were main causes and many were still operating. The two-stroke auto and cycle rickshaws both are seen running despite being banned./""We are fully aware of the situation and the ban is being implemented slowly. After all changes cannot happen overnight. A decade ago we were worried about how the air pollution issue was being neglected but by introducing alternative transport projects like the Orange Line... the government is moving in the right direction.""/""These projects are most environment-friendly,"" says Rehman. ""Orange Line will run on electricity, new LTC buses will use CNG and other Euro 2 and 3 standard buses will use good quality diesel.""/Rafay Alam, an environmental lawyer, says unless there are proper metering systems, not just in Lahore but all over Punjab, no one could make any conclusive claims./""First off, monitors are needed to tell us what the pollution levels are,"" he says. ""When we get accurate data the pollutants will be precisely identified and so a proper response can be formulated."""
Up in the air," ON Nov 7, I left Delhi for Uttar Pradesh to do a couple of pre-election stories. On that day, the main headline of the Hindustan Times was: 'Worst smog yet wakes up govt'./But by the time I got back to polluted Delhi from polluted Lucknow, the winds had changed: the trending topic was - and still is - Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to scrap INR500 and 1,000 currency notes. So these days, the talk of the town is not 'AQI' (air quality index, a hip term even two weeks ago) any more but demonetisation. In pubs, airports and coffee shops, the only question doing the rounds are variants of ""Mila kya/kitna mila [did you get it/how much did you get]?""/My environmentalist friends have gone green with envy. ""What a bad luck. The usually reticent public was finally waking up to the scourge of dirty air in the city. But now no one's talking about it since they are busy standing at ATMs or in bank queues,"" said Reena. ""We have lost the momentum thanks to demonetisation.""/She is correct: the city - and the country - is so taken up by demonetisation (demonisation of cash, if you ask the Congress) that it seems to have forgotten all about the other critical issue that not only impacts our health but also the economy: air pollution./""Several industry bodies have talked about the economic effect,"" Reena said, adding: ""While it may be difficult to hazard a figure of economic loss since the exact period of dangerous levels of pollutants would depend on the weather conditions along with administrative measures, there is no doubt that several billions of dollars of fresh investment and GDP loss would occur, besides causing a loss of confidence among the citizens.""/According to news reports, there are already requests from global tour operators to their Indian counterparts to re-align the itinerary of the international tourists to the 'Golden Triangle'. Instead of the tourists dividing their period of stay between Delhi, Agra and Rajasthan, there have been inquiries about whether visitors can avoid Delhi, excepting the touchdown options at the international airport./The impact on health could be severe too. Last week, Greenpeace - not exactly the National Democratic Alliance government's favourite NGO - said that more people died from air pollution in India than in China last year. Outdoor air pollution killed 3,283 people in India in 2015, compared to 3,233 in China. Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases study, the report said the spike happened because of the lack of adequate measures by the government./If AQI (air quality index) has become a trendy term these days, the new fashion statement is a pollution mask and air purifiers. If I remember correctly, the first time Delhi really took notice of air purifiers was when President Barack Obama visited New Delhi in 2015 and the US embassy purchased 1,800 indoor air purifiers to protect its employees at the embassy and other locations./When the news broke, Delhi's citizens, politicians and bureaucrats - always conscious about their and the city's pre-eminent position in the country - were horrified: not by the poor air quality, but by the Western media/governments' audacity in targeting their 'beloved green' city./Post-Diwali, masks sold like hot cakes. There were long queues - though not long as the ones we now see outside every bank/ATM - for masks. A store in tony Khan Market in New Delhi made quite a killing by selling masks designed by Manish Arora, which debuted in the Paris Fashion Week last year. ""The Arora masks go out of stock before the ordinary ones,"" store manager Meena Thakur told the Telegraph./Protection of the trendy kind comes at a price. The basic Vogmask mask costs INR1,800 apiece for children and goes up to INR2,200 for adults. Arora's five varieties - vivid butterfly, paisley and star prints, among others - cost INR2,500 each, the Telegraph reported./My colleague Avnish Dutta was at Khan Market store to buy a mask. ""I stood there for about an hour before I could get one. What I found interesting is that no one was talking about the fact that as citizens we also have certain responsibilities in cutting down pollution. They were more bothered about the quality and look of the masks. But these are short-term measures,"" Dutta, a proud owner of an Arora mask, told me recently./He hit the nail on the head. While the centre and the state have to take drastic measures (congestion tax, banning crop burning, fixing the roads, curbing construction activities, etc), the people too have to scale down Diwali festivities (crackers, that is) and ration the use of personal vehicles. But try and say that on Twitter and the right-wing brigade will behead you./Meanwhile, we are back standing in another queue, mask or no mask. Air pollution is all but forgotten though the toxic particles are all up in the air, floating merrily./The next Diwali is still a year away, you see."
PU 'pollution study group' to combat environmental challenges," The Punjab University (PU) on Tuesday announced that it would form a pollution study group to combat environmental challenges the province was faced with./""According to various satellite pictures taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), crops were burnt at a large scale in Indian Punjab along with coal, which created environmental hazards for Pakistan./The group will also study this issue,"" PU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mujahid Kamran said while speaking at a national seminar on 'Smog: Formation, Impacts and Mitigation' organised by the varsity's College of Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) in collaboration with SEAL here on Tuesday./""If we gather relevant proofs, a case can be filed against India in international courts,"" Dr Kamran added./CEES Principal Prof Dr Sajid Rashid, Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) head Shoaib Shafiq, environmental law expert Ahmed Rafay Alam, Met Office's Duty Forecasting Officer Syed Pervaiz Shah, SEAL Chief Environmentalist Aleem Butt, Pakistan Green Building Guidelines head Muhammad Sohaib Tahir, various environmentalists, faculty members and students were present on the occasion./Dr Rashid shed light on the history of smog, saying research work was being carried out at the college on various environmental changes. ""Lahore and surroundings areas had to face smog due to India,"" he added./Alam, citing judgements and relevant laws, said courts had played a role in protection of environment. ""International environmental laws are very strict and we can file a case against India's role in the recent smog if we have solid proof,"" he added./Shafiq highlighted the difference between smoke, cloud, fog and smog through satellite images and briefed the participants about instruments being used by Suparco./Butt said coal was being used for meeting most of Indian energy needs and that India was behind smog. Tahir gave a presentation regarding types and elements of air pollution./UET: The prime task of engineering is to contribute to resolving societal issues. Practitioners will have to be well-equipped with modern technology to do that./This was expressed by University of Engineering and Technology's Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Fazal Ahmad Khalid while talking to participants at the inaugural ceremony of a five-day training course on 'Ground Water Modeling and Management' designed by Centre of Excellence in Water Resources Engineering held here on Tuesday./Dr Izharul Haq, adviser to the Water and Power Development Authority, said devising a water policy was a need of the hour to manage the commodity properly for its utilisation for domestic, industrial and irrigation purposes."
Particulate air pollution growing in Peshawar," The Environmental Protection Agency claims the level of Particulate Matter (PM2.5), which increases the age-specific mortality risk, has breached the guidelines of the National Environmental Quality Standard (NEQS) in Peshawar./""The PM2.5 at all sampling locations in Peshawar is higher than the limits of NEQS. The biggest impact of particulate air pollution on public health is understood to be from long-term exposure to PM2.5 (10-15 years), which increases the age specific mortality risk,"" says the EPA's findings./Currently, the minimum level of PM2.5 in the air of Peshawar is 40 and the maximum 90, while the NEQS recommends that level of tiny particles in the air should not be more than 15 micrograms per cubic meter. Rise of PM2.5 in the air becomes hazardous for human health and also reduces visibility./""The level of PM2.5 is four times higher in the air of Peshawar than the NEQS limit, which is alarming. It requires joint efforts to reduce level of pollution,"" said EPA director general Dr Mohammad Bashir Khan./Official pushes govt, people for teaming up to control dust, vehicular emissions/He said: ""We can't blame single factor or sector for the soaring level of pollution in the air./The vehicular emissions, waste burning, construction work, debris, dust, broken roads, poor collection of waste, smoke discharged from brick kilns are contributing to air pollution.""/The EPA tested air samples at 28 different locations in the provincial capital. According to the study level of Carbon Monoxide is within NEQS limits. Percentage of Nitric Oxide (NO) in the air is also within NEQS limits at all location except two area; Kohat Road and Ring Road because of high vehicular traffic./Quantity of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) at all 28 points has exceeded NEQS limits. High percentage of NO2 can cause lung irritation, and weaken the body's defense against respiratory infections. However concentration of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in the provincial capital is within limit./Medical experts define PM2.5 a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets that get into the air. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects./Director Medical of Lady Reading Hospital Dr Mukhtiar Zaman Afridi said that excess of PM2.5 in the air could cause affect from nose to lungs. He said after inhalation, those tiny particles deposited in human body and caused different diseases./""The duration of how long one remains in this environment is very important. It affects people like shopkeepers, policemen and residents who are exposed to PM2 for a longer duration,"" he said, adding that heavy concentration of pollutants in the air caused high blood pressure and other complications./""The number of patients is increasing because of air pollution in Peshawar,"" said Dr Afridi, a pulmonary disease specialist. After passing through the respiratory system these tiny particles deposited in lungs, he added./The EPA DG said thousands of light and heavy vehicles were running on the city's roads on daily bases./""Tiny particulates dispersed into the air as a result of tires rubbing off the road surface also pose threat to health,"" he said, adding that heavy traffic especially unfit machines also discharged emission and created dust in urban areas./The population of private vehicles is rapidly increasing in Peshawar and other urban centres and towns of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa./According to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa statistics development, the total number of vehicles in Peshawar is 577,232 including 212,439 motorcycles and scooters, 95,703 jeeps and cars and 21,446 buses, mini-buses and coasters./Brick kilns in the surroundings of Peshawar are considered main source pollution, discharging thick black smoke. Around 650 brick kilns operate around the city in which coal and used tyres are burned./The heavy traffic, especially motorcycles, is considered another active agent of air pollution in the city. In the absence of proper transport system, motorcycles have become basic and affordable means of transportation./Officials in the excise and taxation department said on average, 110 motorcycles were registered in Peshawar every month./Dr Bashir suggested that the government bodies and citizens work together to control dust and reduce vehicular emissions to keep air clean from pollutants otherwise heavy smog could envelop Peshawar in next few years."
'Smoking-related diseases killing one person every 10 seconds'," Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increases the risk of developing lungs cancer, heart disease and other such fatal diseases./The COPD kills one person every 10 seconds on an average and the death rate is increased about 10-fold for each 15 cigarettes smoked daily and regularly in the past, said chest specialists and pulmonologists at a ceremony on Wednesday to mark the COPD awareness month in Pakistan./Dr Ashraf Jamal, Punjab president of Pakistan Chest Society, said smoking cigarettes from adolescence to adulthood cost on average 10 years of life./""In Pakistan, 18.7 percent of smoking and breathlessness alone is the most frequently reported symptom of the COPD,"" he said./Quoting World Health Organization (WHO) estimates for 2030, Dr Jamal said the COPD had been predicted to become the third leading cause of death killing over 4.5 million people worldwide./Calling the COPD a ""man-made"" disease, he said that many cases of the disease could be preventable by avoidance or early cessation of smoking. ""It is important that countries adopt the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and implement the MPOWER package of measures,"" said Dr Jamal./Dr Javed Magsi, the head of Lahore General Hospital's Pulmonology Department, said long-term exposure to other lung irritants like air pollution, chemical fumes or dust also contributes to the COPD./Dr Kamran Khalid Cheema, the head of Services Hospital's Pulmonology Department, said the COPD ""develops slowly and usually becomes apparent after 40 or 50 years of age. It is not curable, but treatment can relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and reduce the risk of death""./""In Pakistan, the prevalence rate of the COPD related symptoms is 18.5 percent and COPD patients with co-morbidity are 26.7 percent, while 76.7 percent of the COPD patients experience exacerbation,"" said Dr Cheema./Dr Tariq Mahmood Mian, the president of Family Physicians of Pakistan, said that smoking cessation was essential to treat the COPD. Appropriate pharmacological therapy can reduce COPD symptoms and reduce the frequency of severity of exacerbation and severity of exacerbation and improve overall health status and exercise tolerance./Jinnah Hospital's Dr Sobia said that women smokers were more prone to the COPD than men who smoke tobacco."
Drizzle brings long-awaited chill," A day-long cloud cover and drizzle in the late afternoon put winter in full swing in the city on Friday, sharply dropping temperature./The winter has been warm in Lahore and elsewhere in the plains of Punjab because of lack of rain which also gave a free chit to the ever-increasing pollution to torment people, causing or aggravating respiratory diseases among them./Thick clouds continued to hang over the city, trapping the night cooling below. As a result, the day's maximum temperature dropped to 16 degrees Celsius from Thursday's 28 degrees Celsius. It rained but lightly in the late afternoon, only settling air pollution to some extent./The Met Office said the westerly wave persisting over upper parts of the country gave 38mm of rain in Malam Jabba, Pattan received 32mm, Balakot 21, Saidu Sharif 20, Kalam 19, Lower Dir 16, Parachinar 13, Cherat 12, Kakul 11, Dir 10, Peshawar and Kohat 9, Risalpur, Mirkhani 5, Kotli 26, Rawalakot, Garhi Dupatta 24, Muzaffarabad 18, Mangla 22, Murree 21, Mandi Bahauddin 15, Islamabad 15, Jhelum 14, Gujrat 10, Rawalpindi 9 and Chakwal 6,/There was good amount of snowfall over the hills. Malam Jabba, Kalam and Neelum Valley recorded 2ft snow, and Murree, Gillyat, Kaghan and Naran 1ft of snow./More intermittent rain-thunderstorm with snowfall over the hills is expected at scattered places in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Lahore divisions, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir. Cold and dry weather is expected elsewhere in the country./Foggy conditions are likely to continue over plain areas of Punjab and Sindh."
"City residents plagued by high levels of air, noise pollution"," At least 40pc of the city's population is exposed to highly polluted air while 65pc residents live in areas with elevated levels of noise pollution, pointed out a researcher while sharing findings of his study at an international conference which opened at the Karachi University (KU) on Wednesday./Titled 'Urban ecology and frontiers of sustainable development', the five-day conference has been organised by the Society for Urban Ecology (SURE), South Asia chapter and KU's Department of Geography./Giving a presentation on a study based on the assessment of human exposure to traffic-borne problems in Karachi, Dr Salman Zubair, assistant professor at KU's geography department, explained that air pollution, an inherent by-product of the combustion process from vehicular traffic, was a serious threat to human health and had been accountable for 4pc deaths and 0.6pc burden of diseases across the globe./'Our study showed that all traffic-generated problems are strongly associated with areas having high road density. The area intensely affected due to air pollution is just 5pc of the total area of Karachi. But, since the area is the city's central part, it has high road and population density,' he said, while mentioning names of towns with high level of air pollution./Polluted air had more serious health impact than noise pollution since hazardous particles remained suspended in the air for a long time, he added./In another presentation on a study that has explored changes in land use along the west bank of Malir River covering a period from 2005 to 2013, Dr Anila Kausar said the results of the study suggested that there was a dire need to improve water availability and related infrastructure in the area./'Poor standards of literacy, lack of governance and investment also adversely affect development of agriculture in this region,' she said./Other subjects covered in the technical sessions included urban environment and stress, ecological city and urban sustainable development; a case study of Karachi, urban development in the eastern Hindu Kush, assessment of change in slum areas and its ecological impact on Karachi, and urban ecosystem services assessment in Romania./Earlier, Prof Salman Qureshi from Humboldt University, Berlin, in his keynote speech spoke about urban ecology in detail and said that megacities of South Asia needed urban planning since living conditions in these areas were not good. Fifty-two per cent area of Mumbai consisted of slums./Prof Cristian Ioja from the University of Bucharest, Romania, Prof Jamil Kazmi and KU Vice Chancellor Prof Mohammad Qaiser also spoke in the inaugural session."
Choosing to breathe clean air," KARACHI'S air is more polluted than Beijing. Think about it. All the clues have been there for many years - my mother-in-law constantly on oxygen or using an inhaler in Karachi, my children using inhalers or taking anti-allergy tablets. But as a scientist, my light bulb moment only happened when I saw a graph in the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s Global Outlook report for 2016, which showed Karachi next to Beijing, but higher on the pollution scale. The IEA's report was on air pollution because, as the report's foreword notes, 'energy production and use is the most important source of air pollution coming from human activity.' I cannot get that graph out of my head./The first reaction I received was denial. The obvious question was, 'If Karachi is that bad, why don't we see the smog associated with Beijing?' Sadly, the pollution that affects health is fine particulate matter, under 2.5 microns in size or PM2.5. You cannot see it. These particles are so tiny that they make their way through to the deepest part of our lungs. These are the ones that kill you - literally. The pollution we can see are the bigger particles that typically get caught in our noses before they get much further. The IEA graph used World Health Organisation (WHO) data. This data indicates that the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 in the air in Karachi is 88 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3), almost nine times WHO's recommended level of 10 µg/m3. Even Pakistan's own ambient standard for PM2.5 puts the cap at 15 µg/m3 (annual average). Other Pakistani cities are not much better. According to WHO, the concentration of PM2.5 in Peshawar and Rawalpindi is over 100 µg/m3, much worse than in Karachi. Lahore and Islamabad are over 60 µg/m3, more than four times the Pakistani national standard./Poor air quality increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma. Air pollution kills about eight million people annually, and is the fourth leading risk factor for premature deaths worldwide, costing the global economy about $225 billion in lost labour income in 2013, according to the World Bank. Even greater is the cost of illness, resulting in health costs and loss of productivity due to days off work. The highest cost is the agony of watching our children or parents suffer from diseases such as asthma and the loss of pride associated with living in a dirty city./To tackle the pollution in our cities, we need to first acknowledge that we have an air quality problem./However, many cities and countries have successfully addressed this problem. Mexico City made huge improvements by acting on vehicular pollution and Bogota by improving fuel quality. Others succeeded temporarily until investments were made that locked in a development path that did not take into account future pollution. In China's case, it is the coal power plants that are a major source of air pollution. Therefore, in 2012, the Chinese government sought to remedy this by tightening emissions standards for their coal power plants ahead of many countries, including the EU. Thus, they were able to respond to their energy needs and protect the health of their citizens./In order to tackle the pollution in our cities, we need to first acknowledge that we have an air quality problem and begin to share data regularly on air quality and emissions sources with citizens. Indeed, the right to a clean environment is already enshrined in our Constitution and confirmed by the Supreme Court./Secondly, we need to identify the sources of pollution in each of our major cities using a fairly simple test where air is passed through a filter paper and the pollution sources analysed. These results are validated by comparing them with the outcomes of computer models that take into account emission source inventories and meteorological effects. Past analyses suggest that in the case of Karachi, industrial emissions (including from poor quality fuel oil), vehicular emissions, fossil fuel combustion, burning trash, and dust from construction, street cleaning, agricultural residues, and sea salt are important sources./Third, we need to address as many of these sources as possible. In fact, it's not that difficult. Just procuring diesel and fuel/furnace oil with lower sulphur content, reducing industrial emissions through use of cleaner technology, covering our construction sites, or putting in place a better waste management system so the burning of trash is avoided can make a huge difference./Finally, we need to systematically think about future sources of pollution and put in place frameworks to manage these from now. Take the planned increase in coal power plants as an example. Recognising this as a future source of pollution, the federal environment protection agency could introduce new emissions standards for PM2.5 (which do not even exist currently in Pakistan) for coal power plants and adjust other emissions standards, learning from China. This will help to ensure that clean technology is used right from the start in these coal plants, reducing the risk of new plants worsening our air quality. Putting these standards in early will also help to ensure that investors do not have to face additional costs later for retrofitting these plants or even closing them down altogether./As a concerned Pakistani, who has helped many other cities and countries address this problem, it really pains me to see the path that we are unwittingly following on air quality. We need to wake up. We should be defining our own future, a future where each Pakistani not only has the right to breathe clean air, but can actually do so. We can neither tolerate nor afford anything less, if nothing else for our children and our parents' sake."
'Steel mills not conforming with environmental laws'," Residents of the federal capital are fighting air pollution from emissions from steel mills in the local industrial area that continue to poison the air they breathe./'We are fighting a losing battle,' said I-9 resident Hameed Butt, adding that all the complaints registered with the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) have been in vain./'The government and the steel mill owners are playing with our lives,' added Raja Naveed, who also lives in the sector./Dozens of written complaints are sent to the Pak-EPA offices every month from residents of I-9 and I-10. The Pak-EPA, in turn, only responds when the letters continue to come in and pressure mounts./Residents call on environmental watchdog to fight air pollution from steel mills' emissions/Pak-EPA Director General Farzana Altaf Shah told Dawn she has received dozens of complaints every month from residents, as well as factories that produce edibles in the same area./'The steel mill owners do not want to cooperate. Their attitude is extremely non-serious. The industry is blatantly violating environmental laws./'There is a Supreme Court order to shut down steel mills emitting poisonous gases into the atmosphere, polluting the air people breathe. They are leaving us with no option but to implement SC orders to do just that,' Ms Shah said./In 2010, the SC observed: 'From the report of the Director General, Pak-EPA, as well as reports in newspapers, it is evident that the pollution in the residential area has reached a dangerous level and the local residents are feeling difficulty in breathing. In this state of affairs, we have no option but to order sealing of all the steel mills in I-9 and I-10, Islamabad, until the online dust monitor is installed.'/But more than a dozen steel furnaces have failed to comply with environmental laws. They have disregarded Pak-EPA warnings to install equipment, such as bag air filters and online dust monitors to reduce emissions, or face legal action, a senior government official said./Residents have complained that steel furnaces begin running around 5am. 'Thick black smoke blankets the area for hours. They also operate near midnight, when the black smoke rising from the chimneys is not visible in the darkness,' said I-9 resident Malik Najeeb./Steel mills sealed five months ago by the Pak-EPA have also resumed their activities without being cleared by the concerned authorities. In October last year, the agency sealed three steel furnaces for not complying with environmental laws./According to Ms Shah, the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) told the government that steel mills would control emissions and would install the necessary equipment./'We met ICCI representatives and conveyed our concern regarding emissions and asked them to comply with the laws. We will shut down all steel mills not complying with environmental laws. We need all the assistance from the district administration and the Capital Development Authority to implement court orders,' she said./However, ICCI President Khalid Malik claimed: 'Emissions from steel furnaces are very much under control. All the steel mill owners have installed equipment to control emissions.'"
Karachi environment," KARACHI is facing three environmental issues: lack of management of garbage, air pollution and contaminated water. The management of garbage is the foremost issue as it also causes air pollution and contaminates water./To address the issue we need to: 1) Create awareness among people about the 'reduce, recycle and reuse' concept; 2) Reduce pesticides and fertilisers' use in agriculture; 3) Stop buying packaged items as the packages are waste; 4) Ensure proper disposal of garbage; 5) Buy biodegradable products; 6) Last but not least, media must play its role in creating awareness among the masses./Air pollution is mainly caused by transport and industries. The alarming effects of air pollution are respiratory and heart-related diseases, acid rain, eutrophication, adverse effects on wildlife and depletion of the ozone./The following measures should be taken to reduce air pollution: Encourage people to use public modes of transport; resort to car pooling to save energy and money; conserve energy by switching off unnecessary fans and lights to reduce the burning of fossil fuels./The government and all quarters should concentrate on promoting clean energy resources like solar, wind and geothermal energy. Use energy efficient devices like CFL lights which consume less electricity and result in lower electricity bills. These also help reduce pollution by consuming less energy."
Cement factory given 10 days to restore sacked workers," Lakki Marwat District Nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Meenakhel has given a 10-day deadline to the management of a local cement factory for reinstatement of sacked employees and acceptance of other demands, or the people would besiege the factory and halt its production./After addressing a meeting of sacked workers at his residence on Sunday, he told reporters that the people and their elected representatives would not tolerate 'anti-labour' polices of the factory management./'The objective of this year's labour day being observed today (Monday) should be to bring an end to the excesses being meted out to workers by the management of the cement factory,' noted Mr Meenakhel./Lakki nazim says people will besiege factory, halt production/He said over 100 sacked workers had been struggling for their reinstatement for last 10 years, but the factory management was not bothered./He said the families of sacked workers were facing starvation. He said the dust and air pollution caused by the factory had made the lives of locals miserable. He said the management of factory did not bother to launch any welfare project in the district during the last over two decades./POLIO ERADICATION: Health experts have called upon the mediapersons from the southern districts to play role in polio eradication from the region./They were speaking at a training session arranged by Emergency Operation Centre Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on media role in polio eradication in Kohat. Journalists from Lakki Marwat, Karak, Hangu and Kohat participated in the workshop./'Journalists should be more cautious in selection of words while reporting health issues and diseases,' said Dr Altafullah, the chairman of journalism department, University of Peshawar. 'Journalists should keep in mind that polio is a disease and that it should be eradicated, therefore they should avoid creating any sensation through their stories,' he maintained, calling upon the media personnel of backward southern districts to realise their responsibilities and enhance understanding about health issues./Dr Johar, the polio team leader, said the oral polio vaccine was the safest and that Pakistan was near to defeating the disease completely./'No propaganda can impact the anti-polio drives anymore as we are going to eliminate the fatal disease,' he said and urged journalists to help health authorities and partner organisations to bring refusal cases to zero level./Dr Afzal, another health expert, said repeatedly missed children, high population density and mobility and poor sanitation were the reasons for prevalence of poliovirus, and asked journalists to sensitise people, especially parents, on immunisation of their children against the crippling disease./Later, Kohat assistant commissioner Mehmood Ahmad distributed certificates among the participating journalists."
ENVIRONMENT: ARE WE LOSING OUR MINDS TO POLLUTION?," Living in a throbbing metropolis such as Karachi, the rattling of buses on the roads, the incessant blaring of horns, the constant whirring of the rickshaws, coupled with the omnipotent cloud of pollution hanging over us are things which we simply have surrendered to./We raise a hue and cry about pollution - be it air or noise - well aware that it is a cause for grave health concerns. Air pollution results in aggravated cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Noise pollution may result in seemingly trivial ailments such as sleep disturbance and annoyance and even lead to hearing impairment, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, changes in the immune system and birth defects./However, it is not just the body that is susceptible to damage at the hands of noise and air pollution. According to a recently published research which followed nearly two million people in the Canadian province of Ontario over 11 years (between 2001 and 2012), air pollution or noisy traffic could be contributing to mental disorders as well. The study was published in the Lancet - one of the world's oldest and best known general medical journals./Studies show that people living near busy roads are more prone to develop mental disorders/Among the illnesses caused by pollution is dementia, a disease marked by memory loss, personality changes and impaired reasoning. Nearly 50 million people around the world suffer from dementia. About 243,611 cases of dementia were diagnosed during the study, but the risk was greater among those living close to major roads. In this large population-based cohort, living close to heavy traffic was associated with a higher incidence of dementia./According to Dr Jawad Chistie, a prominent environmentalist and principal consultant at Subhe Nau, a non-profit engaged in conserving nature and improving public health, the link between dementia and air pollution is not something to be taken lightly./'The science to prove such links is not easy and generally takes many years, if not decades,' argues Dr Chistie. 'Just like public health experts spent about a full 100 years before they could come up with 'conclusive evidence' that smoking causes cancer. The studies to suggest the link were there, and people also knew that smoking could cause cancer, but convincing governments, and the tobacco industry, proved to be extremely difficult.'/The environmentalist explains that besides dementia, there are many other diseases such as multiple sclerosis that have been suspected of having an aetiology linked to pollution, or more generally, environmental causes. 'Common air pollutants such as PM 2.5, PM 10 and NOx (fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxide) are all leading to major problems, including harmful gases that people are exposed to living near major highways,' he continues./Previously, scientists have linked air pollution and traffic noise to reduced density of white matter and lower cognition. A recent study suggested that magnetic nano-particles from air pollution can make their way into brain tissue./Professor Caleb Finch at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology says, 'Microscopic particles generated by fossil fuels enter our body directly through the nose into the brain. Cells in the brain treat these particles as invaders and react with inflammatory responses, which, over the course of time, appear to exacerbate and promote Alzheimer's disease.'/According to Dr Qurat Khan, assistant professor at the department of psychiatry at the Aga Khan University Hospital, noise and pollution are important contributors to the environment which play a vital role in the bio-psycho-social model of psychiatric conditions. They may cause unmasking and manifestation of psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, bipolar illnesses, psychotic illnesses and may also cause agitation, irritability, and restlessness among people, especially those who are vulnerable./When asked if this may be the reason doctors advise people to move to quieter areas to recuperate from stress, she says: 'Increased work-load, multi-tasking as well as noise and air pollution may cause mental exhaustion, stress and fatigue. Moving away from these and other stressors, along with engaging in exercises such as relaxation and meditation, may help one recuperate.'/Dr Chistie also mentions that in the case of Pakistan, the development versus the environment debate continues to rage. 'The easy answer to which is to allow people to suffer, literally die, while unabashed 'development' continues. We know very well that this development is actually nothing but private business interests that governments want to promote at the expense of the health of the nation.'/He laments that over the years, governments and businesses have forgotten the 'precautionary principle' which is just common sense - don't get into something that may cause damage to the health of not only people, but also other species. 'It is being increasingly learnt from research that major highways may not be the answer to burgeoning populations and economic activity. Smaller, self-sufficient town planning, with good public transport is the way to go,' he says./It is certainly alarming that according to the World Health Organisation three million people die every year due to outdoor air pollution./The rise in population and urbanisation has resulted in people living close to heavy traffic and even a modest effect from near-road exposure could pose a large public health burden. It is tragic that air pollution is not taken into consideration in urban planning and building design to reduce exposure./This just might be the proverbial last straw on the camel's back to prove why life in urban centres continues to get more stressful. More than ever we need to clean up the air."
Air pollution," AIR POLLUTION has now slowly become a toxin spreading into the atmosphere, inflicting damage to the ozone layer. It is caused by the exhaust fumes of automobiles, industries/factories, refrigerants, etc. Apart from these air is also being polluted by the cigarette smoke expelled by the average everyday cigarette smokers. Air pollution is now causing serious problems in the world. Due to the air not being clean it is affecting human health causing different respiratory disorders. Global warming which is a serious issue is one of the offspring of this deadly toxin./I would like readers to minimise air pollution by applying different methods. Like instead of using your own car to travel short distances, walking can cause a decrease in air pollution, for a long journey usage of public transport is best./We can also avoid using ACs and other cooling products which can also minimise global warming effect. This might not help us today but it could lead to a better tomorrow."
FAO-led mapping of smog in Punjab," THE FAO has initiated a technical assistance project on the Punjab agriculture department's request at the start of last winter season when heavy smog engulfed major parts of the province, especially in Lahore./The project is to identify the relationship between smog and the unsafe agricultural practices like crop residue burning by farmers in the rice and wheat belts of the province./Crop residue burning is believed to contribute in the formation of smog - a visible kind of air pollution that combines smoke and fog. Factors causing this kind of pollution include nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, ozone, smoke or particulates./The project, called 'TCP R-SMOG' is in line with the third priority area of the FAO country framework for Pakistan which relates to increased capacity of the government institutions related to designing and implementing the policies and strategies for integrated natural resource management and climate change adaptation and mitigation./Smog can cause a plant to lose 10-40pc growth. Experts believe that the FAO study will prove instrumental in tackling the smog situation in Punjab if used effectively/Common sources of smog include coal emissions, power plants, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural practices such as fires and crop residue burning and photochemical reactions of these emissions./The one-year remote sensing for 'Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Smog' in Punjab and identification of the underlying causes using GIS technologies launched last week, would determine the levels of air pollutants in areas where crop residue burning is in practice./While speaking at the launch of the study, the FAO representative for Pakistan, Mina Dowlatchahi said that an action plan will be developed to contain unsafe agriculture practices such as crop residue burning and propose necessary steps to reduce the contribution of agriculture-related practices towards the formation of smog./The study will also provide scientific evidence to understand the impact of crop residue burning and the need for adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies in the future./Smog can cause a plant to lose 10-40pc growth, according to the University of California. Agriculture globally loses $2-6bn per year as a result of smog-driven reduced productivity./The R-SMOG project uses satellite-based measurements. Satellite data of atmospheric pollutants are becoming more widely used in decision-making and environmental management activities of public, private sector and non-profit organisations. Air quality is important to our health and environment, but sources of contamination are often difficult to monitor./Remote sensing methods and GIS technology provides powerful decision making tools by providing spatio-temporal satellite images. GIS and RS methods offer management, visualisation and analysis of air pollution data with spatial and time dependent attributes./Dr Muhammad Munir Ahmed, Director of Climate Change and Alternate Energy and Water Resource Division of NARC, said that the burning of residues not only causes smog but also affects the fertility of soil and, eventually, the quality of crops. He believes that farmers should adopt scientific methods to dispose off the residue which also has economic benefits./This FAO project will also undertake other factors like urban tree cutting, vehicular and industrial emissions, and increase in number of road vehicles along with others to understand the underlying causes of smog./Dr Muhammad Tariq, Director Barani Research Institute Chakwal believes the study will prove instrumental in moving forward to tackle the smog situation in the province if used to create awareness programmes for the farming community in this regard."
Sohbatpur issues," THE miseries of Sohbatpur district in Balochistan continue to multiply. The district faces environmental pollution leading to deteriorating health conditions and spread of diseases./The district faces scarcity of water, especially of clean drinking water, owing to an overuse of chemical fertilisers, untreated sewerage and the non-availability of water treatment plants./The burning of garbage and plastic, and the increase in the number of vehicles have increased air pollution, causing respiratory disorders etc./Sanitation facilities in the district are poor. Gutters are overflowing and streets covered with animal manure. Municipal services are poor and inefficient, and the local council is dysfunctional./Article 2 (xlvii) of Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010 states that clean drinking water, garbage disposal and maintenance of sanitary conditions are the responsibilities of the local government./The local government seems to be indifferent to these issues."
Availability of non-Euro heavy vehicles creates price distortion," Some assemblers are still rolling out heavy vehicles with non-Euro engines, creating a price distortion in the market./It has created problems for those assemblers that have shifted their entire product range to Euro II vehicles. A major price difference between non-Euro and Euro II vehicles has emerged, which encourages price-conscious customers to buy the former that are more economical./Assemblers rolling out only Euro II vehicles believe that they cannot press the government to implement emission regulations despite the availability of 85 per cent Euro II diesel (55pc imported and 45pc locally produced) as some assemblers are still making non-Euro vehicles./The Ministry of Environment, which is now called Ministry of Climate Change, imposed Euro II emission regulations on all petrol and diesel vehicles in 2012. However, it was practically impossible to impose the regulations on diesel vehicles due to the unavailability of the required grade of diesel at that time./Four assemblers approached the Sindh High Court in June 2012, which issued a stay order against the implementation of Euro II emission standards./Pakistan is among the few countries where outdated diesel engines are in use/Local refineries upgraded and modernised their facilities in the last five years. Barring one refinery that has a small market share, all refineries now produce and market Euro II diesel./Meanwhile, all major truck and bus assemblers managed to introduce Euro II vehicles with higher-grade diesel engines./According to an auto assembler, the stay order provides some assemblers with an excuse to continue assembling non-Euro vehicles. Adopting the Euro II standard may hit their sales due to higher prices, he added./He said the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources and Ministry of Climate Change should take feedback from all assemblers of heavy vehicles about the status of non-Euro vehicles. The petroleum ministry should clear its position on the availability of Euro II diesel (imported and locally produced) through a notification while the Ministry of Climate Change should state its position on the implementation of the Euro II standard, he said./The climate change ministry should set a deadline for non-Euro assemblers to switch over to Euro II, he added. 'As the required grade of diesel is available, there is no reason to continue with this stay order any further,' said another heavy-vehicle assembler while requesting anonymity./He urged the authorities concerned to take immediate action at the earliest. 'There is no reason to prolong its implementation as both fuel and vehicles are available,' he said. Its implementation will lead to better air quality, higher fuel efficiency and low operating cost, he said./Pakistan is among the few countries where diesel engines with outdated technology are in use. These engines are a major source of air pollution./Diesel available in the local market contained 1-1.5 per cent of sulphur whereas the Euro standard limits this to 0.03-0.05pc. Diesel with a higher amount of sulphur is a major source of cancer and asthma. Air pollution mainly occurs in urban areas, especially in winter, and causes respiratory diseases."
Chaubacha underpass misses deadline," The Chaubacha underpass, meant to ease flow of traffic on the Canal Road between Dharampura and Mughalpura, has missed its deadline, at least by a month, if the claims of the contractors are to be believed./A visit to the site, however, does not leave the visitor so optimistic about the fate of the project, which is just beginning to take shape and may take another eight to 10 weeks before it starts serving the purpose./The Rs3bn project, which started on Jan 15 this year, was supposed to be completed by July 31. The contractor's website shows 72pc progress with a promise to complete it by Aug 31./The Lahore Development Authority (LDA), the executing agency, blames the Pakistan Railways for the delay./'It took the railways almost four months, out of total six-month life of the project, to finalise the specifications of the four bridges on which train tracks have to be laid for the canal crossing,' says an official of the LDA. It naturally delayed the entire project or at least provided excuse to the contractor to claim delay, he adds. The railways provided the bridge designs on May 20, allowing the contractor to gather some pace in work./The official agrees that the project does not seem to have attained two-thirds progress but claims that a major part of the project consisted of foundational work, which cannot be seen from above the ground. The claim of 72pc progress includes the underground work. The project has picked up the pace in the last four weeks and the LDA hopes to get it operational by the end of August, he says./Those living on the two-kilometer stretch on both sides of the project site where work has been going on for the last six months are neither so optimistic nor supportive./'Life has been really difficult for the last half year for huge air (dust and noise) pollution, if nothing else,' says Raees Shah who lives on a road taking right turn in the middle of the project. We have to crisscross dozens of streets and crossing from the GT Road to reach our home and it takes almost 30 minutes additional driving because the canal side is now hard to commute on./'But trust me, extra travel doesn't bother us as much as the dust pollution, and allied problems, created by the project. Heavy machines are digging earth on both sides of the road 24/7. The dug-up mud is shifted to other places or used to level up side roads for traffic - creating a dust storm all around. The entire area is now littered with dust, be it homes, roads or trees. Though the contractor has assigned some trucks to sprinkle water in the area of operation, but narrow side roads, taking the main vehicular load, cannot be watered because of continuous flow of traffic. The usage of heavy machinery creates equally annoying noise pollution./Mr Shah agrees that the problems like pollution are a part of the development but says that it is also the government's duty to ensure timely completion of the projects rather than allowing the delays and prolonging the miseries of the people through the diseases caused by air pollution./'There is hardly any chance for the project to get completed even in August, of which only three weeks are now left,' says Muhammad Aftab, who also lives along the canal. All residents have eagerly been watching the pace of project because they have to suffer direct consequences of it day and night; he says and adds that the main parts of the project, four underpasses along with four railways bridges, have just started to take shape. The rest is almost 30pc work of the entire project./If the contractor is pushed as much as he can for the rest of the work, the project may take another two to three months, Mr Aftab expresses his apprehension. He says one only has to look at the parallel project only two kilometers upstream, where an expansion of the road is going on, with no underpass or overhead, but that is also being delayed as much this one. So, the fault probably lies more with the executing agency, rather than the allied departments, he insists."
Govts in Asia-Pacific region fail to check river pollution," The Asia-Pacific region has failed to control pollution of its rivers, more than 80 per cent of which are considered to be in 'poor health', a new United Nations report reveals./The report, prepared by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) for the second forum of ministers and environment authorities of Asia-Pacific region opening in Bangkok on Sept 5, says that common pollutants in the region are organics, nutrients, dissolved salts, heavy metals, pesticides and chemicals from industrial activities./The sources of the pollution are untreated or partially treated sewage, agricultural runoff, industrial wastewater and landfill leachate, and nutrient and sediments washed from degraded land by heavy rainfall./Several river basins, including the Indus, have high organic pollution. This can be further aggravated by other pollution such as increased salinity as seen in the Ganges and Indus river basins./About 1.8 million people die annually due to water-related diseases, says UN report/A major cause of water pollution is poor sanitation, including defecation in the open, leading to contamination of surface and groundwater sources by organics, nutrients and bacterial coliform. In Asia and the Pacific, 1.7 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, and almost 80pc of wastewater being discharged in water bodies with little or no primary treatment./An estimated 1.8 million deaths occur annually in Asia and the Pacific due to water-related diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera. Salt intrusion and higher turbidity from stronger, frequent storms and erosion from deforestation provide favourable growth conditions in tropical estuaries for bacteria such as Vibrio that causes cholera./Other diseases related to water, sanitation and hygiene include intestinal nematode infections, protein-energy malnutrition, trachoma, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, malaria and dengue. Disability-adjusted life years lost due to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene in the region totals 24.78m per year./Another factor affecting human health from water pollution is the accumulation of heavy metal in plants that are then consumed as food. Many studies have looked at accumulations of arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead and mercury in vegetables, rice and other edible plants. The extent of bioaccumulation depends on irrigation methods, much less arsenic accumulation has been observed in rice grown by sprinkler irrigation compared to that grown using continuous flooding irrigation./The report says that nearly 12pc of the population lives in degraded areas of Asia and the Pacific, and this proportion may increase in years to come with significant social impacts. Direct impacts of large-scale land-use changes include displacement of indigenous people, loss of biodiversity and a reduction in important forest products. Land degradation has had severe impacts on human development in the region./The Asia-Pacific region produces more chemicals and waste than any other regions in the world. Over the period of 2012-20, the regional chemical production is expected to grow by 46pc. Major industrial incidents can happen during the processing, storage or transport of potentially hazardous chemicals./Waste generation in Asia and the Pacific is rising and new and complex waste streams are emerging. Total global waste is around 7 to 10 billion tonnes per year, of which total municipal solid waste is around 2bn tonnes. With an average generation rate of 1.4kg per person per day, the annual total municipal solid waste for Asia and the Pacific was estimated at around 870m tonnes in 2014, accounting for 43pc of the world's total./Alongside the increase in municipal solid waste generation, Asia and the Pacific is now facing complex waste streams, including e-waste, food waste, construction and demolition waste, disaster waste and marine litter. Open burning is a common treatment of e-waste in many countries, practiced mainly by informal recyclers when they segregate organic and inorganic compounds, with adverse acute and chronic effects on human health and the environment./Urban areas in the region generate about 1.21m tonnes of municipal solid waste a day. By 2025, this amount will be more than double, to 2.65m tonnes daily. Inadequate treatment of waste can cause pollution and environmental and ecosystem degradation. If not properly collected, waste can decay and cause air pollution, unpleasant odours and degradation of soil, surface and groundwater, and eco-systems."
Islamabad fast losing its beauty due to poor environmental management," 'Islamabad the beautiful' is fast losing its beauty due to poor environment management./With its population having grown during the last two decades, the city is not receiving due attention from its managers. The capital city does not have a proper landfill site and garbage from the urban areas is being dumped in I-12, which is a residential sector. Most of the garbage from the rural areas goes into streams and the city's green belts are being used for parking and commercial activities./There is no audit of trees and the tree plantation campaign which the Capital Development Authority (CDA) - and now the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) - conduct each year in order to keep a check on plant mortality and the cutting of trees./'Islamabad was designed for two million people and today, that is the number of people living in the city,' said CDA's Director Master Planning, Zafar Iqbal Zafar during a briefing to a Senate committee on Thursday./According to the latest census, 9.7 million people live in the rural areas and 10.3 million in the urban areas. All of the rural areas are unplanned and there is no proper sewerage system or garbage collection system, which is affecting the environment of the city./Workshops in residential areas of the urban areas, such as those in the G-7 markaz which is known as Khada Market and encroachments in almost all markets of the city is also affecting the beauty of the city. The quality of air is being affected by the growth of industrial activities which has lead to an increase in smoke and dust./'The major polluters identified by CDA are steel furnaces operating in the industrial areas of sector I-9 and I-10. The authority has so far, identified nine polluting steel furnaces and formal complaints have already been lodged with the Pak-EPA being regulatory authority,' reads a working paper which the CDA presented before the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet on Thursday./It says that following Supreme Court orders, the CDA has directed all steel furnaces to install scrubber units to control air emissions./The scrubbers have been installed in most industrial units and harmful emissions into the air have been curtailed to a large extent, the paper says./However, the managements of steel mills keep the scrubbers off most of the time in order to reduce electricity bills, the documents say, and that the CDA has also assisted Pak-EPA in sealing three steel mills in the recent past including Zia Steel in I-10/3, Silk Root Steel Mill in I-9 and Mustehkam Steel Mill in I-9./A few weeks ago, the auditor general's office through a special audit also tried to inform the government about the serious environmental challenges that the federal capital was facing. It says green belts are being used for parking and commercial purposes in violation of the master plan. It says the green belt in G-5 is used for parking while that in F-9 is used for the Traffic Police Office./According to the audit, various departments are using green areas and other spaces along the Mauve Area, G-8, G-9 and G-10 for parking purposes./The report pointed out that CNG and petrol stations are established along the Kashmir Highway and that kiosks have been established on green belts in all sectors./The report says bus stands and shops have been established on green belts between IJP Road and I-10 and I-9 and seeks the attention of the city managers in regards to the regular fires in the Margalla Hills, though the CDA and MCI are yet to take action to minimise the chances of fire./Spread over 12,605 hectares, the Margalla Hills National Park witnesses dozens of fire incidents every year. During the five years between 2009 and 2014, the hills have faced over 146 fires, which damage forests and adds to air pollution in the federal capital among other adverse effects./'No preventive measure appeared to have been adopted by the CDA/MCI [to] mitigate the risk of fire and to reduce the instances of fire,' the audit pointed out./The katchi abadis based on the beds of nullahs including those in G-7, G-8 and F-7 also add to the sewage problems and debris from demolished houses is also thrown into the nullahs./'I do agree that there several environmental problems in the federal capital which have piled up during the last two decades but we are taking steps to bring improvement,' said MCI's chief metropolitan officer Asad Mehboob Kayani./'We have imposed a complete ban on all types of unauthorised buildings in Islamabad and we are also working on establishing a permanent landfill site. We will also introduce a garbage collection system for all of Islamabad as currently, garbage is only collected in the urban areas,' he said./DG Environment Dr Sulman Sheikh also said that steps are being taken to stop environment harming activities in Islamabad./According to sources in the environment directorate, corruption and nepotism is affecting the performance of the entire department where several corruption inquiries have been pending for years./They said officers responsible for the beautification of Islamabad and for the protection of the environment and forests do not have the qualifications to do so./'You will not believe that this directorate has around 4,000 employees if you visit the city and its parks,' an officer of the MCI said, adding that at times, junior officers are given double charges if they do not have the right candidate and in case of shortage of manpower."
Is Punjab ready to tackle smog this year?," Fog engulfed Lahore a bit too early when it appeared in late October 2016, blotting out the sunshine and causing various issues for drivers. People with eye and skin irritation as well as breathing problems started heading to hospitals./Later, it was discovered that this heavy thick curtain was not a natural occurrence, but smog. The reasons were several including trans-boundary smoke emitted from India due to stubble burning mixed with the smoke from firecrackers burst on Diwali. In images released by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), some crops were seen burning in Pakistan as well. Other reasons included the dust from several development projects and, of course, traffic congestion and burning of third-rate fuels by small industries./As the same time approaches this year, there isn't much information for the public or experts to analyse the situation./The Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) does not seem to be prepared for any emergency situation although officials claim to be working on it. Their air quality machines are not fully functional./EPD Labs Director Tauqeer Ahmed Qureshi says heavy duty machines needed for measuring particulate matter and noxious gases are not only highly sensitive, but also extremely expensive./'We have limited finance and human resources,' he admits. 'Our last tender for the instruments was for Rs40 million per machine, while maintenance would cost Rs5 million every year per station.'/Even if the three instruments they have were working perfectly, he says, they could get readings only for two fixed areas every day. The city needs at least 15 to 20 stations./'In every location, there are so many factors: proximity of industries, traffic congestion, time of the year, wind direction, temperature, cloud cover etc. How can we give a daily mean reading in such a situation?' he asks./The annual cost of just maintaining an air quality monitoring system is much more than the department's annual budget. The department's development budget for 2017-18 is Rs540 million, said Deputy Director (Development) Tahir./According to a joint research report, titled 'Shared Environmental Concerns between India and Pakistan', by environmental lawyer Ahmed Rafay Alam and Sanjay Upadhyay, the high cost of environmental sampling, which is the basis for any conviction before environmental tribunals, means that testing is seldom carried out. At the same time, innovative enforcement mechanisms such as pollution charges and self-monitoring rules have not yet been utilised./Meanwhile, the department is blamed for wasting the equipment it has. Ten years ago, the three machines were acquired from a Japanese firm. A decade later, these instruments have rusted, as the EPD admits itself. If they were used, as officials claim they were, no one knows the air quality readings received as they were never made public./'Whatever the readings are, the public has a right to know,' says Alam. 'It is important for people to know the kind of air they are breathing.'/'We did not upload the results because sometimes knowledge can be an annoyance rather than benefit,' justifies Tauqeer Qureshi./Meanwhile, to manage costs, he says a more compact German replacement has been found which costs around Rs15m per machine with Rs0.5m maintenance cost per annum for each machine./'Right now the EPD has six stations -- Sahiwal, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad, Chakwal and Lahore, and one mobile. But they are all in the process of being set up,' he adds./Qureshi also revealed that corruption has left the EPD in a bad state. 'It was never revealed officially, but currently not a single factory is considered fit.'/'The meters should be up and running at all costs,' Alam says. 'But in the long term, other initiatives can also be taken, for example replacing carbon emitting industries, taking action where cars are concerned, etc.'/Coal emitting industries are expected to spread much more air pollution. Instead, biomass industries are a better option, researchers say./Alam's research report also indicates that besides political interest and increased budget support being integral to a solution, independent provincial frameworks for climatic and environmental issues are needed to be devised, related institutions staffed with trained people, and programmes managed and monitored./'We need to work out if it's only trans-boundary or just a drop in temperature worsening the situation. Without proper data how can we make nuanced policies?' he questioned."
"Kill pollution, save lives"," A NEWLY published report by the Lancet Commission has identified pollution as the biggest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world. The report claims that almost 22 per cent of premature deaths in Pakistan are attributable to pollution and this comes to about 300,000 deaths annually. This is more than the deaths caused by road accidents in the country, or three times the combined toll of tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS. These are stunning findings and have caused a global stir./A 2014 World Bank study, in a similar vein, pointed out that more than 22,600 deaths per year are directly or indirectly attributable to ambient air pollution in Pakistan. 'Outdoor air pollution alone causes more than 80,000 hospital admissions per year, nearly 8,000 cases of chronic bronchitis and almost five million cases of lower respiratory' problems among children under five./The urban air pollution levels in Pakistan are amongst the world's highest, and intensely damaging for human health and quality of life. Pakistan is the most urbanised country in the South Asian region and the direct and indirect costs to our urban, peri-urban and rural standard of life are accelerating. This is degrading our environment, and eroding our economic growth rate. The pollution in low-middle-income countries like Pakistan is estimated to cost 2pc of GDP and almost 7pc of health spending./The urban air pollution levels in Pakistan are amongst the world's highest./To make things worse, most of this cost is borne by the poor. Marginalised groups, particularly women, children and the elderly, get disproportionately affected. Yet, the commission's economic analysis does not include the information about the cost of environmental damage caused by pollution, nor does it fully address the challenges and opportunities offered by climate change to address the root causes of pollution./Despite adverse effects on human health, the pollution issue has traditionally been ignored by the policymaking community in Pakistan. National and provincial assemblies have not enacted any significant legislation to curtail pollution. The manifestos and platforms of political parties are silent about air pollution, industrial emissions, use of chemicals, or technology or fuel import standards. The ambient air quality or industrial emissions standards are inadequate, fragmented and poorly enforced. The capacity of environment protection departments in the provinces has evaporated over the years despite the 18th Amendment that devolved greater environmental responsibilities to them. Their budgets are negligible and enforcement capacities questionable./Pakistan has the highest greenhouse gas emissions intensity in South Asia more than India. We emit more GHG emissions per unit of GDP than any other country in the South Asian region. This structural inefficiency adds to the cost of doing business as well as to the national health bill./Worse, Pakistan's overall trends indicate a steady increase in emissions per unit of economic output over the past few decades. This is expected to further accelerate owing to rapid increase in population, the growing number of mega and intermediate cities, inadequate public transportation and the absence of mass transit systems, heavy reliance on fossil fuels and recent investments in coal-fired power plants. According to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) document that the federal government submitted to UNFCC Secretariat in 2015, the emissions are projected to more than double during the next decade. If the present trajectory of business as usual (BAU) continues, Pakistan, according to the NDC, will need $40 billion to offset these increases./Add to this the institutional complexity and their standard practice of working in silos. The regulatory agencies and research groups that focus on agendas for environmental health and pollution control operate in two distinct domains. Key sources of pollution-health nexus air, water, soil, industry and chemicals are regulated by different national and provincial agencies. This often results in competing policies, interests and fragmented understanding of the full scale of pollution and its share in the national burden of disease. The Lancet Commission report has provided a unique opportunity to our national, provincial and city governments to give deeper thought to how best to change this state of affairs./Going forward, our commitment to Agenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provides a window of opportunity to curtail pollution over the next 15 years. Robust and long-term programmes to protect the health and lives of people through national pollution-control programmes are needed at the federal and provincial levels. The prime minister needs to set up an inter-ministerial commission to design and deliver Pakistan's pollution management programme. A series of targeted, well-integrated interventions should reach out to millions of Pakistanis through pollution-monitoring networks in the provinces, a consolidated regulatory framework for pollution control and using command-and-control measures that include ambient air standards, emissions standards and technology standards. For this to happen, the government must:/a) link air quality to health indicators by focusing on reducing pollutants linked to higher morbidity and mortality, particularly fine particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and lead content that are several times higher than WHO air quality guidelines; and b) link with cleaner production by focusing in particular on such industries as cement, fertiliser, sugar, steel and power plants, and on brick kilns, plastic moulding, and other waste-burning industries./Curtailing pollution is essential for meeting the following SDGs: SDG-1 (poverty alleviation), SDG-3 (improving health), SDG-6 (access to clean water and sanitation), SDG-10 (promoting social justice), SDG-11 (building sustainable cities and communities), SDG-13 (climate change) and SDG-14 and 15 (protecting land and water). Their successful implementation will help curtail pollution that disproportionately kills the poor and vulnerable. Pollution control can benefit greatly from efforts to decarbonise economic development and mainstream renewable energy to slow the pace of climate change in Pakistan."
EPA without gadgets to check air pollution as smog envelops Pindi," The local chapter of the Punjab Environment Protection Agency (EPA) is without gadgets to check air pollution which has created smog in the Potohar region./The provincial government has asked the environment watchdog to launch a campaign against industrial units polluting air and burning of garbage in the open to overcome the issue of smog. The EPA has been asked to register cases with the police against the air polluters./Local officials said in the absence of any gadget to check air pollution, the environment department tried to implement the directives of the government by asking the citizens to register complaints with it about burning of tyres and solid waste in the open./'The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad have seen moderate smog, which is a combination of fog and smoke. Air pollution is the main cause behind it,' Dr Mohammad Hanif, Director of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, told Dawn./Punjab govt asks environment watchdog to register cases against industrial units polluting air/'There are chances of light rain in the middle of November in upper parts of the country which will convert the smog into fog.'/He said air pollution had created the current smog which was unusual in Rawalpindi and Islamabad./'This is the second year when the twin cities are experiencing smog. Earlier, some parts of Punjab faced the problem. The phenomenon is, however, not unusual in India and China where Delhi and Beijing have been facing it for six to seven years,' he said./'The only solution to smog is to check air pollution in cities and adjoining areas. There is a difference between fog and smog as fog is harmless but smog is dangerous for human health,' he said./When contacted, Deputy Director Environment Shahid Hasan said the EPA had banned burning of tyres and solid waste in the open to check air pollution./'In Rawalpindi, there is no such factory which pollutes the environment,' he claimed, adding environment inspectors had been asked to conduct a survey in this regard./In reply to a question, the official said EPA had sent a mobile team from Lahore to check the level of air pollution in the garrison city many years ago. He said a request would be sent to Lahore to send a mobile laboratory to the city once again./According to a survey, in 2014 noise and air pollution in Rawalpindi was checked at Raja Bazaar, Committee Chowk (Murree Road) and Pirwadhai and found to be much above the national standards./After this, the Punjab-EPA advised the local administration to plant more trees around the elevated metro bus track, Pirwadhai and Raja Bazaar./However, no steps were taken in this regard./A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that over 99 unregistered industrial units in the city had failed to adopt any measure to discharge their waste after treatment./'These units are located in Dhoke Dalal, Khyaban-i-Sir Syed, Pirwadhai and Bagh Sardaran.'/He said there were 38 registered industrial units and 29 of them were in the cantonment areas./'Marble factories in cantonment areas are the main cause of air pollution as the owners never adopted any measure during grinding and cutting process. As a result, dust and fume arising from these units pollute the air,' he said./The official said a survey of industrial units was conducted in 2013 but no action was initiated against industrial units responsible for air pollution due to political pressure./'Most of these units are making plastic shoes, bags and other products. Some of the units burn tyres and wood instead of using gas or other fuel.'"
"BREATHE, BREATHE IN THE AIR"," THE weather is getting cooler and so the working day now begins as it does for most construction workers at 7am, amid a grey haze that seems to hang all over the city. At the site of the Chaubacha Underpass along the Canal Bank, nearly 1,000 workers take up positions along what is said to be the longest and deepest underpass in the city. The engines of heavy machines rev into life and as digging resumes, a cloud of dust so thick you can't see through it, rises into the air./Till a week ago, inhaling the dust was only a part of life for these workers, Haider Abbas, one of the workers, says, but recently it has become harder to breathe. Abbas, who is from Khanewal and has been working on the Habib Construction Services site for almost a year, explains that protective gear is available for workers. But not a single worker at the site of construction is wearing a protective mask./Past the mountains of rubble zoom heavy and light vehicles kicking up clouds of smoke and dust. Abbas blames his deteriorating health on the traffic. He realises that the grey, overcast sky does not hold fog or clouds, yet argues that it's not the dust rising from construction that is causing it but the heavy traffic. He is aware of the irony in constructing an underpass to create room for even more traffic but finds solace in that he doesn't have to live here. 'The quality of air in Khanewal is far better,' he explains./Sitting in a container that houses the construction site's medical facilities, Muhammad Amir, the medical rep, says he receives up to 25 cases of chest infections each month, but stresses that it is not because of the smog. Questioned why the workers weren't wearing masks, he shrugs: 'They have the masks, they just don't want to wear them.'/If you go further down the road from here and then take a left onto Ring Road, you'll arrive at Mehmood Booti and Lakhodair where, apart from Lahore's landfill, are several steel mills that, on a regular day, emit thick black smoke. These mills, most of which are accused of burning rubber tyres, were recently sealed under the Punjab government's Policy on Controlling Smog 2017./The Environment Protection Department (EPD) issued a press statement recently proudly announcing that it had sealed 170 steel mills in the province, 130 of which were in Lahore alone. Yet according to a report in Duniya newspaper on Thursday, the factories at Daroghawala, Mehmood Booti and Lakhodair have begun operating during the night so as to avoid punitive action. The report claims that fresh consignments of fuel arrived at these factories at around 5am./The fact of the matter is that industries here are not regulated, says Manzoor Hussain of the Punjab Urban Resource Centre. In fact, most factories in the city are located in congested residential areas. These factory units continue to burn bituminous coal, tyres, toxic plastics and solid waste as cheap fuel. Unfortunately, most of the mill owners are powerful industrialists who know powerful people, he says, so the EPD cannot make them comply with any directions, the push will have to come from the communities themselves./Several activist circles and concerned citizens are now talking about holding the EPD responsible for not taking timely action and allowing thick hazardous smog to blanket the city in October for the second consecutive year. Last year, Advocate Sheraz Zaka filed a petition in the Lahore High Court demanding action against polluters./'Rampant tree felling in and around the city, unregulated factories, the complete absence of political will to tackle pollution and rampant corruption in the EPD are responsible for what's happening,' he says. When the government finally released a policy to tackle smog in October after this year's smog had settled in it was because of the pressure placed on it by the Lahore High Court, he adds./The 36-year-old lawyer questions the kind of city the provincial government wants to build and whether it will be considered habitable for children and the generations to come. 'Do they not realise what's at stake?' he asks./At the other end of the city is a group of activists discussing when to announce a protest against what they believe is the government's apathetic attitude towards curbing pollution. The issue is deeply connected to the major questions of the day: transport, equal development, housing and climate change, all of which need to be addressed in ecologically sustainable and equitable ways, says Tabassum, one of the activists. 'It comes down to a calculation of who is benefiting and who is paying the consequences of the types of 'development' in our community,' she asserts. 'Those who benefit at the expense of public health, the climate, public space and transport must be held responsible.'/Many of these activists join another meeting called at a local bookshop on Friday where information was shared regarding the smog. 'We need to make a noise but also educate ourselves,' says Aysha Raja. The environmental activist believes that combating pollution will require a change in the consumption-oriented lifestyle of the elite./She deplores the lack of equipment available to the EPD, and talks about the need to install air-monitoring units. But above that, she stresses upon the need for the public to act as a pressure group to get the authorities to do their job, suggesting that schools could install air-quality meters that students could monitor and learn about air pollution./'Look around,' Advocate Zaka points out, 'Almost everyone walking or driving bikes is wearing a mask…'"
Punjab to discuss smog remedial measures with centre on 15th," As the persisting dense smog permeated Sindh and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa on Sunday, authorities in Punjab began preparing for a meeting with the federal government on Nov 15, seeking measures that could reduce air pollution such as a dialogue with India over the crop residue burning by its Punjab farmers./Fog develops over the plains of Punjab when there is no rain, temperatures start dropping and humidity increases in the beginning of winter. But ever increasing pollutants are turning it into smog to the detriment of public health for the past couple of years./Smog is a problem particularly in Punjab cities such as Lahore close to India. Officials of the depart­­ments concerned in Punjab largely blame smoke and particulate matter from burning of rice crop residue in Indian Punjab for the phenomenon. There are local contributions too, but officials claim they are being reduced considerably through regulation./'We are submitting our suggestions to the Ministry of Climate Change for controlling air pollution and smog…through medium and long-range measures, including asking India to convince its farmers to stop burning the crop stubble. We can talk to India on the issue under the Mali and Saarc Declarations,' Environment Secretary Saif Anjum told Dawn./As short-term measures, he said, his department had controlled factory emissions and made other departments check vehicular or dust pollution. As a result, local contribution to fog had been reduced, he claimed while showing latest figures of the air quality monitoring units recently set up in Lahore./The secretary said Punjab would ask the federal government to fix vehicular engine standards and allow only quality oil. 'Sulphur content in oil should be 50PPM (particle per million), but ours has 5,000PPM. Sulphur in the air reduces visibility and be­­comes sulphuric acid to­­gether with humidity. Cities having its critical limits in the air receive acid rain,' he said./Smog or fog continued to affect life in the length and breadth of Punjab, also covering upper Sindh and Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa on Sun­day. Rail, road and air traffic was disrupted from Pesha­war to Sindh. The impure environment burnt eyes and caused throat irritation./Motorway and National Highway Authority spokesman Imran shah said GT Road remained fog bound form Peshawar to Lahore on Saturday night, reducing visibility to 20 to 40 metres at many places. The national highway too remained blanketed with fog from Lahore to Sadiqabad. Traffic moved slow and in lines to avoid accidents during the night./Motorway remained closed from Pindi Bhattian to Faisalabad and from Lahore to Gojra, from Pesha­war to Shakai, from Lahore to Kot Momin and from Lahore to Khanewal and Multan due to dense fog that drastically reduced visibility. Traffic was allowed on Sunday early morning./Mr Shah again reported closure of motorway from Pindi Bhattian to Faisalabad and from Lahore to Gojra at 8pm. Fog had also reduced visibility from 50 to 60 metres form Kot Momin to Sial Morr and from Lahore to Khanqa Dogran./He advised people to avoid unnecessary travel, especially during night, fix fog lights on their vehicles and drive slowly and in lines."
"Smog disrupts rail, air traffic in twin cities"," Although the smog in Rawalpindi and Islamabad is milder when compared to the plains of Punjab, it has disrupted rail and air traffic because causing health concerns in the garrison city./Dr Mohammad Hanif, the director of the Meteorological Department's National Forecasting Centre in Islamabad, said the twin cities covered in smog, made up of 80pc fog and 20pc pollutants./Dr Hanif said the smog had been caused by air pollution and had caused health issues. However, he added that after the light rainfall predicted in the Potohar region at the end of next week, the smog 'will end next week'./Smog and persistent dry weather is also affecting the health of citizens/Even though the dry weather will likely persist next month, he said the light rain would wash out the smog in the Potohar region./The smog will instead turn into fog, which will not cause health problems, he said./Dr Hanif added that the smog in the plains of Punjab would end when temperature falls below 18°C. 'Gradually, the temperature is decreasing so the smog will end.'/He said urban areas in Punjab were more affected by smog than rural areas. 'The main reason is smoke emitting from factories and other sources...which polluted the air,' he said./The smog has also disrupted travel, with more than six flights arriving late from Lahore and Multan, and others being delayed./An official at Benazir Bhutto International Airport (BBIA) said: 'The flight schedule was disturbed due to smog in the plains of Punjab, but flight operations for Karachi and other parts of the country are per the schedule.'/Meanwhile, trains from Lahore and Multan arrived two to three hours late. A passenger coming from Lahore, Asif Ahmed, said their journey began at 7am, reached Gujranwala at 10:15am due to the smog and reached the Rawalpindi Railway Station at 2pm./'The distance from Lahore to Gujranwala is not more than an hour, and the schedule [arrival] time of the train in Rawalpindi was noon,' he said./A Railways official said train drivers had been asked to move slowly on the track from Lahore to Lala Musa as visibility was only a few metres. 'This is the main reason for the train delays,' he said./Health concerns have also arisen due to the smog, as many residents of the Potohar region already suffer from pollen allergies, asthma and upper respiratory tract infections such as the cough and cold./Over 617 people suffering from cough, cold and eye infections are reported at Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH), Holy Family Hospital (HFH) and District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital every day./The Punjab health department has issued guidelines for hospitals to inform patients about measures to prevent illnesses related to the dry spell and the smog./Mohammad Sajjad, who lives on Khanna Road, said the dust and smog that got in his eyes in the morning when he rode his motorcycle had forced him to contact doctors at BBH, who told him to wear a mask and sunglasses to protect his eyes, nose and mouth from air pollution./At HFH, Ali Raza told he has been on antibiotics for five days but has not yet gotten a respite from his cough and cold. 'The doctors advised taking liquids and wearing a mask to avoid dust in the air, and they said good rainfall would wash the virus out of the air,' he said./He said his family had also fallen ill from the same virus, which he blamed on the dry weather./Young Doctors Association Punjab Chairman Dr Haider Akhter, who also practices at BBH, told he and other doctors were seeing a large number of people./'Medicine is not perfect, as rain will reduce viral symptoms,' he said. Dr Akhter said rainfall would settle polluted air particles./He added that people should take extra care with children and the elderly./They should also wear masks when going out at night or in the evenings, drink plenty of water, reduce outdoor activities, keep doors and windows closed, wear glasses and wash their hands, face, nose and mouth frequently."
The crisis of air quality in Lahore," It is not uncommon to hear many deny that the visible and stinky haze hanging in Lahore's air could be smog - despite the glut of news around smog in the Punjab. Those who do accept that the yellowish particulate matter suspended before them is indeed hazardous also suggest that this 'smog' is somehow a natural and perennial phenomenon that one must accept, and be comforted that at some point nature will take its course and wash the city clean./Yet Lahore's smog situation is a symptom of a much larger air pollution crisis which is persistent and toxic even when invisible to the naked eye. Although the sources of the pollution vary, most of them are contributing compounding quantities of dangerous particulate matter into the atmosphere year after year. What this means is that, even after rain or a windstorm carries away the pollutants that are irritating our eyes, lungs and throats, more pollutants will continue to be pumped into the air in and around our communities throughout the rest of the year, detrimentally continuing to affect our health as well as contributing to the cumulative greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that worsen global warming./In other words, the few autumn weeks during which the smog events seem to be occurring annually, is not the only time we should be concerned about the quality of the air we are breathing. According to the State of Global Air 2017 report on global exposure to air pollution and its disease burden, conducted by the Health Effects Institute in Boston, Pakistan's air quality has consistently been worsening for years, causing an estimated 135,000 deaths in 2015. This was the case even though the air pollution was not highly perceptible by sight and smell that year./Few air quality monitors are operating in Lahore so it is difficult to know the full extent to which the province's air quality standards are being met or what the trends of local emissions even are. Oddly, while downplaying the agency's inability to adequately enforce environmental standards, the EPD stresses the need for air quality monitoring equipment in order to ascertain what/who is responsible for producing the recurrent smog waves. Yet, environmental lawyer Ahmad Rafay Alam was recently quoted on social media saying that he personally observed that many of the new monitors procured by the provincial government since last year's smog wave remain unopened in the Punjab EPD office./Whether the government monitors are operating or not, data provided by academic studies and community-driven air quality reports of the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative illustrate the trend of steadily worsening air quality in Lahore, as well as across all of Pakistan. Such reports make it clear that the sources of Lahore's air pollution are not mysterious, but in fact are already widely known and well understood./The mushrooming number of vehicles on the roads is one major source of air pollution, with the nearly 4 million vehicles registered in Punjab in 2005 climbing to over 13 million by 2014. The growing quantity of dust in the air from massive infrastructure/housing scheme construction is another source, as is tree-cutting, which reduces the amount of CO2 being taken up by these plants and worsens soil erosion. Of course, there is also the smoke that is pumped into the air daily by the unregulated polluting factories. Other sources include incineration of growing quantities of garbage, burning of crop residues by farmers on both sides of the border, prevalent use of diesel-burning generators, and the growth of fossil fuel-based power plants, known for emitting toxic greenhouse gases./While various government departments are legally bound to safeguard the health of the public and the environment, it is common knowledge that existing environmental legislation is not taken seriously. Therefore it comes as little surprise to see that the Punjab EPD's new 'Policy on Controlling Smog 2017', a propaganda video tweeted by the Government of Punjab, as well as comments by the Minister of the Environment, Zakia Shah Nawaz, all shift a disproportionate amount of blame for the air pollution crisis onto Indian farmers burning their agricultural residues./Where the government does claim to be taking measures to reduce locally produced pollution, its approaches appear to be ridden with inconsistencies. For instance, the new smog policy places a ban on the burning of solid waste, agricultural residues, and hazardous waste. It is not yet clear how responsive LWMC and local authorities have been in curbing these crimes, as burning solid waste has been illegal for years, during which time residents say that trash burning has been a common practice even carried out by LWMC itself. Without a long-term plan to provide non-hazardous and ecologically sustainable ways to deal with the wastes, as well as to create incentives for farmers to manually deal with the agricultural residue, many remain skeptical as to whether the authorities intend to carry out their mandate./Failures in the power grid are being attributed to the smog, some allegedly due to trips on the power line, while other supply shortfalls are due to scheduled maintenance work. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi issued an edict on Friday to the power board telling them to shut down furnace oil and diesel-based power plants due to the smog, but this appears to be a temporary measure, as some of the power plants have already resumed operations. At the same time, no serious effort is being made toward transitioning the country's polluting and prone-to-failure energy systems to those that are ecologically sustainable, non-polluting, non-hazardous sources. Instead the government has committed itself to continuing to burn fossil fuels, including the dirtiest of them all, coal./Speaking at a workshop on Air Pollution and Smog at the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences on Wednesday, Zia ul Islam, programme manager of the National Ozone Unit under the Ministry of Climate Change, said, 'If we don't address the air quality problems, the world will not forgive us.'/Sadly, the temporary and insufficient approaches being taken will not address the destructive and dangerous occurrence of smog, nor the persistent air pollution crisis Pakistan is facing, nor the larger ecological and social woes of the century. As long as the country remains committed to the failed Western model of development, or the Chinese variant, both operating according to the flawed logic of endlessly chasing an elusive 'growth' at all costs and both responsible for literally destroying lives and the planet, prospects in the foreseeable future for a liveable Lahore, and in much of the world, will remain increasingly dubious./The only way out of this abyss is by addressing the air pollution crisis in lock-step with meaningful and coordinated strategies to provide a path for all Lahoris to have clean, affordable and safe transport, housing, schools, water, and electricity, which will require creating an underlying logic that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private gain."
Preventable disease," PAKISTAN is a hard place to be a baby. While according to the Pakistan Demo­­graphic and Health Survey (PDHS) it brought its under-five mortality rate down from 94 in 1999 to 89 per 1,000 live births in 2013, and by 2016 to 81, in South Asia it still ranks second to Afghanistan which tops the list with 91. India with 48 is followed by Bangladesh 38, Nepal 36, Bhutan 22, Sri Lanka 10 and the Maldives nine./Pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria account for almost a third of deaths among under-fives globally. Pneumonia alone accounts for 16 per cent of these deaths. On any given day, it claims the lives of some 2,500 children./Coupled with the seasonality risk of contracting pneumonia, the deadly virus and bacteria of pneumonia surfaces in an overcrowded environment with indoor air pollution (smoke particles from cooking stoves is a key driver of childhood pneumonia) and affects malnourished and low-immunity children first./World Pneumonia Day is a reminder to speed up the fight./Still the world has made significant strides. With better access to antibiotics and improved nutrition, pneumonia deaths have declined. According to WHO, in 2004 pneumonia killed more than two million children globally; in 2015 the number was less than 1m. The vaccines introduced in the early 2000s (they attack 23 of the deadliest forms of the pneumonia bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae) have played an important part in fighting the disease./In Pakistan, there's little to celebrate. Equated with poverty, the disease remains under the radar of both the state and parents. This World Pneumonia Day (today) is a sombre reminder of the urgent need to reduce health inequality and to ensure no child dies from pneumonia or any vaccine-preventable disease./The biggest hurdle in Pakistan's fight against pneumonia is the low routine immunisation (RI) coverage which stands at a dismal 54pc, according to PDHS 2013 (Islam­abad 74pc, Punjab 66pc, KP 53pc, Gilgit-Baltistan 47pc, Sindh 29pc and Balochistan 16pc). It may be added that this data is refuted by provinces that insist the RI coverage has vastly improved in the last four years, especially in KP and Punjab./Pakistan launched the Expanded Prog­ramme on Immunisation (EPI)in 1978 with the aim to save children from TB, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenza type B, pneumonia and measles, and pregnant women from tetanus./Today, the nine vaccines are administered (a 10th rotavirus has been launched in some Punjab districts and is scheduled to be introduced across Pakistan by the end of this year) yet parents do not get their children immunised. The result is that of the over 400,000 under-five deaths, half the number is attributed to these diseases./With regard to pneumonia, Pakistan is armed with both knowledge and technology. It already has a vaccine against pneumonia. Each of the three doses of the pneumococcus vaccine costs around Rs4,000 if inoculation is administered by a private health provider. However, the government, with support from international donors like WHO, Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative and the Gates Foundation, provides it for free. Yet children continue to die from this illness. The major reason is that those most at risk in urban slums, remote areas and migrant communities are not reached./A major reason for the lethargy is the two decades of undivided attention and resources spent on the eradication of polio. While the efforts here cannot be emphasised enough, eliminating other childhood diseases is just as important./Parents used to polio workers arriving at their doorstep expect the same for other illnesses. What needs to be communicated to them is that vaccine vials cannot be taken out from EPI centres where a cold chain is in place, without which the vaccines lose their efficacy./Apart from bottlenecks in the vaccination programme insufficient funding, delay in release of funds, weak and ineffective monitoring, reporting and surveillance there is the political appointment of inept district health officers./There may not be a magic wand to overcome the plethora of problems that beset Pakistan's RI, but if Punjab can do it, there is little reason why other provinces cannot./Pakistan can achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of ending preventable deaths of newborns and under-fives if it sets out to do so. The problems and solutions are all known. All it needs is strong political will at the top and champions from among the elected representatives to take this on as a personal and collective goal./The key to survival of Pakistani babies is simple and costs nothing. Exclusive breastfeeding up to at least six months (the current rate in the first four months is only 16pc); bringing routine immunisation in every province up to 90pc and improving water and sanitation will not only prevent cases of pneumonia but also help eradicate other diseases."
Peshawar severely hit by smog," Women in Peshawar may have religious or personal reasons to cover their faces in public but a thick layer of smog that has recently blanketed the city has set a growing trend to wear face mask./Moderate women, who avoid covering their faces in public, are seen wearing masks to protect themselves from the effects of smog./'I have started wearing mask to protect myself from air pollution since the city has been engulfed by smog for the last 10 days,' said Memoona, a shopper in main Saddar Bazaar. Memoona's colleague also wore mask to protect herself from inhaling toxic air./Like women, men also use smog protection masks./Layers of smog - a combination of fog and smoke - have blanketed the city of five million people that was declared the world's third most polluted city across the world by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2016, said Prof Shafiq, an expert./Expert blames bad roads, huge traffic, unplanned construction for growing air pollution in city/He said the WHO had conducted a survey in 3,000 cities around the world and declared Peshawar the third most polluted urban centre./He said the whole country was in the grip of smog but Peshawar was in pretty bad condition./Prof Shafiq said poor road infrastructure, unplanned construction activities, movement of over half million vehicles, including 22,000 rickshaws, and around 650 brick kilns, which burn rubber, were polluting the air of Peshawar./An official of the Vehicle Emission Testing Station blamed old buses owned by various educational institutions and two-stroke rickshaws for the high concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the air./Millions of residents of the city take in polluted air but the provincial government, especially Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is taking few 'cosmetic' steps to cope with the growing menace of air pollution instead of launching proper mitigation plan./The EPA findings released last year stated that the level of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has breached the guidelines of the National Environmental Quality Standard (NEQS) in the provincial capital./'The PM2.5 at all sampling locations in Peshawar is higher than the limits of NEQS. The biggest impact of particulate air pollution on public health is understood to be from long-term exposure to PM2.5 (10-15 years), which increases the age specific mortality risk,' revealed these findings./Currently, the minimum level of PM2.5 in the air of Peshawar is 40 and the maximum 90, while the NEQS recommends that level of tiny particles in the air should not be more than 15 micrograms per cubic meter./The increase of PM2.5 in the air becomes hazardous for human health and also reduces visibility./The PM2.5 data was collected from 28 different locations of the city. The study found vehicular emissions, waste burning, construction work, debris, dust, broken roads, poor collection of waste, smoke discharged from brick kilns are major contributors to air pollution./Similarly, the quantity of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) at all 28 points has exceeded NEQS limits too. However concentration of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in the provincial capital is within limit./Dr Adil Zareef said the disposal of the city's garbage was also a major contributor to toxic air pollution as there was no proper mechanism for waste disposal but through burning it./'The fumes are toxic,' observed Dr Zareef, who teaches medical sciences, and is also an environmentalist./He suggested that the government impose heavy fine on environmentally-unfit vehicles./EPA Director General Dr Mohammad Bashir Khan told Dawn that the open waste burning and vehicular emissions were polluting air./He said the agency was in action to control air pollution and had directed the Cantonment Board, Peshawar Development Authority and Water and Sanitation Services Peshawar (WSSP) to stop burning waste at their disposal sites./Dr Bashir said the EPA teams were regularly taking air wail out data on roads while all open burning of solid waste were strictly prohibited besides campaign against rubber burning in brick kilns. He said the agency had started collecting PM10 data from different locations which was not so alarming./Officials of the Cantonment Board and WSSP denied the open burning of solid waste. WSSP general manager Engineer Ali Rehman said land had been acquired for dumping waste./He said 1,016 tons of solid waste was generated in three towns of the city and 76 percent of it was lifted on daily basis./The PDA collects 150- 200 tons of waste on a daily basis, while the Cantonment Board disposes of 50 tons of waste. All municipal bodies do not have high-tech facilities for the safe waste disposal."
How smog-eating forests can save our cities," AS a thick, toxic haze envelops parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), rising levels of air pollution, a consequence of industrialisation and urbanisation, threaten to destroy the environment. Currently, the poor air quality has prompted school closures, delayed flights and caused car accidents in cities most impacted. In the past, Pakistan has experienced smog in the winter of 2016 when cities in Punjab, especially Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, were engulfed in it. At the time, the province's chief minister constituted a committee to recommend a contingency plan. Air pollution is the fourth highest risk factor for premature deaths globally. Moreover, it stunts economic growth and exacerbates poverty, making pollution not just an environmental problem, but a pervasive threat impacting aspects of health and wellbeing. Therefore, the kind of choking air quality being experienced currently has potential to create a public health emergency in the future. According to a study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, last month, 311,189 Pakistanis died as a result of air pollution in 2015./This year, the situation in the country's second-largest city, Lahore is at crisis point as a toxic haze blankets the entire province; similarly, most districts of KP have also been affected. The visibility is so poor it is hard to even drive on Lahore's main roads and motorways exiting the city, say residents. Experts say that levels of the dangerous particulates known as Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5, small enough to enter the lungs and the bloodstream, have reached 1,077 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) which is more than 30 times what is considered the safe limit. This year the smog started to build up close to Oct 10 in Lahore and surrounding districts, following which the air quality deteriorated to unprecedented unsafe levels around Oct 20, spiraling out of proportion on Oct 30. According to data by the SEAL air monitoring laboratory in Lahore, on Oct 31, the level of PM2.5 particles were found to be 134, 288ug/m3 way above the safe level of 35ug/m3./On his part, Naseem-ur-Rehman, the director of Punjab's Environment Protection Department (EPD), explains that the increase in vehicles and old polluting automobiles constitute part of the problem, which leads to traffic congestion and increasing emissions. Other contributing factors including stubble burning from both Pakistani and Indian Punjab, emissions from industries, power plants, brick kilns and generators, and burning trash and hospital waste also adversely impacts the environment."
Air quality and forestation," Punjab's new smog policy to control this kind of eye-stinging and throat burning smoke focuses partly on the creation of woodlands in and around major cities because trees are effective in regulating carbon dioxide and other gases. The role of urban forests in controlling air quality and pollution is well documented. Woodlands help to control the micro-climate, protect populations from heatwaves and add oxygen to the atmosphere that eventually leads to rainfall. Explaining the co-relation between forest cover and air pollution, Tahir Rasheed, the head of the South Punjab Forest Company (SPFC), says that 'forests are known to deal with air pollution, including smog, so, if our urban centres have a healthy proportion of forests, this will yield various environmental and economic benefits.' Unfortunately, Lahore is left with minimum forestland, which is also threatened by developmental projects./On its part, the Punjab government has geared up for conserving its forests by promoting commercial forestry on 99,077 acres of land in Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, Muzaffargarh and DG Khan. Land has been distributed to investors for afforestation under a public-private partnership model; a project based on a produce sharing formula, helping to provide sustainable farmed wood to the wood-based industry. This will help to reduce logging pressure on the country's natural forests. Because Pakistan is left with only 1.9pc of forest cover according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, this scenario also underscores the need for preserving woodlands and planting additional forests. According to Mr Rasheed, the land will be awarded to successful bidders for afforestation activities by December 2017. This initiative plans for 13 million trees for south Punjab in the next 15 years, amounting to carbon sequestration of approximately 5.6m tons a project that aims to reduce smog in the future. Similar models can be replicated in cities with the planting of rooftop gardens and through urban forestry. At the national level, a hundred million trees are earmarked for countrywide plantation says Ibrahim Khan, project director for the Green Pakistan Programme. This project when implemented will improve forest cover, conserve wildlife and sequester carbon dioxide."
'Lung disease on the rise in Pakistan'," A devastating lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) progressively robs sufferers of breath. Its incidence is on the rise in Pakistan mainly owing to tobacco smoking, biomass fuels and air pollution./This was stated by Prof Javaid A. Khan, chairperson of National Alliance for Tobacco Control and professor of medicine at the Aga Khan University, during his lecture held at a local hotel to mark World COPD Day on Wednesday./This year's theme is 'Many Faces of COPD'./'The disease is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and is projected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020. More than three million people die from the disease each year, and up to 10 per cent of adults over age 40 worldwide may have it,' he told the audience./Citing WHO statistics, Dr Khan pointed out that the estimated COPD death rate in Pakistan was 71 deaths per 100,000 population, which was the fourth highest death rate among the 25 most populous nations in the world./According to him, coughing, coughing up sputum, and getting out of breath during exercise or exertion are usually the early symptoms of the disease. Without treatment, COPD is generally progressive, and as the disease gets worse patients become breathless during everyday activities such as climbing a flight of stairs or even getting washed and dressed in the morning./'A simple, painless breathing test called spirometry can confirm whether a person has COPD or not. But, unfortunately, this test is not available in most hospitals in the country,' he said, adding that treatment was most effective when the disease was diagnosed early./He urged the government to take measures not only for the implementation of anti-smoking laws, but also for the control of atmospheric pollution."
A self-made disaster," AS the rain clouds are slow in offering relief, vast numbers of people in the country continue to experience disruptions in normal life due to the fog and smog. It is doubtful if the federal and provincial governments have fully comprehended the causes and consequences of the phenomena for which nature alone cannot be blamed./While smog has posed grave threats to the health of a large section of the population, those who must work in the open regardless of the environmental hazards bear the brunt. Meanwhile, curtailment of the people's mobility has played havoc with the economy. The cancellation of flights from and to Lahore, Faisalabad and Multan airports and the delays in flights operated by both domestic and international airlines, plus the adverse impact on work schedules caused by delays in train and road journeys, have resulted in a colossal loss of man-hours. Several hundred factories were closed and the duration of load-shedding increased. The cost to the economy might run into billions of rupees./The first reaction of the authorities to environmental degradation was to blame the neighbouring country for filling our atmosphere with smoke while anybody driving along the motorway from Islamabad to Lahore could have seen crop residue being burnt across a large area. As usual, our own contribution to the creation of the serious problem began to be realised much later./Our own contribution to the creation of a serious environmental problem was realised much later./As has been pointed out in this paper, air pollution in Pakistan, particularly in Lahore, has been going on for years. Winter after winter we have been watching a great column of particles hanging over Lahore at dusk. Punjab's Environmental Protection Department has been concentrating only on the monitoring of air pollution although its ineffectiveness, as well as the non-serious approach adopted, can be judged from the fact that some of the monitoring equipment imported has been lying in unopened boxes. Later on, the EPD rightly gave some credit to the Punjab government for efforts to reduce dangerous emissions from motor vehicles and factories./The hazards to people's heath became extremely grave when particle readings in Lahore's air touched 880 (against the permissible 35-40) on Nov 8, warranting a declaration of emergency (closing down of schools, etc.) which was never done. The situation again became unbearable on Nov 12./However, in addition to the factors mentioned above, it is necessary to take into account the increase in environmental degradation caused by deforestation and neglect of agriculture./Pakistan needs to extend its forest area to prevent carbon gases from escaping into the atmosphere, which is essential for reducing the effect of pollutants being released into the atmosphere all the time. But what is being done to forests was graphically demonstrated recently by photographs of huge quantities of timber from Gilgit-Baltistan flowing down a river. The latest Economic Survey approvingly notes a substantial rise in revenue from increased production of timber in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2016-2017, without acknowledging the damage to ecology done by the indiscriminate, and often illegal, felling of trees./The authorities cannot forget that the cutting down of each tree for any purpose to widen roads in cities, for constructing motorways or for outlandish projects like Lahore's Orange Line not only causes damage to the ecology, but also reduces the country's ability to meet the challenges of climate change./The state's neglect of the country's forest cover has a long history./Nearly 10 years ago, the Planning Commission prepared a five-year Rs13 billion project to substantially increase the forest cover. The plan was duly approved by Ecnec (Executive Committee of the National Economic Council) and formally launched. For some reason, the project was abandoned with the change of government. The government would do well to retrieve the files from its junkyard and consider the possibilities of reviving the afforestation plan as early as possible./It is impossible to deny the large contribution to environmental degradation made by the neglect of agriculture though it still accounts for 19.5 per cent of GDP and employs 42.3pc of the civil labour force (a conservative estimate given in the Economic Survey). Although some progress in agriculture due to higher crop output in 2016-2017 has been claimed, the fact remains that livestock accounts for 53.8pc of the agriculture sector's input; livestock's contribution to GDP at 11pc clearly indicates a smaller one by the farming sector./An expansion of the farming sector by bringing cultivable wastelands under cropping or by turning deserts into pastures will significantly improve Pakistan's capacity to sustain a healthy ecology and enable it to overcome the grim challenge that climate change is posing./A sound project for raising farming sector's output, called biosaline agriculture raising certain crops in saline conditions was launched a decade ago, and it attracted international attention. Quite a few countries acknowledged Pakistan's lead in this area. A pilot project was carried out but this plan too was shelved following a change of government. The scheme offers possibilities of developing vast tracts of barren land in all provinces into pasture, to begin with, according to Dr Kausar Malik, former head of the Agriculture Research Council and former member of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Planning Commission and an authority on the subject./Unfortunately, successive governments in Pakistan have failed to discharge their responsibility towards promoting and modernising agriculture. We need a major breakthrough in this sector through land reforms and improved agriculture development strategies. This is necessary to rescue the 58pc of the people of the country who were found food insecure in a 2011 survey and their number may have gone up./This is also necessary to reduce losses due to fog and smog, to meet the threat of climate change and, above all, to fight the mother of all ills ie poverty."
Health dept asks EPA for air quality data," The health department has requested the Environmental Protection Agency to share the data of air quality in the province for taking steps against diseases caused by pollution./In a letter titled 'Air Quality and Its Impact on Public Health' and dispatched two days ago, the health secretary has asked the EPA director general to share air quality index with him and suggest ways to feed that into the department's surveillance system./He also asked if the data was generated for Peshawar only or other cities of province too./The formal request was made in light of the KP Public Health (Surveillance  and  Response) Act, 2017, which defines hazardous agent as a biological, chemical, radiological or physical agent which has the potential to cause harm to humans./Plans steps against diseases caused by pollution/An inter-departmental Public Health Committee with the health minister as its head and EPA DG as member is primarily responsible for the implementation and enforcement of measures to prevent and control of spread of diseases, the letter said./During the last one month, the air quality remained a hot topic discussion and reports about Peshawar also highlighted the issue./In normal jargon, the people referred to it as smog and even courts considered to ask the government to declare it a health emergency./The letter has cited the WHO and US studies on global assessment of exposure and burden of disease and AQI describing air pollution as the cause of diseases./The health secretary conceded that his department didn't have any expert on the subject right now but pointed out that the matter was of serious nature as a WHO report, which said that one out of every 12 deaths in 2012 was the result of air pollution and subsequently published a study on the Integrated Exposure Risk (IER) functions for global burden of diseases with short and long-term impacts./The short-term impacts included acute lower respiratory in children and under five years of age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) while long term effects are adverse birth outcomes, childhood respiratory disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment of cognitive functions and lung cancer./The secretary said the AQI had been developed for reporting daily air quality for four major pollutants, including ground level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide./The AQI is divided into six levels from zero to 500./From 51 to 100 was acceptable but pollution in this range may pose a moderate health concern for a very small number of the people, who are unusually sensitive to ozone or particle pollution may experience respiratory symptoms./When the AQI level is from 101 to 150 AQI, members of sensitive groups may experience health effects, but the general public is unlikely to be effected and people with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active outdoors are considered sensitive and therefore at greater risk due to ozone./The particle pollution posed risk to people with heart or lung disease, older adults and children are considered sensitive and when the API is from 151 to 200, sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects./Its value between 201 and 300 trigger a health alert, meaning everyone may experience more serious health effects and over 300 AQI trigger health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is even more likely to be an effected by serious health effects."
Lahorites relieved after much-awaited rain," The Met Office has forecast more rain-thunderstorm -- with snowfall over the hills -- at scattered places in the next 24 hours in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, upper Fata, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and at isolated places in upper Punjab (Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala and Sargodha divisions) and Islamabad./Cold and dry weather is expected elsewhere in the country, it added./'With low intensity, Lahore may receive a shower intermittently within the next 24 hours. On Monday, Lahore's temperature was recorded as 15 degree centigrade (maximum) with 15mm of rain,' a Met official told Dawn./He said Khanpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalpur, Sahiwal, Kasur, Kot Addu, Multan, Layyah, Bhakkar, Okara, Gujranawala and Gujrat received 5mm, 4mm, 8mm, 4mm, 3mm, 13mm, 2mm, 3mm, 1mm, 5mm and 7mm rain, respectively./Citizens relish colder weather with traditional snacks/Meanwhile, the people of Lahore were relieved after the city was hit by a hard bout of rain on Monday, chasing away the long dry spell. The day saw a grey overcast sky since early morning, while there was constant drizzling throughout the afternoon. The day rolled by more or less like that and while it got colder, much of the public could not help stop at roadside shacks for some 'rainy treats' like samosas, pakoras and other fried delicacies./'In the kind of climate we have here, any rain is welcome, be it in the summers or winters,' said one man./Roadside snack vendors also saw sales go up thanks to the weather. Like most other rainy days, traffic ended up choking at busy points. Some of the worst places included the busy Mall road artery which connects much of the downtown with other parts of the city, along with Jail Road and Ferozepur Road. At other places, traffic flowed slowly./Heavy but brief thunderstorm began in the evening followed by a downpour. However, despite the problems, people were relieved that the dry spell that had caused a lot of respiratory problems and illnesses had now passed./A schoolteacher, Asma, said her entire family was suffering from either a cough or cold, while one of her children's asthma had worsened by the dry weather./Dr Sulman Kazmi from Mayo Hospital said there had been a 30 to 40 per cent increase in patients at various health facilities, but an exact figure could not be provided. However, he said with the rain, smog levels would definitely decrease and related health issues improve./Dr Shoaib said now the 'better part' of the weather had arrived and doctors expected lesser patients than before. 'We were seeing an average of eight to nine patients coming in for problems related to upper respiratory illness along with other problems,' he told Dawn. 'There were many cases of sore throat, ear infections, dry cough, sneezing and runny nose, and also a lot of chest congestion.'/But the Environment Protection Department (EPD) did not see much optimism regarding smog./Dr Tauqueer Qureshy, director labs at the EPD, said the cause of recent air pollution was mostly vehicular smoke mixed with crop burning, which exaggerated the smog. 'For now, rain has brought about a change in air pollution, but this impact will disappear after 12 hours,' he said. 'It is the beginning of the week, and high traffic is expected in the coming days. Pollution levels will go back to the same as before eventually.'"
Govt seems groping in the smog," The Consortium for Development Policy Research (CDPR) held a discussion on Wednesday on 'Lahore's Smog Crisis: A Regional Approach' where a panel of speakers identified what the actual environmental concerns were and what must be done about them./Environmental lawyer Ahmed Rafay Alam moderated the discussion and began saying the governments in both India and Pakistan had tried to evade the problem of smog until they began to get more pressure. He said there was a distinct difference between the air pollution which happens the whole year through and smog which takes place specifically in winter months./'At the same time the informal air quality monitors have showed how bad the air pollution levels have been lately, especially of PM2.5. In fact one of the highest he himself had measured was 315 micrograms (PM2.5),' he said./Experts point out a lack of clarity, tools to meet the challenge/Ali Habib, Managing Partner at Hima Verte and former director general of the WWF-Pakistan, explained the specific issues about particulate matter especially PM2.5. 'This is so minuscule (one fortieth of the cross section of human hair) that at times it enters lungs and lodges deep inside resulting in a congested cough,' he said./He said there was no formal monitoring in Punjab, especially in parts other than Lahore, but the WHO monitors have shown that Lahore's PM2.5 levels have been up to 6.8 times higher than specified levels. The WHO gives its limits of PM2.5 for up to 10 micrograms (maximum 15)./'The biggest sources of PM2.5 are rural kitchens which contribute to about 50pc of the levels, followed by vehicular emissions, crop residue burning, industrial smoke, open waste burning and diesel generation,' he said./He said the 'Smog Health Emergency Action Plan' was not being fully followed by the EPD./The government was represented by retired Capt Saif Anjum, Environment Protection Department secretary, who said there were no set lines about what was hazardous and what was not. 'The Action Plan given by court has taken into account other countries and the fact of the matter remains that the level of pollutants in their air and ours is very different,' he said./'We do not have tools, finances or staff, so we manage to work on one thing, that is, raise public awareness.'/He said they also sought the agriculture department help in stopping crop burning this year./Dr Sanval Nasim, assistant professor of economics from LUMS, spoke about some policies being adopted the world over and which had worked for other countries and could be applied in Pakistan too. He said measures like tax on vehicles creating pollution, mandatory smog checks in cars, and an emphasis on public transportation could help improve the situation."
SHC seeks comments on petition seeking ban on garbage disposal in Malir River,"The Sindh High Court on Friday directed the city mayor, director general of Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) and others to file their respective comments on a constitutional petition seeking imposition of ban on disposal, burning or smouldering of solid waste and garbage in Malir River or on its banks at Korangi Causeway./The petition was filed by Yasir Khurshid and 41 other residents of Air Force Officers Housing Society (AFOHS), Dadabhai Town, Mehmoodabad, Shehri-Citizens for a Better Environment and others who impleaded the chief secretary, city mayor, inspector general of police, SSWMB, Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, Cantonment Board Faisal, District Municipal Committee Korangi and DMC East as respondents./The petitioners, represented by Advocate Zubair Ahmed Abro, challenged the dumping and disposal through open burning/smouldering of hazardous, hospital, industrial and municipal solid waste in Malir River at Korangi Causeway resulting in adverse environmental, security and health impacts on the residents of the area, including the petitioners./They submitted in their petition that 12,000-plus tons of solid waste was being produced every day in the city and despite such huge load, the city had no garbage transfer stations (GTSs)./The petitioners stated that 7,000-plus tons solid waste was being dumped in nullahs (drains) every day, which ended up in the sea or was burnt openly./They said that open burning of garbage released several hazardous pollutants./The petitioners said that the impact and velocity of the dumping and open burning of solid waste in Malir River at Korangi Causeway could be judged from the Google images from year 2005 to 2017./They submitted that the acts of the respondents put life of the petitioners and other residents in great danger of respiratory diseases, especially children who were most susceptible./The petitioners said the most alarming fact is the effect of air pollution through open burning of solid waste on infants and children residing in the area."
Learning from London," THE mayor of London Sadiq Khan's recent visit to Pakistan reminded me of the roles that Londoners have played in responding to two environmental crises. These, in turn, have influenced countries' approaches to environmental infrastructure and regulation around the world. Let me explain./Water first. John Snow, a Londoner, is known as the father of epidemiology. He was the first to make the connection that water was a carrier of disease. Rather than just being satisfied with treating the symptoms of diarrhoeal disease, he chose to work instead to prevent disease. In the 19th century, tens of thousands of people died in London from cholera, an acute diarrhoeal disease. A particularly bad outbreak in Soho, close to where Snow lived, in August 1854 led to 500 fatalities in the space of 10 days. By tracing each person who was ill, Snow was the first to figure out on Sept 7, 1854, that it was caused by the water source, namely a pump on Broad Street. He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump and immediately the outbreak was controlled. It was later found that the cause was the mixing of sewage with drinking water. Sadly, it took a while for officials to believe Snow and to act. Ultimately, London (and much of Europe) did update sewer systems, significantly reducing diarrhoeal disease incidence./Despite remarkable improvements in the proportion of the Pakistani population using an improved water source and an improved sanitation facility, according to the United Nations Development Programme, 27.2 million Pakistanis still do not have access to safe water and 52.7m do not have access to adequate sanitation facilities. It is also telling that only 36 per cent of Pakistanis have access to a safely managed drinking water source, according to 2015 data, despite 55pc piped water coverage. So Pakistani conditions may not be that different from 19th-century London. But you have already been reading a lot about this in Sindh recently./We need to monitor air quality. This will allow us to determine pollution sources and address them./Now for the second story. From the 13th century onwards, London suffered from poor air quality, and in the 1940s and '50s, it became known for its 'pea soup' fogs. I am sure the citizens of Lahore and Islamabad know what I am talking about, given the situation last month. In London's case, the prevalence of coal use in power stations, industries and in homes resulted in air quality that was so bad that it was tough to see. A particularly bad fog, now known as the 'The Great Smog of London' took place in mid-December 1952. Official estimates put resulting deaths at over 4,000 and over 100,000 people falling ill due to respiratory illnesses. More recent estimates put the number of dead at 12,000. Even the prime minister at the time, Winston Churchill, dismissed it as a 'weather event'. Ultimately, the disaster helped to improve people's awareness about air quality and health and four years later, the United Kingdom passed its first Clean Air Act. This put in place a number of measures to reduce air pollution and was a milestone with respect to initiating a debate on regulation and public health. Subsequently, more stringent regulations in later acts were enacted./Today, London still suffers from poor air quality, at 20 µg/m3, which is twice the WHO-recommended average annual level for particulate matter, less than 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5), ie the pollutant that most affects health. Sadiq Khan and his government are actively working to reduce this. Compare this with the annual mean PM2.5 measurements recorded in WHO's 2016 ambient air pollution database for Peshawar (111 µg/m3), Rawalpindi (107 µg/m3), Karachi (88 µg/m3), Lahore (68 µg/m3) and Islamabad (66 µg/m3), or the 24-hour average PM2.5 reading from the Punjab EPA's Lahore Gulberg monitor of 78 µg/m3 on Nov 30, 2017./I have already shared WHO's estimates for deaths from outdoor and indoor air pollution in Pakistan. At an estimated 155,000 a year, it is a shockingly high and totally unacceptable number. In order to fix this, we need to monitor air quality. This will allow us to determine pollution sources and address them. Monitoring air quality will also help officials to figure out the correct National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) or emissions standards imposed on various industries so that the pollution they put into the air does not cause air quality to deteriorate./Yet it seems that only one province, namely Punjab, has standards for PM2.5, and seems to have a few measurement stations in Lahore. Sindh, despite its huge industrial base, has still not promulgated provincial ambient standards for PM2.5, putting a huge population base at risk. It also seems that emissions standards for some industries are non-existent, such as for PM2.5 emissions from coal power plants. For other industries, the emissions standards do not vary based on the quality of the air shed of the city in which these industries are based. Hence their effect on air quality and citizen's health may be questionable, making them open to abuse. Further, in cities such as Lahore, which are subject to 'thermal inversions', where the air gets trapped due to meteorological effects above the city, measuring air quality comprehensively is crucial as additional emergency measures may be necessary at times to make sure the air quality does not become excessively unhealthy./Today, we do not have to wait for government air quality monitoring using expensive equipment. Satellites can remotely assess air quality, and relatively cheap air quality monitors, around $200, are also available. I put it as a challenge to all schools, universities, industries and businesses to buy a PM2.5 air quality monitor and link it up to a shared, publicly accessible database for each city, set up by an enterprising Pakistani computer scientist or to existing global air quality websites. This way we will know more about the air we are taking into our bodies, which is as fundamental as the water and the food we consume. It will be an important start to help the government and our fellow citizens eventually tackle this problem./WHO estimated, using 2004 data, that 22pc of all deaths and illnesses in Pakistan were due to environmental factors. I keep wondering why we cannot learn from London's experience and prioritise the tackling of air and water quality issues."
