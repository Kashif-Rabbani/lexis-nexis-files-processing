Plan to build waste treatment plant on sports ground protested," Score of players and residents from different localities of Peshawar on Friday staged a protest demonstration against the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government's plan to establish a waste treatment plant on the land allocated for construction of a playground in Ghari Baloch area./The protesters from several villages located on Charsadda Road gathered outside Peshawar Press Club under the leadership of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cycling Association president Nisar Ahmad./They were carrying banners and placards inscribed with their demands and chanted slogans against the government for approving construction of a waste plant on the land allocated for construction of a playground in Ghari Baloch./Mr Ahmad said that the government had set up a playground on 150 kanals of state land in the locality under its initiative of constructing playgrounds at the district and tehsil levels across the province./However, he said that the Public Health Engineering Department had recently signed an agreement with the Water Supply and Sanitation Company, Peshawar, for construction of a waste plant on the land of the playground. He said that the velodrome already planned at the site would be the second such facility to be constructed in the country./Peshawar residents say 80-kanal land already allocated for playground/He said that the decision to set up a waste plant in the densely-populated area would not only deprive the local youth of a sports facility, but also result in air pollution leading to outbreak of various diseases among the people./The area's youth councillor, Akbar Khan, and notables Ahad Murtaza and Shayan Shah also opposed the decision. They demanded of the government to withdraw the decision or else they would launch a protest campaign against the plan./When contacted, KP director general sports Junaid Khan said that the sports department had approved a tehsil ground over 40 kanals whereas another 40 kanals were demarcated for the velodrome. He said that the contract in this regard had been awarded and the contractor had so far carried out construction work of Rs4 million. He said that the land was the property of Public Health Engineering Department and now it had signed an agreement with WSSP for construction of a waste plant over 80 kanals./Mr Junaid said that an MoU had been signed with a Chinese firm to carry out the feasibility for construction of the plant, while the construction work on the playground had been stopped. He said that the matter had been brought into the notice of Chief Secretary Azam Khan for its resolution."
Greening economic growth," WHEN I hear people in Pakistan talk of how we really need to focus on economic growth now and on cleaning up later, I cannot help thinking about the Mexican finance secretary's reaction in 2000 when he heard that environmental degradation was costing his country about nine per cent of gross domestic product per annum. I still remember him holding up one hand and pointing the other hand downwards and summing it up as (to paraphrase): you mean we are pushing the country up through our policies to promote growth with one hand, and pulling it down, through environmental degradation, with the other hand?/We talk a lot about sustainable development these days, but to their great credit, the Mexicans went into action in 2000. They initiated an internal discussion on what they needed to do to modernise their environmental sector and to integrate environment into economy-wide policies. They realised that the physical environment was principally affected by actions in other sectors, and so, among other steps, they developed a new programme focused on sustainable development, which placed accountability for environmental sustainability on (initially) 13 different federal sectoral entities, as well as state and local governments. The programme also emphasised the citizen's right to information that would allow one to know the state of the environment in which one lived and how one's welfare was affected. Mexico also established an environmental unit in the finance ministry with the particular mandate of designing and proposing fiscal instruments to support environmental policy implementation and promote behaviour change. The programme resulted in the Mexican government becoming much more agile at using a forum of multiple sectors to generate comprehensive solutions to environmental problems, gathering environmental data and sharing it with the public, as well as creating the right fiscal incentives to facilitate behavior change./Most finance ministers don't think that environment is their business at all, but increasingly we are discovering that it is. Why do I say this? Economic growth is defined in most textbooks as 'an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services, compared from one period of time to another'. The value (rather than the quantity) of the goods and services is calculated based on current market value, adjusted for inflation and compared across time periods. The unit of measurement is either gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP). So, in effect, economic growth is viewed as a proxy for an increase in aggregate productivity./Most economists will tell you that there are five main ways to generate long-term economic growth. The first is a discovery of new or better economic resources. The second is to create more jobs and to grow the labour force (Side note: women coming into the labour force, together with men, in many countries after the Second World War had a major positive effect on their economic growth. The Quaid clearly had this figured out. In a speech at Aligarh in 1944, he said 'Another very important matter which I want to impress upon you, is that no nation can rise to the height of glory, unless women are side by side with you.'). A third is to increase investment in infrastructure and physical capital. Fourth is to create superior technology or products. And fifth is through increasing skills of labourers, and so increasing their productivity./Most finance ministers don't think that environment is their business, but we are discovering that it is./What does all this have to do with environmental degradation? The latter affects citizens' health, causing early deaths in some cases./Indeed, according to the recent Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health's report, almost one in four premature deaths in Pakistan is attributed to pollution. In other cases, it causes illnesses that prevent people from reporting to work. Finally, in Pakistan, repeated bouts of malnutrition and environmental diseases (such as diarrhoea) in children under the age of two years results in reducing children's IQ levels and their educational and cognitive performance. All this taken together means that the country's productivity is lowered rather significantly./A case study on Pakistan in a World Bank book, Environmental Health and Child Survival, tried to estimate the cost of disease, using 2005 data, in terms of loss of productivity, early mortality and health costs associated with environmental factors, such as lack of clean water, inadequate sanitation, poor waste disposal, indoor and outdoor air pollution, vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, and problems arising from industrial chemicals and wastes. It also included malnutrition-mediated indirect effects of environmental risk factors. The estimated annual cost of direct and indirect impact of environmental risk factors for Pakistan came to almost 9pc of GDP per annum. In comparison, our annual GDP growth in 2005 was a high 7.7pc, according to World Bank data. Just think how much higher it could have been./It seems to me that a major input to achieving greater economic growth, that we can directly affect, are our people. Clearly, a healthy and educated people lead to both a better workforce and budding entrepreneurs, so that old businesses can be more productive but also new businesses can generate jobs and superior technologies and products. So many countries focus on improving the pillars of health and education as they move up the development ladder from low- to middle- to high-income economies. In Pakistan, as in most other developing countries, environmental degradation is the third pillar of that stool, as it directly affects both health and education outcomes. In addition, pollution results in unnecessary healthcare expenditures, an expensive option for a country with insufficient budget./Pakistan's former finance minister, Shahid Javed Burki, often mentions that today's Pakistan is a very young country, with more than 50pc of the population under the age of 25 years. By his calculations, in the cities, more than 75pc of the population are under the age of 25 years old. These youth, and their energy and enterprise, have the potential to raise Pakistan up. At the same time, it seems that we are holding them down, by lowering their productivity, because of poor air and water quality. Why can't we improve the physical environment and green our economic growth? After all, it will only make our youth even more productive and our country even richer. Let's not please ever say again that we have to grow first and clean up later."
Gorano controversy dominates Thar coal project session on last day of HLF," The controversial issue of Gorano effluent reservoir in Tharparkar echoed at one of the sessions on the concluding day at the three-day Hyderabad Literature Festival (HLF) that drew to an end on Sunday evening./Apparently, the controversial issue came to light at the final day's programme when Tharis affected by the reservoir registered their strong protest over not being given representation on the stage./The session discussed 'Thar coal: prospects for future'. It was the Thari community's concerns and protests that prompted eminent economist Dr Kaiser Bengali who was among the panellists to say: 'While Thar coal project will certainly lead to benefits, there is a dire need to pay attention to the price that the community is going to pay'./The Tharis protested that festival organisers did give space to SECMC (Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company) representative but there was none on the stage to talk about the community's narrative and concerns. After giving vent to their feelings against construction of the reservoir by the SECMC, which they believe was affecting their sources of livelihood, they walked out of the session./Dr Bengali started the discussion by saying that everything had a cost and benefit. 'Development has a cost and environmental impacts. Every development doesn't have equal distributional impact,' he said, adding: 'Every development project must be backed by a debate so that community whose interests are to be affected must become part of decision-making.'/He said the coal project would certainly lead to establishment of new cities and job opportunities but there was a cost to be paid. 'Perhaps we must see the aspect of price of development to be paid by community. Will it benefit people of Thar; or outsiders will find new abodes there? Gawadar's debate revolves around same question. Some steps are taken and more are needed to protect rights of locals who have first right to get fruits of development,' he said./He said that desert has a clean environment and what one must see was that the air was going to be polluted due to coal's extraction or will it affect water quality. Gorano's issue is all about groundwater aquifer due to storage of saline water. A displacement is there like any other project. Moot point is how it is to be compensated or resettled so that social engineering of community is not disturbed./He remarked: 'Dev­elopment's human factor is crucial,' and urged the company that has undertaken mining in the region to use technology in checking air pollution and water contamination./'Growth of new houses in Islamkot indicates as if a katchi abadi is emerging. A planned development is needed for new settlement,' said the economist./He underscored the need for conserving cultural and religious heritage of Thar. 'Two-thirds of Thar should be declared 'national park' with ban on multi-storey construction and establishment of smoke smack industry,' he stressed./SECMC's corporate social responsibility (CSR) wing head Naseer Memon, a writer who has recently joined the company, was mentally prepared for the protest. He tackled them politely, asking the audience to have a serious debate over the issues to raise macro-level questions. 'I find Gorano reservoir a dot in Thar's future as many will surface when more companies start working,' he said. The technical studies on disposal sites were done and they could be shared with others, he added./The pandemonium star­ted when journalist Sohail Sangi, himself a Thari, at the outset of the session objected that 'company [SECMC] representative can hold a news conference to present its case. There is none to give community's narrative,' Mem­on argued that Thar coal and Engro were not synonymous as 13 blocks were there, too. He that all pro-Sindh and pro-Thar forces should look at the issue seriously and if it was not done, then everyone would only rue something after five to 10 years.A former diplomat and head of Sindh Vision, Ali Mardan Rahujo, also expressed his views./Inam Sheikh, Dr Shaheen Ashraf and Waheeda Mah­esar discussed 'Chal­lenges and opportunities to education sector'./The session on 'Problems and prospects of higher education' also ended abruptly after Sindh Univ­ersity students registered their protest over increase in fees and provision of a charity's food to varsity students. They raised placards inscribed with such slogans in front of vice chancellor Dr Fateh Mohammad Burfat, who was sitting on the stage. He and Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences vice chancellor Dr Bikha Ram took part in the discussion."
Kohat people protest pollution caused by cement plant," Thousands of residents of some six villages in close proximity to a cement plant have protested against the pollution being created by the factory for the last more than a decade, and demanded installation of filtration plant as soon as possible./The demand was made at a jirga here on Monday. The participants said that the factory was emitting dust and CO2 due to use of coal and crushing of lime stone, causing chest and throat diseases among the people, especially the children./The jirga participants pointed out that there used to be 75 per cent local employees and remaining the outsiders under an agreement but after sale of the factory to private owners there were hardly five per cent local labourers working on contract basis as others had been expelled./They said that the company paid a worker Rs12,000 for 14 hours labour thus violating the policy of the provincial government in that regard. They pointed out that the labour court and the Peshawar High Court had given a decision, ordering for re-employment of the expelled workers, but the plant's administration got the order stayed from the Supreme Court in 2016. They appealed to the apex court to conclude the case at the earliest./An official of the cement plant, when contacted, told that the management was trying to solve the problems of the area people./He said that the plant was changing the old filtration technology with new one with the Chinese help as coal and dust were causing air pollution. He said that a Chinese firm expected to visit the plant soon for a survey./The cement plant gave a grant of Rs40 million recently to the Sarhad Rural Development Programme for forming committees at village level to carry out development according to the needs of the locals. The company has also launched healthcare and poor friendly programmes in rural areas and giving annual cash and medical help to the people, officials said./CHILDREN PARK: The chairman standing committee on information MPA Ziaullah Bangash claims to have sanctioned Rs100 million for beautification of the Tanda Dam resort./During a visit to the area, he directed the officials concerned to start work on the construction of link and widening of main roads. He also ordered construction of a children park and hotels in the dam resort./The lawmaker said hundreds of people thronged the place every day but there was scarcity of excursion places for families and children./VEHICLES' AUCTION: The district administration has asked the departments to auction hundreds of rusting vehicles, and prayer leaders to remove standing water at the ablution places as a precaution against dengue./The directives were issued by the deputy commissioner while chairing a meeting on Monday./He also urged the Auqaf department to create awareness among people about dengue in Friday sermons. He requested the principals of schools and colleges to create awareness about dengue in assemblies./Similarly, he asked the medical superintendents to devise a mechanism for proper disposal of hospital waste. He directed the tehsil municipal administration to provide a vehicle to the Water Supply and Sanitation Company to carry out fumigation in six urban union councils of the city."
'Hattar industries playing havoc with environment'," The residents of different localities near the proposed phase-7 of Hattar Economic Zone have stressed the need for protecting their areas from pollution in case of developing more industries in Haripur. They also sought assurance that the rights of people who had given their precious land for this project would be protected./The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Economic Zone Development and Management Company (EZDMC) arranged a public hearing on the impacts of industrialisation in Hattar area here on Tuesday where Environment Protection Agency, KP, DG Dr Bashir, officials of EZDMC, representatives of Industrialists Association Hattar and residents of Hattar, Shadi, Khoi Nara, Dingi, Motiyan and other areas were in attendance./Speaking on this occasion, Masood Khan advocate said that the existing industrial units of Hattar had been playing havoc with the environment. He lamented that the people of surrounding and downstream villages were the worst affected in the district and despite repeated complaints the government had not taken concrete steps to check the water and air pollution./Public hearing on impacts of industrialisation held/He said that the respiratory, stomach, brain and eye diseases and cancer were common in these areas since early 80s. He suggested that the government must first take measures such as construction of a waste treatment plant to avoid pollution./Hattar village council nazim Malik Asim said that people were not opposed to industrialisation in the area as they were aware of the economic benefits of this activity, but it should be in such a planned way that the social, economic and environment rights of the residents of surrounding areas were protected./He said that the government should satisfy the people of about the measures it would take for checking air, water and noise pollution and allocating certain job quota in industrial units to those who had given their land for proposed phase-7 of Hattar Economic Zone./Qamar Hayat, a social activist, referred to the harm the existing industrial units of Hattar, especially cement plants, had been causing to the biodiversity./He demanded that the local MPA and district and tehsil nazims should also be invited to the hearing./The villagers also rejected the EIA report of the area that the KP EZDMC got conducted with the help of consultants and demanded practical steps before the construction of industries in phase-7./Speaking on the occasion, EPA DG Dr Bashir told the audience that as per development plan the EZDMC would construct a treatment plant for controlling water pollution while for air pollution the modern bag filtering system would be ensured./He said that no industry would be given no-objection certificate unless effective pollution controlling measures were taken."
Air pollution," DO you know that the air you breathe in could be much more polluted than you ever think? Most studies investigating an association between levels of air pollution and rates of diseases have been conducted in developed countries where concentrations of air pollution, climatic conditions and many other factors are significantly different from those in most developing countries./Air pollution is a big problem in Asian cities. A study on Karachi about environmental pollution shows that the pollution is five times greater than the safe levels recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO)./The Pakistan government-owned compendium of environmental statics shows air pollution from double to five times of WHO levels. Poor air quality increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma. Air pollution kills about eight million people annually and is the fourth leading risk factor for premature deaths worldwide . There is a resulting rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, including non-smokers, children and the elderly. Eighty-eight per cent of the traffic police in Karachi develop a respiratory disease after two years on the job./Environment should be put in the category of our national security. Defence of our environment is just as important as defence abroad."
Smokeless stoves," IT is an innovative technology-based solution for getting rid of the indoor air pollution that occurs due to smoke produced by stoves, particularly used in rural areas of our country, as well as in urban slums too./It helps alleviate health diseases and infections. So many World Health Organisation reports are on the table and its website suggest not to use smoke-producing stove as it adds to bad health conditions rapidly while empirical researchers have found its impacts on the mental and physical conditions of users or the affected ones./A novel fuel-efficient stove, as developed by Masood Lohar of UNDP Global Environment Facility, Small Grants Programme , Pakistan, vents nearly all of the smoke that is produced in the process of cooking. However, innovative stoves have also replaced the cooking method./A smokeless stove is greatly beneficial like it does not carry indoor air pollution, carries high fuel efficiency, low cost, durable, aligned with current habits, having mobility, and easy to install at home for cooking./What our government needs to do is to implement large-scale 'smokeless stove' programmes with awareness campaigns partnered with organisations working to that end./Doing this will strengthen efforts for protecting the environment and fighting effects of climate change."
Quality of air in Islamabad declining," Trying to get away from dangerous airborne pollutants? Do not linger into sectors I-9, I-10 and I-11./And if residents of Islamabad are bent on avoiding both invisible and visible particulate matters that travel through the blood stream and permanently settle in the lungs to cause respiratory problems, add sectors I-8 and areas of Rawalpindi adjacent to the industrial area as no-go zones./According to environmentalists in the Ministry of Climate Change, Islamabad owes its high air pollution to continuous mega development works such as road widening projects, increasing numbers of cars and particularly steel mills, a dominant source of air pollution./Particulate matter in smoke causes respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, says official/'Islamabad may not have the worse air quality but its high enough to have drawn the attention of the Supreme Court over the past years, issuing directions to monitor emissions from steel mills in particular./'The declining quality of air is the biggest environmental issue in Islamabad,' said an official of the ministry./According to another official, the quality of air is worse in I-8, I-9, I-10 and I-11 than other parts of the city higher than what is considered healthy./The official explained that the smoke residents in these sectors see rising from chimneys is black carbon that contains particulate matter 10 (PM10). If inhaled, the particulate matter causes respiratory and cardiovascular diseases./'But worst is the particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), mixture of solid and liquid particles that circulate in the air. Inhaling this type of particle can increase risks of lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes and emergency room visits for people with asthma and heart problems.'/He explained that the black smoke was caused by the poor quality of scrap used by steel mills and furnaces./The scrap included oil and paint canisters, one of the actual sources of black smoke./'A lot of problems could be solved if the owners of these steel mills switched on their filtering equipment,' he added./For the residents in these sectors who breathed PM2.5 and PM10 day in day out, there is no respite./Rizwan Butt of I-9/4 said: 'We open our eyes to a toxic fog mixed with tons of poisonous soot when the mills start their engines every morning after 5am. Our children breathe the same air,' he said./Mehboob Ali, who owns a store in the I-9 Markaz, said he tried to keep his face mask as long as he could./'The steel mills and furnaces run even after dark. The black smoke is visible in the darkness of the night. It has been so for many years now,' the shopkeeper said./Here's why the problems of residents in these sectors who breathe particulate pollution is less likely to go away./When Secretary Ministry of Climate Change Khizer Hayat Khan was contacted, he told Dawn that he did not even know that emissions from the steel mills and the deteriorating quality of air in these areas were a problem./'This issue was never brought to my attention,' said Mr Khan./However, after double checking with his subordinates, the secretary said a meeting was held between officials from the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and owners of the steel mills./'Pak-EPA has asked the steel mill owners to install filters that cleansed the emissions of poisonous components,' Mr Khan said, adding in case of failure the environment watchdog would cancel their leases./'More action is expected along these lines next week,' the secretary added."
Pak-EPA orders shutdown of two steel mills for breaking environment laws," In a crackdown against steel mills in I-9 and I-10 for polluting the air, the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) on Wednesday ordered the shutdown of two steel mills and will also take action against the remaining units for breaking environment laws./Pak-EPA issued environment protection order (EPO) under the Pakistan Environment Protection Act 1997 to Siddiqui Steel Mill and Zia Steel Mill./In the EPO, Pak-EPA has maintained that both steel mills are responsible for causing significant pollution./Smoke from their chimneys was 40pc in excess of permissible limits, action to be taken against other units/During the monitoring of these units on April 2, 2018, the smoke from their chimneys was 40pc in excess of the permissible limit of the National Environment Quality Standards (NEQS)./Pak-EPA has maintained that both steel mills were served with summon notices in the past, extending them the opportunity for personal hearing that were never availed by the owners of the mills./'You did not even bother to appear for personal hearing in order to satisfy the concerned authorities about the violations. You are directed to immediately stop operations of your units till compliance of National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS),' Pak-EPA said in the EPO issued to both units./The environment watchdog warned that failure to comply with these orders will be considered an offence punishable under the law./Talking to Dawn, Secretary Climate Change Khizar Hayat Khan said more raids will be conducted against steel mills and steel furnaces that are polluting the air./According to environmentalists in the climate change ministry, Islamabad owes its high air pollution particularly to steel mills, a dominant source of air pollution, other than factors such as mega development projects./The officials in the ministry said that the black smoke residents see rising from the chimneys is black carbon that contains particulate matter 10 (PM10) and PM2.5./Inhaling particulate pollution, mixtures of solid and liquid particles that circulate in the air can increase risks of lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and emergency room visits for people with asthma and heart problems among a host of other health problems, they said./Officials say that the black smoke is caused by the poor quality of scrap used by steel mills and steel furnaces. The scrap include oil and paint canisters, one of the actual sources of black smoke./Despite repeated reminders from Pak-EPA, steel mills and steel furnaces continue to operate without switching on their filtering equipments, an official in the ministry said."
"Air even in courtroom is polluted, reading tells"," Air quality even inside the lofty Courtroom No. 1 of the Supreme Court leaves much to be desired. A reading taken inside the courtroom on Thursday during the hearing of a pollution-related case showed a scale of 39 particulate matter (PM) when the international standard of clean air is 10PM./Particulate matter is the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in the air many of which are hazardous like dust, pollen, soot, smoke and liquid droplets./The reading was taken by Venu G. Advani, a concerned citizen from Karachi, on the request of Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar when he inquired whether the former had brought the pocket-sized apparatus to gauge air quality./Mr Advani, who had moved an application to become a party in the case related to environmental pollution in Karachi due to industrial activities, told the court that the apparatus had been impounded by the security outside. The apparatus was brought inside the courtroom on the instruction of the court and Mr Advani told the court after taking the reading that though inside the courtroom the reading showed 30PM, outside it was much higher./He said even a minuscule increase in the pollution index led to 10-year decrease in the life expectancy of individuals who inhaled polluted air./'What are we doing to our children who are not breathing clean air,' Mr Advani lamented./The chief justice regretted that Pakistan had become one of the most polluted countries in Asia and wondered whether the government was doing something to address the alarming situation./One of the reasons of rising air pollution was the fast depleting forest cover, said Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan./Children were most susceptible to diseases like asthma, Mr Advani said adding that when children went to schools they were exposed to smoke emitting from cars./He highlighted that Germany had banned diesel cars and said that the move forward was to encourage electric buses and cars./Earlier in his application, Mr Advani had regretted that non-implementation of the World Bank guidelines by the federal and the provincial governments over the last five years had exacerbated the situation./Since the environmental protection agencies had an integral role to play in every province, the budgets of the agencies needed to be enhanced and the powers of their functionaries should be broadened, he said./He stressed the need for identification of major pollutants being released from the industries, saying PM25 was detrimental to the health of pregnant women and children./To ameliorate the situation, he proposed, air purifiers be implanted in schools and the cars which caused pollution should not be allowed to crowd around schools./He said the mechanical and vehicular overhaul was also necessary./When Mr Advani mentioned coal-related pollution hanging over Karachi, the chief justice asked him to move an application so that the matter could be taken in Karachi."
Two steel mills shut for air pollution resume operation," Two steel mills shut down for violating environment laws have resumed business without approval from the environment watchdog./'The owners of the steel mills seem to have broken the seals placed on the gates by Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA./'The agency is now looking into the matter,' said Ministry of Climate Change Director General Irfan Tariq./He explained that a process had to be followed through court and the government department that sealed the building/premises was then notified to reopen the premises./'However, Pak-EPA has not received any notification through the court to allow the steel mills to resume business,' Mr Tariq told Dawn on Sunday./In April, Pak-EPA had issued environment protection orders (EPO) to Siddiqui Steel Mill and Zia Steel Mill for polluting the air with dangerous emissions./The environment watchdog had maintained that both the steel mills were 'responsible for causing significant pollution.'/Secretary Ministry of Climate Change Khizar Hayat promised action against other units for polluting the air./According to environmentalists in the climate change ministry, Islamabad owes its high air pollution to steel mills, a dominant source of air pollution, other than factors such as mega development projects./The officials in the ministry said the smoke residents see rising from chimneys was black carbon that contained particulate matter./Inhaling particulate pollution, mixtures of solid and liquid particles that circulate in the air, can increase risks of lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes and emergency room visits for people with asthma and heart problems among a host of other health problems, they said./The officials added that black smoke was caused by the poor quality of scrap used by steel mills and steel furnaces./The scrap included oil and paint canisters, one of the actual sources of black smoke./Despite repeated reminders from Pak-EPA, steel mills and steel furnaces continue to operate without switching on their filtering equipment, said Mr Tariq./He said Pak-EPA was monitoring the air quality around I-9 and I-10 where these steel mills were located./'A survey is being carried out and raids will be conducted on the steel mills that are contaminating the air,' the official said."
Footprints: WOES AND FEARS IN KAHOON VALLEY," IT is a hot day but the light breeze blowing through the Kahoon Valley of Salt Range makes it tolerable. A gardener is busy watering plants using water from a bore drilled a few yards away on the right side of a lawn. At the entrance to the lawn lies the fabled Katas Raj pond, once used to supply drinking water to nearby towns and irrigate the loquat orchards in its vicinity./The pond, once believed to be fathomless, used to be on the verge of overflowing throughout the year. It now carries four to five feet of water, which is dropped into it daily through a water bore drilled half a kilometre away. The once crystal cerulean lake, revered and held sacred by the Hindu community, is now muddied and stinky./'The natural water of this pond was sacred for us but now we cannot get ishnan (bath) in the pond as it is being filled by groundwater instead of water from its original source. The very purpose of our worship has been killed,' complains Shiv Partab Bajaj, who has been leading Indian pilgrims to Katas Raj for last thirty years./The dismal situation of the Katas Raj pond led Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar to take action last November, but it is only one of the indications of the problems faced by the residents of Kahoon Valley. The condition of Tatral Kahoon, a village situated only two kilometres from the historic Katas Raj, is worse./The residents here suffer a continuous shrill scream of boring machines operating in various parts of the village. Nearly every house here has bored into the ground for water, but most villagers either get the bores drilled further or dig up new wells to get access to potable water. 'We had bored 120 feet deep into the ground. A couple of years ago, I got it dug another 30ft deep (so that it was 150ft deep), and now I have gotten it drilled up to 291ft deep, because the level of the water table has dropped at an alarming rate,' shares Jamil Hussain, a resident of the village./Other residents share similar fears. They suffer health hazards, which they attribute to air pollution by the Bestway Cement Plant. 'Every other person is suffering from chest diseases and allergic reactions,' Mohammad Yunus, another resident of the area, says as he looks up at the cement plant hovering over his village./According to the Imperial Gazetteer of India 1883, the Salt Range 'runs in two main ridges from east to west, now parallel, now converging, meeting in a confused mass of peaks east of Katas and opening out again. Between these ranges is a succession of fertile and picturesque valleys set in oval frames by the hills never more than five miles in width and closed in at either end'. Among all the valleys here, Sakesar, Kahoon and Jhangar stand apart due to their mesmerising beauty./The region, dotted with historical sites, natural springs, lakes and plenty of wildlife, such as the rare Punjab urial, had the potential to be a haven for tourists at a point. However, it is fast becoming a wasteland, as the cement plants, installed in a rush during retired Gen Pervez Musharraf's regime, are laying waste to nature at an alarming rate./Former Chakwal MNA Tahir Iqbal, who was a federal minister for the environment when the cement plants were set up in the area, says his ministry had refused to issue a no-objection certificate but the plants were installed here anyway./Former governor of Punjab retired Lt Gen Mohammad Safdar Malik wanted to spend the last years of his life in his village a few kilometres from Katas Raj, but was forced to settle in Rawalpindi because of the pollution caused by cement plants. 'The chief justice is very keen on this issue. I hope the pollution and destruction being wrecked by these cement plants would be controlled.'/Stressing the need for a health survey among residents of the area, former MPA Mehwish Sultana, who hails from Choa Saidan Shah, says it is important to determine the extent to which these cement plants have affected the health of the people living here. 'This should also be determined how many locals have been recruited by cement plants and how many facilities have been given by the cement plants to this area from where they are earning billions,' she says./However, the general manager of Bestway Cement, Irshad Ali Ameer, insists that his plant has not been creating pollution. 'We are converting our water usage to air-cooled system which would bring our dependence on groundwater to zero level while we would harvest rainwater as well,' he says./Although the Supreme Court has given the cement factories six months to arrange for alternative water sources and bring the use of underground water to zero, the residents of the area want to know if that would also end the incidence of disease and health hazards. 'Will our fertile land be returned to us? Will groundwater be revived and, most importantly, will the damage done to the natural beauty of our valley be repaired?' are among the questions they have as they set their eyes on the Supreme Court's next move."
SC orders sealing of all steel furnace units causing pollution in capital," The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) to seal all steel furnace and fabrication units in the federal capital which do not conform to the environmental regulations and are causing serious health hazards by creating pollution./A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar ordered Director General Pak-EPA Farzana Altaf Shah to close all such industrial units in I-9 and I-10./The court had taken up a 2007 public petition against pollution caused by the industrial units in I-9 and I-10. The petition was filed by Nazir Ahmed and other residents of the two sectors. On Tuesday, the apex court ordered the advocate general Islamabad to provide force, including police, to Pak-EPA to help ceasing the industrial units causing pollution within two weeks./Advocate general directed to provide needed force, including police, to Pak-EPA to stop functioning of such industrial units in two weeks/During the hearing, the EPA chief told the court that her department had been monitoring industrial units for the last eight years and in response to notices issued by the agency a number of steel furnaces had installed the recommended devices./However, they utilised the devices only when the representatives of EPA carried out surveys or inspections. This was because the functioning of such devices increased their cost, she added./When she informed the court that environment tribunals had overturned the decision of the agency to close down the industrial units, the bench ordered that all industrial units closed on the orders of the apex court would reopened only on the orders of this court./The petitioners claimed that local residents had fallen victim to chronic and life-threatening diseases such as asthma, respiratory infections, allergies and heart ailments due to pollution caused by the industrial units, especially steel furnaces and marble factories./In 1993, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) had developed a negative list of undesirable industrial plants working in the industrial estate. It encouraged them, especially the steel furnaces, to switch to some other trades as they had been offered a waiver of the normal fee. A few units took up the offer and changed their businesses./According to earlier reports, 1,500 tons of effluents generated by the pharmaceutical industry, flour, oil and ghee mills, marble factories and plastic extrusion units were being thrown into Leh Nullah every day, heavily polluting the underground water./Around 500 factories in the I-9 and I-10 industrial estates are causing water and air pollution. Of them, 204 are manufacturing units, including eight steel melting furnaces, 11 rerolling mills, 25 flour mills, five oil and ghee mills, 31 marble cutting and polishing units and 23 metal working and engineering units, GI pipes, soap, chemical, plastic, marble, spices and printing, which either lacked or had inadequate facilities for treatment of waste emissions./An earlier survey conducted by Pak-EPA had also confirmed high levels of hazardous particles in the air which could cause various respiratory diseases. While almost all industrial units were adding to pollution, eight steel melting units were held mainly responsible for doing the greatest damage to environment."
Rs250m fund to execute smog control policy," Chief Secretary Akbar Durrani on Saturday approved creation of a Rs250 million Punjab Environment Fund for, what officials said, implementing recommendations of a commission formed by the Lahore High Court to suggest ways and means to control smog, blanketing Punjab in October to November for the past few years./The fund was approved at a meeting held to review smog control policy and tree plantation campaign in the province here at the Civil Secretariat./The commission had given 17 recommendations under direction by the LHC to control smog badly affecting life in Punjab for the last three years. Later, the Supreme Court of Pakistan too took notice of the problem directing the provincial government to effectively control it./The commission had suggested motivating farmers not to burn rice crop stubble stated to be the major cause of smog and brick kiln owners to install low-cost technology to control release of smoke in the air, close down pollution-causing steel mills especially in Lahore from September to December, strictly disallow burning of solid waste, start massive tree plantation campaigns, disallow tree cutting and create a climate commission to enforce these recommendations./The commission had also asked for trans-boundary dialogue with India to have rice crop stubble burning by Indian Punjab farmers stopped. The burning was stated to be the single largest contributor to the smog./The chief secretary told the meeting that as per directions of the Supreme Court, smog control policy had been posted at the website of EPD. He directed all departments to submit their suggestions regarding the policy within two days./The meeting decided to set a target of planting 30 million saplings in the province in three months during the tree plantation campaign. Top achievers in tree plantation would be awarded prizes at district, division and provincial level, he said./He asked for committees at union council level to stop cutting of trees. He also asked the relevant authorities to launch a community mobilisation and awareness campaign regarding controlling air pollution and benefits of trees."
Trees affected by 'viral disease'," Alstonia scholaris in the cantonment areas, commonly known as devil trees, have contracted what horticulturalists have called a viral disease because of air pollution./The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) has contacted horticulturalists and begun treating the trees, which have been planted in parks and on greenbelts along roads in the area. The treatment process will be completed within a week./Horticulturalist Sohail Ahmed told Dawn that galls had appeared on the leaves of these trees in several areas, and experts believed this was the result of a viral infection./'As Alstonia scholaris are not native to the area, there were chances that they could contract a viral disease,' he said, adding that the trees had been sprayed with bifenthrin after 15 days and their old shoots were cut off./Mr Ahmed said experts believed that such plants were affected by air pollution emitted from vehicles, but added that the disease in plants would not affect humans./He said sheesham trees had also been affected by this disease in the past. Attention will be given to treating the trees, and there is no plan to cut them down, he said."
Contaminated water," THE Naushahro Feroze district has had contaminated water for several years now. Oil companies and government officials began drilling for oil reserves in the area with no regard for the consequences./To establish an underground network of pipes, they used dynamites which caused air pollution and contaminated aquifers with arsenic and other dangerous chemicals. Our population of 1.5 million receives this contaminated water daily./Diarrhoea, skin infections and cardiovascular diseases have been reported in various parts of the city. The issue needs to be addressed immediately."
"'High temperature, water scarcity and air pollution are major challenges'"," Pakistan's first ever Environment Barometer survey cited high temperature, water scarcity and air pollution as top three environmental challenges Pakistan is facing./Regarding provincial government's efforts to address these challenges, 40pc respondents from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) believed that their government took some measures to tackle these challenges, followed by Punjab with 28pc respondents, Sindh with 26pc and Balochistan with 20 pc./The survey was jointly conducted by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and Herald magazine to assess people's perceptions on environmental issues and government's role in environmental sphere./Presenting the findings of the survey, SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qayyum Suleri said the barometer was aimed at assessing people's perceptions about environmental issues./According to the survey, 89pc of the respondents believed that these environmental issues are negatively impacting their health, 74pc said they are affecting their livelihood and 68pc believed that their day to day social life was negatively impacted by the issues./Only 4pc of the respondents were satisfied with their respective provincial governments' measures./Also, voters' response on the environment as a determinant for their vote in the coming election was depressing, where only 13pc respondents prioritise environment as a determinant for casting their vote./As per the survey, 87pc respondents believed that human activities are largely responsible for these environmental issues, 75pc blamed on natural causes and 74pc found population growth as a major factor./Associate Research Fellow at SDPI Dr Shafqat Munir said the Environment Barometer showed the awareness level of the voters on environmental issues seems high, majority of them did not include environmental issues as determinant for voting in the 2018 elections./He said rising awareness may play a key role in future to include environment on the priorities' list of the people while pushing for their demands in terms of allocations in budget and electing representatives./Meanwhile, during an event held on World Brain Day (WBD) at Shifa International Hospital, Consultant Neurologist Prof Dr Arsalan Ahmad said in recent times, the effects of air pollution on our health has attracted increasing interest with international institutions providing growing mortality and morbidity data./The latest estimate of deaths attributable to air pollution worldwide is nine million annually./These deaths are related to cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, neurological events such as stroke, lung diseases and cancer./This year's theme for WBD is 'Clean Air for Healthy Brain'./Long-term exposure to relatively high levels of certain chemicals in workplace air has resulted in nervous system damage over the past century./In addition to air pollution, occupational and residential air pollution and water pollution may also be an emerging issue."
"Rs745m given back to 23,000 medical students: FIA"," The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) informed the Supreme Court on Monday that Rs745 million had been recovered from the private medical colleges which they minted from students in terms of excessive fee and donation against admission./FIA Director Muhammad Usman further informed to a three-judge bench that the recovered amount had been returned to 23,000 students./The bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar was hearing a suo motu case against exorbitant fee structure of private medical colleges.

"Garbage heaps left unattended in RCB, CCB areas during monsoon"," Heaps of garbage have been left on the roads and streets of the Rawalpindi and Chaklala cantonment areas during the monsoon season./Residents have complained that sanitation workers' failure to clear drains of garbage has led to the accumulation of water, while garbage bins are overflowing and heaps of waste have been left along main roads./Disposing of garbage in the open can become a safe haven for disease carriers such as rodents, flies, mosquitoes and other insects; garbage also produces a foul smell while the common practice of burning garbage in the open can lead to air pollution and generate other kinds of garbage./Garbage has been heaped on main roads, back streets and in main squares. On one slip road, from Peshawar Road to Allahabad Road near the Shah Piyara Graveyard, garbage heaps are even causing problems for motorists and pedestrians./Sanitation workers have not emptied the bins on Peshawar Road near Siham for two weeks, while solid waste accumulates in Tench Bhatta, Lal Kurti and Jhanda Chichi./The Rawalpindi and Chakwala cantonment boards only appear to be paying attention to Westridge, Qasim Market, The Mall, Chaklala Scheme III and some upscale localities./Misrial Road resident Asif Ahmed told Dawn sanitation workers were collecting home waste and dumping it in a nullah or on the main road near a small bridge. The garbage collection truck comes in a week, he said./Shahzad Malik, who lives in Jhanda Chichi, said it had become difficult to walk along the main road because of the smell of garbage./He said they had registered complaints but had gone unnoticed./Several people complained that sanitation workers were not visiting their areas, and residents were hiring private sanitation workers to collect solid waste every day./They said the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) had a duty to ensure sanitation workers visit the area and collect garbage./Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) Vice President Raja Irfan Imtiaz said the civic body had recently finished de-silting nullahs and in some areas had dumped garbage on the banks of the drains. Because of the rain, the operation to lift garbage was not completed./He said work to clear the roads and streets of garbage would be finished in a day or two, adding that CCB has been asked to maintain cleanliness./A senior RCB official said main roads such as The Mall, Bank Road, Haider Road, Kashmir Road and Peshawar Road were cleared regularly with road sweeping machines after business hours./He admitted that some areas had been left unattended due to shortage of staff, adding that the rain had created problems in transporting garbage from residential areas to the dumping site but they would be cleaned within two days."
Commission summons millers over unsafe waste disposal," The Supreme Court-mandated judicial commission on water quality and state of sanitation in Sindh issued notices to the owners of some seven mills in Nooriabad, asking them to appear before it on Aug 15 to explain how they could run industry without effluent treatment plants./It also called for action against public health engineering department (PHED) officers for their wilful defiance of the commission's directives issued in February about water supply scheme of Matiari./The commission headed by retired apex court judge Amir Hani Muslim visited a place in Nooriabad called Loyash River in local parlance on Wednesday. He was told that there were 75 industries which were in the production phase while 45 other units were sick and non-functional./A Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) representative told the commission that at least eight mills needed treatment plants and only one has a fully functional one. The notices to be served on industrialists would be served through the Jamshoro senior superintendent of police (SSP). Sepa's deputy director Imran Ali disclosed that septic tanks installed in 67 industries, in all, were not properly functional. The commission has given two weeks' time to 67 industries to make their tanks functional, failing which they would be issued notices for appearance before the commission after receipt of a report from Sepa./Khair Mohammad Kalwar, SITE's managing director (MD), and estate engineer Tariq Aziz Ansari were directed to plant trees of neem, amaltas and gulmohar across roads in SITE. The district forest officer (DFO) of Jamshoro should provide these trees in a week from today, according to rules./The commission noted that the resident engineer had no clue about location of proposed treatment plant. He said that land on which plant had to be installed was yet to be taken possession of. The MD SITE, the commission said, should take steps to ensure that land was identified as no confusion should be created on that score./The deputy director blamed some industries and shared their names which are contributing to air pollution. He said that notices were issued to all the four and fine was imposed by the judicial magistrate concerned, but in vain. The commission issued notices to the owners of those four industries to appear before it on Aug 15 and justify how they could run industries without treating black smoke./During a visit of water supply scheme-I in Matiari, the commission observed that on Feb 14's visit to the said scheme directives were issued, but these were not complied with in letter and spirit. The slow sand plant was not functional as per requirement while ponds had stagnant water. It said that the area remained unclean and debris was still littered across ponds./It observed that there were serious complaints about supply of contaminated water. The Matiari deputy commissioner provided a copy of the report regarding samples collected by him from final source of pump through which water supply is supplied to the town and according to which water sample contains bacteria and is not safe for human consumption./Some residents complained to the commission about Panu minor which is source of collection of the main water scheme. They said that a village, Dato Bhatti, was located near the minor and toilets were built on the banks of this minor. The banks are also encroached upon./The commission directed the Sindh secretary irrigation to depute a senior officer to inspect the place and if it was encroached, encroachment should be removed forthwith to minimise contamination. The DC was told to submit a report regarding contamination of water from the minor and scheme-1 of Matiari within three days./Rehabilitation of the second phase of the scheme has not yet started and as per DC's claim, the public health engineering department has given the estimate of Rs750,000. On account of elections, the matter was deferred and would be completed within two months under monitoring of the DC./The commission expressed displeasure over the conduct of the town officer. He was directed to appear before the commission on Aug 15. During the intervening period, surroundings of water supply scheme-1 should be cleaned by him within two days. This would be certified by Amar Lal, magistrate Saeedabad, or any other magistrate deputed by the sessions judge of Matiari./The commission ordered removal of all illegal connections allowed by the municipality from water supply scheme-1. These directives shall be complied with by chairman and the town officer under vigilance of the DC, who shall appear on Aug 15."
Coal being dumped in open in violation of SC orders," Another case of open dumping of coal has surfaced, this time in the area of Juma Goth in Landhi, in violation of the June 2018 Supreme Court orders, according to which coal would only be stored in warehouses./A recent visit to the site located along the railway tracks in Juma Goth revealed that coal was being dumped in open in the area for the past few months./'Coal is being brought here from PIBT [Pakistan International Bulk Terminal] and then transported to Punjab through trains,' a worker at the site told Dawn./At least three companies were involved in transporting coal here, he added./A thick layer of black dust covered the area with large coal stockpiles as workers handling the consignment without any protective gear unloaded coal from a truck./The residential area was not very far from the site and was directly exposed to hazardous flying coal dust due to winds./A trader dealing in livestock at the nearby Cattle Colony confirmed that the coal dumping activity was going on for a few months./Asked about any complaints registered so far with the local administration, he replied: 'How the illiterate poor living in miserable civic conditions could be bothered by dumping of coal?'/It is important to recall here that the apex court had directed the authorities concerned this year that 'open coal will not be stored anywhere in Karachi and can only be kept in warehouses'./The court further ruled that in case of transportation, proper blankets and moisture must be provided to the coal so that dust should not cause pollution. It directed all ships carrying imported coal not to unload it at Karachi Port Trust but at Port Qasim./Earlier, dumping of coal in the open was spotted in Machhar Colony./Public health in danger/Highlighting the threats poor coal storage and handling posed to public health, Saquib Ejaz Hussain, an expert on air quality, referred to the Forum of International Respiratory Societies based in Switzerland which had linked all major respiratory diseases to exposure to dust, fumes and air pollution./'A 2017 United Nations Children's Fund report found that air pollution is associated with pneumonia, which is responsible for the deaths of 920,000 children under the age of five years ever year.'/Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution, he pointed out, protected the citizens' right to life and the right to live in a clean and healthy environment./'The manner in which coal is being handled, transported and dumped in open all over the city has endangered public health and severely compromised citizens' rights,' he said./He called upon the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) to look into coal handling operations at Port Qasim./'The berths being used for coal handling at PQA also have tanks for palm oil, crude oil and fuel. The establishment of these berths was done in violation [of] the national and provincial environmental laws,' he said./Upon contact, Waqar Hussain Phulpoto representing Sepa stated that the department had taken notice of coal dumping in Juma Goth and had initially served a notice to the transporter./'We have inspected the site on Monday and [are] investigating the case. Information gathered from the site has showed that a large part of the coal is going to Sahiwal for a power plant and the rest to a cement factory,' he said, adding that the illegal activity had been continuing for four months./The department, he pointed out, had taken a number of steps to ensure proper transport and storage of coal in the city and withdrew its no-objection certificate it had accorded to Karachi Port Trust in a case./'In another case pertaining to coal dumping in Machhar Colony, it conducted legal proceedings against the divisional superintendent Railways and the case is currently with the judicial magistrate,' he said."
SC orders steel mills to deposit Rs5m each until they install filters," The Supreme Court has ordered owners of steel mills in I-9 and I-10 to deposit Rs5 million each as security until they install equipment to filter emissions before they are released into the air, the climate change secretary said on Sunday./Secretary Khizar Hayat told Dawn this was the first time 'such a strong action has been taken against these callous and rich industrialists'./He said that in addition to praising the efforts of the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), the SC has reminded owners of the steel industry to abide by environmental laws and the agency's rules./'The SC has also directed owners of steel mills [to submit] reports of emissions released from the chimneys of their establishments. The apex court has warned further legal action in case the Pak-EPA is not satisfied with the reports and feels that emissions are high,' Mr Hayat said./According to him, the Pak-EPA has been drawing the SC's attention towards increasing air pollution, and steel mills' emissions in particular, for nearly three decades./'The environment watchdog has extended maximum cooperation and leniency towards owners of steel mills for the last 20 years. Now, the apex court has finally taken a decision in favour of the residents of I-9, I-10 and I-8, and adjacent Rawalpindi, who have been breathing poisonous air for many years. Bringing the owners of steel mills under the ambit of the law would not have been possible without the intervention of the SC,' Mr Hayat said./According to environmentalists in the climate change ministry, Islamabad owes its high air pollution to steel mills, with are a dominant source of air pollution aside from other factors, such as mega-development projects./Ministry officials said the smoke residents see rising from chimneys is black carbon that contains particulate matter./Inhaling particulate pollution - mixtures of solid and liquid particles that circulate in the air a- can increase risks of lung cancer, cardiac arrest, stroke and emergency room visits for people with asthma and heart problems, as well as a host of other health problems, they said./The officials said black smoke is caused by poor quality scrap used by steel mills and steel furnaces. The scrap includes oil and paint canisters, which is one of the actual sources of black smoke./A senior official said that despite reminders from the Pak-EPA, steel mills and furnaces have continued to operate without switching on their filtering equipment. He said the agency was monitoring air quality around I-9 and I-19, where these mills are located."
LHC seeks notification of commission on air pollution," The Lahore High Court directed on Friday a provincial law officer to submit a notification regarding constitution of an air pollution standing commission, as ordered by the Supreme Court./Justice Ayesha A. Malik was hearing petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Waleed Iqbal and others questioning the failure of the government to implement recommendations of a smog commission established by the high court in 2017./Smog commission chairman Dr Pervez Hassan told the court that the apex court had constituted the air pollution standing commission to implement guidelines prepared by the smog commission./He stated that Punjab had been divided into three zones  green, yellow and red.

"Illegal trade, deforestation hit Pak wildlife hard"," The Living Planet Index (LPI), which tracks trends in global wildlife abundance, indicates that global populations of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles declined, on average, by 60 per cent between 1970 and 2014./Hammad Naqi Khan, director general of the World Wide Fund-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan), citing the Living Planet Report of 2018 by the WWF, says these declining populations are pronounced in South America (89 per cent), Africa (56 per cent) and the Indo-Pacific (64 per cent) region, which includes Pakistan. In addition to these declining trends Pakistan is adversely affected by illegal wildlife trade which has deeply impacted our biodiversity. Smuggling of freshwater turtles and pangolins are a growing concern as well as rising rates of deforestation. Increasing deforestation has contributed to increased threats for species such as the snow and common leopard which is fast losing its habitat. Pakistan is experiencing a steady rise in carbon emissions, which contributes to global issues such as climate change and global warming./The report, released on Tuesday, presents a sobering picture of the impact of human activity on the world's wildlife, forests, oceans, rivers and climate. The report underlines the rapidly closing window for action and the urgent need for the global community to collectively rethink and redefine how we value, protect and restore nature./Living Planet Report-2018/Mr Khan added that Lahore and Karachi are among the 10 most polluted cities in the world in terms of air quality, according to air quality monitor AirVisual. The ranking today puts Lahore at the top of the list, and urgent action needs to be taken to tackle this issue. Air pollution caused by traffic, industries, crop burning and burning of solid waste are major contributors of smog and the layer of smog will thicken in the coming days. The urban air pollution in Pakistan is among the world's most severe, significantly damaging human health, quality of life, economy and the environment. The report highlights that over recent decades, human activity has also severely impacted the habitats and natural resources wildlife and humanity depend on such as oceans, forests, coral reefs, wetlands and mangroves./About the impact of human activity on nature, the Living Planet Report 2018 also focuses on the importance and value of nature to people's health and well-being and that of our societies and economies. Globally, nature provides services worth around $125 trillion a year, while also helping ensure the supply of fresh air, clean water, food, energy, medicines and other products and materials./The report specifically looks at the importance of pollinators which are responsible for $235-577 billion in crop production per year, and how a changing climate, intensive agricultural practices, invasive species and emerging diseases have impacted their abundance, diversity and health./Evidence shows that the two agendas - for the environment and human development - must converge if we are to build a sustainable future for all. The report highlights the opportunity the global community has to protect and restore nature leading up to 2020, a critical year when leaders are expected to review the progress made on the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)./'WWF is calling on people, businesses and governments to mobilize and deliver on a comprehensive framework agreement for nature and people under the CBD, one that galvanizes public and private action to protect and restore global biodiversity and nature and bend the curve on the devastating trends highlighted in the Living Planet Report 2018', reads a press release by the WWF-Pakistan./Living Planet Report 2018 is the twelfth edition of WWF's biennial flagship publication. The report includes the latest findings measured by the Living Planet Index tracking 16,704 populations of 4,005 vertebrate species from 1970 to 2014./The report also gives a comprehensive overview of the state of our natural world, 20 years after the flagship report was first published. Through indicators such as the LPI, provided by the Zoological Society of London, the Species Habitat Index, the IUCN Red List Index and the Biodiversity Intactness Index, as well as Planetary Boundaries and the Ecological Footprint, the report paints a singular disturbing picture: human activity is pushing the planet's natural systems that support life on earth to the edge."
Plea in LHC seeks compensation for damage during TLP protest," A writ petition has been filed in the Lahore High Court seeking compensation for the damage caused to public and private properties during the countrywide protest by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) against release of Aasia Bibi in a blasphemy case./Abdullah Malik of the Civil Society Network arrayed federal and provincial governments as party in his petition. He pleads that protection of people's life and property is a responsibility of the government and a great damage has been done to the public and private property during the TLP protests./He says the government is duty-bound to compensate the losses of the citizens./The petitioner asks the court to order both the federal and provincial governments to determine the losses and pay compensation to the citizens./SMOG: A petition has been filed in the Lahore High Court seeking a direction for the government authorities to take immediate steps to control smog in Punjab./A citizen, Munir Ahmad, contends through his counsel that Lahore is among the 10 most polluted cities in the world in terms of air quality.

This week 50 years ago: Air pollution and delay in winter," THE fog that had enveloped Karachi on the morning of Nov 10, 1968 continued to make Karachiites feel a bit like people from up north for a couple of more days. On Nov 12, it was reported that the hazy atmosphere caused vehicular traffic to move at a snail's pace and the air traffic was disrupted till the fog melted away in the afternoon. Just as experts had predicted, the fog delayed the arrival of winter, and the weather, both at night and in the daytime, was hot. While the climate seemed to make citizens recall the summer of October, it was expected to bring cold winds in its wake within two to three days./It was not the mist that was bothering the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) that week. Rather, on Nov 12, the KMC expressed grave concern over the alarming increase in air pollution caused by smoke-emitting vehicles. It had requested the police department to revitalise its campaign against such cars, buses and motorbikes by giving specific instruction to its traffic staff. The KMC's chairman also wrote to the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) to consider appropriate measures to resolve the issue, including a periodic check-up of public and private vehicles and withdrawing road permits of defective buses and trucks. The corporation offered to the police all possible help in that regard./But poor KMC, it did not have a moment of respite in those days. On Nov 13, the Anti-Corruption Police arrested a KMC building inspector for allegedly accepting a bribe from the owner of a house in Paposhnagar. The inspector was caught red-handed taking Rs500 from Ghulam Murtaza. The trap to nab him was laid under the supervision of a magistrate following a piece of information given by Murtaza that the suspect had asked for illegal money. The police said the inspector had demanded the amount for not demolishing an unauthorised work of construction built by Murtaza./Staying on the subject related to the police, on Nov 16, a foreigner was found dead in his apartment in the commercial area of PECHS. He was identified as Joseph Edward Montgomery (77), a British national. As per info that investigators got from his passport, he was a lecturer and author. He had not been well for quite some time and was twice operated upon for hernia at the Civil Hospital Karachi./The mystery surrounding the death of the British citizen, though, was not as intense as one gets to see in movies. Speaking of movies, eminent producer and director of Pakistan Ehtisham was in Karachi on Nov 17. Film star Nadeem hosted a reception at a restaurant in his honour. Speaking on the occasion, Ehtisham who originally hailed from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) advised film journalists to evaluate the drawbacks of the national film industry and come up with healthy criticism for their removal. 'Without constructive criticism the film industry cannot progress,' he remarked and then dwelt on various problems confronting the East Pakistani filmmakers. 'The present rates for eight-hour indoor shifts for Urdu and Bengali films at the Studio of Dacca are the highest in the country,' Ehtisham said, adding that such handicaps were compelling certain producers of Bengali films to shift to Lahore because the Punjab capital was comparatively more 'economical'./Wow! How times change. Today, Lahore is no longer the filmmaking centre of the country. Or is it?"
"Air 10 times more polluted than permitted level, Senate body told"," Environmentalists told a Senate body on Thursday that the air is 10 times more polluted than the permitted level in all major cities throughout the year./'We are suffering from air pollution beyond the legal limit every day, throughout the year,' environmental lawyer, Rafay Alam told the Senate Climate Change Caucus./Showing them satellite images of the dust cloud blanketing the whole country, graphs and pictures of healthy and sick lungs, Mr Alam urged the Senate body to revisit and fix Pakistan's energy policy, to promote green practices in the industry and plan urban development./MPs urged to revisit, fix Pakistan's energy policy, promote green practices, plan urban development./The Climate Change Caucus was formed by PPP Senator Sherry Rehman to build literacy among policy makers on issues of public importance such as the deteriorating environment in the country./Mr Alam gave the example of Lahore, one of the most polluted cities in the world due to emissions from cars, construction dust and pollution from coal fired plants. Crop burning around Lahore is not the only cause of smog./Mr Alam compared air pollution in Lahore with that in Delhi, India where cancer due to breathing polluted air is as common as cancer in smokers./He said the air pollution in Lahore mixes with the fog in winters to make smog which leads to numerous health issues./'Air pollution is causing stunted growth in children and people with mental disabilities,' the environmental lawyer said./The meeting was told that no one took notice of the smog when it first happened in Nov 2016./The following year, the high court took notice fearing the smog could potentially become an annual event./'When environmental watchdogs in Lahore identify pollution levels as moderate actually hazardous under international standards,' Mr Alam said, adding that misleading citizens is criminal./He used images from the Nasa, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to show hot spots in Punjab created by coal powered plants and nitrogen dioxide, one of the constituents of green house gases, spreading towards Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar./Mr Alam gave the example of China where politicians are shown hard scientific facts./'The change came when political decisions were made,' he said./Alternate energy sources, desulphurization of coal power plants, controlling vehicular and industrial emissions and engaging the private sector to declare war on air pollution were some of the effective measures taken by China, he explained./'The problem of air pollution will not solved by merely planting trees,' the expert explained./The presentation seemed to have some effect on the parliamentarians who suggested that air quality measuring devices be installed in all provinces to understand the extent of air pollution across the country./Senator Sherry Rehman said that the committee of the whole should also be informed of the problem of increasing air pollution in the country and recommended measures to be taken to spread awareness of the issue."
Efficient management of asthma and pulmonary disease stressed," The Pakistan Chest Society pulmonologists on Thursday urged efficient management of asthma and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the changing weather conditions./They said changes in weather had triggered asthma and COPD and the situation could be controlled through awareness campaigns, effective management and long-term treatment. They further said the asthma patients and COPD should ensure compliance and adherence to prescribed medication./The Pakistan Chest Society on Thursday organised a briefing to launch awareness campaign about asthma and COPD disease at a local hotel. Society president Prof Khalid Waheed, Jinnah Hospital HOD Pulmonology Prof Ashraf Jamal and others attended the media briefing./They said asthma and COPD were most common respiratory diseases in Pakistan and they were posing a serious challenge. They said that according to the World Health Orgnisation estimates, 235m people suffered from asthma worldwide while COPD was affecting 210m people./'As many as 6.9m people were suffering from COPD in Pakistan and COPD was currently the leading cause of death in the world and if it was not controlled it could become fourth leading cause of death till 2030. More than 3m people died of COPD during last year,' they said./Globally, the COPD burden has been projected to increase in the coming decades because of continued exposure to the COPD risk factors and aging of the population./The experts said: 'Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation'./Whereas, 'The COPD is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs,' they added./The doctors said there was a difference between causes of asthma and the COPD. 'The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways. On the other hand, smoking is the biggest cause of the COPD,' they said and added smoking could lead to several respiratory and chronic diseases and tobacco use should completely end./They said allergens that triggered asthma included house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander and outdoor allergens included pollens and molds, tobacco smoke, chemical irritants in the workplace, urbanisation and air pollution. The doctors suggested that appropriate management could control the disease and could also enable the people to enjoy good quality of life. They urged patients on compliance of controller medication and relievers for best outcomes."
Air pollution termed greatest environmental threat to health," Describing air pollution as the world's single biggest environmental health risk, experts at a three-day international conference, which concluded at Karachi University (KU) on Sunday, called for collaborative research efforts to determine the impact of specific sources of air pollution on human health./They were speaking at the fifth international conference on 'Environmental horizon, sounding the alarm! Environment, climate change and health' organised by KU's department of chemistry and Office of Research Innovation and Commercialisation (ORIC), and International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS)./Sharing global concerns on air pollution, Dr Haider A. Khwaja from Wadsworth Centre at the School of Public Health of University at Albany in New York, said that air pollution was a serious public health issue the world over as population-based studies had documented health risks resulting from short-term exposure to air pollutants./'The World Health Organisation reports that in 2012 around seven million people died one in eight of total global deaths due to exposure to air pollution. This data confirms that air pollution is now the world's largest single environmental health risk,' he noted./He said that the South Asian and Western Pacific regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012 with 2.6m deaths linked to outdoor air pollution and 3.3m deaths related to indoor pollution, according to WHO./A significant number of these deaths, he said, occurred due to stroke and cardiopulmonary diseases. These findings were not based on a significant increase in pollution but rather on improved knowledge of the links between air pollutants and cardiopulmonary diseases./Dr James J. Schauer, a senior civil and environmental engineer heading the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the association of atmospheric particulate matter particles with adverse health effects had been well established and led experts to develop standards on these pollutants and implement control measures./According to him, different strategies can be used in air pollution control programmes to reduce the impact of particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, given the complex nature of the sources of these pollutants./He emphasised the need for collaborative efforts between atmospheric science studies and epidemiological and toxicological studies to establish how specific sources of air pollution were affecting human health./Sheryl H. Ehrman from Davidson College of Engineering, San Jose State University, USA, informed the audience that anthropogenic pollutants had been successfully reduced in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, resulting in improved air quality./However, she said that parts of the mid-Atlantic were still non-attainment regions (areas which are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards as defined in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 of the United States)./The ozone, she pointed out, was a secondary air pollutant, formed by reactions between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Ozone precursors were mainly emitted by power plants, motor vehicles, industrial operations and biogenic sources./'In the past several years, a new influx of emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing-based production of natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (the largest gas field in the US) may be counteracting the benefits that have been gained. On the flip side, low-cost natural gas could replace coal as fuel for power plants, potentially reducing emissions,' she observed./Another speaker, Parisa A. Ariya of the department of chemistry and department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, shared that the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and WHO had identified airborne particles as a research priority of the utmost importance./She said the IPCC pointed to the importance of aerosol-cloud processes due to their impacts on the absorption and scattering of irradiation, altering the earth's climate whereas WHO predominantly considered aerosols to be health hazards./Former federal minister for science and technology Atta-ur-Rahman spoke about how progress in science and technology had dramatically changed socio-economic conditions in different countries./Director ICCBS Prof M. Iqbal Choudhary said biodiversity was a manifestation of chemical diversity and plants contained a fascinating array of highly evolved, specific and effective gene products."
"Oral cancer in men, breast cancer in women most common in country, moot told"," Experts on Sunday identified oral cancer in men and breast cancer in women as commonest cancers in Pakistan and their incidence was alarmingly on the rise./They said oral cancer was caused mainly by paan, gutka, betel nuts and tobacco./'Almost 30 to 50 per cent of cancers can be cured if treated at early stages for which timely diagnosis is crucial,' said an expert at a seminar marking the World Cancer Day./With a three year global theme 'IAmAndIWill' announced by the Union of International Cancer Control world cancer day was begin celebrated across the globe on Monday (today) urging all communities and stakeholders to make personal commitment towards its prevention and bringing down the numbers./The awareness seminar was organised with the support of National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Child Aid Association (CAA), Mohammadi Blood Bank, Consumer Rights Protection Council of Pakistan (CRPC) and at the NICH auditorium./Prof Nizamul Hasan, Prof Rufina Soomro, Dr Mohammad Ali Memon of the Sindh Healthcare Commission, Dr Suleman Otho, Pakistan Medical Association secretary general Dr Qaiser Sajjad, Dr Asghar H Asghar, Shakil Baig, Tariq Shafi and Akhtar Rind spoke on the occasion./Prof Nizamul Hasan said a cancer awareness programme had been launched in schools in which it was worried to see very young kids were using betel nuts and other addictive stuff./'Around two per cent of children are suffering from cancer in Pakistan, however it can be well managed and treated successfully. Majority of cancer related deaths occurred not because of cancer but infections. Smoke, air pollution and other diseases can also cause cancer,' he added./Dr Mohammad Ali Memon said around 70pc of cancers were caused by infections reminding that how hygiene was important./'More than 60pc cancer cases are caused by HIV and hepatitis. We have 13 million hepatitis patients in the country. Paan, betel nut and tobacco are major causes of cancer in our country.'/He said that more than 30pc of cases could be prevented with the help of modifiable risk factors including lifestyle, diet and physical activity./The preventable cancers included breast, liver, skin, cervical, lungs, colorectal and oral cancers./Quoting the World Health Organization, speakers said 18 to 21 million new cases of cancers were reported worldwide every year while more than 9.5m patients died of the disease./Dr Suleman Otho highlighted importance of healthy lifestyle and advised that everyone should work for eight hours and take rest for as much time to keep oneself mentally fit./Dr Qaiser Sajjad showed pictures of patients suffering from cancer and urged public to immediately stop use of tobacco in any form./'Oral cancer is leading cancer in men which is mainly caused by paan, betel nut and gutka. People are afraid to undergo biopsy although it can confirm diagnosis. Cancer is not spread by biopsy. People should get it if advised by qualified doctors,' he added./He said that over 40pc of men and 30pc of women were using betel nuts in any form in Pakistan and asked the government to impose a complete ban on import of betel nuts./'Its sale should immediately be stopped within and outside schools.'/Experts said heart attack and cancer were two major causes of death in the world, adding, cancers could be prevented by taking all necessary measures."
Pall of toxic air hangs over Karachi," Seeing all these people, including small children, wearing masks to protect themselves from pollution as they commute or run errands in the city as if it is the most normal thing to do one is reminded of those dystopian science fiction movies where they show the Earth becoming so polluted that people have stopped going out at all. If they do they have to carry oxygen cylinders with them because the air is simply unbreathable./'Fog' is a word used not as much as 'smog' these days. Yes, we are surrounded by a tornado of toxic air comprising smoke and dust, not to mention stench, forcing us to cover our noses and mouth with these masks which are also easily available now with every other roadside vendor, and not just with the chemists. Burning garbage, carbon emissions and so much dust in the air can really destroy our health./The handkerchief also comes in handy to filter the air you breathe. / Photos by Fahim Siddiqi / White Star/Just about every other vehicle on the road is seen giving out so much smoke. Such vehicles are unfit to be on the road and yet they are there happily adding to the air pollution. And with so few plants and trees to absorb the pollutants such as carbon dioxide from the air to then turn it into oxygen, we are heading towards disaster./When we can't handle the piling garbage due to there not being a proper garbage disposal system in place, we simply put a match to it. The fumes from burning waste carry dioxins, which are colourless and not visible to the eye. But health experts say that these dioxins deposit in the glands and are even passed on to the coming generations causing lung and heart diseases and cancers to spread within families./Those most affected by air pollution. / Photos by Fahim Siddiqi / White Star/The dust that you see everywhere is not just due to the dry winds in the city. It is also because of so much construction taking place here. And with the construction there is also the recent demolition which also cannot be ignored. There is rubble still lying by roadsides where the anti-encroachment drives took place. Many people are allergic to dust. Coughing with the eyes watering is a common symptom of dust inhalation. It can also get worse if it leads to asthma. Dust particles can cause the walls of our air tubes to move mucus into the throat while making the air passage narrower for air to pass. These days even children develop asthma. Serious breathing-related problems can also lead to cardiovascular ailments./Vehicles giving out too much smoke are unfit for the roads. / Photos by Fahim Siddiqi / White Star/The masks came later. First women used to cover their nose and mouth to filter the air they were breathing with their chador or dupatta as the men used handkerchiefs. Some people would get disposable surgical masks from chemists. But since 'necessity is the mother of invention' you have the masks at the vendors now. They are cheap, about Rs20 to Rs50 each, and they are washable and thus reusable. There are some available in mesh and some in plain cotton cloth in many colours and designs including camouflage print. So one can buy several to go with their various outfits./Masks to protect from pollution in a variety of materials and designs. / Photos by Fahim Siddiqi / White Star/Those who wear these say prevention is better than cure but they should also understand that 'prevention' includes controlling the pollutants too by planting more trees, regularly servicing cars, not littering etc."
Illegal dumping of coal spreads to parts of Malir district," A number of companies importing coal through the Pakistan International Bulk Terminal (PIBT) in the Port Qasim area are dumping their hazardous consignments in different parts of Malir district, violating environmental laws and endangering public health, it emerged on Saturday./Sources said that coal was being dumped in the open as well as within areas surrounded by boundary walls in Landhi, Bhains Colony, Razzaqabad and near Rehri Goth./'While most people living nearby wouldn't have any idea how coal could impact them, they would confirm to you that coal dumps along this railway line now cover a larger area,' said Bilal Ahmed, a livestock trader and resident of Bhains Colony where coal was being dumped at three sites./The specific location he was talking about was located along the railway tracks in Juma Goth in Landhi where illegal dumping of coal had been going on for almost a year./A recent visit to this place, which last year had only one coal dumping site, showed that coal was now being dumped at two locations along the railway tracks within a distance of one kilometre./Workers were found handling coal without any safety gear in an environment heavily laden with coal dust. The coal, they said, would be transported to Punjab by the cargo trains which had arrived at the site a few hours before./Companies not dumping coal in designated sites to cut costs/Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) official said that the department had identified places in Bhains Colony, Razzaqabad and Railway Colony where coal was being dumped illegally./'But we are waiting for a detailed report before taking up the cases,' he said in reply to a question, adding that Sepa had not given permission to anyone for setting up a coal storage facility in Malir./SC order/The Supreme Court had directed the authorities concerned last year that 'open coal will not be stored anywhere in Karachi and can only be kept in warehouses'./The SC further ruled that in case of transportation, proper blankets and moisture must be provided to the coal so that dust should not cause pollution. It directed all ships carrying imported coal not to unload it at Karachi Port Trust but at Port Qasim./Health hazards/Impacts of unsafe handling and burning of coal on health and environment are well documented./Recent studies have showed that coal stockpiles emit fine particulate pollution in several ways. First, wind blowing over uncovered coal piles results in fugitive coal dust emissions that are a source of PM2.5 (particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers in diameter are so small that they can get into the lungs, potentially causing serious health problems)./Second, coal stockpiles emit volatile gases that can also lead to the formation of PM2.5 and when coal is delivered to a power plant, it goes through a lot of handling, including unloading, separating 'light dust' from the coal and crushing the coal to make it suitable for burning. These processes all generate fine particulates./Experts have linked exposure to fine particulate pollution to increased deaths and ailments caused by cardiovascular diseases and respiratory infections./A 2017 United Nations Children's Fund report found that air pollution is associated with pneumonia, which is responsible for the death of 920,000 children under the age of five years ever year./Coal is being offloaded from a truck at a location in Landhi. White Star/Sepa's stance/When contacted, Naeem Mughal, the director general of Sepa, said that he was looking into the matter seriously after he recently took over the department's charge./'The Supreme Court barred the Karachi Port Trust last year from offloading coal at its facility as it lacked proper storage for keeping such consignments safe. It was decided that coal would be imported using a dedicated facility at the PIBT,' he said./Referring to the data the department has collected so far, he said that right now 22 companies were importing coal from countries such as Indonesia and South Africa./'The PIBT has a limited coal storage facility for 15 days only, for which they charge. Now, what's happening [is] that these companies dump coal outside the PIBT to avoid costs as well as to store their consignment till they are ready for its transportation,' he said./In addition, he said, companies were saving money by importing coal in excess quantities. 'We are pursuing it and would take action against the Port Qasim Authority, which has given licence to the PIBT, and also those running this terminal as they are allowing companies lacking storage facility to import coal.'/A Sepa team, he said, had planned a detailed visit to the PIBT next week to meet stakeholders, including industrialists, having any reservations over coal storage, handling and transportation in the Port Qasim area./'Besides, we have written letters to the relevant police officials and local administration to take action against illegal dumping of coal in their areas,' he said."
Clean air revisited," EXACTLY two years ago, this week, I wrote my first op-ed for Dawn: 'Choosing to breathe clean air'. I wrote it because people refused to believe we had an air quality problem in Pakistan. After spending much of this December and January in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, I feel it is time to take stock of what has happened in these two years./The first sign is positive. We actually know what the quality of the air is in these three cities. Just type Airvisual in your mobile phone or computer and download the app; it's free. The data it shows every single minute is real-time data, crowdsourced from many different low-cost air quality monitors owned by citizens, in those cities. The Punjab Environmental Protection Department (EPD) also monitors air quality, in particular PM2.5 (remember, that is the pollutant that causes all the negative health effects), and often shows the results on its website./The second sign is also positive. A lot of different people are talking about air quality. The Federal Minister for Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam has tweeted about the many measures being taken by the Punjab EPD this winter to address air quality. The Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI)'s Abid Omar has been active on social media for some time now, and has also been raising awareness in schools. The Pakistan Business Council organised a webinar on 'Air Quality, Health and Industry' in January. Karachi University and the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences held a workshop in January where air quality and related health effects were front and centre. Virtually every day in December and January, one of the newspapers included a piece on air quality./We need air quality labs in our universities./So, how is our air quality? We now know that Karachi's air quality on most days in December and January was unhealthy, meaning worse than, or comparable to, Beijing. Islamabad's was also unhealthy on many days. Lahore's air quality was downright hazardous virtually every day. On Jan 2 at 2 pm, Lahore was number one among all the cities in the world, with an average AQI reading of around 600, with Delhi coming second, with an AQI of 245. It's nice to be number one, but not for reducing life expectancy of your citizens. The doctors in Karachi certainly were also talking about air quality and prescribing medicine for the coughs, wheezing, bronchitis and pneumonias (the obvious symptoms, since we still are not adequately linking strokes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases to air quality)./So now comes the real test. What are we doing about it? Let's take a look at the measures the Punjab EPD is taking to address air quality. First on the list was the number of trees planted. This is wonderful and important, but has only a tiny effect in reducing PM2.5. Other measures, such as sealing smoke-emitting brick kilns and units, and pulling smoke-emitting vehicles off the road, however, should help to reduce PM2.5. But whether it will be enough to change air quality at a city level is something we just do not know./Recently, Prime Minister Imran Khan banned the import of fuel oil (which has tended to be very high in sulphur content in the past, and therefore is typically a major source of PM2.5) and also asked the refineries to improve the quality of this fuel oil. That could have a major positive impact. But we do not know whether it will be enough to bring the air quality to healthy levels, or other measures will also be needed./It is therefore time to turn to the scientists for help. We need air quality labs in our universities. What is an air quality lab? In my mind, these are research labs in which chemists, environmental scientists, and computer scientists work together to figure out what are the major sources of pollution in our cities in different seasons (each city is different in each season, since air quality is a function of emissions and weather, including wind patterns, humidity, rain and temperature). This can be done through conducting PM2.5 source apportionment tests and preparing emissions inventories to determine the main sources of pollution. Computer models, which simulate the pollution sources, and also take into account meteorological effects, can then be developed to 'try' out policy measures and see the effect on air quality. This information will help decision-makers to take evidence-based actions./Once we know what the solutions are that will truly improve our air quality, the results must also be made public. Even though the responsibility for action to address air pollution lies legally at the provincial level, and there are many actions on which they will need to take the lead, ultimately everyone will have to play a role to address the problem. The federal government has a responsibility to maintain oversight and to ensure there is action to tackle a problem that affects all citizens. There may also be measures that need federal level policy action, such as this one on fuel quality. Citizens will also have to contribute to solutions by changing their behaviour. For example, if the problem is due to transportation, effective measures could range from not letting engines idle, to reducing number of trips, to using more efficient and less-polluting vehicles./I am very proud of Pakistan's resilience, the determination of its youth, and its desire to make sure our children have a better future. Getting to clean air is an opportunity to work together (government at all levels, academia, industry and citizens) to make a difference. We have already taken the first two steps, namely air monitoring and greater awareness of the challenge. The next steps involve setting up air quality labs, and then taking evidence-based actions. We will know next winter (when air quality levels are typically at their worst in Pakistan), if we are succeeding or not. Those air quality monitors will tell us. And, if for some reason they are not working, the doctors, and mothers, will definitely know."
Garbage disposal," IN most parts of the world, we do one of two things with garbage burn it or bury it. Neither option is good for the environment. Burning releases dangerous gases and dust (particulate matter) which contribute to global warming and pollute lakes, forests, oceans and cities half a world away./Burying garbage causes both air and water pollution. Transporting it to landfill sites consumes fossil fuels. This creates more pollution and other problems./One outcome of overflowing garbage is air pollution, which causes respiratory diseases and other adverse health effects as contaminants are absorbed from lungs into other parts of the body./The best solution for a Third World country like Pakistan is resource recovery, which is reducing, reusing and recycling waste. This practice will reduce the amount of waste for disposal, save space in landfills and conserve natural resources. The developed world is doing this and so should we."
Concern over rise in cancer cases in Karak," A daylong seminar was held in Khushal Khan Khattak University Karak in collaboration with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission on Tuesday to create awareness about the causes of cancer./Addressing the seminar, director Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicines (IRNUM), Peshawar, Dr Abdur Rauf Khattak said the major causes of cancer were air pollution created by industries, viruses, bacteria and radiations./He said the number of cancer patients was on the on rise in Karak, adding smoking was the major cause of lung cancer and likewise, snuff caused oral cancer./He said non-sterilisation of equipment used in different surgical operations in hospitals was also causing hepatitis which later turned into a cancer./The IRNUM director said the government was providing cancer treatment facility on subsidised rates to the poor segments of society./On the occasion, Dr Mohammad Rauf, director of Bannu Institute of Nuclear Medicines Oncology and Radiotherapy, said different treatment facilities of cancer were available in the hospital, where people of southern districts could get treatment at low cost./Dr Hussain Majid, PAEC director general safety, apprised the participants about the safety measures in exploration of the radioactive substances. There was no danger of radiation from the local uranium extraction in Karak, he explained./PAEC spokesperson Shahid Riaz Khan highlighted the efforts of the commission for creating awareness among the people regarding the causes of cancer./District naib nazim Sajjad Barakwal on the occasion stressed the need for creating mutual understanding among relevant organisations to stop the spread of deadly disease in Karak./SECURITY BEEFED UP: The police have tightened the security of different government buildings and installations of the oil and gas exploration companies to avoid any toward incident./According to police sources, district police officer Nausher Khan Mohmand has directed the subordinate officers to provide security to the educational institutions, courts and sensitive places./He also appealed to the people to inform the police in case they spotted an suspected person or activity taking place in their areas."
Parliamentarians deliberate on their role in meeting clean air challenge," Two to three Pakistani cities regularly rank among the top 20 most polluted in the world, a gathering of parliamentarians was told at the National Assembly Secretariat on Tuesday./MNAs and senators were attending a meeting organised by Air Quality Asia, where they deliberated over parliament's role in meeting the clean air challenge and organisers cautioned parliamentarians of the consequences of failing to mitigate the impact of climate change./MPs were told that air pollution is the greatest health concern today, killing more people that Aids, malaria and tuberculosis combined./Two to three Pakistani cities regularly among 20 most polluted cities in the world, MNAs and senators told/'The annual cost of health in Pakistan caused by deteriorating air quality is 6pc of the GDP,' Air Quality Asia President Shazia Rafi said./Parliamentarians were told that countries such as the United States and China have reduced air pollution to safe levels by introducing monitoring systems, selling deadlines to accomplish targets and by improving public and private transport systems./However, investment in 'dirty' or fossil fuels is still higher than investment in renewable energy./National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser assured his government's support for bringing emissions down to safe limits, giving examples of massive plantation campaigns to combat air pollution./'Pakistan must fulfil its international commitment to completely eliminate air pollution to levels where airborne disease will be a thing of the past,' Mr Qaiser said./He emphasised that equally if not more important than planting saplings in forest areas was to increase green cover in cities and towns, which turned into furnaces during the summer due to less vegetation./Senator Sherry Rehman, who chairs the Climate Change Caucus,/said Pakistan is a victim of climate injustice even though its carbon footprint is the bare minimum./'There are parts of the country that are becoming unliveable. We were appalled to learn when schools had to close down in Lahore due to extensive air pollution and children could not attend classes,' she added./She said: 'We are gathered here today to amplify that if we do not take measures now, the country will become uninhabitable like they show in post-apocalyptic movies.'/Describing the poor air quality in Pakistan as a crisis, Senator Rehman said the complex issue needs to be addressed, which would require costly interrelated action and better information, such as data sharing from provinces./The convenor of the Sustainable Development Goals Taskforce, MNA Riaz Fatyana, argued that while the rest of the world is phasing out old technologies, Pakistan is adopting them./'China is phasing out coal-powered plants while Pakistan is installing them. We can feel the rise in temperature in Sahiwal, where a coal-powered plant was installed. Similarly, while many countries are discouraging eucalyptus Pakistan is planting them,' he said./Mr Fatyana said legislation is needed to ensure efforts to mitigate the impact of global warming, followed by strict implementation of the law./MNA Naveed Qamar said clean air is crucial to the future of Pakistan and its next generation./The issue of climate change has long been neglected, he said, including in parliament./'Now we have to take charge to grapple with this issue and its many dimensions. Health of the population in general and children are directly affected by the increasing air pollution,' he said./He added in a hopeful tone that countries have achieved clean air, and Pakistan can as well./Ministry of Climate Change Additional Secretary Babar Hayat Tarar recounted for the gathering the steps taken by the government to tackle deteriorating air quality./These included sealing factories predominantly steel mills, introducing environmentally friendly technology in brick kilns, tree plantations, banning plastics in the ministry which will be duplicated in the Prime Minister House, government departments and the capital."
"Pakistan only behind China, India in air pollution deaths: study"," Pakistan is the second on a list of 10 countries with the highest mortality rate due to air pollution, while India ties with China for the first place, says a report released on Wednesday./A total of 2.4 million people (1.2m each) died of air pollution in China and India in 2017, when a survey was conducted./India, however, was ahead of China in the percentage of population exposed to household air pollution. In India 60 per cent people were exposed to household air pollution, 32 per cent in China, 79 per cent in Bangladesh and 52 per cent in Pakistan./Polluted air cited as the fifth leading cause of early death worldwide/In Pakistan 128,000 deaths were attributed to air pollution, 124,000 in Indonesia, 123,000 in Bangladesh, 114,000 in Nigeria, 108,000 in the United States, 99,000 in Russia, 66,000 in Brazil, and 64,000 in the Philippines./The report 'State of Global Air' by the US-based Health Effects Institute and the University of British Columbia identifies air pollution as the fifth leading cause of early death worldwide, responsible for more deaths than malaria, road accidents, malnutrition or alcoholism. Only dietary risks, high blood pressure, tobacco and high fasting-plasma glucose are more injurious than air pollution./The World Health Organisation's Air Quality Guideline sets 2.5 pollutants per micrometre (PM) as the upper limit for humans. PM2.5 pollution contributed to nearly 3m early deaths in 2017./More than half of this disease's burden fell on people living in China and India./Exposure to PM2.5 was found to be the third leading risk factor globally for type 2 diabetes deaths, after high blood sugar and excessive body weight./The study includes hypothetical increases in life expectancy among the 11 most populous countries if PM2.5 concentrations were limited to the WHO Air Quality Guideline. Bangladesh would have the highest expected gain of nearly 1.3 years, followed by India, Nigeria and Pakistan with gains of about one year of life expectancy./The percentages of population living in areas above the guideline ranged from 92 per cent in Russia to 100 per cent in China, India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Bangladesh./Children in South Asia would have their lives cut short by 30 months because of a combination of outdoor air pollution and dirty indoor air./A study last October from the WHO found that exposure to toxic air both indoors and out kills some 600,000 children under the age of 15 each year. It found that children are often more vulnerable to the impact of air pollution since they breath more rapidly than adults, and thus absorb more pollutants at a time when their brains and bodies are still developing."
Minister writes to PM's adviser seeking assessment of Islamabad's air quality," The minister for national health services (NHS) has written to the prime minister's adviser on climate change seeking help with an assessment of Islamabad's air quality so necessary measures can be taken to protect the health of residents of the city./NHS Minister Aamer Mehmood Kiani said in a letter to climate change adviser Malik Amin Aslam that 'declining quality of air is the biggest environmental issue in Islamabad.'/'Particulate matter in smoke causes respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the country. Urban air pollution in terms of particulate matter is estimated to cause around 22,000 premature deaths among adults and 700 deaths among young children annually. Indoor air pollution causes the deaths of more than 30,000 children per year across the country,' he added./Says deteriorating air quality has significant impact on human health/Mr Kiani said global climate change and the deteriorating quality of urban air have a significant impact on human health. He said health effects caused by air pollution can include difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, asthma and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. The effects of poor air quality on human health are far-reaching but principally affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, he wrote./Speaking to Dawn, he said international surveys have continuously shown that environmental pollution is rising across the country./'We want to make Islamabad a model city, so other cities and provinces follow it. Apart from that we have decided to facilitate residents of the federal capital to remain healthy. We will also give them awareness so that they also play a role in keeping the city pollution-free,' he said./In response to a question, Mr Kiani said some companies are being involved to hire physical exercise trainers as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity, who will deputed in parks and walking tracks where they will assist people with exercise and inform them of how to remain healthy and avoid cardiovascular disease./He said that four decades ago there were just a few slums in the capital, which have now increased significantly./'Once the population of the federal capital was 400,000, but now it has reached to 2.2 million. One should understand that pollution increases with the increase in population. So there is need to take steps to reduce environmental pollution,' he said./He said by next year 'every deserving resident of the federal capital' will receive health cards so they can avail healthcare facilities./According to the letter, a rapid assessment of particulate matter may be measured in various locations in the high industrial zones of I-9 and I-10 to address the situation./Particulate matter in industries will be measured using Environmental Particulate Air Monitor-5000 (EPAM-5000), which is available with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)./The letter added: 'EPAM-5000 is portable instrument best for measuring the indoor environmental and ambient air monitoring. We don't have any available funding to cover the expenses [or to hire] the staff and this instrument from EPA. However, your kind support for this assessment project is required to help us in measurement of this PM level in different areas of Islamabad.'/The minister said in the letter that he wished to inform the prime minister of the health effects of industrial pollution in Islamabad and asked the adviser on climate change to 'direct the EPA to extend their full support to the investigators the Health Services Academy, Islamabad.'"
A long-term forest policy," RAPID climate change and high air-pollution levels require urgent investment in afforestation programmes in Pakistan. Deforestation is a major cause of erosion of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Forests have direct and indirect linkages with nutrition and food security via wild tree fruits and fuel wood, making them an important instrument in achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)./The current government has initiated the '10 Billion Tree Tsunami', which aims at rapid afforestation in all Pakistan's provinces. Although it is a much-needed programme, there are concerns regarding the sustainability and long-term viability of such initiatives. This is important given that other political parties do not have a great record of preserving the environment./The BTT needs to morph into a long-term, institutionalised forest policy that can provide maximum environmental and economic benefits in line with the SDGs. In the absence of such a policy, any change in the government setup can potentially impede the progress achieved so far towards restoring our forest areas. Three aspects are particularly crucial./Forest conservation should feature prominently in our scientific and political discourse./Firstly, afforestation needs to be viewed by the Pakistani voter as any other development infrastructure with clear personal and societal benefits. This can happen when an increased emphasis on urban afforestation leads to mitigation of public health crises caused by urban heat effect and air pollution. A clear improvement in air quality and reduction in pollution-induced health issues are bound to get votes in major Punjab cities, which regularly rank high on the pollution scale. This can bring environment to the centre of the political discourse. The present government should link its urban afforestation initiatives to urban air quality in order to enhance citizens' involvement in sustaining green urban infrastructures./Urban afforestation should be complemented by strict environmental regulations on vehicle emissions and sustainability regulations for homes, buildings and offices. Clear emission reduction and afforestation targets for each district and incentives for achieving those targets can bring about transparency and efficiency./The added advantage of pursuing green urbanisation is that its positive impact on society is measureable through geospatial imaging and air quality indices, as well as marketable for political parties interested in urban vote banks. Improving air quality in urban centres will result in a better quality of life, lower the incidence of disease and decrease the burden on an already overtaxed healthcare system./Secondly, an optimal forest rotation policy that ensures economic viability of forests needs to be installed, ie we need to grow, harvest and manage forests in a way that maximises their economic benefits, reduces imports of forest products and helps us leapfrog towards a sustainable bio-economy where local forests can provide wood, biofuels, bioplastics and recyclable packaging materials without increasing deforestation rates./Monitoring our forests to prevent harvesting without a licence will contribute to this economic viability and rotation of forests. The PTI government has been effective in monitoring KP's forests and should replicate its performance across the country./Lastly, stronger land tenure and private incentives in the form of payment for ecosystem services for landowners need to be set up to increase conservation, forest cover, and long-term sustainability, ie private landowners should be compensated for the environmental services their forests provide. The methodology for valuation of such services in different regional contexts has been carefully studied and is readily available. Such an initiative will incentivise individual landowners to protect forest cover on their land, which means the government will not be entirely dependent on community or forest-level monitoring./Further, the adoption of such incentives can optimise land use over time, ie high-productivity agricultural land will continue to yield high-value crops and low-productivity land would be turned into forest cover. There are several examples of successful implementation of such initiatives. In 2000, China launched its 'Sloped Land Conversion Programme' which paid farmers to convert cropland on hillsides with high risk of soil erosion into forest; this led to a whopping 18 per cent (1.2pc annually) increase in forest area in China./Similarly, the Municípios Prioritários programme in Brazil led to historic reductions in deforestation rates in the Amazon. The programme incentivised farmers to divert investment from clearing new land for agriculture to capital investments in farming; this led to an increase in agricultural productivity, suggesting that afforestation of agricultural land does not necessarily result in food-security concerns. Additionally, these programmes have also been shown to alleviate poverty by making the provision of ecosystem services economically desirable for low-income landowners./To design and implement a long-term forest programme, forests and biodiversity conservation should feature prominently in our scientific and political discourse. The implementation of such programmes can be challenging. In some cases, a less-than-ideal implementation of such programmes led to an increase in forest cover at the expense of high-productivity agricultural land, which can result in reductions in the growth of agricultural production./There can also be issues of financing for a country like Pakistan that is struggling to increase its tax base and decrease expenditures. However, these programmes have generally been successful at increasing forest cover, reducing carbon emissions and increasing biodiversity, leading to an overall positive impact on societal welfare. Given the urgency of the situation, finding fiscal and political space for a sustainable and profitable forest policy should be on top of the development agenda for Pakistan if we want to tackle climate change and pollution."
"Dust affects population, orchards along Swat Expressway"," The residents of the areas along the under-construction Swat Expressway have said that the dust caused by long vehicles and heavy machinery is increasing air pollution, which is harmful for local population as well as nearby orchards of peach./They demanded of the construction companies to sprinkle water on the road for two to three times daily to save the local people from developing chest infections and other related diseases./'There are a lot of orchards of peach and orange near Swat Expressway from Palai to Pul Chowki Chakdara and gardening is the only source of income of the local people. The dust is harmful for fruit trees,' said Islam, a gardener./Local people demand sprinkling of water at the site on daily basis/He said that last year too, peach gardens were affected owing to work on the expressway. The fruit could not reach its standard size and produce was also affected by the dust and pollution, he added./Adam Khan, a resident of Palai, said that not only the orchards were affected by the dust but most of children in the area were also suffering from chest and throat infections. He said that uniforms of schoolchildren needed to be washed everyday due to dust and pollution./'We face difficulty in protecting our children and household items from dust as heavy trucks ply on the link roads in the area. We have demanded of Frontier Works Organisation and other companies several times to sprinkle water on daily basis on the roads but to no avail,' said Adam Khan./The contractors working on the site, when contacted, said that it was the responsibility of FWO to spray water on the roads as all roads were used for its work. 'We forwarded the complaints of local people to FWO but it did not take any notice. The FWO official should take notice of public demand,' said a contractor on condition of anonymity'./An official of FWO, when approached, said that the company sprinkled water on the roads four to five times on daily bases. 'However, it is not enough as weather is hot. We receive complaints and request the authorities concerned to increase water spray at construction sites. We also request local people to cooperate with FWO because all the work is being carried out for development of the area,' he added./The local people threatened that they would stop work forcibly on the expressway the companies did not start sprinkling water on the roads on daily basis. 'We have already suffered losses as our lands were taken from us at a low price for the expressway. Now all the link roads and streets in the area are badly damaged by heavy trucks,' they added."
Three tyre-derived fuel plants sealed in Taxila," Three tyre-derived fuel plants in Bun Bhola, in the Thatta Khalil union council, were sealed by the local administration and the health authorities after public complaints that they were polluting the environment and creating problems for the nearby population./The raiding team found a lack of safety measures at the plants, with scores of workers working without safety equipment and no fire safety arrangements./An official said that under the law, consent from the local population is mandatory to set up a tyre-derived fuel plant. In response to a question, he said tyre-derived fuel was being used as an alternative to furnace oil. The owners of the plants were also issued notices./'The process of extracting fuel from tyres creates a foul small and a gas is emitted during the process that may cause respiratory diseases among nearby residents,' Chaudhry Mohammad Ijaz, a member of the raiding team, told Dawn./Local administration officials told the press that action was taken against these units because burning tyres for fuel releases large quantities or carbon, sulphur and dust pollutants into the atmosphere./Many of these pollutants are carcinogenic and cause respiratory and other diseases./'The oil extracted from tyres was transported to industrial areas in Taxila and caused air pollution when these industrial units burned it. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority has already issued directions to stop these tyre-derived fuel plants,' said environmentalist Aabid Ali Azeemi./Local residents, including Ghulab Abbas, Shabbir Shah, Nadir Hussain and Dr Ramzan Abdullah, while speaking to the media, said serious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis and heart ailments were spreading in the area because of pollution and the hazardous fumes emitted by these plants./They believed that stone-crushing plants and other industry have already made life in surrounding villages miserable because of the unchecked dust, smoke, noise and water pollution./These tyre-derived fuel plants were first sealed by the district environment department in March 2014, but resumed operations allegedly with support from the concerned officials."
Govt ponders over electric cars to fight pollution," Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday chaired a meeting on climate change and decided to introduce electric cars by setting up electric car plants for the first time in the country./Adviser to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam briefed the premier on the climate change./The prime minister ordered the authorities concerned to ensure conversion of 30 per cent of all cars running in the country into electric vehicles by 2030./PM orders conversion of 30pc cars into electric vehicles by 2030/On the issue of possibility of heavy rains and flood in Gilgit-Baltistan, the meeting was informed that Shisper glacier in Hassanabad village of Hunza was posing a serious threat to residents of the area with each passing day as it has surged by three kilometers./The prime minister directed his team on climate change to expedite the process of installation of a glacier monitoring system to monitor all glaciers in the country./Referring to the government's plan to plant 10 billion trees across the country, the prime minister said that it was a national project and the matter should not be politicised./Later, Mr Aslam told a press conference that the government planned to introduce electric cars in the country by 2030 and that the move would have far-reaching impact on the country's environment./'Most countries are opting for electric cars across the world and Pakistan is far behind in it and once introduced in the country, electric vehicles will help save Rs2 billion worth of oil imported into the country besides reducing the country's air pollution,' Mr Aslam said./The adviser said that smoke emissions from vehicles were a major source of air pollution in the country and it contributed heavily to smog during winter season in Punjab, especially in Lahore./He said that electric cars would help lessen dependence on LPG and compressed natural gas stations, most of which were shut down because of gas closure on different days especially in winter in Punjab and these stations would be converted into charging docks for electric cars./Referring to the smog issue in Punjab during winter, he said that last year crop burning, one of the major sources of smog in Punjab, was banned. This year, too, he said, crop burning would be prohibited and the government planned to purchase the crop waste to sell it to industrial units./He also announced plans to launch Green Rickshaws in the country and for this purpose the government was holding talks with different stakeholders."
"Sulphur in diesel a major environmental concern, Pak-EPA tells senators"," The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that the sulphur content in diesel continues to be a major environmental concern./'The sulphur content in diesel is 1pc plus, which it should be less than 0.05pc according to international standards,' Pak-EPA Director General Farzana Altaf Shah said at a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change./Despite meeting with the concerned government departments, including the Ministry of Petroleum, she said there is no timeline for how soon diesel quality can be improved./Senate climate change body met to discuss measures taken to control industry, vehicular emissions/The committee met to discuss measures taken to control emissions from industries and vehicles./Senators believed that there were no checks on pollutants emitted into the atmosphere; they were told that vehicular emissions, mostly from diesel-run public transport, contribute the most as high as 43pc to the smog that covers Punjab every winter./Ms Shah told the meeting that refiners blending diesel to improve its quality are not following international standards, and are doing more harm to the environment than good./Pakistan State Oil (PSO) General Manager Government Affairs Khawar Abbas Jilani conceded that Euro II diesel in Pakistan is far inferior to international standards./He said that Pakistan switched to Euro II compliant high speed diesel after 2017. Prior to this, high speed diesel had 5,000 parts per million of sulphur, which was reduced to 500ppm post-2017./'We are aspiring for Euro V high speed diesel. We are in contact with the Kuwait Petroleum Company, which has informed us that from 2020 onwards it will stop producing the inferior Euro II high speed diesel. Once introduced in Pakistan, the sulphur content will drop to hardly 10ppm,' Mr Jilani said./Shell's Head of Corporate Affairs Imran Qureshi told senators that diesel will soon be transported through pipelines, which will halve the number of oil tankers currently around 15,000./The committee also took up air pollution caused by 185 industrial units in Islamabad and Kahuta, most of them steel mills and marble factories./According to the Pak-EPA, 63 brick kilns were stopped from operating, except for two units that obtained stay orders from the Islamabad High Courts./Senators argued that the ambient air quality over Islamabad has continued to worsen, and attributed emissions of hazardous smoke to industrial units, especially steel mills, in I-9 and I-10./Ministry of Climate Change Secretary Nasir Jamy told the committee that emissions from steel mills were being controlled through continuous checks by the Pak-EPA./'Until a few years ago, all the industrial units were emitting five tons of raw carbon into the air. In the last two to three years, these units have been directed to install scrubbers, which now absorb raw carbon into bags of filters,' he said./The senators, however, were not entirely convinced by some of these measures and believed the concerned departments were misleading members with outdated presentations."
Fires continue to rage in Margalla Hills," Seasonal fires continue to rage in the Margalla Hills despite the deployment of 300 personnel in the hills to fight and put them out./Throughout Sunday, thick smoke could be seen rising from a massive fire at a location called Makhnial falling in the jurisdiction of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa about 12 kilometres from Islamabad./The distant peak is one of the highest points in the Margalla Hills National Park which is supervised by the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI)./300 personnel deployed in the hills fail to extinguish flames/Director Wildlife MCI Rana Tahir said the fire in Makhnial, which was on a massive scale, was less likely to reach the Margalla Hills falling in Islamabad./He told Dawn that 10 pickets had been set up and staff deployed on ground and prepared to tackle the flames if it reached the jurisdiction of the capital city./Forest fires in the Margalla Hills have been seen since June 4. On Friday and Saturday, the peaks behind Faisal Mosque were seen burning on two spots./The MCI believed that the fires in the Margallas were caused by the summer heat in the months of May and June and also caused by local villagers./Two months ago, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) joined hands to control growing incidents of forest fires at Margalla Hills National Park./Both the organisations signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish seven fully equipped fire stations in the national park./Spreading over 12, 605 hectares, the Margalla Hills National Park witnesses many fires every year. However, during the last few years, bigger and more frequent fires have been reported which damaged trees and plants besides adding to the air pollution and rising temperature in the capital./The NDMA had said besides destroying the green character of the national park the frequent fires in the recent past have caused considerable damage to the flora and fauna in the hills./The issue of frequent fire incidents on the hills was also taken up by the Supreme Court which later referred the matter to the federal ombudsman./In pursuance of the direction of the apex court in June 2018, the federal ombudsperson held meetings with the Capital Development Authority (CDA), NDMA, MCI, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) and the Ministry of Interior and suggested measures to prevent the fires./It was recommended that the MCI, CDA, IWMB and NDMA should work together to develop standard operating procedures to ensure coordination in order to avoid such incidents./The ombudsman office had directed the MCI to equip its pickets on modern lines along with deployment of sufficient staff to control the fire incidents."
Small industrial outlets in residential areas pose threat to residents," The mushroom growth of illegal factories in the residential areas is creating noise and air pollution besides endangering the life and health of the residents./Establishment of small industrial units in the thickly-populated areas of the city is against the local government laws but the district administration and the civic agencies concerned remain oblivious of the issue./Under the law, residential areas cannot be used for commercial activities./Civil Defence Department survey shows over 4,000 illegal factories operating in thickly-populated areas, official says/Most of the factories are preparing polythene bags, plastic chapals and other products. During the process, smoke emitting from these illegal outlets creates air as well as noise pollution./A senior official of the district environment department told Dawn that air and noise pollution had increased in the city and there was a need to stop such activities./He said the waste generated from the factories was also being dumped in Leh Nullah without adopting safety measures which could pollute the ground water. He said for the establishment of a factory or other units, permission from the environment department was required./The Civil Defence Department conducted a survey in the city last month and found more than 4,000 illegal factories in the thickly-populated residential areas, including Khayaban-i-Sir Syed, Bangash Colony, Dhoke Dalal, Bagh Sardaran, Mohanpura and Sadiqabad./These small-scale factories manufacture and prepare goods using chemicals and other inflammable material and any untoward situation could occur as they do not adopt any safety measures./The report said shortage of facilities in these factories posed a risk of fire incidents as most of them have no fire fighting system. Besides, these outlets were established in narrow streets./According to the building by-laws, essential safety measures are basically required in commercial, industrial and public buildings to ensure the safety of occupants in the event of a fire or emergency./Apart from this, godowns have also been established in residential areas especially around Moti Bazaar, Bara Market, Raja Bazaar, Urdu Bazaar and Murree Road./When contacted, Civil Defense Officer Talib Hussain admitted that there were more than 4,000 illegal small industrial units in different parts of the city and his department had so far issued notices to more than 300 outlets./He said such illegal industries should be shifted outside the residential areas./He said houses were being used for commercial purposes and in case of a fire people living in the vicinity of these units would suffer./About the increasing trend of converting residential houses into godowns, he said it was illegal. He said the traders did not adopt fire safety measures and many fire incidents had occurred during the last a few years./When contacted, Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) Chairman Arif Abbasi said illegal factories should be removed from the residential areas./He claimed that the RDA had removed all illegal factories set up in 13 housing schemes under the administrative control of the civic body before Ramazan. He said the RDA wanted to clear residential areas from illegal factories./He said Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) failed to remove illegal factories from its area and it created problems for the RDA. He said there was a need to clear the city of such outlets immediately."
Growing pollution in Hayatabad alarms environmentalists," The civil Society members and environmentalists have sought total ban on smoke emitting industrial units and stone crushing plants operating in the surrounding area of Hayatabad Township and asked the government to declare the residential area pollution-free zone./Representatives of civil society groups asked the government to impose total ban on industrial units causing air and land pollution, penalties and fines on smoke emitting vehicles and public littering by traffic wardens and staff of Peshawar Development Authority./In a statement issued here on Wednesday, they said that a delegation comprising representatives of civil society groups and environmentalists met Finance Minister Taimoor Jhagra and PDA Director General Eng Mohammad Uzair to apprise them of various issues being faced by the residents of Hayatabad./Civil society seeks ban on smoke emitting industrial units/The statement said that toxic air pollution was caused by illegal stone crushing units, asbestos, steel rolling mills and cardboard manufacturing plants in Shahkas area of Khyber tribal district as those were emitting dust and smoke, which posed severe health hazard to the residents Hayatabad especially Phase-7./It said that influential people including some parliamentarians had set up industrial units in violation of Environmental Protection Agency's regulations./These industries were emitting toxic, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and evaporated particulates in the air, despite the ban imposed by Peshawar High Court last year. The problem got worse in winter, especially at nighttime when emissions were at their peak, it added./The delegation informed the minister that faculty and students of Institute of Management Sciences (IMS) and Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) took air quality measurements and results were in the range of 2,350 micro gram per cubic meter whereas, the safe level according to the World Health Organisation air quality standard was10-50 micro gram particulate matter (PM) per cubic foot./'This is a criminal neglect on the part of authorities concerned. Dust particles smaller than 10 microgram remain suspended indefinitely and when inhaled are lodged inside the lungs,' said the statement./It said that more units were being established in the same area and the problem would exacerbate during the winter if administrative action was not taken to shut them down./The statement said that there were public complaints of eye irritation, skin and pulmonary diseases in the locality and it was incumbent on PDA and district authorities to take immediate action in the interest of public health."
Pakistan and India face common threats. Climate change is the biggest one," Climate change is no longer limited to books or scientific papers; it is a reality knocking on our doors./Longer, sweltering summers bringing in record-breaking heat to South Asia are just one example. The harshest of conditions have yet to come, and the entire region is woefully unprepared to meet the challenges./While they may seem isolated, increasing instances of extreme weather are harbingers of a major climate shift for South Asia. Unlike transnational challenges like security and trade, climate change cannot be deterred by conventional methods or unilateral initiatives. Instead, synchronised common action is the viable way forward for sustainable progress to mitigate the impacts of climate change./Let's look at some of the common environmental challenges facing Pakistan and India and propose strategic measures to address them./Heatwaves/Over the past decade or so, the frequency of extreme weather phenomena - ranging from blistering summers to freezing cold winters - has increased. Nearly half of these events were heatwaves, surpassing the previous record highs, and resulting in a wave of mortality around the world. Researchers point out that ""the trend in global warming has contributed to the severity and probability of 82pc of record-hot days globally.""/In Pakistan and India, heatwaves have become somewhat of a norm, an expected part of the summer. As a matter of fact, just last year, Pakistan saw the highest official temperature recorded in the world - 50.2 degree Celsius in Nawabshah - and a week later, that record was broken when Jacobabad hit 51°C./Related: Climate change does not need visas to cross borders/In 2015, a severe heatwave struck Karachi, breaking 40-year records, and resulting in nearly 2,000 casualties. As Edhi morgues and cemeteries started turning dead bodies away, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency attributed the event to climate change./Over in India, over 30 people died this summer as heatwave after heatwave resulted in temperatures near 51°C. Storms and rain brought little relief, as hundreds of thousands faced the brutal heat./Survivability and wet-bulb effect/Experts warn that various areas in South Asia, including the Indus Valley in Pakistan, and much of India, would cross the survivability threshold by 2100./Survivability was measured against what is known as the wet-bulb temperature, a factor based on both humidity and external temperature. It turns out that while our bodies are good at keeping themselves cool in heat, when you throw humidity into the mix, things go awry./At 35°C, it becomes impossible for the human body to cool itself through sweating, and it enters survival mode. A few hours of sustained exposure to wet- bulb conditions, and you have imminent death - even in young, healthy adults in their prime./While heatwaves have traditionally gained a strong foothold in the Indian subcontinent between March and July, their intensity, frequency and duration has been steadily increasing./According to Elfatih Eltahir, a professor of hydrology and climate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ""the future of heatwaves is looking worse even with significant mitigation of climate change, and much worse without mitigation.""/Flooding/By far the most dangerous natural hazard that devastates Pakistan and India on a nearly annual basis is flooding. In the past 65 years, Pakistan has suffered from 30 major floods - the super flood in 2010 alone affected 20 million people./Over in India, hundreds are killed and millions are displaced on an annual basis, as the monsoon intensifies short, heavy spells of rain. Just this year, monsoon-fueled storms killed around 270 in India, and left over a million displaced./The continued rise in global temperatures spells further risk of flooding, as glaciers melt at a faster than normal rate. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods occur when a large amount of water, usually in a glacial lake, is released all of a sudden. They are often a precursor to flash flooding - a massive torrent of water picking up speed as it flows downhill, destroying everything in its path./Read next: Climate change affects women more. What can the state do to intervene?/In recent years, urban growth in both Pakistan and India has surpassed expectations. However, as more and more people flock to the cities, dilapidated infrastructure and poorly built settlements are becoming a common sight. Add to that a crumbling drainage and sanitation system, and you end up with the perfect recipe for urban flooding, the likes of which we have seen in Lahore and Karachi this year./The situation is similar across the border, where rains lashed major towns and cities, leaving dozens dead and large swathes of infrastructure - roads, bridges, and railway lines included - under water./Water stress/Pakistan is home to around 47pc of the Indus Basin, and India to around 39pc. The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) has been in effect since 1960. Recent political bickering aside, the IWT has managed to survive the test of time, yet fails to comprehensively address climate change. Then again, at the time it was enacted, many of the stark realities that we know today were not understood./According to the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Pakistan officially crossed the water scarcity line in 2005. The United Nations Development Program and the PCRWR have issued warnings about the upcoming scarcity of groundwater in just six years./According to some estimates, Pakistan is the fourth-largest user of its groundwater, and over 70pc of drinking requirements and 50pc of irrigation needs are met through groundwater extraction. Due to excessive pumping, it is estimated that water tables could fall by as much as 20pc by 2025./Also read: A water policy for a Naya Pakistan/Among the main contributors of water stress in Pakistan are poor water resource management and poor water service delivery, including irrigation and drainage services. Moreover, the lack of reliable water data, subsequent analysis and consequent poor planning and allocation is leading to environmentally unviable methods of water withdrawal, causing an alarming reduction in groundwater./In India, water stress is attributed first and foremost to the massive population growth. Another cause is lack of sufficient urban water treatment facilities, which prevent the usability of river water for drinking and irrigation./Like Pakistan, over-extraction of groundwater has also been recognised as a major contributor to water stress in India. Twenty one Indian cities, including Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad are estimated to run out of groundwater altogether by 2020./Agriculture/The South Asian region has historically been one of agriculture and livestock rearing. Indeed, the image of the trusty old farmer who sacrifices his body and soul for the land has been romanticised through the ages. But increasingly unpredictable weather patterns have started to disrupt agricultural activities./In Pakistan, agricultural productivity is one of the lowest in the world. Adverse weather conditions caused a loss of nearly 1.5 million tons of wheat during the rabi season 2018-19./Explore: Is climate change depressing you too?/Over in India, thousands of tons of ready wheat were lost due to an unexpectedly heavy monsoon spell. According to a report by the World Bank, the agriculture sector makes up for more than 40pc of employment in Pakistan, and nearly 50pc of all labour in India is engaged directly or indirectly in agriculture./Understandably, adverse effects of climate change on agriculture would not only hit the national economies hard, they would also threaten food security. Increasing populations in both Pakistan and India are likely to drive up demand for food, drawing in a looming imbalance between food demand and supply./Drought/This brings us to another climate change-related conundrum: drought. Droughts occur frequently in Pakistan, and can affect as much as a third of the country at a single time. Balochistan, in particular, is hit hard because of its arid climate./While structural arrangements to combat the effects of drought are well in place, issues such as lack of capacity, inability to tackle basin-scale water sharing challenges and lack of effective decision making further compound the problem. Earlier this year, the Pakistan Meteorological Department declared a drought in Sindh and Balochistan - over five million are estimated to have been affected./In India, droughts have driven nearly 300,000 farmers to suicide in the past 25 years. Earlier this year, officials called the situation 'worse than the 1972 famine'. Millions of farmers are simply abandoning their fields and livestock and moving to cities in search of work; there just isn't enough water to go around. Meanwhile entire cities - like Chennai - are at the brink of a major disaster as water reservoirs run dry./Smog/Over the past few years, smog has become a necessary precursor to the winter season, almost becoming a norm for the subcontinent. As vast swaths of land are set alight in northeastern India to prepare for sowing the wheat crop, plumes of smoke and highly carcinogenic particulate matter are carried over across the border to Pakistan./There is no doubt that Pakistani farmers, too, burn their fields to get rid of parali in preparation for the next crop, but that is a drop in the bucket compared to the smog that is carried over across the border./According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for a few weeks in October and November (which coincidentally include the firework fueled festival of Diwali), Indian Punjab becomes a 'major source of air pollution.'/In-depth: No, India is not responsible for Punjab's smog. Here's what's really happening/Here, it is crucial to talk about particulate matter, or PM, which is made up of a mixture of solid and liquid droplets of dust, dirt, soot and smoke which are divided into two broad categories. PM 10 are inhalable particles, while PM 2.5 particles can get embedded into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream./Extended exposure to PM 2.5, a major part of smog, can lead to premature death in people with preexisting conditions, heart attacks, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function and various respiratory illnesses. Aged people and children are the most vulnerable to these effects./What is the way forward?/According to climate researchers at Germanwatch, Pakistan ranks eight on the Global Climate Risk Index, with over 145 catastrophic events - heatwaves, droughts and floods - reported in the past 20 years. On the other hand, India ranks among the top 20 vulnerable countries in terms of climate risk./There is no debating that both countries, and indeed South Asia at large, are highly susceptible to risks of climate change. Risks such as droughts, severe rains and flooding translate into decreased agricultural income and production and reduced food security./A continuous cycle of heatwaves could lead to a public health emergency, where old and young may be the victims. Air pollution and smog could catapult rates of lung and breathing diseases, including asthma and cancer in the decades to come, debilitating an entire generation./Action to mitigate the effects of climate change is needed to ensure adequate availability of water and food resources for future generations. Governments of both countries place climate change among their priorities./In 2015, Pakistan reinstated the Ministry of Climate Change, while a year earlier, India expanded its Ministry of Environment to include Climate Change to its agenda of action. The Pakistan Climate Change Act, 2017 and India's National Action Plan on Climate Change are a step in the right direction, at least on a domestic level./With the IWT being held ransom, and rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers, we are likely to witness a reduction of water flow in rivers. Increased extraction of water from aquifers for drinking and irrigation purposes will amplify water stress, and researchers paint an alarming picture ahead: by 2025, Pakistan will, for the first time in its history, dip below the critical threshold of 1,000 cubic metres per year. In India, the per capita availability of water will be just over 25pc of what it was in 1951./Water stress, exacerbated by these conditions, will spell disaster for the local populace. Already water stressed countries - such as Somalia, Syria and Yemen - have witnessed horrific violence over limited resources./PTI's one year: Fixing how we deal with the climate crisis/With each passing year, the risks of unabated climate change to human lives and livelihoods are increasing. A bilateral agreement between India or Pakistan, through a forum such as South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), can be the first crucial step for addressing existing and emerging environmental challenges./In order to address implementation issues due to topographic variations and state interests, the United Nations Environment Program can take the lead on such an initiative. A case in point is the dramatic shift in China-Japan relations which were transformed as the two nations began environmental cooperation through initiatives like the Sino-Japan Friendship Center for Environmental Protection at the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, which was funded and operationalised by the Japan International Cooperation Agency./Both the governments of Pakistan and India are actively promoting a transition towards sustainable, green economies and cutting down on carbon emissions and other contributors of climate degradation. India plans to have over a third of its installed power capacity reliant on renewable sources. In addition to being the fourth-largest wind power producer in the world, India is also home to some of the largest solar power parks./In contrast, Pakistan has established solar parks, the largest of which is the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park in Bahawalpur. A handful of windmill farms have also been established in coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan. SAARC Energy Centre, based in Islamabad, is supporting the development of battery electric vehicles in Pakistan and India, with researchers at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore paving the way for what could transform urban transport./These initiatives, in addition to various other schemes, can prove to be the foundations of sustainable development for both nations. Increased cooperation between institutes of higher learning can be promoted to help identify potential risks, adopt and improve local best practices, and promote the exchange of practice and information between the two countries./Looking at the climate change challenges Pakistan and India face together, collective action - as unlikely as it seems - may just be what is needed to secure the lives and livelihoods of future generations."
Heart disease prevention," EXPERTS have suggested that more than 40 people die of heart disease every hour in Pakistan. Until three years ago, the number of such deaths was around 12 per hour. This is an alarming increase of more than 200pc in the heart-related mortality rate. The data speaks volumes for the inability of the public healthcare system to cater to a rapidly growing population; secondly, it shows that there is something inherently wrong with the lifestyles of a majority of Pakistanis. Government spending on healthcare in Pakistan has remained less than 1pc of the GDP over several decades. While the present government came to power promising to make healthcare one of its top priorities and also announced a couple of health programmes, the budgetary allocations tell a different story. The federal health budget was slashed this year, along with the provincial budgets of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Balochistan. Fortunately, in Sindh the health budget was increased by 19pc, underscoring the provincial government's plan to improve the provision of healthcare. In this regard, the opening of a chest pain unit by the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases in the low-income neighbourhood of Orangi in Karachi is a step in the right direction./Meanwhile, unchecked 'development' over the years has led to a decline in the overall quality of life as air pollution has increased and public spaces have been reduced, especially in the bigger cities. Karachi, which has been declared the fifth least liveable city in the world, is a case in point. It is no surprise that sedentary lifestyles and poor diet, combined with bad air quality, have resulted in every third person suffering from hypertension - a precursor to heart disease. If heart patients get medical assistance in time, a large number of these deaths could be prevented. However, this requires that people have easy access to basic but effective healthcare, something that is impossible to achieve until the government makes considerable investment in the development of health facilities and medical staff."
Pakistanis are marching to combat climate change," Does the Pakistani public care about the climate crisis? The answer may be that it has no choice but to do so./Across Pakistan, the effects of climate change and environmental degradation are hitting communities hard. A shortage of water is being deeply felt by both urban and farming populations. Just a few months ago, farmers from the town of Kharo Chan in Sindh marched on foot to Thatta the old capital of the province located about 100 kilometres away to protest decreasing levels of water in the Indus River. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, environmentalists based in Peshawar are sounding the alarm over rising levels of pollution brought on by smoke emitting industrial units and stone crushing plants operating in the city's Hayatabad area. In Punjab, Lahore has seen dangerously high levels of smog, causing respiratory issues, allergies and headaches./As these communities, across provinces, grapple with the multiple impacts of climate challenge, environmentally-conscious citizens have taken inspiration from global protests on climate change. They will be part of the global protests and will demand action from their government today with September 20 being the day marked for a global climate strike in 120 countries./In Pakistan, the organisers hope to keep the march 'apolitical' in the sense of not aligned to any existing political party and are expecting the turnout across cities to be in the thousands./One of the many posters prepared by ClimateActionPK for the climate march./The mass day of action is scheduled to take place just days ahead of the United Nations climate summit in New York. One of the lead organisers of this march in Pakistan, the environmental group ClimateActionPK, is calling on the Pakistani government to become part of a global collective to reduce carbon emissions. Their specific demands include: declaring a climate emergency, demanding climate justice through a global coalition, adopting a low-carbon economy and ensuring climate adaptation efforts at the grassroots./The government seems willing to listen to some of these calls to action. According to one organiser, Sara Hayat, the government has facilitated the citizen-led initiative by granting permission for the march in various cities. In Lahore, the deputy city commissioner is helping to mobilise government school students and has pledged to join the walk. Hayat says that Zartaj Gul Wazir, the state minister for climate change, too, has agreed to come to the march in Islamabad, where the demands will be presented to her./One of the many posters prepared by ClimateActionPK for the climate march./'People have protested in the past for the climate as well but those protests have been isolated,' says Abid Omar, who founded the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative that gathers data about air pollution and its impacts. 'This time in Pakistan, it's not the same old motley crew of individuals or NGOs. Citizens are now taking the lead.'/Enthusiasm for the march is high. Climate change activists and students are busy rallying supporters to join the initiative. Some are going into communities to invite people to join and to inform people about climate change. On university campuses like Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan, students are putting out calls for a poster drawing activity. There are even pleas for crowdfunding aspects of the march, such as purchasing water drums and first aid kits. The march is taking place as temperatures in parts of the country remain close to 40 degrees Celsius./Various reasons, common demands/Omar said, 'In Lahore, air pollution has reached a tipping point and there is a conversation about it. But in Karachi, despite the high levels of carbon monoxide in the air, it is not really a discussion. I'm marching for action.'/Alina Salahuddin, a student who just graduated from one of Karachi's most prestigious high schools, said the sense of eagerness within the student body is encouraging. 'I manage a climate forum on social platforms and am seeing a lot of curiosity about the upcoming event. A lot of questions are coming to us from young people in Hyderabad and Thatta. High school students outside Karachi want to know if there is a march in their city.'/She added that students are realising that they have to march for their future. 'Even those who shy away from political discussions want to make their voices heard on the issue of the environment. It leaves no one untouched. We will all face the same consequences.'/Salahuddin, who said she admires Swedish student activist Greta Thunberg's perseverance, notes that things are slowly changing on campuses. 'One private school has started a zero waste initiative. They don't waste paper and have stopped selling plastic bottles at the canteen. Where one would see more students flocking to the sports club or debating society, we are seeing the environmental societies grow in membership.'/While preparations for the climate march in Pakistan are an encouraging indicator of awareness levels, is the government listening?/Will the government listen?/Environmental lawyer Abdul Rafay Alam said, 'I don't think policymakers in Pakistan have understood the gravity of the climate crisis. Our current Nationally Determined Contribution to greenhouse gas reduction is in fact a trajectory to increase emissions by 400% by 2030. This is remarkably irresponsible when we know just how vulnerable Pakistan is to climate challenges. 'Business-as-usual' models are now showing a possible global temperature increase of 4 degree Centigrade by the end of this century. There will be little or no agriculture in Pakistan by then.'/Alam also said that the discussion on climate change and its effects on the country are still not part of mainstream discourse. 'Climate action is not part of the mainstream discourse in Pakistan. Too many other things are. And in between we are planting some trees,' said Alam./'If there are conversations raising concerns about the climate crisis, they're drowned out by claims that Pakistan doesn't owe the international community anything. These claims are premised on the notion that the responsibility to deal with the climate crisis is the developed world's alone. Nothing could be further from the truth. The climate crisis is real, and it's everyone's problem.'/Federal minister for climate change, Malik Amin Aslam, who is also a key advisor to Prime Minister Imran Khan on the subject, said his government is making a strong political commitment to tackling climate change. He said that while he will be unable to march on Friday, he welcomes the initiative. 'I would have loved to be a part of it but can't as I will be leaving for the UNSG climate summit. This positive civil society activism bolsters our cause, which is to make Pakistan ready to face climate change and contribute to the global effort towards fighting this challenge.'"
Experts call for enforcing smoking ban at public places," On the occasion of World Lung Day observed on Sept 25, experts associated with the National Alliance for Tobacco Control (NATC) and the Pakistan Chest Society (PCS) passed a resolution at a meeting held on Wednesday demanding implementation of smoking ban at public places and enforcement of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control./The resolution also called for adoption of World Health Organisation's air quality standards and increasing public awareness of respiratory health./'Promote universal access to quality healthcare, essential medicines and immunisation. Improve early diagnosis of respiratory diseases, increase research and strengthen training of health professionals in this specific area./'Standardise monitoring and management of respiratory diseases with evidence-based national and international strategies,' the resolution demands./Speaking about the hazards of smoking and air pollution, Prof Javaid Khan of Aga Khan University (AKU) and chairperson of NATC said lung cancer was still the number one cause of cancer deaths in Pakistani men and the leading cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)./The rising air pollution levels in Pakistan, he warned, could result in exponential increase in the number of COPD cases in the country./Prof Ali Zubairi, PCS-Sindh chapter president, said the use of biomass fuel like wood and coal in cooking was another important cause of COPD especially among women living in rural areas./He urged the government to implement clean air laws in the country as COPD could also occur from exposure to second-hand smoke./Citing a research of AKU, Prof Zubairi said that tobacco smoke pollution in Pakistani restaurants was one of the worst in the world./'There is a dire need to strictly implement the ban on smoking at public places in the country,' he said./According to these experts, respiratory diseases carry a huge worldwide health burden as an estimated 384 million people suffer from COPD, killing three million people each year, which makes it the third leading cause of death worldwide./Out of the 10 million people who develop tuberculosis, 1.6 million die every year, making it the most common lethal infectious disease whereas lung cancer claims lives of 1.76 million people annually."
"Joint efforts stressed against ice addiction, deforestation"," Speakers at a seminar on Wednesday called for joint efforts against iceaddiction among students and deforestation in the district./'Though playing an important role in increasing literacy rate in the country, the private sector should also focus on the grooming of students to prepare them for all situations,' deputy commissioner Aurangzeb Haider Khan told the seminar on 'role and responsibility as a citizen of Pakistan' at a local school on Wednesday./The event was attended by students and teachers from across the district./The speakers highlighted the use of ice drug in educational institutions, deforestation, role of students in community development, governance system, education and democracy, and responsibilities of district administration andmedia./ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER AD/The deputy commissioner said he foresaw that major tasks currently in the government's domain would be executed through public-private partnership./Umar Gul Khan said students were the future of the country, so they should be equipped with knowledge./'The use of ice and other drugs is alarmingly on the rise in educational institutions but nobody is ready to discuss it publicly. The issue should be highlighted in curriculum,' he said./Khadija Yousuf said the large-scale deforestation was a major cause for environmental issues and high disease incidence in Hazara division./'Instead of pointing the finger at other nations, we should protect our forests and check activities, which cause air pollution,' she said./Sunniya Sitwat and Mohammad Anis of the United Nations Development Programme said biodiversity was required for life on earth but hunting and deforestation caused extinction of species in the country./FINED: The tehsil administration on Wednesday fined many hoteliers for selling unhygienic food in Siren valley./The action was taken by assistant commissioner Rabia Sajjad during a surprise visit to Jabori and Schain areas./Also in the day, the Kaghan police arrested a man wanted for murder, murder attempt and other crimes./They also held a drug peddler and seized 3kg charas and an unlicensed pistol."
Experts warn suicide trend on the rise in country," Experts at a press briefing on Wednesday said every third person in Pakistan was depressed and the trend of suicide was alarmingly on the rise in the country./Marking World Mental Health Day, which is being observed on Thursday (today), the experts said at the briefing that key factors behind increasing depression among the society were low standard of living, social deprivation, etc./The press briefing was organised by the Neurology Awareness and Research Foundation at the Karachi Press Club./The foundation's president Dr Mohammad Wasay said the problem relating to mental health was equally important for every country since it led to various socioeconomic issues./'Mental health issues are greater in Karachi than any other city of Pakistan'/He said people were committing suicide every 40 seconds in the world and Pakistan was among the countries where that trend had horribly increased./'The ratio of suicides is greater in women in Pakistan,' said Dr Wasay./He said the growing acrimony, chaos, melancholy, lack of confidence, poverty, joblessness, police torture, anxiety for greater marks in school and college examinations and changing social norms had contributed immensely to increase in such trends, including committing suicide./He added that increased pressure for better marks in examinations exerted by parents and teachers threw students into depression./'For such reasons, many young children have committed suicides.'/He referred to the World Health Organisation, which said depression was a key factor for many diseases, disorders and disabilities. Every third person in the world is depressed and 'situation is not different in Pakistan either'./He said the country was facing a serious dearth of neurologists and other experts, which was contributing negatively in dealing with the issue./Dr Wasay said mental health issues were greater in Karachi than any other city of the country where more than five million people were enduring such disorders, particularly depression and anxiety./Prof Iqbal Afridi said there were no facilities of psychotherapy and counselling of patients in the country./He added there was a mental health law in the country, yet, the role of psychiatrists and psychologists had not been accepted in it./Dr Afridi said people were committing suicide because of deteriorating political and economic issues. Besides, environmental issues like increasing noise and air pollutions were also contributing to those disorders./He said half of the mental health problems began when patients were still in a tender age; most of those problems remained undiagnosed and untreated since parents and teachers were not capable of dealing with it because of lack of awareness to identify those symptoms./Dr Afridi said solving those issues and improving the existing mental health situation was needed in Pakistan since 'suicides among teenaged people [are] dangerously on the rise'./Prof Raza Rehman and Dr Qirat Khan said demand for drugs for curing tension and antidepressants was on the rise. However, the users of those drugs were susceptible to committing suicide./They said increasing trend of suicides was a sign of danger. Such people could be stopped from committing suicide through counselling; yet socioeconomic issues and lack of social justice forced people to end their life./The experts said an improved community support system, better awareness among communities, educationists and medical practitioners could also stem the rising trend of suicides."
Call for measures to tackle reasons behind smog," The Attock district administration held an awareness seminar and walk on Wednesday to sensitise local residents on the negative effects of smog on human health./Speakers told participants that burning paddy stubble, smoke producing vehicles, hours-long traffic jams, the use of substandard fuel by industrial units, rapid and unplanned urbanisation and drought are the main causes of smog./They emphasised the need for collective efforts to control the burning of crop residue, which contributes to smog formation./The speakers also said that collective efforts and planning by various departments with a multi-sectoral approach is needed to overcome the issue./Community participation is also essential for immediate measures to control pollution./Speakers urged participants to take precautionary measures and observe traffic rules during smog./Attock Assistant Commissioner Jannat Hussain Nekokara explained that smog is a kind of air pollution named for the mixture of smoke and fog in the air. It affects visibility, human health and crops./District Health Authority CEO Dr Sohail Ijaz said that ground-level ozone, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis and asthma./He said smog has become a regular occurrence in the last couple of years and could be labelled a 'fifth season' in the country./'Pakistan is suffering huge economic losses due to smog pollution in the form of delayed flights, decline in crop yields and respiratory illnesses,' he added./Elderly citizens with weak physiques, children and patients with respiratory diseases are more vulnerable to the effects of smog. Dr Ijaz said smog can produce pneumonia in children and elderly people, and such individuals should therefore take precautionary measures in such a situation./District Council Chief Officer Imran Sindhu told participants that smog is formed when fog and smoke combine together in October and November, coupled with low temperatures, high moisture and slow wind speed./He said the government has passed an environment act to control emissions from various industries and has taken legal action against individuals and industries contributing to pollution./District Education Authority acting CEO Imran Qureshi, the district officer environment and district officer agriculture also spoke at the event./Afterwards, participants of the seminar held a walk to raise awareness among the public and distributed literature in this regard./Separately, International Hand Washing Day was observed at informal basic education schools in Attock on Wednesday, under the supervision of the district education officer (literacy)./An awareness campaign was launched in the schools in which students were informed of the benefits of hand washing through banners, placards and lectures by district literary department officials."
EPA seals six factories for causing air pollution," The Environment Protection Agency has sealed at least six factories and issued notices to 27 others for causing air pollution by emitting smoke during its drive aimed at curtailing smog launched in the district./Muhammad Umar, District Officer (environment), said this while briefing a meeting held here on Monday that was presided over by Deputy Commissioner Dr Khurram Shahzad. Senior administrative and municipal officers were also present./The DO said the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) had planned walks to raise awareness regarding environmental issues, especially smog. He warned criminal cases would be launched against the owners of brick kilns, factories ets polluting the air so that smog could be avoided this season./He said that so far only 26 brick-kilns in the district had switched over to the Zigzag Technology that was essential to check smoke emissions. However, he said the department had issued notices to at least 196 brick kiln owners, asking them to adopt the modern technology, whereas 137 others had also been served notices for polluting the air./Mr Umer said the owners of at least 170 vehicle owners had also been slapped heavy fines since their vehicles were emitting excessive smoke./The DC told the meeting that a stern warning should be issued to the kiln owners across the district asking them to shift to the Zigzag Technology till December, whereas the owners of the factories and private hospitals should also be issued direction to take environment-friendly measures for creating a pollution-free environment./The meeting decided that the sanitary staff of the civic agencies across the district would clean dirt and mud gathering along the median of various roads and the workers would be warned against burning the heaps of garbage./An official of the local agricultural department said the department had lodged various criminal cases against farmers for burning the remains of paddy crop in the fields last year. He said instructions would again be issued to the farmers so that the practice could be checked since it could also affect the land fertility./The meeting also decided that the health department would establish separate smog counters in every public sector health facility, whereas education department would conduct 'zero period' in the schools and colleges for raising awareness among the students regarding the dangers of smog./HEPATITIS SCREENING: Gujrat district has topped in the province in hepatitis screening by conducting camps and screened some 15,000 people during the wwek-long drive launched on Oct 21 for the purpose./This was stated by Health Chief Executive Officer Dr Zahid Tanveer here on Monday./During the last such drive the district had been given the target of screening some 10,000 people./He said during the recent campaign 1,683 people were diagnosed with hepatitis C and 150 with hepatitis B./He added that the samples of those diagnosed with hepatitis had been sent to the laboratory for further tests to confirm the disease after which these patients would be provided free medicines."
Smog blamed on Indian farmers begins to hit Lahore," Moderate smog has started developing in Lahore because of the lowering minimum temperature, humidity and calm wind at night that is allowing the contributing pollutants, being generated mostly by Indian Punjab farmers by burning massive crop residue, to penetrate the bordering areas./'We have already taken adequate steps to prevent local contributions to smog, and are ready to combat those from Indian Punjab,' said Environment Protection Secretary Salman Ejaz on Wednesday./He contradicted reports suggesting development of hazardous level smog in Lahore. 'This is false as our authentic data shows much lower levels that are not dangerous at all as yet,' he said./Chief Meteorologist in Lahore Sahibzad Khan said there was no smog. It was merely smoke and haze, he said, indicating chances of rain and strong westerly winds on Saturday and Sunday./This would provide relief, though temporary, against smog or whatever, he said./Human rights group Amnesty International earlier said that the Air Quality Index in Lahore had reached 484 at 10am, adding that the threshold for hazardous level of air quality was 300./It blamed the Punjab government for exposing people to hazardous air risks in violation of their human rights to life and health./Smog was witnessed in the bordering areas of Lahore and those in the south along the canal on Wednesday morning./Haziness, and nose and eye irritation was a clear indication of the beginning of the phenomenon which is pestering Lahore and other Punjab cities in October and November for the past few years./The main cause is stated to be the burning of crop residue mainly by Indian Punjab farmers. Smog that develops as a result causes worst health threatening conditions in the Indian side up to Delhi./The Environment Protection Department (EPD) observatory at the Met department's Jail Road observatory on Wednesday recorded 128 AQI (Air Quality Index) at 12.50pm./The AQI at Wagah was 280. According to the EPD smog policy, AQI ranging between 101 and 200 indicates slight, 200 to 300 moderate and 400 to 500 hazardous air pollution./Mr Salman Ejaz said Punjab did not witness smog during most parts of the current month because of extended monsoons and some strong westerly weather systems that pushed back the pollutants from the fields of Indian Punjab./'NASA Satellite pictures are showing huge crop residue burning in the east Punjab cities Amritsar and Jalandhar. The local contribution is 20 per cent. And we are not having full impact of the smog causing pollutants from the Indian side because of the (favourable) wind direction,' he said."
"'Alarming' levels of smoke, not smog engulfing Lahore: Punjab chief meteorologist"," As schools in Lahore remained closed on Thursday for the first time due to the prevalence of ""smog"" in the city, Punjab Chief Meteorologist Mahr Sahibzad Khan said that the current smoke levels should not be confused with ""smog""./""Smog components become visible after smoke and fog combine. Until now, the fog has not developed,"" he said while talking to DawnNewsTV./""Fog has its own criteria under which it develops: the visibility must reduce to less than 1 kilometre, the humidity levels must be more than 90 per cent, the air must be still and the sky clear. Only then are there chances for fog,"" Khan explained./""These phenomena (required for fog) are not currently present. There is smoke, because of car and factory emissions, as well as transboundary smoke coming in from India due to crop burning. So the smoke levels have risen significantly owing to these factors. And there are components in the smoke that raise the air quality index. People start calling it smog, but it isn't. There are alarmingly high levels of smoke, however.""/Examine: No, India is not responsible for Punjab's smog. Here's what's really happening/Khan said that it had rained yesterday and there are chances of rain today as well. ""The weather is pleasant and it seems it will be tomorrow as well,"" he added./Lahore's Air Quality Index (AQI) appeared to have improved on Thursday from a day earlier, falling to 106 in the late afternoon which is within the 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups' category./On Wednesday, Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar had announced the closure of public and private schools in Lahore today after the sudden spike in smog levels from less than 200 to over 500./From November 9-12 the city's AQI will be in the 'Unhealthy' category, the daily index shows./'Terrifying'/Following the unprecedented measure of schools closure yesterday, journalists took to Twitter to express alarm at the constantly rising levels of air pollution./The head of communications for Amnesty International, Rimmel Mohydin, criticised the government for continuously monitoring pollution levels and ""never actually doing anything""./Iman Zia also shared her ""smog"" experience, saying it had entered her house./""Barely slept last night from the pounding heaviness from the smog drooping in the bedroom. Also honestly terrifying walking out into the corridor and noticing smoke INSIDE THE HOUSE."" she wrote./Omar Waraich, in response to Chief Minister Buzdar's notification for schools closure due to a ""sudden increase in smog"" said that the government had had plenty of time to deal with rising pollution levels./""You had 15 months to deal with this. There's nothing 'sudden' about this environmental crisis that is violating people's human rights to education, health and even life,"" he said./Meanwhile, the Punjab Health Department issued an advisory for citizens instructing them to take certain measures to guard against the effects of pollution./Punjab Environmental Protection Department Director Misbah-ul-Haq Khan Lodhi said that the Punjab government, ahead of November, had decided to close conventional kilns in consultation with the Smog Commission, which had been tasked with identifying the root causes of fog generation and to formulate a policy by prescribing a plan to protect the people's health./Punjab Minister for Environment Protection Bao Muhammad Rizwan said that the Punjab government has taken several emergency measures to counter smog, including a strict ban on burning crops and solid waste./He said that last year more than 100 people were arrested for crop burning and this year hundreds of factories have been shut down for not having proper emission-control equipment."
"All schools in Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad to remain closed for two days due to smog"," The Punjab education department on Thursday decided to keep all public and private schools in Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad closed on November 15 and 16 due to poor air quality./According to a notification issued by the provincial government, the schools will remain closed due to ""dense smog"" in the three districts./Punjab Minister for Schools Education Dr Murad Raas in a tweet vowed that the government will protect school-going children at all costs. ""The Punjab government is taking all necessary steps to improve air quality,"" he added./On Wednesday, the provincial education department had prohibited holding all outdoor activities in all public and private schools across the province till December 20 for the same reason./The government had directed all students to wear air filter masks during school hours. It had also decided to hold awareness sessions on environment in all schools. This is for the second time in a month that the government has decided to keep schools closed due to smog./Lahore's air quality remained 'hazardous' with an air quality ranking of 447, according to Air Visual's Air Quality Index (AQI) list on Wednesday./The Punjab capital is ranked the second most polluted city in the world, according to Air Visual, which records air pollution levels across the globe in real time. New Delhi holds the top spot, with an AQI of 556 recorded on Wednesday./An AQI ranking between 301-500 (or above) is classified as 'hazardous' and would ""trigger a health warning of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected,"" according to Air Now./For the last four years, smog, rightly being called the fifth season of Lahore, has deprived the people of sunshine and dusk-hour charm as layers of toxic smoke engulf the horizon from November to February. The situation has worsened this year./Earlier this month, a group of students petitioned the Lahore High Court seeking a change in the AQI measurement system, and implementation of the Smog Policy."
Smog turns air 'very unhealthy' in city areas," Smog reached very unhealthy levels (as per the US Consulate readings) in Lahore on Wednesday, worsening eye and throat sores people have been suffering since the beginning of the annual menace around a week ago./According to the Met department website, (which also quoted the US Consulate readings) the level of air quality index (AQI) in Lahore was 257 (very unhealthy)./US Consulate Twitter account nevertheless indicated much higher figures at different points in the city in the morning./They showed 506 AQI at the US Consulate, 498 in Gulberg, 491 at Punjab Assembly, 489 at Liberty Market, 453 at Upper Mall, 384 in Allama Iqbal Town's Zeenat Block and 395 at Sundar Industrial Estate./Outdoor activities banned in schools/Smog or a high level of air pollution in Lahore is causing eye and throat irritation, skin rashes, besides generating or aggravating pulmonary diseases./The Punjab environment department says the practice of paddy stubble burning, mainly by the Indian Punjab farmers, is the major contributing factor in the formation of smog during October and November for the past few years./But independent sources say the permanent contributors to the unhealthy phenomenon include fuel emissions from vehicles on city roads, untreated emissions by industries, particularly steel re-rolling mills that burn used tyres and plastic waste material as an alternate to costly electricity and gas, besides the dirt. They say if crop stubble burning is one of the factors, it only adds to the huge domestic polluters contributions./Meteorologists say that calm or low wind, low temperatures and humidity during this part of the year help form smog in the highly polluted areas. Humidity keeps the pollutants suspended in the air, they say./Meanwhile, it remained partly cloudy in Lahore, keeping temperatures low and weather a bit cold. The city's maximum temperature was 25 degrees C and the minimum 15 degrees Celsius./The Met department said, a westerly wave was affecting lower parts of the country and was likely to also cover central and upper parts on Wednesday night./As a result, rain, wind/thunderstorm is expected at scattered places in south Punjab, Sindh and northeastern Balochistan, besides at isolated places in districts of upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir in the next 24 hours. Snowfall is also expected over mountain./Meanwhile, the Punjab school education department has banned outdoor sports and other activities in all the public and private schools of the province because of smog till Dec 20./Punjab Minister for School Education Murad Raas tweeted: 'No outdoor activities in all public and private schools of Punjab till December 20, 2019 due to the Air Quality./Secondly, all children should wear air filter masks during school hours and lastly, awareness sessions on environment should be held in all schools.'/A department notification addressing all the chief executive officers of the district education authorities in Punjab says: '... there will be no outdoor sports and other activities up till 20th December in all public and private schools in Punjab due to smog.'/It adds that all the students should wear masks while in the school during smog and that arrangements should also be made to create awareness among the students about air quality, prevention of smog and impact of environment on the health of human beings."
Impacts of smog on health discussed," A session titled 'How does smog affect your health?' at the CDPR (Consortium for Development Policy Research) on Wednesday discussed aspects of smog./Punjab Finance Minister Hashim Jawan Bakht said smog was an issue of air quality and it persisted all year round. 'But we must figure out where it is coming from, and how much of it is coming from the transport sector,' he said. He said that the air visual measurements had become very popular but the government also had excellent machines that were capable of giving accurate readings./'In the case of Air Visual, different areas give different concentrations, so it is important to give a rolling average of air quality. The diffusion average is what should be confirmed.' He said it was also difficult to pinpoint the sources./'We must investigate and research into different measurements in the peripheries of Lahore, etc, but we do know the biggest culprit is traffic.'/He also said that there was a lot of trans-boundary pollution coming from India and wondered if there could be talks with the Indian government regarding this problem. He said that there must be a kind of green finance./'A lot of things such as improving standardization of fuel and car engines, could have a huge impact on the petrol prices and we must see the economic aspects of that,' he said. A Euro 6 engine would lessen fuel emissions by quite a lot - what three cars emit now would be emitted by about a 100 cars if shifted to Euro 6 but this too was an expensive procedure./Lawyer Sara Hayat differed with the government narrative about the pollution coming from India. She said the winter wind was mainly westerly in Lahore. She said that while wind direction did change and some of the pollution did come from India, such as last week during an especially bad spell, this was not the norm./Geriatrician and palliative care specialist Dr Zulfiqar Mir showed a couple of documentaries about how toxic air emissions affect health, including child health./He said that particulate matter especially PM2.5 was what caused eventual organ failure or dysfunction, as the particles - 25 times smaller than a human hair - were carried into the blood stream to various organs. This was also therefore dangerous for pregnant women and fetuses would be directly transmitted with PM2.5. Illnesses such as pulmonary diseases, respiratory problems, strokes, and pneumonia were also a result of this air pollution./Dr Agha Ali Akram from LUMS said section 144 crackdowns, and the forcible conversions to zig-zag kilns were not going to be beneficial in the long run. The latter for instance could end up being discriminatory in a way, as what one kiln endured the others may not. The government should instead have caps, which could allow certain emissions to an extent but not after that - or taxes or incentives./Environment Protection Department's Ali Ijaz, Urban Unit's Khalid Sheikh and Transport Secretary Asad Rehman Gilani briefed about measures such vehicular inspection, AQI App and stoppage of burning of materials like plastic, rubber and coal to produce fuels./Activist Rafay Alam said that the government should focus on the low grade fuel emissions - a major source of pollution./'The fuel and energy issue is a federal issue, including the high content of sulphur in diesel and the sulphurization of coal,' he said. 'The rest of the world is moving on towards other kinds of policies but we are still using the command and control approach.'"
Lahore now 3rd most polluted city as air quality moves from 'hazardous' to 'unhealthy'," Lahore's air quality went from being 'hazardous' to 'unhealthy' with an Air Quality Index (AQI) ranking of 157 on Saturday, according to Air Visual./The Punjab capital, which was recorded to be the world's second most polluted city for weeks, finally slid to the third spot. Uzbekistan's Tashkent replaced Lahore as the second most polluted city, while Delhi retained its top position with a 'very unhealthy' air quality ranking according to Air Visual, which records air pollution levels across the globe in real time./The air quality ranking of Karachi - previously classified as 'unhealthy' - was recorded as 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' with an AQI of 144. The metropolis is currently the 10th most polluted city in the world, according to Air Visual./This chart shows different AQI categories and their effects on the population. - Courtesy AirNow.gov/An AQI ranking between 151-200 is classified as 'very unhealthy', according to Air Now, and may cause the entire population to experience adverse effects. 'Sensitive groups', i.e., people with lung diseases, children and elderly people, may be at greater risk./Areas with an AQI ranking between 101-150 is classified as 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' and may pose health risks to 'sensitive groups', i.e., people with lung diseases, children and elderly people. ""The general public is not likely to be affected,"" Air Now says./For the last four years, smog, rightly being called the fifth season of Lahore, has deprived the people of sunshine and dusk-hour charm as layers of toxic smoke engulf horizon from November to February./The situation became worse this year as the Punjab government, for the first time, announced the closure of schools due to dense smog. Residents accuse the government of taking insufficient measures to control the situation even as the administration insists that it is making efforts to deal with the smog./Adviser to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam, earlier this month, said Pakistan has taken measures to stop crops stubble burning, a major cause of the phenomenon, and other countries should also come forward to address it./He said that two smog checking units had been installed in Lahore and his department was also focusing on measures to increase resources to address the issue./""With the help of the World Bank the government was launching a programme to address the air quality issue,"" he said./The adviser said the smog level in India was increasing but the Pakistani government had taken measures to reduce it here. He pledged that Lahore would be made 'smog free'./Government officials blame the smog on crop burnings in India. Experts, however, say that the situation is caused by pollution in the country."
"Schools in Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad to remain closed on Friday due to 'dense smog'"," The Punjab education department on Thursday decided to keep all public and private schools in Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad closed on November 22 due to poor air quality./According to a notification issued by the provincial government, the schools will remain closed on Friday due to ""dense smog"" in the three districts./Earlier this month, the Punjab education department had prohibited holding all outdoor activities in public and private schools across the province till December 20 for the same reason./The government had directed all students to wear air filter masks during school hours. It had also decided to hold awareness sessions on environment in all schools. This is for the third time in a month that the government has decided to keep schools closed due to smog./Lahore's air quality remained 'very unhealthy' with an air quality ranking of 245 on Thursday evening, according to Air Visual's Air Quality Index (AQI)./The Punjab capital was ranked the most polluted city in the world on Thursday, according to Air Visual, which records air pollution levels across the globe in real time./For the last four years, smog, rightly being called the fifth season of Lahore, has deprived the people of sunshine and dusk-hour charm as layers of toxic smoke engulf the horizon from November to February. The situation has worsened this year./Earlier this month, a group of students petitioned the Lahore High Court seeking a change in the AQI measurement system, and implementation of the Smog Policy."
Schools in three cities shut today as smog hits Punjab," The Punjab government has decided to close all public and private schools in Lahore, Faisal­abad and Gujranwala on Fri­day (today) as air pollution worsens in these districts./The air quality in central Punjab, especially in Lahore, Faisalabad and Gujranwala, was rated as 'severe' for the last couple of days in a row. A thick grey haze covers these cities, making travel and outdoor activities both difficult and dangerous. Lahore once again became the second most polluted city in the world after India's Delhi./According to a notification issued by the school education department, schools will remain closed due to 'dense smog' in three districts, including Lahore, Faisalabad and Gujranwala./Earlier this month, the education department had prohibited holding of all outdoor activities in public and private schools across the province till Dec 20 for the same reason. The government had directed all students to wear air filter masks during school hours. It had also decided to hold awareness sessions on environment in all schools./This is for the third time in a month that the government has decided to keep schools closed due to smog - a kind of pollution caused by the mixture of smoke and fog in the air./Lahore's air quality remained 'very unhealthy' with an air quality ranking of 245 on Thursday evening, according to Air Visual's Air Quality Index (AQI). The provincial capital was ranked the most polluted city in the world on Thursday, according to Air Visual, which records air pollution levels across the globe in real time./For the last four years, smog, rightly being called the fifth season of Lahore, has deprived the people of sunshine and dusk-hour charm as layers of toxic smoke engulf the horizon from November to February. The situation has worsened this year./Earlier this month, a group of students petitioned the Lahore High Court, seeking a change in the AQI measurement system and implementation of the smog policy./The Lahore High Court on Thursday directed the Punjab government to take all precautionary measures to control smog. Justice Jawad Hassan issued the directive while disposing of a public interest petition in the light of a report submitted by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Director General Tanvir Warraich./The report said action against more than 567 industrial units had been taken and in future the government was taking every possible measure to control smog. It said recommendations of a smog commission had also been taken into consideration while adopting measures to eliminate the harmful weather."
PM tells Buzdar's foes in PTI to wait for four years," Prime Minister Imran Khan once again made it clear that Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar will complete his term as he supported him in different meetings he chaired at the CM Secretariat during his one-day visit to Lahore on Saturday./Sources said that during one of the meetings with members of the Punjab cabinet and MPAs at the CM Secretariat, the PM said that he knew everyone sitting in the meeting wanted to become the chief minister, but he would continue standing with CM Buzdar./'Those aspiring to replace Mr Buzdar should wait for the next four years,' asserted the prime minister./He said Mr Buzdar was neither living in palatial houses nor spending Rs800 million per annum on his personal security./'The reforms implemented during the PTI government's tenure have never happened before in Punjab. We need to hold seminars and publicise the reforms implemented in Punjab,' he said./During meetings with MPAs, senior government and police officials and at a press conference, Mr Khan said his government had fought with the 'mafia' during the past 15 months and survived./In separate meetings, Imran outlines decisions taken to fight pollution, assures bureaucrats their tenure of posting will be protected/He said although the 'mafia' and opposition parties were sure that the PTI government would not survive beyond a few months, but 'Pakistan has come out of the crisis and good times are round the corner'./Bureaucracy assured of tenure protection/The prime minister said the government in consultation with former bureaucrats had gone through a rigorous exercise for three weeks and posted bureaucrats at all positions on merit./He hoped that the new team of bureaucrats would streamline governance affairs and bring about a positive change in Punjab./The prime minister, however, parried a question that the bureaucracy had stopped taking bold decisions and launching new initiatives following his warning that anyone found involved in corruption would be taken to task./Mr Khan, in his earlier days, had also held meetings with the bureaucracy in Lahore and Islamabad but his ministers and other top brass continue complaining against the bureaucracy's inaction when it comes to taking decisions and launching initiatives that involved big finances./In the meeting with senior government and police officials, the prime minister told them to focus on governance and law and order. 'We need to discard the old system and mindset in Naya Pakistan,' he said./Promising that the tenure of the new team would be protected, Mr Khan demanded that the bureaucracy take decisions without taking political pressure into account and bring about real change in Punjab./'It is now the bureaucracy's duty to take all decisions on merit and refuse any illegitimate order of any politician,' he said./He said the bureaucrats' good governance would eventually help the government to attain economic stability. Mr Khan also congratulated his economic team for steering the country out of the crisis and leading it towards economy stability./Steps to curb smog/The prime minister chaired a meeting on the issue of smog and environmental pollution. He later told a press conference that his government was giving priority to controlling the smog and measures 'should have been taken decades ago as recommendations were always available'./Lamenting that smog and environmental pollution is severely affecting the health of elderly persons and children, the prime minister explained that the cutting of 70 per cent trees in Lahore, traffic pollution, burning of crops' residue in Indian Punjab as well as thick smoke emitted by oil furnaces and brick-kilns were contributing to environmental degradation./Considering these life-threatening factors, the prime minister said five decisions had been taken to avert the pollution crisis gradually in the next three years./He said the government had decided to import Euro 4 oil (instead of Euro 2 oil) that had much less chemicals and could guarantee lessen air pollution by 90 per cent. The government would convert buses on CNG from the beginning of the next calendar year./Mr Khan said oil refineries would be given three years to improve their technologies to better refine crude oil and added duty on scrubber would also be abolished. He said brick-kiln owners would be offered loans on six per cent to convert kilns on the zigzag technology./He said the government would import machinery at a cost of Rs300 million that would uproot the crops residue, which could later be sold./The prime minister said trees serve as a major resistant to pollution and sapling would be planted on 60,000 kanal land in Lahore. 'The people will see a clear-cut decline in environmental pollution in the next three years,' he said./Mocks opposition for anti-govt march/The prime minister said previous governments with experienced teams had increased the country's debt by four times but the economic team of the PTI worked hard and steered the country out of the fiscal crisis./Afraid for being held accountable for corruption and money laundering, Mr Khan said the opposition parties joined hands and marched on Islamabad under the leadership of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazalur Rehman. 'The marchers did not even know why they were marching on Islamabad,' he said and alleged the Maulana was not going to 'conquer' the capital but win a 'diesel permit'./The prime minister said the government had allowed former PM Nawaz Sharif to go abroad for treatment purely on humanitarian grounds since the medical reports presented to him explained that the patient was on the verge of death./'Since the court has sought Mr Sharif's medical reports every two weeks, let's see what will come out,' the prime minister said./Meanwhile, the PM attended a programme to sign a service level agreement between the Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) and major private commercial banks for rapid agri loans./He said 95 per cent farmers had 12 acres of agriculture land and they would be facilitated to get loans by just getting their land record verified."
EPD helpless to enforce ban on industrial activity," The Environment Protection Department (EPD) has yet to take action against the industrial units polluting environment despite a Punjab government's Nov 26 notification banning the industry activity to curb air pollution./The directive stated industrial activities would be banned in Faisalabad, Kasur, Lahore, Gujranwala and Sheikhupura till Dec 20. However, the directive is not being implemented as scores of sizing, dyeing and other industrial units are working in Faisalabad city areas./Smoke can be seen billowing out of an industry unit on the Sargodha Road. The unit is few kilometres from the office of the deputy commissioner and the environment protection department as well./Department officials said the monitoring of these units were underway and the government would be approached for action against violators./Ban was imposed to check air pollution/They said without the police and the district administration they might not enforce the ban on industrial units as most of the industrialists had patronization of politicians and the bureaucrats./They said it was the duty all officials to play their role to keep the masses safe from the impact of pollution./'We'll not move against these units actively fearing the wrath of industrialists as a couple of weeks ago the head of EPD Faisalabad was transferred from here as he tried to work against the units polluting the environment,' the official said./An industrialist said they were also feeling the heat of bad environment but they had also to meet their export orders. He said how they could meet international competitors because of such ban orders./'We'll not be in a position to give salaries to labourers by keeping our units closed as the stuck refunds have badly affected our cash flow,' he added./Central chairman of the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturer Association Haji Salamat Ali said financial problems of exporters were multiplying due to inordinate delays in payment of sales tax refunds as their liquidity continues to stuck while the Federal Board of Revenue did not honoure its commitments to release the sales tax refunds within 72 hours of filing of refund claims. He said pending sales tax refund claims of exporters should immediately be released./EDP Deputy Director Farhat Abbas did not comment on the situation."
District admin to seal smog-causing units," The district administration will seal the units burning plastic, old cloths and tyres in the boilers of sizing and other industries./Issuing directions to the environment protection department (EPD), Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali said he had taken a serious notice of air pollution and directed the respective departments to take stern legal action against the extensive smog-causing industries and brick kilns./He said he had expressed his anguish over the air pollution and smog which was hazardous for environment. He said the factory and brick kiln owners should be made to follow the rules and regulations to avoid the possible smog situation./He said ban on smog-causing brick kilns should be got implemented in letter and spirit. He asked the EPD officials for carrying out regular monitoring of the industrial units and legal action should be taken against the violators without any discrimination./He said precautionary measures should be followed to save the citizens from lungs, eyes and throat diseases./The DC also directed for ensuring compliance of ban on burning solid waste, tyres, plastic goods and crop residue./The deputy commissioner directed the monitoring staff to stop this practice and factories should be sealed in case of violations./He asked the factory owners to follow the law in the larger interest of the public and get their machinery rectified to avoid smog."
Smog and oxygen bar," A THICK blanket of toxic smog has overwhelmed Lahore owing to high pollution levels in recent weeks. To inhale a draught of fresh air has become very difficult. Without unpolluted oxygen, it is very difficult to live. On the other side one can drink purified water but air is not in their control./With air pollution linked to diseases, including lung cancer and acute respiratory infections, pollution levels in Lahore have reached alarming levels./These days Lahore's air quality index (AQI) and PM2.5 air pollution is 230 which is unhealthy and extremely dangerous. The acceptable AQI level should be under 100./It is the duty of the government, stakeholders and civil society to introduce oxygen bars or similar outlets like other countries to provide relief to citizens./Further, the government should take strict action to stop annual burning of crop residuals, order bricks kiln owners to introduce zigzag technology to reduce emission of gigantic quantities of smoke, and other measures to reduce smoke emission in the metropolis."
"Air pollution: Five factories sealed, two men held in crackdown"," The district administration sealed on Tuesday five factories for releasing smoke and polluting the air and got two persons arrested./Deputy Commissioner Suhail Ashraf told reporters the district administration had started an anti-smog campaign and in this regard an action was being taken against the factories emitting smoke in the air./A team under the supervision of City Assistant Commissioner Usman Sikandar Hanjra inspected Makki Raod, Khayali and other areas and sealed Saif Steel Works,, Iftikhar Silver Steel Works, Amanat Metal Works and Waqas Metal Works for polluting the environment./The DC said the locals were suffering from respiration, throat, eyes, lungs and other diseases due to smog which originated from the poisonous smoke of factories and kilns. He said it was the duty of all of us to save the environment. Factory and kiln owners should cooperate with the district administration and use filters to lessen carbon./The DC also directed the assistant commissioner, environment department, Metropolitan Corporation and municipal committee officers to take a strict action against the factories those were causing smog./Also, Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) office-bearers expressed their concerns over the failure of the Environment Protection Department to stem the tide of pollution and demanded that the prime minister and the chief minister take action against the environment department./GCCI President Mian Umar Saleem, senior vice president Irfan Suhail and vice president Muhammad Asghar Butt said in a statement that the ratio of pollution in Gujranwala had increased by 587 points which was very dangerous./FIA: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) arrested on Tuesday 11 human agents in different areas of the region./FIA Deputy Director Roy Nasrullah told Dawn the agency started a campaign against human trafficking and formed different teams to arrest human agents./Teams under the supervision of Assistant Director Ahmar Sandhu and Station House Officer Hassan Farooq arrested Anwar, Tufail, Jamshed, Shakeel, Zafar, Manzoor, Kashif, Yasir, Javed, Umar and Shaukat for sending people to Iran, Turkey, Greece and other countries."
'Environment tax'," Our Indus river is the second most polluted river in the world. Like old newspapers, let everyone collect plastics, deposit them and get rewards./We don't take air pollution seriously. Smoke, gas, carbon, methane, uranium, lead, mercury, coal, ash etc., are from power and coal plants and spread hundreds of miles, polluting our rivers, oceans, underground aquifers and our soil. Our rivers are still being exploited for sand and gravel./Fighting these issues require a will first and then funds. Can't we make our ministry of climate change the most important one? As far as funds are concerned, a two per cent environment tax on the use of fossil fuel usage and industries that pollute will be a good starting point./There is money in the bank for the 'dam account'. It can be used to start off and can be returned in a year./But the awareness and will is not there. The world will not help us unless we help ourselves./Don't we want to leave Pakistan a better place for our children?"
"All provinces performed poorly in health sector, says PMA"," Expressing concern over the state of healthcare in the country, the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) stated on Tuesday that the year 2019 saw further deterioration in the health sector as there were major outbreaks of infectious diseases across the country, which reported 117 cases of polio./'Polio remains endemic despite over 100 rounds of the vaccination being carried out in the past decade. Last year, the polio programme seemed to be on the brink of eradicating transmission of the wild poliovirus. In the year 2019, however, as many as 117 cases have been reported (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 83, Sindh 19, Balochistan 9, Punjab 6) as compared to 12 cases in 2018.)/'This sorry state also attracted criticism from international monitoring bodies which observed that there is lack of political unity behind the polio programme,' says a PMA press release./The association also shared concern on the dengue outbreak and described it as 'vicious this year'./'Around 50,000 cases have already been reported. This is almost double the number of people infected with the virus in the past decade. This shows the negligence of our rulers, they have done nothing to combat this disease,' it said./The number of HIV/AIDS patients in Pakistan, according to the PMA, currently stands at 165,000 whereas 9,565 new cases had been detected in 2019./During the outgoing year, Rato Dero, a small town in Larkana, alone reported 895 cases of AIDS. Of them, 754 were children and 141 adults./'From April to November 30 this year, about 37,558 people have undergone HIV screening in Larkana, out of them 1,195 have reported with suspected presence of the virulent germs,' it says./The outbreak of extremely drug resistant typhoid in Karachi and the interior of Sindh, the association says, affected people in thousands./'It's a serious water-borne infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi that spreads through contaminated food and water.'/In addition, there have been confirmed cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Balochistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab./'CCHF is widely spreading in Pakistan. The deadly Congo [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic] virus has 'attacked' Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan, killing at least 20 people this year,' it said./It also highlighted the reasons leading to the fast spread of hepatitis in the country currently having 15 million infected people, calling for government focus on prevention, ensuring that infection control practices were in place at all healthcare facilities and eliminating quackery./The association refers to the World Bank estimates according to which Pakistan's annual burden of disease due to outdoor air pollution accounts for 22,000 premature adult deaths and 163,432 disability-adjusted life year lost, while that for indoor pollution accounts for 40 million cases of acute respiratory infections and 28,000 deaths/year./'This is the worst situation due to air pollution but again no significant change has been observed. Even the Sindh High Court ordered thrice improvement in this respect but no serious initiative was seen on part of the government. The relevant laws have never been implemented, including the Prohibition of No Smoking Law 2002,' the association regrets./It called upon the government to invest more on disease prevention, including provision of clean water and safe sanitation and sewerage systems./'The WHHO recommends that the health budget of any country should at least be 6 per cent of its national Gross Domestic Product. In our case, the health budget, despite repeated PMA pleas and reminders to the government, has remained less than one per cent./'The association believes that proper planning, political will, honesty, increase in health budget and its proper allocation and above all the consolidated preventive measures can improve the health delivery system in 2020,' it concludes."
'Lahore needs air quality management system to fight smog'," When it comes to air pollution control, the focus is on the technological intervention to resolve the issue, but very little attention is being paid on social interventions, which can also help fight pollution to a great extent./'When we talk about social interventions for cleaner air, it is about people's role in controlling pollution like waste management, solid waste burning control etc,' says environment engineer Dr James Schauer, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA./Dr Schauer was in Lahore on a brief tour to interact with policymakers, government representatives and students and the people for an exchange of ideas on air pollution and to find common grounds to counter the menace in Pakistan./'We need to educate the public about how their role is important in the fight against pollution. They should know the impact of burning waste at home; they should know how the crop [stubble] burning can pollute the environment.'/About Lahore smog, he said, crop stubble burning by farmers to reclaim the land for new crop could be one source of air pollution. 'But, most of the pollution sources are local. Vehicle-emitted pollution, industry emissions, house and solid waste burning -- the local sources of air pollution are endless.'/So, the people of Lahore should focus more on social as well as technological interventions to achieve a cleaner air regime./Dr Schauer stresses on having in place air quality management systems to find the right solutions./Elaborating air quality management system, he says there is a need to have programmes to monitor air pollution, and more importantly to understand its sources and to quantify air pollution data. These are a major steps in air pollution management./So far Lahore is concerned, it has placed, though insufficient, only air quality monitoring systems./'These monitoring tolls tell us how bad the air pollution is and pollution in terms of indexes but they do not tell us where it comes from, and of what type and source. At the end of day, these monitors don't help us to form regulations,' said the expert./To Dr Schaeur, data collection is a key to devise an effective air pollution management strategy. 'It will help us [in determining] what should we be focusing on and it is [also] a way of validating if we have a policy and if our policies are effective.'/Once we know about what the sources of air pollution are, we can have effective policies./But, some sources of pollution are no more a secret./'We all know that vehicles emit smoke and pollute the air; we know about industry emissions, dust and burning of fossil and solid fuels are the pollutants.'/'Having quantitative data gives us a push towards reliable solutions,' he said, giving the example of US, where data helped the government to fight air pollution despite having enormous industry and vehicle emissions./'In the US, we burn a lot of fossil fuel but we have clean air … that has been made possible by putting in place emission control technologies, that have been made possible by finding data and then right solutions, not wrong solutions.'/Dr Schauer proves with scientific data that having clean technology does not destroy the economy. 'Instead, it improves the economy. For example, health benefits of air pollution control can be enormous and improve overall economy.'/He sees air pollution as the most pressing issue of the day. He supports a proactive approach to fight air pollution through collaboration between scientists, the public, policymakers and industry because 'air matters every time; this is what we breathe every time.'"
Climate and health," THE COP25 conference in Madrid last month ended without much progress in terms of coming up with either additional finances for countries battling severe effects of climate change, or an alternative carbon market. The countries present expressed only ritualistic commitment to continue working towards the goals of greenhouse gases reduction set in the previous edition of the Paris climate conference./However, the WHO used the occasion to unveil its first-ever report on the resilience of health systems vis-à-vis climate change, The WHO Health and Climate Change Survey: Tracking Global Progress, to highlight the neglected link between health and climate change. Rising global temperature impacts social and environmental determinants of health, including clean air, potable water, sufficient food and secure shelter, increasing the global disease burden./Increased temperatures contribute to higher levels of pollens and allergens in the atmosphere that cause respiratory diseases like asthma while the ozone layer's depletion contributes to higher prevalence of skin cancers. Hot weather causes dehydration; in areas where water is scarce, kidney stones and other health complications may arise./Increased frequency of extreme weather events also contributes to the disease burden. For example, between 2010 and 2015, Pakistan was ravaged by severe flooding that caused deaths in the thousands, while also contaminating freshwater sources, increasing the prevalence of water-borne diseases and creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects, besides damaging public property./Inaction on climate change will only exacerbate the problem./Meanwhile, carbon emissions into the atmosphere also lower the nutritional density of food crops. Climate change induces drought leading to disruption of the supply and production of food items, eventually resulting in food insecurity and malnutrition./With malnutrition levels already alarmingly high in Pakistan, the government's inaction on climate change will only exacerbate the problem. According to the WHO, the effects of climate change can cause up to 250,000 additional deaths between 2030 and 2050 by a combination of malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and heat stress, costing the global health sector up to $4 billion by 2030./WHO also estimates that reducing carbon emissions in line with the 2014 Paris Agreement could save about a million lives by 2050 through action on reducing air pollution alone. The resilience report also shows that in countries where climate and health assessments were conducted, heat stress, injury or death from extreme weather events, food- and water-borne diseases were identified as the most common climate-change-related health risk indictors./The WHO report on health systems resilience pointed to the lack of capacity and money to incorporate health-related factors into climate action strategies. The report revealed that about half the countries surveyed had developed national health and climate change strategies or plans, but less than one-fifth reported high levels of implementation. At least 10 per cent of countries cited lack of resources as the reason for not fully implementing their own national plans./The report stated that most governments experienced difficulties in accessing international climate finance for health-related projects. Moreover, 75pc respondents reported lack of information on climate finance opportunities, 60pc said health actors were disconnected from climate finance processes while over 50pc cited lack of existing expertise within health systems to even draft proposals for climate finance funding cycles./The report further stated that very few countries were able to exploit the synergies between carbon-emission-reducing and environmental-con­tamination projects. Only 20pc countries repo­rted clear collaboration between the health sector and other sectors involved in climate cha­nge mitigation work, eg, power generation. This means that potential health gains accruing from cutting down carbon emissions are rarely reflected in national climate strategies, with only one-fifth of Nationally Determined Contri­butions mentioning health in the context of emission reduction./The WHO resilience report ends with a clarion call for prioritising health in climate change plans, stating: 'For the Paris Agreement to be effective to protect people's health, all levels of government need to prioritise building health system resilience to climate change…'./In Pakistan, though the climate change debate is clearly headed in the right direction, in the ensuing conversation and plans the subject of health still remains elusive. The COP25 in Madrid and the WHO report only remind us of the critical importance of factoring health into national climate change plans and nationally determined contributions and commitments."
"5.13m trees to be planted in four years, LHC told"," The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) on Thursday submitted latest master plan of the provincial metropolis till 2050 to the Lahore High Court in addition to details of a project about plantation of 5.13 million trees during the next four years./A report submitted by the LDA also revealed that a new legislation was on the cards for mandatory plantation of at least 10 trees in one-kanal house./The LDA also presented details about functional, planning and administrative boundaries of Lahore city./Earlier, Chief Justice Mamoon Rashid expressed concern over felling of trees in different parts of the city and questioned performance of the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA)./The CJ admonished a PHA official for his ignorance about trees felled by a hotel management on Egerton Road./Expressing concern over growing boundary of Lahore, the CJ observed that the city now should be better named as 'LDA'./Representing a petitioner, Advocate Azhar Siddique said no action had been taken to control smog and smoke-emitting industrial units. He said the government could not show any progress except making committees./The chief justice warned the government authorities of strict action if effective measures were not taken to eliminate environment pollution and smog. He summoned a progress report on the next hearing./WATER: Justice Shahid Karim of the Lahore High Court on Thursday sought recommendations from the environment department for preservation of clean water and control of air pollution./The judge also directed the provincial government to publicise actions taken by a water commission formed by the court./The judge observed that millions of gallon water was being preserved on a daily basis with the initiatives of the commission."
How to achieve clean-up of Karachi's Nehr-i-Khayyam," THE Sindh chief minister has recently given his consent for signing an agreement with a private party for the development of Clifton's Nehr-i-Khayyam. He said that this would be a gift to the people of Karachi and it would be for families to have picnic and enjoy sailing in boats./Mr Shah needs to keep the gift aspect in the background because clean-up of a water body is a very time-consuming and complicated process./If the people of Karachi use the Nehr while its water quality is poor, the people will suffer from waterborne diseases, water-washed diseases, water-based diseases and water-related vector-borne diseases./Contains septage, not water/A visit to the Nehr shows that it is an extremely polluted water body. It emits very strong pungent smell and does not contain water. It contains septage, which is a combination of liquid and solid material as found in septic tanks and cesspools. Septage contains four major types of human pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms: bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths./Its physical characteristics make septage difficult to treat. High levels of grease, grit, hair and large solids in septage can clog pipes and pumps. The anaerobic nature of septage results in the presence of odorous compounds. Foaming can also be a problem when air is blown into the septage. The proponents intend to establish waste-water treatment plant for septage treatment. This will not be feasible and should not be done. Putting septage in a municipal waste-water treatment plant will spoil the pumps and other mechanical equipment./The Nehr water in its present state can be a source of waterborne diseases/Currently, the Nehr receives the raw municipal waste water. The site visit also showed that it has almost no water flows. The constituents were stagnant, indicating that its inlet and outlet are probably blocked. The bottom constituents of the water body seem to be comprising of odour-emitting substances. Water quality improvement, therefore, will be the major component of the Nehr's development./Karachi does not have a proper sewerage system. Wherever system exists, the 'invert' levels of sewer pipes were never maintained properly. Waste water at the farthest upstream end cannot flow down to the final outfall point, unhindered. Sewer pipes are now laid in ad hoc fashion. To secure a way out, the storm-water drains are used for conveying waste water. Besides, as is the present case, the sewer pipes drain in the Nehr to dispose of the waste water./Clean-up strategy/The first thing the sponsors should do is to stop flow of waste water in the Nehr. At the same time, a detailed survey should be carried out to see that there are no other inlet pipes, draining in the water body, especially the industrial effluent./The second step should be that of sediment dredging and removal of solid waste. The dredging will be a problem for workers and for the people living in the adjacent buildings./Still, this will not be enough. Since septage is hazardous to human health, it must be stabilised with lime. Lime or other alkaline material is added to the septage to raise the pH to 12 for a minimum of 30 minutes. While the septage characteristics vary, approximately 20 to 25 pounds of lime are used for every 1,000 gallons of septage (2.4 to 3.0 kg per 1,000 litres)./The pH must be measured to ensure that pH 12 is achieved and maintained for 30 minutes. After pH 12 is reached, pH should be measured every 15 minutes using a pH meter. If the pH drops below 12 during the 30-minute period after mixing, more lime or other alkali must be added. The pH of the mixture must be maintained at 12 or greater for a full 30 minutes. The septage can then be disposed of by applying at 20 centimetres depths on sand beds./Canal should be filled with fresh water/Once the canal bed is cleaned, the third step should be securing the canal linings through stone pitching, and embankment reconstruction./The fourth and important step is that of filling the canal with water. The sponsors say that 40 per cent of the water that will be filled will be treated waste water. In Karachi, there is currently no waste water treatment that is working at over 90pc of treatment efficiency, which produces treated waste water of acceptable quality. The use of treated waste water will mean the use of 'raw waste water'. This will spoil the water quality and will be a waste of time and money./The sponsors must not use waste water. The canal should be filled with fresh water. It is admitted that obtaining fresh water will be a problem, but then, there is no way out, other than to pray for rains, heavy rains./Once the Nehr is filled with fresh water that will not be the end of the story. Since the water body has almost no flows, it means, over a period of time, the water quality will slowly deteriorate. To prevent this, the aeration technology, commonly used in Bangkok for this purpose, shall be adopted./Well-designed cage rotors, fabricated locally, which the writer used at the North Karachi aerated lagoons waste-water treatment plant, will do the job. Inspection of the water body, once the work is completed, would show the number of cage rotors that will be required and their mounting and placement details./During operation of the cage rotors, the public should be kept away, as aerosols created by the splash of water, produced by the cage rotors, would be injurious to human health, upon inhalation./Construction activities for dredging, septage removal, solid waste cartage and other activities at the site will involve the use of heavy machinery and trucks. It will produce noise, vibration, create air pollution, create muddy runoff, safety hazards and traffic congestion. Environmental protection measures will be required as integral parts of the engineering works./An environmental assessment of the project will be required. While the environmental impact assessment (EIA) is commonly used in Sindh to assess the impacts and monitor mitigation activities, the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is used globally./The chief minister may ask the people of Karachi to enjoy the scenic beauty of the Nehr only when its water quality meets required guideline values./The writer served for five years as director, Sindh Environmental Protection Agency."
Diesel gushing out of overturned tanker causes big fire," A big fire broke out on Monday at a garbage dump under which considerable quantity of diesel, gushing out of an overturned oil tanker, had accumulated./Panicked residents of nearby localities and villages rushed to the spot, locally known as Massan turning on the outskirts of Kandhkot town, to extinguish the fire that had caused severe air pollution in a vast area around the garbage dump./The oil tanker carrying 60,000 litres of diesel had overturned at Saki turning located along Thull Road on Friday. People had thronged the spot to collect the flowing diesel in pots, plastic bags, buckets etc until the local administration diverted the flow into the closest opening of the area's drain. People were seen collecting diesel from various openings of the drain along its long route over the last three days./On Monday, a fire suddenly broke out at the garbage dump at Massan turning and the thick black smoke coming out of it caused severe pollution in the area. It later transpired that the flowing diesel had accumulated under the heap of garbage and when someone tried to destroy the garbage by torching it, the fire intensified swiftly upon reaching pool of diesel underneath."
'Chest diseases on the rise due to air pollution'," Health exp­erts at a gathering at the Wetland Centre in the area of Sandspit have expressed concern over the growing environmental degradation being experienced across the country and urged the people to demonstrate civic sense and social responsibility by adopting nature-friendly practices./Organised by the Chest Society of Pakistan (CSP), the event marked the launch of an upcoming conference titled 'Chest Con 2020' with plantation of mangrove saplings./Sharing how air quality is causing death and disease across the world, speakers said more than seven million people died prematurely due to air pollution. This worrisome situation, they noted, could be changed for the better if humans started making greater effort in keeping their surrounding environment clean./'We can save many lives by just being considerate towards our environment. It's this same concern that we wanted to show through this plantation event chosen for the launch of Chest Con 2020,' said Dr Nisar Ahmad Rao, CSP president and head of the Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases./Highlighting concern over pollution, he said degrading quality of air and water posed great threat to public health./'We have to address the pollution challenge seriously in order to improve public health especially chest health. It's unfortunate that little awareness exists on this issue. Perhaps, this is the reason why Pakistan has been included in the list of 10 countries most at risk of climate change.' He also spoke about how marine forests helped tackle the threat of climate change./The audience was informed that the theme of the conference would be 'Healthy lungs healthy life' and it would have 14 workshops./Several foreign and local experts are participating in the conference."
Climate lockdown?," SOME have forcefully attached a silver lining to the coronavirus epidemic. With human activity on a lockdown, the planet is healing, they say./There is no evidence to label the pressing global crisis as 'nature's revenge': the idea that humans have brought Mother Earth to a tipping point, and she is now fighting back. Apart from knowing that the pandemic has its epicentre in China, we cannot really assume whether or not it is part of nature's 'cleansing' ritual./What we do have complete certainty on is that humans are primarily responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions, and that this in turn causes global warming. As provinces, states and entire nations are forced into lockdown, greenhouse gas emissions have fallen because schools are closed, many distracting avenues such as malls and restaurants are shut, factories have been bolted, international and national sports and entertainment events have been postponed, and travel has been curtailed./According to climate campaigners, global air traffic decreased by 4.3 per cent in February. Controlling the spread of Covid-19 in China forcefully reduced emissions by 15pc to 40pc across key industrial sectors. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air has said that the reduction in emissions is equivalent to 200 million tons of carbon dioxide, which is more than half of what the UK emits in an entire year, or what Argentina, Egypt and Vietnam emit in one year./Air pollution is estimated to kill over 7m people a year./Air pollution is estimated to annually kill over seven million people globally through exposure to fine particulate matter, which is highly dangerous for our lungs. China's ministry of ecology and environment announced that the number of 'good quality air days' in Hubei province increased by 21.5pc in February, compared to last year. Temporarily improved air quality over two months in China can prevent between 50,000 to 75,000 premature deaths, as per Prof Marshall Burke at Stanford University. So far, Covid-19 has taken the lives of up to 3,255 people in China. The aim here is not to undermine human fatalities due to the virus, but to highlight how deadly a killer air pollution is./Other environmentalists have reported that fine particulate matter has decreased by 40pc in San Francisco, 28pc in New York, and 32pc in Seattle, compared to last year. Meanwhile, researchers at Columbia University say that carbon monoxide, another greenhouse gas mostly emitted from cars, has reduced by nearly 50pc in New York as traffic is down by an estimated 35pc./According to the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5P satellite, which measures concentrations of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels fell drastically in northern Italy in recent days. A potent greenhouse gas that affects the respiratory system, NO2 is emitted primarily from vehicles, diesel-powered construction equipment, and power plants. High levels of NO2 can be extremely dangerous for those impacted by a virus which cripples the respiratory system./All these changes are temporary, and in light of the pandemic, cannot even be termed good news. They will most likely jump back as countries race to recover once the immediate threat dissipates. As environmentalist Bill McKibben writes: 'No environmentalist should welcome a crisis, but they can learn from it...'/The epidemic has drained stock markets and is threatening to plummet nations into economic recession. Bloomberg Economics estimates it could cost the global economy up to $2.7 trillion in lost output. An epidemic enforced greenhouse gas emission reduction framework is temporary and not sustainable. The promised recovery stimulus packages suggest that as soon as the epidemic is under control, an upsurge of carbon-intensive projects to boost economies will incite 'retaliatory pollution'. With competing concerns such as debt, joblessness and recession, em­­ission reduction will be brushed to the curb./It is imperative that climate change be considered a deadly threat to the human race, expected to kill millions of people as it acts as a poverty multiplier, induces involuntary migration, exacerbates extreme weather events, spreads diseases, and threatens food security. We need a strict and sustained transition to a carbon-neutral economy, not short-term reductions in emissions, if we wish to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal under the Paris Agreement. Governments should remember green measures they can take, such as tying emission reduction actions to the bailout of airlines, or even encouraging large companies to let some of their employees work from home./It is unfortunate that it has taken a pandemic to make us realise that governments, companies and societies can function differently, and what these lifestyle changes can mean for the planet and human health. Once the epidemic is under control, we must remember these clearer skies, and embrace sustainable and eco-friendly practices."
Punjab notes: What does afflict the earth: greed or disease?," 'Earth has a disease called man', says Friedrich Nietzsche in his book 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' in nineteenth century when the Western society was on a high in the wake of Industrial Revolution that had not only swept across Europe but was also in a process of getting itself imprinted on the rest of the world through the phenomenal advance of colonialism. Isn't it surprising that he diagnosed the symptoms of the malady very early when capitalism, propelled by introduction of mechanical mode of production, was emerging as a universal vision of society with boundless possibilities./Capitalism in its infancy was marked by two distinct but interlinked philosophic concepts: one, nature has infinite resources, and two, man's mission is the conquest of nature. These concepts were not entirely new as they had been espoused by ancient wise men and religious traditions in the man's unceasing struggle for survival in the face of hostile natural forces. What was new about it was the exponentially increased knowledge of manifest and hidden natural resources and enhanced human capacity to subjugate the nature and exploit what it held./The notion of limitless resources was in fact born of ignorance. Scientific knowledge has convincingly proved in empirical terms that the planet we live on is finite. So how can our finite world provide us with infinite resources? Consequently how can we afford infinite consumption in a finite world as has been relentlessly advocated by capitalism? Craving for limitless consumption is a result of cultural habit inculcated in consumers by big business in its urge of unrestrained expansion. Such an attitude has obfuscated our understanding of crucial fact that if limited resources of our planet are exploited relentlessly, the act would not only accelerate the process of depletion but also damage the balance that sustains life. Why is the illusion of limitless supply of resources maintained and touted? The answer is greed which is euphemistically called profit. It's profit for big business and corporations. What would happen if we insist to live beyond what discreet use of resources allows? The destruction of what sustains us! The destruction is already visible in the shape of impoverished world we at the moment have. Just look at the scene; environment damaged, air polluted, seas contaminated, ground water poisoned, sanctuaries of wildlife encroached, millions of species pushed to extinction./The conundrum is that if the existing capitalist system openly recognizes that our planet has limited resources, it would have by its own logic to adjust to a new perspective; it cannot produce endlessly. It would have to recognize that greed is a disease. The admission would further imply non-emphasis on mass and conspicuous consumption resulting in the curtailment of profit, the raison d'eter of capitalist enterprise. Can a system sound its own death knell? Obviously not."
Closure of Jamrud steel mills improves air quality," One would think that it is the coronavirus-induced lockdown that brought steel mills and foundries to a grinding halt in Jamrud, Khyber tribal district, and thus, leading to a visible improvement in air quality in the surrounding residential areas, as is the case with most cities in the country./However, the residents say the foundries had stopped working under an administrative order two months agofollowing complaints by the residents of Phase-7 in Hayatabad Town Peshawar adjacent to Jamrud about the unbearable air pollution in the localities./They told Dawn that steel mills and foundries in the midst of residential quarters in Shakass, Jamrud, once a barren plain, hadpolluted the air to the point of suffocation and they had no option but to seek the government's action to stop the maddening activity./'Air quality has visibly improved since steel mills and foundries have stopped operations,' said Dr Ikram, a resident of Phase 7./He said steel mills and foundries in Shakass emitted thick black smoke deteriorating air quality./Administrative order on pollution complaints led to suspension of operation two months ago/The resident said only three units were operating./'Black smoke emitting from mills enveloped our homes and this intolerable condition forced people to bring the issue to the notice of Health Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra,' he said./Air pollution has enormously dropped in the provincial capital due to the coronavirus lockdown./Residents of Shakass said they were more exposed to air and noise pollution./They said the steel mills and foundries put up in the middle of residential quarters emitted black smoke and that the air quality had deteriorated to its worst levels in recent years./'The air was suffocating and the people were struggling to breathe,' said Akbar Afridi, a native of Shakass./He said the residents felt better since steel mills suspended operation in Shakass./Following receiving complaints the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took action against the steel mills and foundries in Shakass. A total of 11 mills and foundries were served notices, sealed or prosecuted under the Environmental Protection Act, 2014 and none of the mills had proper pollution control system./Director General EPA Dr Mohammad Bashir told Dawn that the agency's team visited mills in Shakass and several units were prosecuted in the Environmental Protection Tribunal./He said notices were served on the mills' owners in Feb and March./Dr Bashir said mills and foundries operating in Shakass area violated environmental quality standards and the agency sealed them./'These mills were major factors behind air pollution in the surrounding residential areas and people had received relief since steel factories stopped operations,' he said./Dr Bashir said the environmental protection officers had served notices to three units to stop all running activities until the installation of proper pollution control system within 45 days. He said cases against three mills were under trial in EPT, adding that EPA staff could not conduct follow up visits of the foundries due to lockdown./Notices served on foundries and mills included Prime Steel Re-rolling Mill, Royal Foundry, Mustafa Foundry, Shah Steel Mills, Nawab Steel Mills, Mohmand Modeling Works, Hassan Steel Mills, Al Haj Foundry, Afridi Steel Mills, Iftikhar Steel Mills and MK Steel Mills, said an official document./Dr Bashir said the reopening of the foundries was subject to the installation of proper pollution control system and three owners had requested to relax order for 45 days to install the system./Sources said foundries were installed in Shakass before the merger of Fata with KP and at that time, the region came under the administrative control of the federal government. Environmental laws of the province have also been extended to merged tribal districts./The sources said the EPA had proposed to the KP government time and again to make legislation for land zoning in the province./'The problem is that no definition of residential area exists as there is no legal tool to stop people from converting lands into residential, commercial or industrial activities,' an official said."
Pakistan embraces zig-zag technology-led brick kilns to fight air pollution," Haji Parvez has been in the business of brick kilns for the past 16 years. He owns a brick kiln in Raiwind on the bypass of Sue-e-Asal road. For 14 years, Parvez had a traditional brick kiln that was a Fixed Chimney Bull's Trench Kiln (FCBTN) type and it was only in 2018 that he decided to convert it to the cleaner zig-zag technology./He had his reasons for doing so. Previously, on the traditional brick kiln, Parvez couldn't enhance brick production. ""The brick kiln had a maximum capacity of producing 30,000 bricks. On the other hand, through the smart zig-zag technology, I can easily enhance the production from 30,000-50,000 bricks daily.""/Parvez says, ""When one of my friends, Haji Islam installed the first brick kiln on zig-zag technology, I could see the benefits that he was reaping at low cost, and that motivated me to convert my kiln from traditional to zig-zag technology in 2018.""/The conversion had cost Parvez over two million rupees but now the cost to convert has substantially reduced to one million. ""The cost reduced as brick kiln owners engineered and introduced a fan/blower made of fiber glass that can withstand high temperatures,"" informs Parvez./Difference between traditional and zig-zag technology-driven brick kiln/The real difference between the traditional Fixed Chimney Bulls Trench Kiln (FCBTK) and the zig-zag technology driven brick kiln is that in the former the placement of bricks is done in a straight pattern, whereas in the latter the bricks are placed in a zig-zag pattern. The zig-zag pattern allows to efficiently manoeuvre the air for heating purposes./Labourers stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern./Furthermore, the black soot that comes out of the traditional brick kiln is due to inefficient burning of fuel, whereas, the zig-zag setting of bricks and continuous feeding of small quantities of coal improves fuel efficiency. As a result, the emitted smoke from the kilns employing zig-zag technology is white coloured and with significantly low air pollution levels. The Induced-Draught zig-zag kiln type also has a fan, which allows to control the air, thereby making the coal burning process even more efficient./There is also a strong business case for converting to zig-zag technology. It reduces coal consumption by 20 per cent, carbon emissions by 40-60pc, produces more A-grade bricks, and brick production can be enhanced as well, says a research by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), a regional intergovernmental organisation working in the Hindu Kush Himalayas as part of the UN's Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) initiative. The organisation was also the first to bring the idea to introduce fuel efficient brick kilns running on zig-zag technology to Pakistan./The CCAC initiative aims to improve the climate and air quality, and removing Short Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCP) from the atmosphere, with a focus on the brick-making sector./In this regard, the ICIMOD, being the lead partner for the CCAC Brick Initiative, helped implement cleaner brick production in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal by working with the governments as well as the private sector in the four countries. And although Tunnel Kilns are the cleanest technology to-date when it comes to brick production, due to the high construction costs involved and complex operations, zig-zag technology was deemed a more viable option in Pakistan./Bidya Banmali Pradhan, who heads ICIMOD's Air Pollution Solutions Programme, highlights the benefits of zig-zag technology vis à vis the Fixed Chimney Bulls Trench Kiln (FCBTKs). ""The brick kilns running on zig-zag technology consume 20pc less coal, emit 40pc less particulate matter (PM), and 60pc less black carbon,"" she says. Black carbon is a potent climate warming component which is a major contributor to global climate change, possibly second only to carbon dioxide./Pradhan explains that in zig-zag technology, the fireman would feed coal in small quantities in the kiln in a Z-pattern continuously. ""The (black) soot that earlier used to come out through the chimney in the traditional brick kiln is fully burnt in the zig-zag technology-driven brick kiln. The smoke therefore is white in colour.""/A labourer feeds coal in the brick kiln through feeding hole./""Not just that, due to improved combustion and uniform heating, more A-grade bricks are produced,"" adds Pradhan./Good for business/However, introducing zig-zag technology-driven brick kilns in Pakistan wasn't an easy task, Pradhan shares./""We visited Pakistan in 2017 and met the officials of the National Energy Efficiency  and  Conservation Authority (Neeca) and the All Pakistan Brick Kiln Association. We convinced the brick kiln manufacturers that converting to zig-zag technology was in their best interest and told them that it would also benefit the environment.""/""We hosted some of the brick kiln owners in Nepal in 2018 and showed them the technology. The first brick kiln on zig-zag technology was successfully constructed the same year by Haji Islam, who is an active member of the All Pakistan Brick Kiln Association,"" she says./Muhammad Shoaib Khan Niazi, president of the All Pakistan Brick Kiln Association, was also part of the delegation that visited Nepal to witness the technology. Upon their return from Nepal, the ICIMOD also organised training sessions for brick kiln owners and workers./Niazi says the brick kiln association fully supports zig-zag technology, ""as it makes an excellent business case""./""The return on investment can be achieved within a short period,"" he adds./Owing to the smog crisis in winters, the Punjab government does not allow traditional brick kilns from working in September and October every year. Because of this, Parvez says, ""until 2018, my traditional brick kiln had to be shut down too, resulting in losses of millions of rupees. Not only could I not do any business during these months, but when I would restart the kiln in November, the preheating of the kiln used to cost me approximately one million rupees.""/""That ordeal is over now, as my brick kiln on zig-zag technology runs throughout the year,"" he shares./Parvez highlights the benefits he is able to mint by shifting to the cleaner technology. ""On every 1,000 bricks, I am now able to save Rs400-600. The monthly consumption of coal has gone down from 200 tonnes to 160 tonnes.""/Zig-zag technology has received a positive response from brick kiln owners in Punjab./""We are now approaching the provincial governments of Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, so they can also benefit from this technology. Imagine if we are able to reduce up to 60pc of our emissions from the 16,000 brick kilns across Pakistan,"" Pradhan says, adding: ""It will be a fantastic opportunity for Pakistan to refer to this achievement in the country's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as part of its commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement.""/When coal feeding is complete, the feeding holes are covered to conserve heat./Niazi is also hopeful that zig-zag technology will gain momentum in the country as it makes more sense for business as well./""We have convinced our fellow brick kiln owners in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and Sindh to replicate this technology, and our trained labourers are ready to play their role as well.""/For this, trained labourers working in zig-zag technology-led brick kilns in Punjab would go to other provinces to train the labourers working there, so that they can learn how to produce bricks through zig-zag technology./Niazi is hopeful that ICIMOD can convince the provincial governments to speed up the transition./International support to transform brick making sector/International support can be instrumental in converting these brick kilns to zig-zag technology. Pakistan has already applied for funding from the Global Environment Facility (Gef) to transform the country's brick kiln industry to one that is more environment-friendly and within a period of five years./""If Pakistan is able to receive this funding, it would help revolutionise the entire brick kiln sector by converting it to the zig-zag technology. Few tunnel kilns would also be constructed as part of this project,"" Pradhan says./Haji Parvez and Haji Islam say that while the Punjab government had initially agreed to support them financially in constructing the initial prototypes for zig-zag, no such funding was disbursed to them, and nor were they given any loans at flexible rates for the purpose./Meanwhile, the 2018 Smog Commission Report acknowledged that the environment protection department of Punjab would provide 'subsidy support' to brick kiln owners to convert to the more environment friendly zig-zag technology./As the stacking of bricks is being done, a labourer covers it with soil./Naseem Ur Rehman, the director of Punjab's environment protection agency (Epa), says that Dr Parvez Hassan, chairman of the Smog Commission, had requested the State Bank governor to provide soft loans to brick kiln owners at flexible rates./""Governor State Bank has approved the idea of issuing soft loans at 6pc interest rate to brick kiln owners so they may convert to zig-zag technology under the Small Medium Enterprises (SME) programme,"" says Rehman./Rehman says the federal cabinet has also discussed the possibility of offering financial support to brick kiln owners for conversion to zig-zag technology, adding that further deliberations have been paused since the Covid-19 outbreak in Pakistan./Punjab's 2020 ultimatum/The Punjab government has also gone one step further. Rehman says that ""by the end of 2020, all polluting brick kilns in Punjab must convert to zig-zag technology or else they would be shut down indefinitely""./The transition from Fixed Chimney Bull's Trench Kiln (FCBTK) to zig-zag technology is finally gaining momentum and the provincial Epa confirms that in Punjab 592 brick kilns are already running on it./Haji Parvez is on the winning side, as he is able to produce A-grade bricks at a lower cost and that too with much more controlled impact on the environment. For others, it is only a matter of time before they can recognise the benefits of zig-zag technology and decide to adapt. Failure to do so could mean that they may no longer be able to function./Air doesn't respect borders and in South Asia, the brick kiln industry remains one of the major contributors to air pollution. Zig-zag technology offers hope by reducing the harm caused to the environment and the air, which is currently laden with life-threatening pollutants and particulate matter./People living in our part of the world have reduced life expectancy by an estimated average of a year and seven months due to high exposure to PM2.5 pollutant, according to the State of Global Air 2019 report./The real challenge however still lies ahead - to transform the 150,000 brick kilns in all of South Asia. Though it's a long way before we can achieve that goal but it's among some of the critical steps that have to be taken so we may save millions of lives that are at risk from air pollution."
Clean the air first," IF there is one thing that Covid-19 has shown us, it is that there is no getting away from it. It is here to stay and we will have to look at ways to protect ourselves. The crisis has also highlighted the extent to which our health is linked to the health of the ecosystem. If we want to live healthy lives, we need to conserve the planet and use natural resources in a sustainable manner./While governments are busy battling the pandemic, experts from the scientific community are studying patterns of Covid-19 fatalities. Though still preliminary, their investigations show a link between air pollution and coronavirus deaths. Hence, cleaning up the air we breathe is the right place to begin the journey towards improved public health./What does it mean for Pakistan? As the government mulls over a slew of stimulus packages to revive the economy, while ensuring that easing the lockdown is safe, the authorities would do well to review its investments in coal energy. More than 95 per cent of Pakistan's installed coal-based electricity generation capacity (5,090 megawatts) was commissioned during the past three years and the plants are at various stages of development. All this is happening at a time when around the world the same are being scrapped - not only because of the high levels of air pollution they generate but also because they are economically unviable./Take the example of the nine proposed coal power plants with a total capacity of 3,700 MW in Tharparkar, which has the worst human development indicators in Sindh. A recent study titled Air quality, health and toxic impacts of the proposed coal mining and power cluster in Thar, Pakistan, carried out by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), paints a horrific picture./The government should review its investments in coal energy./It projects 29,000 deaths related to air pollution over an operating life of 30 years, 19,900 new cases of asthma among children and 32,000 preterm births. With quality of life compromised due to breathing polluted air, most Tharis would be living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, and be at risk of stroke./Terming Tharparkar one of South Asia's largest 'hotspots for mercury and carbon dioxide', the study calculated that of the 1,400 kilograms of mercury emitted annually, one-fifth will settle in water or on land. The independent research centre could only review three environmental impact assessments that were available publicly and found 'errors and omissions' thereby 'misleading public through data manoeuvring' noted lead author Lauri Myllyvirta, with concern. There was one EIA report that had calculated mercury content in coal but its calculations about emissions were inaccurate. The study also held those carrying out these assessments to be 'misreporting'. At the same time, it questioned the role of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) and the 'level of regulatory oversight'. Had the EIAs been reviewed seriously, the 'elementary' errors caught by CREA could certainly have been caught by the regulator./According to CREA spokesperson, while there are affordable techniques whereby mercury emissions can be reduced by more than two-thirds, there were no emission limits in Pakistan that would require any mercury controls. With the result, plant developers can continue to completely neglect the issue. And so, it must be emphasised to Sepa how crucial it is to carry out studies to evaluate the health risks of mercury emissions since lignite coal plants are very large sources of the element./However, for the sake of public health, perhaps the best decision - one requiring courage - would be to cancel those coal-based plants that are still in the early stages of development and not follow the route of China and the US, which is slowly pivoting towards fossil fuels. As they come up with economic recovery packages, there are reports that China wants to set up new coal plants and the US wants to use the pandemic as an excuse to relax environmental rules and impact reviews./The pandemic has made it crystal clear that our future economic plans must be climate-smart. The 10 billion tree tsunami project has earned the government much applause. At present, it provides jobs to nearly 65,000 people and plans are underway to provide three times more employment by the end of this year. But instead of resting on its reforestation laurels, perhaps the government can direct some of its attention towards renewable energy projects that are much cheaper than mammoth toxic-spewing coal plants./Civil society movements and environmental activists must come together and put pressure on the government to tread a greener, more sustainable path towards economic recovery, and use the opportunity provided by the pandemic to course-correct with even more stringent environmental laws and regulations, and rectify past mistakes."
Review: Pakistan's feeble fight against filthy air," The days of remarkably blue skies over South Asian cities are ending. Countries in the region have started to restart their economies after months of lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. Since late March, with industries shuttered and hardly any vehicles on the roads, emissions have dropped significantly across South Asia, and the typically high levels of air pollution in cities dissipated./The pandemic-forced shutdown and the return of breathable air over cities have driven home an important point: the simple pleasure of breathing clean air that people living in cities in Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh have almost forgotten in recent decades. There have been calls across nations that we should draw lessons from this and do our best not to return to business as usual, which would mean a return to the toxic hazes that hang perpetually over our cities./It is in this context that the environmental documentary, Out of the Smog: Pakistan's Plea, has to be viewed. Produced by Naveen Rizvi and Sahar Abbass and directed by Shahrukh Bhatti, the documentary is a deep dive into Pakistan's climate crisis and the links between air pollution and high carbon emissions. Featuring detailed interviews with environmental lawyers Sara Hayat and Rafay Alam, and air quality activist Abid Omar, the documentary is an excellent introduction on the challenges Pakistan faces, particularly for audiences outside the country who are not familiar with the issues./The interviews are clearly structured, with Alam speaking mainly on emissions and air pollution, Omar focussing on air quality monitoring issues, and Hayat linking Pakistan's smog problem with its carbon footprint and climate change./Dirty fuel/For international audiences, and those in India and Nepal, it will come as a shock that Pakistan is still using Euro II fuel standards - emission norms that were discontinued in the developed world more than 10 years ago. India has recently leapfrogged to Euro VI standards along with Nepal, which imports all its fossil fuel from its southern neighbour./Low-quality fuel is one of the reasons behind air pollution in Pakistan's cities. - Photo by Alamy/Both Alam and Omar point to this import of cheaper but dirtier fuel as one of the main reasons for the terrible air pollution in Pakistan's cities, especially in Lahore and Karachi, and vigorously argue that authorities need to move to more stringent standards. In South Asia, Bangladesh is the only other country that lags behind in imposing tighter fuel norms but it has a clear roadmap to transition to Euro VI. Pakistan, unfortunately, is yet to have an official policy on this./Alam provides a detailed view of Pakistan's air pollution problem that is intimately linked with the nation's carbon footprint. He also points out that piecemeal approaches to clean air in Lahore, the most polluted of Pakistan's cities, are unlikely to work. He says there has to be regional and cross-border cooperation to tackle the crisis due to the unique characteristics and common issues cities in the northern Indian plains face, from Peshawar to Lahore to Delhi to Kolkata to Dhaka./Monitoring blues/Pakistan also lags behind in monitoring air pollution, which has prompted Omar to start a citizens' initiative to record air quality using privately owned machines. This is a problem often spoken about in India - how inadequate the air quality monitoring system is in South Asia's largest nation./However, the situation is much worse in Pakistan. For instance, the non-profit World Air Quality Index (AQI) project shows data from only four monitors in Pakistan, located in the US embassy in Islamabad and US consulates in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar. This compares with more than 400 AQI monitors in India, with the more than 40 in the national capital region alone./This serious lack of data also stalls any discussion on improving air quality in Pakistan, Omar says in the documentary. To address this, Omar has started Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, which provides crowd-sourced, community-driven air quality data to increase social awareness. One is forced to wonder: is this enough? Shouldn't the government and the country's pollution control authorities be doing something about this?/Climate crisis/The documentary, its makers say, was inspired by the climate marches in Pakistan in 2019, which were attended in large numbers by ordinary citizens, particularly young people and schoolchildren. It is heartening to know that awareness of the climate crisis is increasing in Pakistan, which was quite ably described by Hayat. However, although public opinion is in favour of taking action on this front, she says the government is yet to wake up to the reality./Out of the Smog is an essential addition to the cinéma vérité documentaries that are emerging from the developing world. More than finding audiences within Pakistan, it is useful for international viewers to be more informed about the broad environmental problems that Pakistan faces./Having said that, there are a few rough edges to the documentary that could have been smoothened out by tighter editing. At more than an hour and 20 minutes, it will struggle to retain viewers for its entire length. The documentary could have been shorter, with less time given to talking heads and more footage of the ground situation in various cities./Overall, it is an informative and in-depth view of Pakistan's climate change challenges and its problems with filthy air. It remains to be seen whether its promoters can market the documentary so that influential audiences, particularly policymakers, view it. Whether they take action is entirely another matter."
"Speakers criticise tug-of-war between CDA, MCI"," Civil society representatives and officials criticised the Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Saturday for its tug of war with the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) since the latter's inception more than four years ago./Speaking at an online seminar on 'Population and Sustainable Urban Practices for Islamabad', they expressed the hope that the Supreme Court, which last month directed for the issue to be addressed within a month, would help get the MCI's rules of business approved./They said citizens have suffered from the illogical rift between the two organisations, as Islamabad's civic services and environmental conditions have deteriorated in the last few years. The tug of war between the two - the capital's managers and the people's representatives - over funding and authority have ruined the sustainability of the entire system of service delivery, they said./Civil society representatives highlighted that the shortage of water, the absence of domestic waste and sewage management, dilapidated roads, diminishing green cover and irrational development have marred the capital's sustainability./The seminar was organised by the Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) to mark World Population Day./Dispute over funding, authority of both organisations has ruined sustainability of entire service delivery system, participants say/MCI Deputy Mayor Zeeshan Naqvi said the MCI was allocated Rs14 billion two years ago for various project proposals, but no funding has been released so far./'The MCI cannot even use the taxes it collects from various sources because its rules of business have not been approved by the government yet. The MCI has approved schemes for small dams on eight natural streams from the foot of the Margalla Hills, improvements to sewage treatment plants, repairs and the provision of water, filter plants and the maintenance of parks. They are all possible if the funds are provided. We are handcuffed by the government, perhaps because we belong to the opposition party,' he said./Mr Naqvi said that encroachments cannot be removed without the support of the ICT administration. Despite making requests, the MCI has not been extended the administration's cooperation to remove illegal construction on greenbelts and in the national park, he claimed./He added that the MCI is trying to take care of the city with its limited human resources and available funds. The collection of domestic waste has been improved while working on a landfill site, and they are trying to improve the condition of parks and to overcome the shortage of water, he said./Mr Naqvi asked the government to begin a process of amending rules and regulations framed for the capital to ensure the rights of locals, adding that legislation is needed on contradictions in the same zone that affect the rights of citizens./Mr Maqvi told Dawn that the MCI's rules of business have been pending with the Ministry of Interior for the last four years./'We used to get funds during the PML-N government, but now, as it is the PTI government, our funding has been stopped and all our projects have stalled,' he claimed, adding: 'However, we hope that the SC - which directed for the issue to be addressed last month - will play its role for the passage of the rules of business. Moreover, we want to make dams for plantations, fire-fighting and other purposes. Such dams have been established in Nepal and Bangladesh and were successful./Speaking about the new paradigm of sustainable urban management, water and climate expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh said that the resilience of the city matters, with regard to how good its coping mechanisms are in place to face disasters, urban flooding, the impact of harsh weather, water scarcity as well as its recycling and waste management systems./Devcom-Pakistan Director Munir Ahmed said civil society representatives and experts should play their role in bridging conflicts between the CDA, MCI and the capital administration. He also urged the government to release funds so development projects could begin./Environmental advocacy expert Mome Saleem urged the government to take immediate steps to remove encroachments from green belts and national park areas./Solid waste management expert Saadat Ali said that a comprehensive plan is needed to segregate 750 tons of waste at the source and its disposal./At present, he said, it is being dumped out in the open in I-12, causing air pollution and diseases while also contaminating subsoil water. He said a landfill site towards Rawat would be more suitable for waste management."
Webinar terms lockdown opportunity to improve environment," Speakers taking part in a webinar have expressed their concerns over increasing air pollution due to ill-planned urban development, environmental mismanagement and poor planning and policy implications in urban centres like Karachi./They called for restoration of biodiversity, revisiting environment, transportation and housing policies taking advantage of the Covid-19 lockdown. Experts, academic environmentalists and civil society organisations' representatives were among the speakers at the webinar organised on Friday by a non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Sindh Community Foundation (SCF)./SCF's head Javed Hussain said that ill-planned urban development, transportation policy and vigilance were major factors of the worst quality of air. He said modern ICT (information and communication technology) based air quality monitoring was need of the hour to make citizens aware of the situation. He said policymakers did not attach importance to environment, although it was the key to development and needed to be addressed accordingly./Environment expert and researcher Nasir Panhwar observed that air quality had improved during the Covid-19-driven lockdowns in the country and across the world. Noise pollution had considerably declined,/he said, which was also witnessed in Pakistan, mainly in its major cities. He said Pakistan had slipped from fourth in 2016 to number two in Global Air Quality Index in 2019./Naeem Ahmed Qureshi of the National Forum on Environment and Health (NFEH) said that Karachi experienced improved air quality and recorded 40pc drop in noise pollution during the lockdown according to the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa)./He said that it was a great opportunity to revisit environment, transportation and housing policies to improve air quality in Karachi and expand air quality measurement system across Sindh in urban centres. He said Sepa's capacity was limited./Qazi Khizr of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said that it was every citizen's right to have fresh air and environment. During the lockdown, trees reduced Co2 emissions, which reduced pollution, and over five to seven types of birds were seen after a long time./He said the people affected by lung diseases felt ease in breathing. He said that bronchitis had increased in Karachi due to poor air quality which was directly related to Covid-19. He urged the government to take urgent actions to provide fresh air quality to the citizens."
Covid-19 and Pakistan's raging NCD crisis," As the world scrambles to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, the most devastating infectious disease outbreak to hit the world in decades, the crisis has revealed a great deal about the gaps in our economic and health systems. At the same time, in the choice of its victims, the virus has also revealed another health crisis raging world over - that of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)./The evidence emerging from the pandemic makes one thing clear - people living with or affected by noncommunicable or chronic diseases are at higher risk and far more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from the virus./What are NCDs? According to the WHO, these are long-duration diseases that result from a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The major types of NCDs include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes./While previously thought of as a problem for developed countries, NCDs have risen world over in the past 30 years - driven by urbanisation, globalisation and associated lifestyle changes - and now kill 41 million people every year (more than 71 per cent of all global deaths). More than three quarters of NCD-related deaths now occur in low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan./While public health debates in Pakistan have focused more on continuing battles with communicable disease like polio, NCDs, such as heart disease, diabetes and hypertension now contribute significantly to adult mortality and morbidity in Pakistan - they are amongst the top 10 causes of mortality and morbidity within the country, and WHO estimates indicate that they account for approximately 58 per cent of total deaths in Pakistan. In addition, they impose a heavy and increasing economic burden on individuals, families, communities, and health systems in the country. Over 45 per cent of Pakistani households spend far more on treating NCDs than they do on communicable diseases. Many of these expenses end up being catastrophic, pushing people into deprivation./NCDs have a lot to do with a set of inter-related behavioural, metabolic and environmental risk factors, which greatly increase chances of contracting these diseases. These risk factors include tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and obesity, as well as problems like air pollution and food systems./Prior research has already focused on the dangerous convergence between NCDs and infectious disease. Studies have demonstrated how diabetes patients are more susceptible to diseases like tuberculosis and malaria. As is becoming clear from the emerging clinical evidence on Covid-19, these NCD risk factors can make people more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with Covid-19 as well. For example, smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to Covid-19 as they already have reduced lung capacity or lung disease. Similarly, obesity has been identified as one of the risk factors for severe illness from Covid-19 and mortality in younger individuals is higher among those that are obese./Many of these risk factors are increasingly prevalent in Pakistan. Around 24 million Pakistanis smoke tobacco, which kills around 160,000 people a year. Twenty-six per cent of our population is diabetic, one of the highest rates in the world, and obesity is on the rise, with 20 per cent of men and 25 per cent of women in Pakistan being either overweight or obese./A major reason behind these unhealthy indicators is our increasingly unhealthy diet. Consumption of vegetables and fruits in Pakistan has been decreasing amid high consumption of salt and sugar and rising intake of unhealthy processed food products. Another nutritional challenge in Pakistan relates to dangerously high consumption of industrially produced trans-fatty acids (iTFA), a harmful fat found in processed vanaspati ghee, margarines and some cooking oils that greatly increases the risk of heart disease. The excessive intake of TFA in a culture of deep-frying has created a generation of patients suffering from hypertension and heart disease./NCDs are a growing problem and as the coronavirus pandemic has shown, can have devastating mortality consequences if left unchecked. Pakistan's NCD burden is worsening and puts a large proportion of the population at risk, both from the chronic diseases themselves and from vulnerability to severe illness from infectious diseases like Covid-19./Fortunately, NCDs are largely preventable. Through tobacco use cessation, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, healthy body weight and avoidance of stress, these diseases can be prevented to a large extent, and in the event of disease, suffering and deaths can be reduced./However, this will require concerted policy efforts from the federal and provincial governments as well as cooperation from society. Smart policies can help create a healthier environment for people, including a healthier food environment. This must include policy and regulatory measures to reduce the consumption of excessive salt and sugar and eliminate the use of TFA from our food supply (something the WHO has also called for and our successive governments have also committed to). This must also include efforts to adequately tax the tobacco industry and unhealthy beverages and earmark those funds for investing in public health. This will create healthier populations less susceptible to NCDs./In addition, there is a need to integrate treatment and prevention of NCDs in the system of primary healthcare (rather than costly late-stage treatment at tertiary care hospitals). Early detection and management of diabetes, hypertension and other NCDs at the primary healthcare level is cost effective and with early treatment, the needless strokes, blindness, heart failure, end stage renal disease, gangrenous legs, and amputations can be avoided. This must be accompanied by efforts to raise public awareness about risk factors behind NCDs and promote healthy behaviours and lifestyle choices among the population that can prevent the development of these illnesses./In public health, we have always kept infectious and non-communicable diseases in separate silos. Covid-19 has reminded us of the potentially devastating interlinkages between the two. Therefore, the redesign of our health systems in response in a post-Covid-19 context must also include an integration of the battle against NCDs, which has been neglected in public health planning to-date. As we resume the fight for quality universal health coverage in the aftermath of the pandemic, NCDs must be placed at the centre of the debate in order to adapt our health systems to contemporary health challenges so we can make our societies secure and less vulnerable to being ravaged by future outbreaks."
Factors that increase dementia risk," Air pollution, head injury and alcohol consumption have been identified as three new dementia risk factors besides nine already-established risk factors - less education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes and infrequent social contact./The new risk factors have been discussed in the 'Dementia prevention, intervention, and care: 2020 report of the Lancet Commission' launched in a live session of the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Tuesday./The report suggests that modifying these risk factors at the population level can potentially prevent or delay up to 40 per cent of dementia. Interestingly, it says, the potential for prevention is high and might be higher in low-income and middle-income countries where the prevalence of dementia is higher, and where access to information and education around dementia risks is often more limited./At the online report launch session, there port's lead author, Prof Gill Livingston of University College London, speaking from London, said: 'Our report shows that it is within the power of policy-makers and individuals to prevent and delay a significant proportion of dementia, with opportunities to make an impact at each stage of a person's life./Interventions are likely to have the biggest impact on those, who are disproportionately affected by dementia risk factors, like those in low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations…'/Dr Hussain Jafri, secretary general of Alzheimer's Pakistan, said the report highlighted a number of important preventive actions. The recommendation of keeping cognitively, physically, and socially active in mid-life and later life here becomes especially poignant in the context of social distancing measures./Alzheimer's Disease International Chief Executive Paola Barbarino said early retirement, which was perceived by many as a desirable outcome, might actually increase chances to develop the disease./She said the Covid-19 pandemic had and would continue to present additional challenges for individuals living with non-communicable diseases, who were predisposed to more severe symptoms of coronavirus and to developing additional co-morbidities."
Capital ranks seventh among most polluted cities in country," Islamabad is the seventh most polluted city in Pakistan and several studies have indicated that air quality in the country is not safe for human health and causes thousands of premature deaths annually./Environmentalist Munir Ahmed expressed these views while speaking to a webinar as chief guest, organised by Islamabad Devcom Centennial Leo Club, in connection with the very first International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies./He said that air pollution is the single greatest environmental risk to human health, causing 7 million premature deaths annually from diseases like stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections./'We immediately need to work on the air quality of Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, Faisalabad, Muridke, Bahawalpur, Gujranwala, Islamabad and Rawalpindi,' he said."
Experts call for awareness of Alzheimer's disease," Experts at an online session held on Saturday underscored the need for proper guidance and awareness of Alzheimer's disease - an irreversible and progressive brain disorder./The event titled 'Update on Alzheimer's Disease' was organised by the Pakistan Society of Neurology (PSN) in collaboration with the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH)./Nine neurologists from three countries were in attendance at the event./The World Health Organi­sation (WHO) has declared Sept 21 as the World Alzheimer's Day to create awareness about the latest developments about the disorder and its treatment./Explaining the disease, speakers said Alzheimer's was the most common cause of dementia - a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life./Alzheimer's, they said, was an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroyed memory and thinking skills, and, eventually, the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks./According to experts, various surveys show that about 50 million (m) population of the world are suffering from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, and as there is no cure for it and the number is expected to go up to 150m by 2050./'The disease affects the elderly and currently 4.3 per cent of the population of Pakistan is over 60 years of age. Due to this, the number of dementia patients in the country is also increasing, so proper guidance and awareness is needed,' said Dr Abdul Malik, an associate professor of neurology at the Liaquat College of Medicine and Dentistry while speaking about the burden of dementia in Pakistan./Risk factors/Presenting Alzheimer's data in a global context, Dr Manmohan Singh from India said 50m Alzheimer's patients had been diagnosed worldwide and the number was expected to reach 152m by 2050./'The disease was discovered in 1906. Today, with each passing minute, one patient emerges. Aging is the leading cause of the disease while modern research has revealed three more risk factors, including alcohol use, air pollution and brain injuries.'/The United States alone, he pointed out, was spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the care and treatment of dementia patients where Alzheimer's was considered as the sixth leading cause of death./Dr Muhammad Wasay, head of the neurology department at the AKUH, said the treatment of Alzheimer's was prolonged and if the treatment was not started in time, the disease became extre­mely severe in six to seven years./'There are medications that only slow the progression of the disease a few years if the patient is being treated at an early stage. The most important thing with medicine in this disease is the family members who take proper care of the patient and prevent the disease from getting complicated. In this respect, we counsel patient's family members so they can improve the quality of patient's life with utmost respect,' he said./Senior Prof Ejaz Vohra emphasised on patient care by strengthening the family system and social networks so that the children take care of their parents at home./Dr Sajid Hameed of the AKUH explained the benefits of 'Mini Mental State Examination' as a screening tool for early diagnosis of this disease all over the world./Regarding the prevention of Alzheimer's, Dr Salimullah said that a good early education of children also had an effect in preventing or eradicating the disease./Presenting new research on the treatment of depression in Alzheimer's disease, Dr Keira Joann from Singapore said the risk factors included depression, hypertension, obesity and smoking./'For the treatment of depression, Vortioxetine has been found effective in treating depression in all the studies done till now.'/According to experts, the study of this drug in Pakistan is also in the stage of data analysis which will be very helpful in controlling depression with very few side-effects./PSN president Dr Salim Barich and head of the psychiatry department of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre Prof Iqbal Afridi also spoke on the occasion."
World Bank supports environment protection initiatives," The Ministry of Climate Change and World Bank have agreed on working closely in various areas, including environment development, adaption to and mitigating climate change, reduction of air pollution and disaster-risk mitigation./A three-member delegation led by World Bank Country Director to Pakistan Najy Benhassine on Thursday met Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam to support Pakistan, which is confronted by immediate and long-term health and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic./Mr Benhassine assured the SAPM that his organisation was backing the government's recent recovery initiatives, aimed at restoring the lives and livelihood that were affected by the crisis./Both sides discussed matters of bilateral cooperation and opportunities for collaboration in the fields of green economic recovery. They deliberated enhancing investment for nature-based solutions and creation of green jobs, environmental sustainability, climate change, forest management, air pollution, water conservation, and protection and disaster risk reduction./Mr Aslam informed the country director that Prime Minister Imran Khan had approved the Green Stimulus package in April to extend green cover and create job opportunities for the youth. So far, over 86,000 green jobs have been created for daily-wagers who lost their jobs because of the pandemic. He also spoke about Protected Areas Initiative recently approved by the prime minister under the Green Pakistan programme. He said the programme aims to expand protected areas in the country from 13pc to 15pc by 2023 along with creating 5,000 green jobs./Creation of jobs is crucial whilst protecting natural resources of the country, he added./Sharing details about Clean and Green Pakistan, Mr Aslam said the climate ministry had launched several flagship projects, including the world's largest afforestation programme under 10 Billion Tree Tsunami, Clean and Green Pakistan, Protected Areas, Plastic-Free Pakistan and Recharge Pakistan. These initiatives, he said, will help achieve environmental sustainability and climate resilience through conservation and protection of the environment, forests and wildlife./Both sides agreed on working towards tackling the fallout of the present global health crisis due to Covid-19 along with global warming by focusing on various socioeconomic sectors of the country to achieve equitable and inclusive social and economic growth and mitigating poverty and diseases./'It's amazing and inspiring that despite limited financial resources, Pakistan launched green stimulus initiative, which has led to creation of thousands of green jobs for those rendered unemployed due to pandemic,' Mr Benhassine said./He said World Bank will utilise financial, technological and knowledge resources to support Pakistan through its experiences in the post-Covid-19 green recovery by enhanced investment in green sectors, including forestry, environmental protection and climate change resilience."
"Hazardous waste being dumped without EIA, tribunal told"," An environmental tribunal on Tuesday recorded testimony of a witness in a case pertaining to issuance of approvals by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency to private companies for collection and disposal of hazardous and infectious waste allegedly without conducting environmental impact assessment./The three-member tribunal headed by its chairman retired Justice Sadiq Hussain Bhatti was hearing a complaint filed by a non-governmental organisation, Society for Environmental and Mangrove Protection Welfare Association, against issuance of approvals to private contractors by Sepa allegedly without fulfilling legal requirements./The complainant cited the provincial chief secretary, secretary of environment, climate change and coastal development department, the director-general and director of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, and private company Unique Plastic Disposal as respondents./On Tuesday, witness Mohammad Munir appeared before the tribunal and deposed that he was an eyewitness to disposal of hazardous and infectious waste in different parts of the metropolis and into the sea./'Hazardous waste is being dumped at the National Highway near Port Qasim Industrial Area and Lyari Expressway and into the sea during night hours'/He further deposed that the private contractor companies were involved in disposing of the hazardous and infectious waste at the National Highway in vicinity of the Port Qasim Industrial Area and Lyari Expressway and into the open sea during night hours, adding that they were also burning such waste without adopting scientific methods, causing environmental issues and risks to human health./The witness said several pictures of such activity were taken while video footage was also made of the same under his supervision since he worked for the complainant organisation./After recording his statement, the judge adjourned the matter till Nov 17 for issuance of notice to the respondents./On the last date, the association's president, Dr Kanwal Nazim, had recorded her statement before the tribunal, stating that Sepa was issuing approvals without conducting EIA/IEE without following provisions of the Sindh Environmental Protection Act, 2014 and its rules and regulations./The complainant had said that hazardous and infectious waste was being collected through trucks without following the standard operating procedures (SOPs) or any scientific approach, therefore, there were chances of contamination of all natural resources. /The different organizations/companies are directly dumping the said hazardous and infectious waste into the Jam Chakro and Gond Pass, the complainant had alleged and added that it was also observed that the hazardous waste had been burnt later on, which emitted smoke, soot, dangerous gases and the same were creating air pollution in the environment./The complainant had further testified that the staff of the association had taken some photographs and also made video recording of such hazardous and infectious waste, which had been dumped at the National Highway in the vicinity of the Port Qasim Industrial Area and Lyari Expressway./The complainant had produced photos as well as video footage of the same in the court./The complainant had stated that Sepa had issued approvals to different organisations, entities and persons for collection, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of the hazardous and non-hazardous waste without conducting the environmental impact assessment (EIA), which is mandatory requirement of the law./She produced copies of such approvals allegedly issued without fulfilling formalities./He said that in some approvals, Sepa had mentioned five conditions and in some approvals 20 conditions were mentioned./The complainant had testified that one of the waste handling organisations, namely Unique Plastic Disposal, was being run at Mehran Town in Korangi and the incineration plant was not functional, but Sepa had issued approval for collection, transportation, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste without conducting EIA./She further deposed that on March 4 the association issued a letter to the Sepa DG with a request to provide information regarding approval of the contractors/companies to collect, handle, transport, store and incinerate the non-hazardous and hazardous waste, but no response had been given so far./Thereafter, on June 10 the complainant served a notice on the DG Sepa regarding contravention of the Sindh Environmental Protection Act, 2014 under Section 26(3)(b) of the act. The DG was requested to take action against the responsible organisations/companies for committing such violations of the environmental laws."
"Heart disease, stroke and diabetes among major causes of death: study"," Heart disease, stroke, pulmonary diseases, diabetes and kidney infections are the five major causes of death in Pakistan, according to the findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study carried out at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the United States./Pakistan currently has the lowest average age in the region. The study found that the largest contributors to the increase in health loss, measured by the number of years lost due to ill health or early death, are neonatal disorders, heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Obesity is also going to become a major challenge for Pakistan./The study suggested that the average age in developed countries, which has increased over the years, may start to decrease due to obesity. Diseases and outdoor air pollution over the past 30 years have created a perfect storm, fuelling Covid-19 deaths, the study said./The Global Burden of Disease Study was published in the prominent medical journal The Lancet. It was conducted with a number of organisations in 204 countries; the Pakistan Health Services Academy and Aga Khan University (AKU) collaborated as well./It also said that among major non-communicable diseases (NCD) risks, only smoking has declined substantially. Major efforts to implement international tobacco control policies have seen exposure to smoking fall by nearly 10pc worldwide since 2010./AKU Department of Medicine Chairwoman Dr Zainab Samad told Dawn that although some advancements have been seen over the years in terms of communicable diseases, NCDs are a major issue because they carry 60pc of the load of overall diseases in Pakistan./'Blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, cancer, stroke and diabetes are major diseases. In Pakistan, some focus has been given on primary health services but unfortunately people do not have awareness that physical activities are important for their health and there is need to change the behaviour of masses,' she said./Dr Samad said that the Covid-19 has proved that there was little to no attention given to chronic diseases./University of Health Sciences Vice Chancellor Dr Javed Akram said he agreed with the study. He said Pakistan had twice the burden of diseases, meaning that people suffer from communicable and non-communicable diseases simultaneously./'The infant mortality rate is unacceptably high in Pakistan. According to our study 17pc of the population in Pakistan is suffering with diabetes and it can increase to 25pc in the next five to seven years. Every second Pakistani is hypertensive, which becomes the reason of heart diseases, stroke and kidney failure,' he said./Dr Akram said that obesity is becoming a new problem because of peoples' lifestyles and the consumption of junk food./'Our parks are disappearing, walking tracks are encroached on and people prefer to travel in their vehicles rather than use public transport. They use elevators rather than stairs, the young generation uses energy drinks but don't bother to burn the calories,' he said./Covid-19 deaths globally/According to the study, the latest global disease estimates reveal a perfect storm of rising chronic diseases and public health failures fuelling the Covid-19 pandemic. The study analysed 286 causes of death, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories, which revealed how well the world's population were prepared in terms of underlying health for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic."
Court deplores lack of admin response to smog," The Lahore High Court on Thursday expressed its dissatisfaction over the measures taken by the Punjab government to control smog and observed that the chief secretary had not taken the issue seriously./Hearing the petitions relating to different environmental challenges, Justice Shahid Karim directed an additional advocate general to convey the court's concern to the chief secretary./Perturbed over the alarming Air Quality Index (AQI) of the provincial capital, the judge ordered the chief secretary to conduct a meeting with the Lahore chief traffic officer (CTO) and the environment department to ensure a ban on smoke-emitting vehicles in the province, and action against the industries causing air pollution./Regretting district administration's lack of concern over the issue, the judge said there was a time when the deputy commissioners in every district used to perform their statutory obligations and implement law in letter and spirit. Unfortunately, they [the officers] were not sensitised to the environmental issues that had adversely affected sustainable development, he added./To the law officer's statement that a notification had been issued to declare smog as a calamity under the Punjab National Calamity Act 1958, Justice Karim observed that mere issuance of a notification won't help curb the smog unless or until the chief secretary and the commissioners took serious actions and passed executive orders against the industries violating the relevant laws./The law officer further informed the court that the commissioners had been delegated the task in all major cities to curb the smog./The judge directed the government to release information regarding the AQI, and make it available to the public./Advocate Sheraz Zaka, representing a petitioner, said the government needed to take drastic steps and must ensure closure of brick kilns./A lawyer, on behalf of the environment department, assured the court that the entire brick kiln industry would remain shut from November to the middle of December./A counsel for the association of brick kiln owners objected to the decision of the industry shutdown. However, the judge observed that no concession could be given to the brick kiln industry as the wellbeing of the public at large was at stake./The hearing was adjourned for Nov 2."
Alarm raised over toxic gas emissions in Peshawar," Toxic gas emissions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially the provincial capital, have reached critical levels exceeding the World Health Organisation and Provincial Environmental Quality Standards and causing serious health hazards, including cancer, pulmonary and heart diseases, says an advocacy organisation./According to the Sarhad Conservation Network, Peshawar's Air Quality Index is above 150, which is mostly moderate-unhealthy category, competing with the high AQI levels of Faisalabad and Lahore, two of the most industrialised cities in the country./'Particles PM 2.5 (fine inhalable particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometer) and PM 10 (inhalable particles with diameters of 10 micrometer) that have reached critical levels in the air in KP and Peshawar are considered very harmful for health. When the level of these particles increases and penetrate deeply into lungs, it causes serious health hazards,' the SCN said in a presentation to chief secretary Dr Kazim Niaz on Tuesday./It said traffic, industrial emissions and civil works were major contributors to air pollution./The SCN, however, said industrial pollution had increased as many industries operated without obtaining NOC from the relevant department./Sarhad Conservation Network calls for legislation to check air pollution/'The inhabitants of Peshawar have been raising alarm about threat to human health, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, and increased associated risk factors,' it said./In the presentation, the SCN experts proposed short, medium and long-term corrective measures.They said in the short term, the Environmental Protection Agency should take strict administrative action against illegal commercial and industrial activities in Peshawar city, especially its areas, which bordered Jamrud and Shahkas in the neighbouring Khyber tribal district./The experts said to offset vehicular emissions, green interventions should be taken in the form of urban tree plantation of indigenous species along major traffic arteries, highways and canals./They said administrative actions should ensure public notice to schools, colleges, business and industry to improve technology of old vehicles within a specific time-frame and on-spot imposition of fine by traffic wardens on polluting vehicles, especially heavy vehicles and school buses./The experts recommended the establishment of the Centre for Environment at the Institute of Management Sciences in Peshawar for policy research in the field of environment to provide policy inputs to the relevant departments and measures for improvement of air quality in KP./They said the initiative could generate and analyse pollution data identifying its sources and recommend policy guidelines for agencies and people to undertake preventive, technological and administrative measures./The experts said to overcome the dearth of data on various parameters of the Air Quality Index in KP, drones equipped with different sensors for measuring PM, and oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur should be deployed for data collection from selected areas, including Hayatabad Industrial Zone./They also said air quality data from Dera Ismail Khan, Kohat, Mardan, Mingora and Abbottabad regions should also be collected routinely./According to them, technological interventions can focus on locally fabricated solar powered low-cost ambient air filtration plants installation in most congested spots in Peshawar and other major cities to improve air quality. The clipboard factories and steel mills should be particularly mandated to install filtration plants near their emission points to check unregulated emissions./The experts said a regular bi-annual meeting of the KP Environmental Protection Council under the chair of the chief minister had been long overdue to identify environmental issues and their solutions./They called for legislation and its enforcement to address air pollution in KP."
'It's like looking at an old sepia photograph': No respite for Lahore as city gets smoggier by the day," Iram Mohsin, a resident of Lahore, had been dreading the coming of winter this year. Amid the second wave of Covid-19 which has gripped Pakistan, the city is wrapped in a blanket of smog./'The air has a metallic smell, the skin feels itchy and there is a gritty feeling of dust settling upon us,' Mohsin related. 'There is a very visible brown haze, blurring the skyline; it's like looking at an old sepia photograph.'/The school principal had not expected anything better after what she said was the 'complete disregard for taking precautions against coronavirus and the onset of smog since October'. She is witnessing colleagues and family 'having serious breathing difficulties'./Pictures taken by a resident show the view from an office in Main Boulevard Gulberg Lahore in (L) July 2019 and (R) November 2020. - Photo by Ahmed Muzammil/The air quality index (AQI) of Lahore and Faisalabad was worse than New Delhi in neighbouring India in early November. Faisalabad recorded 440 and Lahore 321, with a fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration of 270 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³). Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns is particularly dangerous because it is fine enough to penetrate into the lungs and bloodstream. The World Health Organisation guideline is 25 µg/m³ for PM2.5, the state government's is 35 µg/m³./Pakistan's Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) found 28 of the 36 districts in Punjab were witnessing increasing levels of smog this November. The US embassy, which puts out real-time AQI data, has been showing consistently poor numbers./Dawar Butt, analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said, 'For any AQI above 300 - which is hazardous - the protocol is to raise warnings if it stays the same for more than an hour.' But there was no warning, just advisories on the government website./The Environmental Protection Agency has only three monitors in the city, while Butt said there should ideally be at least 30. Unfortunately there was doubt even about the information from the three that existed. 'Lahore's central part (Jail Road) is among the most polluted, but somehow the PM2.5 levels there are much lower than the outskirts.'/Khurram Shehzad, director general of the Punjab Environment Protection Agency (EPA), remained confident about the authenticity of the 'data calculated by experts from the highly sophisticated government monitors'. He was optimistic this year's smog would be less deadly than before./'We know stubble burning has continued despite the ban, so we share the heat maps sent to us by Suparco with the deputy commissioners of those districts to take immediate action,' Shehzad said. In the first week of November, Suparco pointed to 1,290 areas where stubble burning was going on./This was corroborated by journalist Farahnaz Zahidi. Driving through Punjab, she saw 'huge swathes of fields belching thick smoke'. Visibility was poor, even in the day time, she said. 'We could not roll down our windows due to smog so had to switch on the air conditioning.'/Another picture of the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore from December 2019. - Photo by Nida Sohail Chaudhary/The government has sealed 366 factories found running without any environmental control systems (ECS), informed Shehzad. 'We also closed down an additional 140 factories that were using plastic and rubber as fuel.' There are factories that have ECS but do not turn them on. 'To keep a check on them, we have installed CCTV and can keep an eye on them from our offices,' Shehzad said./Of the 7,530 brick kilns in the area, 1,268 have been converted to the energy-efficient zigzag technology that reduces the use of coal by around 20%. Over 5,200 kilns have been ordered to close down till December 31. However, many continue to operate as nearly 80% of the construction in Punjab use bricks. The kilns employ nearly 2.3 million daily wage earners./Big run on air purifiers/Health experts have noticed a serious increase in respiratory diseases, eye infections and allergies in Lahore in the past four years. Research has also shown that polluted air causes depression, Alzheimer's and even poor academic performance./'Lungs get damaged from pollutants, including smoking, and become vulnerable to any kind of bacterial, viral or fungal infection,' said Naseem Salahuddin, head of the infectious diseases department at Indus Hospital. She warned that those with weakened lungs are more likely to be infected by Covid-19./Lawyer Khalid Ibrahim, an avid golfer, who has asthma, has had to put away his golf clubs this season. 'Fall and winter are the best time for golfing in Lahore,' he said. But his 'throat feels sore' and he 'can smell soot'. The air purifier that he bought last year for about PKR 40,000 (USD 254) has really helped. 'I sleep much better now.'/Hassan S. Zaidi, a 32-year-old computer engineer, has installed eight air purifiers in his Lahore home, all made by him. 'I was worried for my two daughters and my parents,' he said. He has been using these purifiers for three years now. 'All I do is change the filter annually.'/Word got out and Zaidi started making purifiers for friends. 'Last year I put up a hundred of them at a friend's shop and they were a complete sell out,' he told The Third Pole. He ended up selling nearly 1,000 last year at the PKR 16, 000 (USD 102) each. This year, he is expecting his sales to increase by 40% due to Covid-19./Vehicular emissions the biggest culprit/While crop burning and brick kilns are blamed for air pollution, Momin Imran Sheikh, a microclimate expert, pointed out that the main reason in cities like Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Gujranwala and Rawalpindi was emissions from vehicles./Shehzad of EPA said since October, Lahore traffic police had impounded over 700 vehicles and collected a fine of PKR 2.5 million (USD 15,865) from smoke spewing vehicles./For years now, the Punjab government has been planning to issue fitness certificate to vehicles plying on the roads. A Swedish vehicle fitness certification company, established in 2016, was tasked to set up centres across all 36 districts of Punjab but it remained dormant. Last week, Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar asked the transport authority to reactivate the system./'They're always announcing vehicle inspection systems but I've never seen one materialise,' said environmental lawyer and Lahore resident Rafay Alam Khan. He does not have a certificate for his car either./Garbage burning is another pollution source in Lahore, Sheikh pointed out. 'It's banned, but continues unabated.' Nearly 6,000 tonnes of garbage is collected in the city daily. Little gets to Lahore's only landfill site, which has reached its capacity anyway./Blaming India, the wind/While acknowledging that crop burning continued in Pakistan, an EPA spokesperson said the problem was '200 times worse' in adjacent parts of India, and this was 'affecting us' because the wind blew across the border./Sheikh, however, pointed out that in autumn, the wind blows from the northwest to the southeast, from Pakistan to India."
Smog touches unhealthy level once again," Smog has started building up in the city again after the rain had cleared its weather last week and it reached an 'unhealthy level' in some areas and crossed over to a dangerous level in other parts here on Monday.According to the environment department's mapping, its three measuring stations at the Jail Road, Town Hall and Township reported 111, 128 and 42 US AQI, respectively. However, the level at Shahdara touched 361 and Rafaqat Chowk - a little down to Sheikhupura Road - hit 229./Commenting on the situation, Khurram Shahzad, the director general (environment), thinks the build-up is a bit slow as compared to the last year due to the steps taken by the department./'Almost 85pc of 7,500 brick kilns have already been closed down. Around 20pc of them have already been forced to adopt the zigzag technology, which reduces emission substantially. Smoke-emitting vehicles, the heaviest pollutant, are being challaned heavily and the industry, especially the one using rubber and plastic as fuel, is being taken offline.'/Mr Shahzad said though the build-up is slow but it did not mean that the problem was going away./'It is a long way. But the journey has begun,' he claimed./According to an official of the Met office, the next rain spell, which could bring some relief, is at least two weeks away and it is expected in the second week of December./'It would be a heavy but short spell and would improve the conditions for the second half of the next month. But next two weeks would be really bad and the people need to take care of themselves.'/He advised the people to wear masks, keep themselves hydrated and that those with ailments like asthma must take extra care. Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) stated that fines of Rs513,950 were imposed on Sunday and Rs636,250 on Saturday on violators./In the last three days, 5,327 FIRs were registered and 478 people arrested over violation of smog policy; 8,579 vehicles were impounded, 2,148 industries sealed and 613 brick kilns closed down./So far, 19.72 per cent of brick kilns have been converted to zigzag technology, according to statistics provided by the EPD./A total of 7,515 kilns are in Punjab, of which 6,033 are old technology kilns, and 5,618 of these have been sealed. Only 1,482 kilns have converted to ZZT./Also, a meeting attended by Punjab Finance Minister Makhdoom Hashim Javan Bakht and PDMA Director General Raja Khurram Shahzad Umar discussed the smog situation. Mr Bakht said temporary restrictions on industry and transportation are not the answer./'The shift to industrial technology and electric vehicles is integral but purchases require time and resources, and these are being ensured. However changing social attitudes must be the first and foremost important strategy for us,' he said.The provincial minister said that bringing a change in social attitudes would not be possible without the involvement of civil society, educational institutions and the media. Students could be made part of tree planting campaigns while NGOs and organizations could promote pollution control activities at a local level. Research scholars must also introduce ideas for a healthy environment./Punjab Relief Commissioner Babar Hayat Tard said the main cause of pollution in urban areas was the emissions from transport which made around 43 per cent of air pollution in Pakistan./The Urban Development Unit chairman said that for the last 20 years no systematic traffic plan has been formulated in the city nor communication plans and coordination of various authorities for the construction of cities has been made. The present government is formulating a regular traffic plan with an appropriate plan for urban development."
Two kilns and four restaurants sealed," Assistant Commissioner (AC) Suleman Zafar Dothar on Friday got the owners of two brick kilns arrested for not shifting their kilns to zigzag technology and causing air pollution in the Tanda area./The AC also sealed four restaurants in the city for violating the Covid-19 protocols./The Punjab government has already imposed a ban on such kilns from functioning for a couple of months to avoid the smog./However only those brick kilns having the environment friendly Zigzag technology can remain operational throughout the year./The arrested owners of kilns include Dildar Abid and Adeel Mazhar. Their kilns have been closed./The AC directed the officials of the administration and environment protection department to keep an eye on such violations./The rates of bricks have gone up from R10,000 to Rs13,000 per 1,000 bricks after a cut in the production of bricks due to the ban imposed by the government on old traditional kilns emitting thick black smoke from the chimney./However, kiln owners have been violating such a ban by continuing with their businesses and charging huge profits./Meanwhile, the AC examined various restaurants along Bhimber Road in the city area and sealed two restaurants for committing violation of the standard operating procedures to avoid the spread of Covid-19./On the other hand, Kharian AC Khalid Abbas imposed a Rs20,000 fine on the management of a petrol station near Jandanwala along GT Road for a fault in the gauge of fuel machine."
Steel furnaces sealed in Khyber, The district administration on Wednesday sealed at least three steel furnaces for emitting poisonous gases and causing air pollution in the area./A statement issued from the DC office said that several other furnaces and small industrial units were issued notices for using substandard smoke filters./Officials of the district administration along with environment department staff and police visited several industrial units in the vicinity of Bara bazaar in Alamgudar and Karigarh Garhi and found gases billowing from some of them and polluting environment in the nearby areas./The officials said the action was taken against the units following public complaints about the increasing pollution.
The unequal opportunity killer," ONCE again Lahore has been enveloped in the same old thing: smog - now known as the city's fifth season - is here to stay and there is no respite for the people./The days are grey and dreary, with thick clouds of fumes hovering over the city horizon, drastically dimming the sight of buildings that can be seen easily on a clear day./Generally, the nights are better; there are fewer cars and less pollution./But since a few days, even late at night almost the entire city remains so badly affected by the poisonous mask of dust and smoke that it seems it has entered some kind of dystopic nightmare./Shahid, a food deliverer, feels as if he has suddenly been transported into an eerie, claustrophobic other-world. 'It doesn't feel like the Lahore I grew up in,' he says. 'There were always cars around, there was always bad air, but no one would have thought that we would end up like this. One can hardly breathe.'/Shahid's duty hours begin late in the evening and last till 4am. With restaurants closing down, more and more orders for home delivery of food are being placed./But for workers like Shahid, who are more exposed to the outside air, they may be relatively safe from Covid but are facing other serious threats to their health. It is said that air pollution is an 'invisible killer'./'We have been seeing so many more patients with respiratory illnesses,' says Dr Irshad, who works in the emergency ward of a large private hospital. 'They are coming in with allergies, breathing problems - we have had to nebulise a person tonight - and there have been many cases of eye irritation or allergies, too.'/Patients are not restricted to emergency visits. Doctors have been observing an increase in the incidence of respiratory illnesses - a persistent smoker's type cough, sore throat and lung infections - but some say health of mothers and children has also been compromised./'Those mothers who live in low-income areas are usually more prone to pregnancy complications,' says Dr Shaheena, a maternal health specialist. 'Babies born may be stunted or underweight - and even have brain damage - which are all consequences of lead poisoning.'/There has been an increase in the number of industrial units inside, outside and around Lahore. It is the same with vehicles. But the areas closer to the noxious gas-emitting factories are mostly inhabited by poor people. Residents of these areas are faced not just with industrial fumes but also heavy traffic. This is yet another socioeconomic divide./Shehnaz, a domestic worker, is a resident of Haji Park, a low-income area that is adjacent to two or three large factories. Since the last two years, she has had a constant cough. At first she thought it was seasonal, but when months passed, she became worried./Several medicines later she discovered the only way she could find some relief was by using an inhaler. 'Sometimes I can feel the particles as I breathe in and it hurts when I inhale,' she says./Families of the area became even more worried after Amjad, who lived very close to one of the factories died of a respiratory illness. But as they had little influence or power, not much could be done about it./Amjad's family, however, wants the factories to be shut down. 'We live here, this is no place for an industry,' says his son Majid. 'They should move into a proper zone so that people aren't affected… by these toxins in the air (and water).'/In 2019, the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution put the total annual air pollution-related premature deaths in Pakistan at around 128,005, placing the country at number 3 out of the 10 worst countries./In Lahore this week air quality reached 'hazardous' proportions (the last level shown on the Air quality charts), while it has consistently been subjected to 'unhealthy' levels, the main pollutant being PM2.5 or particulate matter that cannot be seen and is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and is then carried to the organs, including the brain./Tabitha Spence, who is part of the Haqooq-i-Khalq Movement, a social platform raising voice for the underprivileged and marginalised, has been helping to set up free medical camps in many working class neighbourhoods across Punjab. 'Doctors who work with us note that the bulk of the illnesses they see in these communities are completely preventable, ranging from respiratory issues to waterborne diseases,' she says./'Poor people are much more exposed to air pollution, as their communities are treated as dumping grounds for industrial waste. Many live in drafty homes in the industrial areas where they work, subjecting them to the non-stop assault of toxic air billowing out of factories and brick kilns, which are not checked by the scantily enforced air quality regulations,' she adds./People who live in nicer neighbourhoods - usually areas away from the main roads, or the suburbs - tend to be protected to an extent by residential zoning laws that create some distance between their homes and the industrial units. They also have 'social capital', allowing them to take action (legal and otherwise) when a specific polluter is out of line. 'While rich people still suffer the effects of pollution, they are able to insulate themselves with sturdier homes, costly air filters, and travelling by car,' she adds./Meanwhile, it remains unclear as to why there has been a sudden spike in pollution, pushing air quality to hazardous levels. The dense cloud shrouding Lahore may be due to aerosols which, researchers say, lowers visibility. Unfortunately, this has still not become an electoral issue, mainly because of a lack of awareness and dearth of reliable data."
"Experts discuss ways to curb air pollution, vehicular emissions"," The World Wide Fund for Nature Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan), in collaboration with the Pakistan Engineering Congress (PEC), conducted an awareness drive with traffic wardens and the civil society on Tuesday./According to a press release, the event was organised to establish a consensus on the roles, responsibilities and actions required to ensure clean air for all, especially traffic wardens who are on the front lines and directly exposed to polluted air./In her opening remarks, Nazifa Butt, the WWF-Pakistan Climate and Energy Programme senior manager, talked about their efforts to recreate awareness about air pollution and its repercussions, not only through digital platforms, but also face-to-face seminars with key stakeholders. Air pollution not only remains a global environmental threat, but also has immense economic implications./Lahore Waste Management Company Assistant Manager Nimra Zareen highlighted the initiatives taken by the organisation in managing waste in Lahore and actions to tackle the issue of waste burning, which exacerbates health problems./According to Wajeeh Usman, a transport economist from the Transport Planning Unit, transport-related emissions are responsible for a staggering 43 per cent of the total emissions in Pakistan, and the role of policy and hard interventions such as vehicular pollution control technology, introduction of low sulphur fuels, better traffic management etc are essential in tackling the issue. He also pointed to initiatives such as the Vehicular Inspection and Certification System and extensive road checking campaigns in the transport sector./Provincial Disaster Management Authority Additional Director General Hameed Malik spoke about the GIS mapping of brick kilns, shutting down of kilns not using zigzag technology and controlling crop stubble burning./The chief guest, Senior Traffic Officer Waseem Dar, said: 'Vehicular emissions are the top contributors to air pollution and the traffic police is at the forefront. To counter the problem, heavy fines are imposed on vehicles producing smoke beyond legal limits and those which do not have fitness certificates.'/WWF-Pakistan Water, Food and Climate Programmes Senior Director Dr Masood Arshad stated: 'Air quality in Pakistan is deteriorating rapidly, with a yearly average of 68 micrograms per cubic metre of respirable particulate matter (PM) 2.5micron, which is significantly above the National Environmental Quality Standard for ambient air set at 15 micrograms per cubic metre. The Air Quality Index has been observed between 200 and 400, which is beyond the healthy limit, thus leading to adverse health effects, such as respiratory problems, on the country's population.'/Later, 150 smog kits were provided to traffic wardens to mitigate the problem of poor air quality and ensure all required protective equipment is available with them. Each kit contained a PM2.5 mask, eye drops and lozenges to alleviate eye and throat irritation."
Smog fallout," THE dreaded 'fifth season' has arrived. A sombre grey shroud has enveloped the city of Lahore and the adjoining towns and cities, reminding the poor - once again -that no one is looking out for them. While those who can afford it might invest in precautions like air purifiers; they may be able to shut their doors and windows, etc. However, people whose livelihoods depend on them plying the roads at any time of the day and night, or those living in low-income localities next to industrial areas can do little except hope that the authorities take some measures for them to be able to, quite literally, breathe easier./Earlier this week air quality in Lahore reached hazardous levels while during November it was recorded as approaching a shocking high of AQI500. The situation is neither new nor unexpected. For several years now, the month of December has brought, besides chilly weather, a suffocating blanket of smoke and pollutants that affects not only everyday life and movement, but also has a debilitating effect on the public's health. In Lahore, hospitals are reporting a significant increase in allergies and respiratory illnesses. Other health problems such as smoker's cough have become more pronounced and prevalent than before. Moreover, by inhaling pollutant-laden air, expectant mothers in low-income areas are damaging their health and also that of their unborn babies, leading to complications during pregnancy or childbirth. The Global Alliance on Health and Pollution estimated air pollution-related deaths in Pakistan to be around 128,005 in 2019, ranking third highest among the ten countries with the worst air quality. Earlier in the month, Lahore stood sixth among the world's top ten cities with the worst air quality. (While Karachi ranked fourth, it has the advantage of being a coastal city.) The authorities need to address this issue immediately before it gets out of hand. They must devise both short- and long-term strategies for cleaning up their act so that the people of Lahore do not continue to suffer."
Combating pollution," WHILE Pakistan's carbon emissions are very low in comparison to the rest of the world, it is among the most polluted countries in terms of ambient (outdoor) air pollution and water contamination. According to rankings compiled by IQAir, Pakistan was the world's second most polluted country in the world for both 2018 as well as 2019, behind Bangladesh, with air quality characterised as 'unhealthy' as measured by levels of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter that have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres)./The annual average concentration of PM2.5 recorded for the country as a whole was seven times higher than the World Health Organisation's recommended air quality guideline. For several months of the year, Pakistan's main urban centres, especially Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar and Faisalabad - are ranked among the cities with least safe air quality in the world ranging from unhealthy to outright hazardous, with Lahore alternating with New Delhi as the top-ranked city globally between November and February each year./At the time of writing, the air quality index (AQI) value for Lahore was 178, according to specialist website IQAir, which indicates a PM2.5 concentration of 108.2 µg/m³. This level is characterised as 'unhealthy' for all population groups, according to the Air Quality Monitor scale of the US Environmental Protection Agency./Exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause a variety of adverse health outcomes. According to the WHO: 'It increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer.' Other research indicates that every 10 µg/m³ increase in PM 2.5, increases all-cause mortality between 3-26 per cent, chances of childhood asthma by 16pc, chances of lung cancer by 36pc and heart attacks by 44pc. The WHO estimates that ambient air pollution accounts for an estimated 4.2 million deaths per year worldwide./Air quality is at hazardous levels, and a more robust policy response is needed./The estimates for the number of premature deaths caused annually by pollution in Pakistan vary from 22,600 in the mid-2000s, to well over 300,000 as of 2015. Based on data for more recent years, air pollution is the sixth leading risk factor for mortality in Pakistan. According to the State of Global Air Report 2019, 47pc of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are attributable to air pollution in Pakistan, in addition to 32pc of deaths from lung cancer./The health costs attributable to ambient air pollution are substantial. A 2014 study by the World Bank estimated that Pakistan's annual burden of disease due to outdoor air pollution accounted for 163,432 disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) lost. The State of Global Air 2019 Report found that 'exposure to outdoor PM2.5 accounted for a loss of one year and seven months in life expectancy'./Air pollution is not just a health issue but a significant (and growing) development challenge. High levels of ambient air pollution impose significant costs on society and the economy. The World Bank has estimated that, for the world as a whole, the cost associated with health damage from ambient air pollution is around $5.7 trillion, equivalent to over 5pc of global GDP. According to its findings, 'In individual countries, the economic burden of pollution associated with premature mortality and morbidity is also significant, equivalent to 5 to 14pc of countries' GDPs'./The costs associated with pollution are both direct as well as indirect, and include health and social costs, environmental costs, economic costs incurred by households as well as firms, and fiscal costs. To address the issue of pollution (as well as carbon emission), a range of policy instruments are available and in use around the world. These include inter alia:/- Clean-air legislation, tighter regulation and greater enforcement with regard to emission standards and safeguards;/- Introduction of cleaner fuels in transportation and power generation;/- Adoption of carbon sequestration and offsetting measures, such as KP's billion-tree tsunami initiative or the Punjab afforestation programme;/- Provision of subsidy and/or grants for adoption of cleaner fuels and newer technology;/- A congestion tax;/- Emissions Trading Systems (or 'cap-and-trade' systems). These are specific to carbon emissions;/- A 'carbon' tax levied on motor fuels, vehicle purchase and/or ownership, tailpipe emissions, and on polluter industries;/- Mandating targets for the sale of electric and hybrid vehicles./The major sources of ambient air pollution worldwide include inefficient modes of transport (polluting fuels and vehicles), inefficient combustion of household fuels for cooking, lighting and heating, coal-fired power plants, agriculture, and waste burning. In Pakistan's case, with the rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles on road from approximately 4.5m in 2001 to a provisional estimated 29.5m by 2020, vehicular emissions are estimated to account for over 40pc of ambient air pollution./Hence, by virtue of the well-established 'polluter pays principle', a green tax on motor fuels is an option worth considering, as one of several multipronged measures. This tax could take the form of a nominal per-litre levy on motor fuels sold in the country, with the advantage of being both targeted as well as an 'efficient' tax with low compliance and administrative costs. It is unlikely to be inflationary if set at well below Rs1 per litre, allaying a key concern of the government./Since petroleum pricing is a federal subject under the Constitution, the federal government will need to introduce the 'green' tax on every litre sold, and pass on the proceeds as a straight transfer to each province under the NFC Award. The revenue raised can be used to partially defray the substantial economic and health costs incurred as a result of air pollution, as well as build sub-national governments' fiscal capacity to make appropriate investments and incur expenditures to reduce ambient pollution levels./In summary, Pakistan has a serious pollution problem. With rapid urbanisation as well as motorisation, its poor air quality is deteriorating further, posing very significant health risks for its population as well as its economic trajectory. Concerted policy action is needed on a wide front to deal with the challenge."
