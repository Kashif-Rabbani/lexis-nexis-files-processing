Pakistan: Air pollution causing respiratory diseases,"QUETTA, July 4 -- Stakeholders were not playing their due role to reduce air pollution that making a large number of people suffering from respiratory and skin diseases in Quetta. This was said by experts who were talking to media, here on Wednesday. Dr Munir Ahmed Raisani, chest specialist and former programme manager TB Control Programme Balochistan said "" ongoing construction work on bridges and roads, installation of crushing machines on mountains surrounding Quetta valley and plying of old vehicles were damaging air quality"". He said that thousands of carbon emitting vehicles that was called little Paris in past but now not only causing air pollution but noise pollution too that making citizens suffering from depression and respiratory diseases. A large number of patients suffering from respiratory disease, asthma, Tuberculosis and other, daily visit hospitals and private clinics he said adding that carbon, nitrogen, smoke and dust particles in the air causing diseases among people. /He revealed that presently, every third person of the city was suffering from respiratory disease because of non-availability of healthy air and environment. He said that Provincial TB Control Programme conducted a contacted observation survey that unveiled that every 10 to 15 persons out of total 100 might be vulnerable to TB and other fatal respiratory diseases due to air pollution. He said that air pollution could be controlled and improved if attention paid to complete ongoing work on road and bridge construction as early as possible, making the vehicles in dilapidated condition off road, and implementation of rules and regulations strictly to control road traffic. When contacted, renowned scientist and former manager of International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Balochistan chapter, Zabardast Khan Bangash said that Quetta is narrow valley surrounded by mountains and air enters the city through narrow passage of mountains with speed that also brings dust. "" When carbon dioxide mixes with dust particles and it hovers on the city with rising of temperature at daytime while it could not leave the city because of surrounding high mountains and resultantly, at evening time, it comes down, causing respiratory, skin and lungs diseases,"" Bangash said. He said that Government Vehicular Examiner System had totally failed as the official concerned were allegedly issuing vehicle fitness certificates from their office instead of testing the fitness of vehicle whether it was meeting the standard or emitting carbon, contributing into surging level of air pollution. He alleged that bribe culture had affected the performance of vehicle fitness test system and causing the air pollution. He also blamed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for not playing its due role in controlling air pollution."" It seems that EPA has lack of Will power or it deliberately, does not want to take action against the elements responsible for air pollution,"" he said. He said that according to rules and regulation, it was responsibility of the EPA to register cases against vehicles owners whose vehicles emit carbon and dispatch the cases to Environmental Tribunal for trial. He said that unfortunately, civil society was also not playing practical role to raise awareness among citizens about damages of air pollution those creating and increasing fatal diseases. Muhammad Ali Batur, Deputy Director, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Government of Balochistan told this scribe that causes of air pollution in the city include slow moving traffic, old vehicles, emission of carbon dioxide from diesel vehicles and nitrogen oxide from petrol vehicles and chopping of trees. He said that most of people do not pay attention to arrange tuning and maintenance of their vehicle those continue emitting carbondioxide, nitro oxide sulphur and poisonous gases. He said that EPA found out that sub-standard fuel was being sold out in several gasoline stations. He emphasised the need to check whether all petroleum service stations have certificates that the petrol and diesel being sold out there was meet standard. He underlined the need to ensure issuance of fitness certificates to vehicles after their practical examination instead issuing it only from office. He said that it is need of hour to make Motor Examiner Department functional if the stakeholders were sincere to reduce air pollution. When asked whether EPA was not responsible to test the vehicles on road. He replied,"" Keeping in view the current law and order situation of Balochistan, whether it would be not life risky to stand on roads and test the vehicles,"" he said. He, however, sought integrated efforts of all stakeholders including EPA, Traffic Police, District Management, and Motor Examiner Department to test the vehicles. There should be enforcement of law that vehicle found emitting carbon dioxide would be made off road or confiscated, he said. He said that his department had registered cases against several vehicles owners for violation of environmental laws adding that however, EPA lonely could not resolve the issue and other stakeholders especially district management and Traffic Police would have to extend their cooperation to EPA/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Various types of pollution increasing allergic asthma patients in city,"HYDERABAD, July 6 -- The increasing air pollution, vehicle smoke/and dust put the number of allergic asthmatic patients high in urban areas of Hyderabad and there is need of formation of an effective strategy to control air pollution./Eminent pulmonologist and Head of the Department of Pulmonology,/Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Jamshoro Dr./Rashid Ahmed Khan expressed his concern over the increasing allergic/asthmatic disease in Hyderabad in an interview with this scribe on Friday./He said that the smoke of increasing number of new and unfit vehicles/as well as dust, which go into air because of development work, were the main reasons for increasing allergic asthmatics among the residents of/urban localities./Dr. Rashid Ahmed said the cigarette smoke, animal dander, mold spores,/house dust, feather pillows, some foods, or any other sensitive substance,/infections, emotional stress, fatigue, endocrine and climate changes are also the main sources of eruption of the disease among the people./He said that asthma is an allergic disorder that is characterised by/spasm of the muscles in the walls of the small air passages to the lungs, which results in the shortness of breath and wheezing./About symptoms, he informed that an attack may begin gradually;/resulting in increasing respiratory distress and it could also begin dramatically with the onset of severe multiple symptoms such as tightness/in the chest, difficulties in inhaling and exhaling and coughing. Feelings of suffocation and difficulty in speaking could also occur, he added./Dr. Rashid said that asthma sufferers rarely die from an asthma/attack, but the feeling of suffocation as their airways begin to close/often makes them fear that they have already gasped their last breath./He said that asthma is a disorder of the respiratory system in which/the passages that enable air to pass into and out of the lungs/periodically narrow, causing coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath./This narrowing is typically temporary and reversible, but in severe/attacks, asthma may result in death and most commonly refers to bronchial asthma, an inflammation of the airways, but the term is also used to refer to cardiac asthma, which develops when fluid builds up in the lungs as a complication of heart failure and this article focuses on bronchial/asthma, Dr. Rashid Ahmed added./He said that asthma attacks occur when the bronchi and bronchioles/become inflamed, reducing the space through which air can travel through/the lungs and this causes the asthmatic to work harder to move air in and/out of the lungs./Dr. Rashid Ahmed said frequency of asthma attacks varies considerably/among asthma sufferers and some people have daily attacks, while others/can go for months or even years without having an attack./He said that common causes of asthma attacks are extremely small and/lightweight particles transported through the air and inhaled into the/lungs and when they enter the airways, these particles, known as environmental triggers, cause an inflammatory response in the airway/walls, resulting in an asthma attack, he added./He said that asthma also occurs among those people who do not have/allergies and in these persons, chemical irritants trigger an inflammatory/response that is initiated in a different way than in allergen-triggered asthma and for example, some people are sensitive to certain common/chemical irritants, such as perfume, hairspray, cosmetics, and household/cleaners/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Polluted air linked to autism risk,"LAHORE, July 10 -- Pregnant women who live in smog-filled areas may be twice as likely to have children with autism, a new study suggests./""The study does not prove that pollution increases risk for autism. It found an association,"" cautioned lead author Andrea Roberts, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. ""It adds to the weight of the evidence that there may be something in air pollution that increases risk for autism."" Researchers compared exposure to air pollution among 325 women who had a child with autism and 22,000 women who did not. The women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study II. Pollutants measured included diesel particulate matter, lead, manganese, mercury, methylene chloride, and a combined measure of metal exposure./Twenty percent to 60 percent of the women lived in areas considered highly polluted. And the study showed that: those women who lived in the 20 percent of locations that had the highest levels of diesel particulates or mercury in the air were twice as likely to have a child with autism, compared to those who lived in the 20 percent of areas with the lowest levels of these pollutants. In addition, those who lived in the 20 percent of locations with the highest levels of lead, manganese, methylene chloride, and combined metal exposure were about 50 percent more likely to have a child with autism than those who lived in the 20 percent of areas with the lowest concentrations./The findings held even after the researchers took into account other factors known to affect autism risk, such as income, education and smoking during pregnancy. Overall, the association was stronger for boys than it was for girls, but the number of girls included in the new study was too low to draw any firm conclusions. The findings, which were published June 18 online in Environmental Health Perspectives, do add to a growing body of research that suggests the air women breathe while pregnant is one of many factors linked to autism risk. Previous studies have shown that pregnant women who live in polluted areas or close to freeways are more likely to have a child with autism, but the studies were done regionally. The new data is nationwide. Exactly how, or even if, air pollution affects the developing brain is murky. ""By definition, pollution is stuff that is not good for us,"" Roberts said./Still, the overall increase in autism risk that may be attributed to pollution is low. ""Let's say a woman's risk for having a child with autism is one in 100, women who live in the most polluted cities have a risk that is about one in 50, which means that 49 children would not have autism,"" Roberts said. ""Even if the risk is doubled, it's still low,"" she explained. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now estimates that about one in 50 children aged 6 to 17 in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder, the name for a larger group of disorders that can range from the mild to the severe, and affect social and communication skills. Other experts also urged caution in interpreting the new findings./""There many genes, probably hundreds, and many environmental factors, probably hundreds, that increase risk of autism,"" said Alycia Halladay, senior director for environmental and clinical sciences at the advocacy group Autism Speaks. ""The real message is that a lot of things cause autism, namely genetics and the environment and their interaction."" Laura Anthony, the associate director of the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., said that these risks accrue during pregnancy, delivery and within the first month of a newborn's life. ""Everything points to that as the critical period. This is the time when the brain is most sensitive because it is still developing,"" she said. The new findings don't mean that pregnant women should head for the hills to avoid smog, Anthony added. ""Even if you live someplace rural, you may be exposed to pollution while driving or you could live in a rural place right next to a plant [or factory],"" she said. ""We all need to campaign for cleaner air for a lot of reasons./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution linked to over 2 million deaths each year: study,"ISLAMABAD, July 14 -- U.S. researchers claimed Friday that human- caused outdoor air pollution may be responsible for over two million deaths worldwide each year. The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, estimated that around 470,000 people die each year because of human-caused increases in ozone. It also estimated that around 2.1 million deaths are caused each year by human-caused increases in fine particulate matter, tiny particles suspended in the air that can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing cancer and other respiratory disease. /""Our estimates make outdoor air pollution among the most important environmental risk factors for health,"" co-author of the study, Jason West, from the University of North Carolina, said in a statement. ""Many of these deaths are estimated to occur in East Asia and South Asia, where population is high and air pollution is severe."" According to the study, the number of these deaths that can be attributed to changes in the climate since the industrial era is, however, relatively small. It estimated that a changing climate results in 1,500 deaths due to ozone and 2,200 deaths related to fine particulate matter each year. Climate change affects air quality in many ways, possibly leading to local increases or decreases in air pollution, it said. For instance, temperature and humidity can change the reaction rates which determine the formation or lifetime of a pollutant, and rainfall can determine the time that pollutants can accumulate. Higher temperatures can also increase the emissions of organic compounds from trees, which can then react in the atmosphere to form ozone and particulate matter, said the study. ""Very few studies have attempted to estimate the effects of past climate change on air quality and health. We found that the effects of past climate change are likely to be a very small component of the overall effect of air pollution,"" West added/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Diesel fumes pose high risk to diabetics,"ISLAMABAD, July 14 -- Exposure to diesel fumes, for even a few hours, is putting diabetics at a higher risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, a study has found. Nano Diesel Exhaust Particles (DEP) enter the blood stream of diabetic patients through the nasal/respiratory tract and cause systemic inflammation (swelling) of heart tissues and other vital organs, proves the study, Health News reported. Exposure of between 24-48 hours can have an acute effect on the patients by causing a risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory issues, while long-term chronic effects can lead to the development of cancer cells in the human body. /Though harmful environmental particles affect healthy humans as well, the effect is greater on diabetic patients, said Prof Abderrahim Nemmar who carried out the two-year study at the UAE University's Department of Physiology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences. The experiment was carried out on mice with Type 1 (genetically inherited) diabetes with the dose of particle exposure comparable to human exposure. According to the professor, similar international environmental studies have proved that pollutants can affect the heart and brain. ""Our studies demonstrate an increase in susceptibility to the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of DEP in Type 1 diabetic mice compared to healthy ones,"" said Prof Nemmar. ""We found that acute exposure (24 hours) of mice to DEP induced pulmonary and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, liver dysfunction and thrombotic (clotting) events in cerebral micro vessels and that these effects were aggravated in diabetic mice."" ""Upon observation, small aggregates of carbonaceous particles and a substantial amount of ultrafine (nano)-sized particles (less than 100 nanometres) were seen,"" he explained. ""The inhaled nano-sized particles can penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract, pass into the systemic circulation and reach various organs,"" added the professor.Concluding from the study Professor Nemmar said that it would be advisable for diabetics to avoid peak traffic hours and extreme heat. ""Face masks can be worn but even then these nano-particles get through."" ""Doctors should also pass on this advice to their patients,"" he added. ""It proves that pollutants from heavy trucks that use diesel because it is cheaper than other kinds of fuel, have a bad impact on our health,"" he said. ""The particles not only affect the lung functions but all parts of the body,"" he added. ""Concerted efforts are needed to reduce the air pollution with such dangerous elements either by working on reducing the rates of the consumption of diesel by using other kinds of fuel, or by reducing heavy truck traffic in the residential areas,"" he said/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Poor air quality boosts risk of lung cancer, heart failure","ISLAMABAD, July 16 -- European researchers have warned that air pollution, largely from traffic fumes significantly increases risk of developing lung cancer and heart diseases. An international team of research observed 35 studies with data for thousands of patients in 12 countries, including some European states, the US and China, Press Tv reported. /The study of 300,000 people over a period of 13 years shows that areas where traffic increased, residents had a higher risk of developing lung cancer and heart failure, according to the paper published in the international medical journal The Lancet. Some 2095 people from among the total participated number have been diagnosed with lung cancer. In patients involved in heart failure, the pollution leads the heart muscle to become weak and less good at its job of pumping blood around the body. This condition is regarded as the consequence of a heart attack. The danger highly threatens those people exposed to high levels of pollution where gases such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and other gaseous pollutants can get deep into the lungs and, from there, into the bloodstream. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution in towns and cities kills 1.3 million people globally each year.

Pakistan: COPD explained,"KARACHI, July 19 -- COPD is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. ""Progressive"" means the disease gets worse over time./COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms./Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants-such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust-also may contribute to COPD./The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways./Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli./Small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange./The airways and air sacs are elastic. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out./In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: the airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality, the walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed, the walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or the airways make more mucus than usual, which can clog them/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Population influx in city linked to rising pollution,"KARACHI, July 23 -- Population influx in the metropolitan city is causing alarming levels of environmental pollution and health hazards./People from all provinces of the country are settling in the metropolis for jobs and other businesses, increasing air, sea and water pollution. Natural resources like water are also depleting./Due to the population explosion, people are being forced to drink polluted water and many of them have been affected by waterborne diseases like diarrhoea and vomiting./As of April 2013, Karachi has an estimated population of 23.5 million people and is the third largest populous city of the world./The government has taken no significant action to control the population rise, and the city's resources are declining while levels of pollution are gradually rising. There is an urgent need to control the city's population./According to the National Forum for Environment and Health, Karachi generates 25 tonnes of garbage on daily basis, of which only 25 percent is being disposed of./Except for the posh localities, the city's streets have become dumping sites for garbage as the local bodies are not properly carrying out their duties./The Malir and Lyari rivers have been encroached upon at many locations and huge quantities of garbage are being dumped into them./The irony is that the storm-water drains are being used for dumping garbage rather than ensuring smooth flow of sewage./It is the duty of the provincial government to treat sewage before it is released into the sea, which is a breeding ground for fish and other sea life./The Economic Survey of Pakistan 2012-13 states that Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world with an estimated population of 184.35 million in 2012-2013./The growth rate of population in 2012-2013 was two percent. Under the current circumstances, Pakistan might attain the fifth position in the world in terms of population by 2050./The survey says population density in Pakistan was 231 in 2012-13. Due to uneven distribution of population, its density varies dramatically, ranging from scarcely populated arid areas, especially in Balochistan, to some of the highest urban densities like Karachi and Lahore./Global warming and the change in seasonal and monsoon patterns can cause more heavy rains in the city like in the past and pollute the atmosphere as rainwater drains are filled with garbage./There is an urgent need to implement the environmental laws to ensure a safe environment in the megalopolis./Owing to a rise in vehicles in the city, smoke pollution has also jumped to an alarming level. Resultantly, people are experiencing respiratory diseases./All major arteries of the city release high levels of smoke in the air, but the authorities concerned seem indifferent to overcoming the air pollution.

Pakistan: '30pc population of Karachi suffering from skin diseases',"KARACHI, Aug. 5 -- Approximately 30 percent population of Karachi is suffering from different types of skin diseases due to poor cleanliness, industrialisation, urbanisation and lack of proper awareness about the disease./Senior Skin Specialist Dr Qamar Iqbal told media here that the ratio of skin diseases is high in those people who had oily and dry skin as compared to those having normal skin. He said extremeness of weather increases the risk of skin diseases among the masses in the country./He informed that scabies, eczema, heat rash and rash on different parts of the body and hair fall are common skin disease in the country. He said around 1,500 to 2,000 people visit different Out-patient Departments (OPDs) at the Institute of Skin Diseases Hospital in the holy month of Ramazan and the number of cases increased in the normal days./Dr Qamar said industrialisation, urbanisation and air pollution were the major causes behind surge of skin disease in the city. He informed that skin disease cases are high in big cities like Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad and Multan as compared to small cities, towns and villages./He informed that skin disease cases automatically increase in summer and monsoon season. He advised the people to remain clean and use hygienic food to prevent from skin disease in summer. He urged the affected persons to stay away from healthy people and do not share your towel with others during disease. He said skin diseases were transferable and may affect other people too./He further informed that the Institute of Skin Diseases Karachi is providing healthcare service to the people across Pakistan and Afghanistan as well. He said around 18 different OPDs were functional in the hospital. He said there were separate OPDs facilities for male and female patients in the hospital./He stressed the need of establishment and upgrading the primary health care centres at town level for provision of better healthcare facilities at the doorstep of poor people in the country.

Pakistan: Worldwide air pollution deaths per year number over 2 million,"ISLAMABAD, Aug. 14 -- Air pollution may be responsible for more than 2 million deaths around the world each year, according to a new study. The study estimated that 2.1 million deaths each year are linked with fine particulate matter, tiny particles that can get deep into the lungs and cause health problems, Huff Post Green reported. /Exposure to particle pollution has been linked with early death from heart and lung diseases, including lung cancer, the researchers said; meanwhile, concentrations of particulate matter have been increasing due to human activities. The study also found that 470,000 deaths yearly are linked with human sources of ozone, which forms when pollutants from sources such as cars or factories come together and react. Exposure to ozone has been linked to death from respiratory diseases. Most of the estimated global deaths likely occur in East and South Asia, which have large populations and severe air pollution, said study researcher Jason West, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""Air pollution is an important problem. It's probably one of the most important environmental risk factors for health,"" West said. The study suggests that improving air quality around the world would increase life expectancy for some, he said. While some studies have suggested that climate change can make air pollution more deadly, the new study found that climate change had only a small effect on air pollution-related deaths.Pollution and climate interact in several ways. Climate-related factors such as temperature and humidity can affect the reaction rates of particles in the air, which in turn determine the formation of pollutants; additionally, rainfall can affect accumulation of pollutants, the researchers said. However, in the researchers' analysis, changes in climate were linked with just 1,500 yearly deaths from ozone pollution, and 2,200 yearly deaths from fine particulate matter/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Exposure to ozone has been linked to death from respiratory diseases. Most of the estimated global deaths likely occur in East and South Asia, which have large populations and severe air pollution, said study researcher Jason West, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""Air pollution is an important problem. It's probably one of the most important environmental risk factors for health,"" West said. The study suggests that improving air quality around the world would increase life expectancy for some, he said. While some studies have suggested that climate change can make air pollution more deadly, the new study found that climate change had only a small effect on air pollution-related deaths. Pollution and climate interact in several ways. Climate-related factors such as temperature and humidity can affect the reaction rates of particles in the air, which in turn determine the formation of pollutants; additionally, rainfall can affect accumulation of pollutants, the researchers said. However, in the researchers' analysis, changes in climate were linked with just 1,500 yearly deaths from ozone pollution, and 2,200 yearly deaths from fine particulate matter. The researchers used a number of climate models to estimate concentrations of air pollution around the world, in the years 1850 (the pre-industrial era) and 2000. Focusing on these two years allowed the researchers to determine what proportion of air pollution was human-caused (attributable to industrialization). Then, the researchers used information from past studies on air pollution and health to determine how many deaths are linked with particular concentrations of air pollution, West said. The new study had an advantage over previous work in that it did not rely on just one climate model, but instead included several. However, because the study used information from previous research on air pollution and health, the estimates are subject to the same uncertainties that characterized those previous studies. In addition, most of the studies on air pollution and health were conducted in the United States, so applying those results globally, as the current study did, introduces some uncertainty, West said/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Household air pollution major contributor to NCDs: WHO,"ISLAMABAD, Sept.. 7 -- Household air pollution (HAP) which is a major contributor to lower respiratory tract infections in children and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults, remains a neglected issue, WHO said. Reduction in HAP will be added as the tenth target in the global action plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), said World Health Organisation (WHO) in a statement. The target calls for 50 percent reduction in households using solid fuels like wood, crop residue, dried dung, coal and charcoal as primary cooking source, it said. /Other adverse effects of HAP include tuberculosis, cataract, cerebrovascular disease and poor maternal outcome, including still births, WHO said adding that an estimated 3.5 million deaths in 2010 were attributed to HAP globally. The other nine voluntary global targets stress on 25 percent relative reduction in overall mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease, at least 10 percent reduction in harmful use of alcohol, 30 percent reduction in tobacco use in persons aged over 15 years and a halt in rise of obesity. All these targets are to be achieved by 2025, the statement said. According to WHO, four major NCDs like cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer and diabetes together kill the largest number of people in the region. NCDs take a huge toll on national economies and disproportionately affect poor, impoverished families and are a growing burden on health systems, pti quoted Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia as saying. These targets are ambitious goals and demonstrate that governments are serious about reducing NCDs, he added. Health ministers from 11 countries will meet at the 66th session of WHOs Regional Committee for South-East Asia here between September 11 and 13 to chalk out an action plan for prevention and control of NCDs/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Air pollution linked to over 2 million deaths each year: study (Oct. 3, 2013)","ISLAMABAD, Oct. 3 -- U.S. researchers claimed that human-caused outdoor air pollution may be responsible for over two million deaths worldwide each year. The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, estimated that around 470,000 people die each year because of human-caused increases in ozone. /It also estimated that around 2.1 million deaths are caused each year by human-caused increases in fine particulate matter, tiny particles suspended in the air that can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing cancer and other respiratory disease. ""Our estimates make outdoor air pollution among the most important environmental risk factors for health,"" co-author of the study, Jason West, from the University of North Carolina, said in a statement. ""Many of these deaths are estimated to occur in East Asia and South Asia, where population is high and air pollution is severe."" According to the study, the number of these deaths that can be attributed to changes in the climate since the industrial era is, however, relatively small. It estimated that a changing climate results in 1,500 deaths due to ozone and 2,200 deaths related to fine particulate matter each year. Climate change affects air quality in many ways, possibly leading to local increases or decreases in air pollution, it said. For instance, temperature and humidity can change the reaction rates which determine the formation or lifetime of a pollutant, and rainfall can determine the time that pollutants can accumulate. Higher temperatures can also increase the emissions of organic compounds from trees, which can then react in the atmosphere to form ozone and particulate matter, said the study. ""Very few studies have attempted to estimate the effects of past climate change on air quality and health. We found that the effects of past climate change are likely to be a very small component of the overall effect of air pollution,"" West added/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Parks and recreation,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 8 -- Public parks and recreational activities play a very important and pivotal role in helping improve physical and psychological health. They strengthen communities, and make our cities and neighbourhoods more attractive places to live and work./Yet, very few Pakistanis are able to enjoy these benefits. Most of our housing settlements are ill-planned. Specifically metropolitan areas suffer from very little park space available. Low-income neighbourhoods are especially short of park space. Thus, a great majority of us live in polluted, congested and environmentally unhealthy localities./Strong evidence shows that when people have access to parks, they exercise more. Regular physical activity has been shown to increase health and reduce the risk of a wide range of diseases, including heart disease, hypertension, colon cancer, and diabetes. Physical activity also relieves symptoms of depression and anxiety, improves mood, and enhances psychological well-being. Beyond the benefits of exercise, a growing body of research shows that contact with the natural world improves physical and psychological health./Parks and open space increase the value of neighboring residential property. Growing evidence points to a similar benefit on commercial property value. The availability of park and recreation facilities is an important quality-of-life factor for corporations choosing where to locate facilities and for well-educated individuals choosing a place to live./Green space in urban areas provides substantial environmental benefits. Trees reduce air pollution and water pollution and they help keep cities cooler./City parks also produce important social and community development benefits. They make inner-city neighbourhoods more livable; they offer recreational opportunities for at-risk youth, low-income children, and low-income families; and they provide places in low-income neighborhoods where people can feel a sense of community. Access to public parks and recreational facilities has been strongly linked to reductions in crime and in particular reduce delinquent behavior in children./Community gardens increase residents' sense of community ownership and stewardship, provide a focus for neighborhood activities, expose inner-city youth to nature, reduce crime by cleaning up vacant spaces, and build community leaders./For small children, playing is learning. Play has proved to be a critical element in a child's future success. Play helps kids develop muscle strength and coordination, language, cognitive thinking, and reasoning abilities./Even for teenagers and elder children, well managed parks can provide an outlet for expression and letting out their frustration. Recreational centres around parks can also help communities come together. There are publicly available classes in a vast array of subjects available at such centers which can be made around parks./Unfortunately, we have now resorted to lending out park space to fast food companies even in the nations capital!We can build parks in existing vacant spaces and in huge empty government lands.

Pakistan: WHO regional committee to meet on Oct 27,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 20 -- The 60th session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean will be inaugurated in Muscat, Oman, on October 27. The meeting will address a range of important health issues representing priorities for the 22 countries of the region, informs a press release issued by WHO Pakistan office here Friday./The meeting will review developments in polio eradication. Epidemiologically, wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission is at lowest recorded levels ever, with fewer cases in fewer districts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region's remaining endemic countries. No cases due to WPV type 3 have been recorded anywhere since April 2012. However, these achievements are seriously threatened by security challenges that have been reducing access to children in several areas and that have claimed the lives of a considerable number of vaccinators, particularly in Pakistan. Some other countries are also at increasing risk of polio outbreaks./Participating in the meeting are ministers of health, representatives of national, regional and international organizations and agencies concerned with health, as well as experts from WHO headquarters and the regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean./The opening session will be inaugurated by Bahar Idris Abu Garda, chair of the 59th session of the Regional Committee, Dr. Ala Alwan, WHO regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean, and Dr. Ahmed Bin Mohamed Al Saeedi, minister of health of Oman. Princess Muna Al-Hussein, WHO Patron of Nursing and Midwifery in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, will deliver the keynote speech./Maternal and child health is another health issue that will feature on top of the Regional Committee's agenda this year. The region has several countries in which under-5 mortality rates are among the lowest in the world, ranging between 7 and 10 per 1000 live births. However, the pace of progress is slow in the rest of the region, especially in the six countries which contribute to 82% of total under-5 deaths. As a result, the region is unlikely to achieve the targets set for MDGs 4 and 5 by 2015 unless intensive and accelerated progress is made./The Regional Committee will discuss progress made in the development of core capacities for implementing the International Health Regulations 2005, which are intended to rapidly identify and stop the emergence and spread of public health risks including emergency events./The committee will also review the regional strategy for health and environment which aims to reduce the impact of environment-related hazards. Environmental hazards are responsible for about 24% of the total burden of disease./The main environmental/risk factors prevailing in the region include unsafe water and sanitation, indoor air pollution and exposures to chemicals and wastes. Women and children are the groups most affected./The Regional Committee agenda also includes the subject of road safety. The region accounts for 10% of the world's road traffic deaths and ranks second among WHO regions in terms of road traffic fatality rate (21.3 per 100 000 population) compared to a global rate of 18.03 per 100 000 population. Young males at their prime productive age of 15-44 years are at highest risk, with serious implications for national development./The Regional Committee will address the key challenge of reaching universal health coverage in countries of the region. Its members will discuss a roadmap to universal health coverage based on detailed country health system profiles developed by the Regional Office showing strong and/weak points, opportunities and challenges as well as priorities for strengthening health systems./Tobacco is still a multidimensional problem in the region. One of the aspects of the problem reviewed by the Regional Committee is illicit tobacco trade. The Regional Committee will also discuss strategies for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Decisions and resolutions of regional interest adopted by the World Health Assembly and Executive Board in their most recent sessions will also be discussed/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Rising environmental pollution posses threat to health of capital's residents,"LAHORE, Oct. 31 -- Rising environmental pollution in the federal capital is posing a threat to the health of its residents, besides impacting adjoining areas of the city. The residents have expressed their concern and asked the concerned authorities to check the rising level of pollution, which is having hazardous effects on human health. /According to them, trees, improper garbage disposal and bad sewerage system were the main contributors of environmental degradation. They complained that lack of a proper system for solid waste treatment and uncovered drains running through the city were also causing bad odor. Multiple development projects such as widening of roads were carried out at the cost of trees, and that resulted in the concentration of harmful gases in the air, they said. Farooq Khan, a resident of the capital, told media that having more roads and more driving lanes might help alleviate traffic problems, but that also causes more air pollution. He said that an effective air-management plan was needed, which should also be focused on the introduction of an environment-friendly public transport system in order to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads. He said the step would also help in reducing air pollution from direct smoke emissions from vehicles. ""The authorities must evolve a strategy for the protection of trees,lan and water ponds,"" he suggested. Another resident, Zaghum Naqvi, said that widening of roads was undoubtedly need of the hour, but the authorities concerned must also focus on planting trees to avoid pollution hazards. When contacted, a CDA official said that the department was making serious efforts to eliminate pollution from the city by improving the sewerage system/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: UN says air pollution a leading cause of cancer,"ISLAMABAD, Nov. 1 -- The air we breathe is laced with cancer-causing substances and is being officially classified as carcinogenic to humans, the World Health Organization's cancer agency said. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cited data indicating that in 2010, 223,000 deaths from lung cancer worldwide resulted from air pollution, and said there was also convincing evidence it increases the risk of bladder cancer, Today's Zaman Reported. Depending on the level of exposure in different parts of the world, the risk was found to be similar to that of breathing in second-hand tobacco smoke, Kurt Straif, head of the agency's section that ranks carcinogens, told reporters in Geneva. /""Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,"" deputy head Dana Loomis said in a statement. ""The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution."" Air pollution, mostly caused by transport, power generation, industrial or agricultural emissions and residential heating and cooking, is already known to raise risks for a wide range of illnesses including respiratory and heart diseases. Research suggests that exposure levels have risen significantly in some parts of the world, particularly countries with large populations going through rapid industrialization, such as China. IARC reviewed thousands of studies on air pollution tracking populations over decades and other research such as those in which mice exposed to polluted air experienced increased numbers of lung tumors. In a statement released after reviewing the literature, the Lyon-based agency said both air pollution and ""particulate matter"" - a major component of it - would now be classified among its Group 1 human carcinogens. That ranks them alongside more than 100 other known cancer-causing substances in IARC's Group 1, including asbestos, plutonium, silica dust, ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke. Air pollution is highly variable over space and time. Loomis said there was relatively high exposure in Asia, South Asia, eastern North America, some places in Central America and Mexico, as well as North Africa. But although both the composition and levels of air pollution can vary dramatically from one location to the next, IARC said its conclusions applied to all regions of the world. ""Our conclusion is that this is a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths,"" Dr. Christopher Wild, director of IARC, told the news briefing in Geneva. IARC's ranking monographs program, sometimes known as the""encyclopedia of carcinogens"", aims to be an authoritative source of scientific evidence on cancer-causing substances. It has already classified many chemicals and mixtures that can be components of air pollution, including diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals and dusts. But this is the first time that experts have classified air pollution as a cause of cancer. Wild said he hoped the comprehensive evidence would help the WHO, which is revising its global 2005 guidelines on air quality. The U.N. agency makes on recommendations on public health issues to its 193 member states. Asked why it had taken so long to reach the conclusion, he said that one problem was the time lag between exposure to polluted air and the onset of cancer. ""Often we're looking at two, three or four decades once an exposure is introduced before there is sufficient impact on the burden of cancer in the population to be able to study this type of question,"" he said/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Parents and media need to do more,"ISLAMABAD, Nov. 8 -- Even though pneumonia is the biggest killer of under-5 children in Pakistan, making it a health emergency to be tackled on war footing, the country is far from affecting a decline in its incidence. While the government has done its bit by managing the introduction of the costly pneumococcal vaccine in the routine immunisation regime, both parents as well the media need to do more./The head of the department of paediatrics at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Dr. Tabish Hazir made this observation during an informal briefing organised here on Wednesday in connection with World Pneumonia Day, which is observed on November 12 every day to draw attention to the pneumococcal health crisis./Pneumonia kills 2 million children worldwide every year, with the largest percentage of deaths occurring in developing countries. Every 30 seconds, a child somewhere in the world, dies of pneumonia, making it the number one global cause of childhood mortality. India tops the scorecard with 40 million cases every year, followed by China (18 million), Pakistan and Nigeria (7 million each) and Bangladesh (6 million). In Pakistan, it is responsible for the death of 92,000 Under-5 children every year; the country contributes 18% to the global child deaths./Talking about parental responsibility, Dr. Tabish wondered why parents should be hesitant about taking their children to the nearest health facility for the administration of a vaccine that is available free of cost. ""Why don't they understand that vaccines are a child's right, and in order to safeguard his future, they must leave the comfort of their homes for a few minutes to protect him against pneumonia and other childhood diseases,"" he pondered. The participants thought that the polio eradication initiative, under which polio drops are administered at the doorsteps of the community, might be partially responsible for parents' lackadaisical approach./Pakistan is the first country in the South Asian region to have introduced pneumococcal vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunisation. A vaccine that would otherwise cost Rs18,000 per child, is available free of cost for protection against pneumonia in all major cities excluding the province of Balochistan, where logistic issues have prevented its introduction thus far./Dr. Tabish exhorted the media to play its role in raising public awareness about pneumonia so that the resultant rise in community demand can lead to improved uptake of the vaccine. ""The devastation and deaths caused by pneumonia needs to be highlighted at a scale that is commensurate with the magnitude of the disease,"" he stated. He said, the media does not highlight issues unless they are sensational. ""What you don't realise is that pneumonia has been and continues to be the largest killer of under-5 children ever since the last 20 years. What greater health emergency can there be in a country,"" he asked media representatives. Wondering why so many children should be dying of a disease that can be prevented and cured, he urged the media to contribute its share in promoting awareness. ""Every time a bird dies in Pakistan, the television channels go crazy devoting hours to the possible outbreak of bird flu, but there is no mention in the media of diseases of which children are dying every minute in this country,"" he added./From a medical perspective, Dr. Tabish shared that pneumonia is usually caused by infection with virus or bacteria. Conditions and risk factors that predispose to pneumonia include mal-nourishment and poor nutritional status, indoor air pollution caused by cooking with wood or coal and overcrowding within households. Appropriately treating underlying illnesses such as malnutrition, and exclusively breast-feeding children for the first 6 months of their life can decrease the risk of pneumonia. ""In children less than 6 months of age, exclusive breast feeding reduces both the risk and severity of disease,"" Dr. Tabish informed. Yet, unfortunately, Pakistan has the lowest breastfeeding rates in South Asia (37%), poorest complementary feeding practices and high rate of stunting. Add to these indicators, factors like overcrowding and indoor pollution, and the environment offers just the right recipe for further spread of childhood pneumonia./As far as the government is concerned, its role does not end with making the pneumococcal vaccine available. The government needs to pay heed to pneumonia as a national commitment, just as it is paying heed to polio eradication as an international commitment. It can utilize its Lady Health Workers to educate mothers to recognise the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. It must also prioritise routine immunisation (RI) coverage, which stands at a shameful 56% in Punjab, and less than 20% in Sindh and Balochistan.

Pakistan: Smoggy Beijing sees lung cancer cases soar,"Beijing, Nov. 13 -- The number of lung cancer cases in the Chinese capital Beijing has soared over the last decade./According to figures published by the state-run Xinhua news agency, they have increased by more than 50%./Beijing health officials say smoking is still the number one cause of lung cancer, but they admit air pollution is also a factor./The World Health Organization (WHO) recently estimated that polluted air kills millions of people every year./Pollution kills millions Xinhua said the latest figures - which are for only one city and one disease - were issued by Beijing municipal health bureau./They show the number of lung cancer patients per 100,000 people was 39.56 in 2002, but had jumped to 63.09 by 2011./The article gave no reason for the increase in patients./Beijing health officials said lung cancer was linked to lifestyle choices, with smoking still the top cause. But they said passive smoking and air pollution could also be a factor./Last month the WHO issued a scientific report detailing the link between air pollution and a number of different diseases and illness./It estimated that breathing in fine particles contributed to 3.2 million premature deaths a year across the world and killed more than 200,000 from lung cancer./""More than half of the lung cancer deaths attributable to ambient fine particles were projected to have been in China and other East Asian countries,"" said the WHO./Correspondents say Chinese people are becoming increasingly worried about the health problems caused by the thick air pollution that often blankets much of their country, a result of rapid economic expansion coupled with poorly enforced laws designed to protect the environment./Earlier this week it was reported that a eight-year-old girl in Jiangsu province had become the country's youngest lung cancer patient.

"Pakistan: Pneumonia kills nearly 92,000 children in Pakistan every year","ISLAMABAD, Nov. 13 -- Every 30 seconds, a child somewhere in the world, dies of pneumonia, making it number one global cause of childhood mortality. In Pakistan, an estimated seven million cases of pneumonia occur every year and out of these, as many as 92,000 children die before their fifth birthday due to the infection. At least 85 out of 1,000 children die under the age of five in Pakistan and it is alarming that most of these deaths are unfortunately due to vaccine preventable diseases including pneumonia./Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. It is caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi (germs). The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a child's nose or throat can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne drops from a cough or sneeze./Children whose immune systems are compromised are at higher risk of developing pneumonia. Infants and children below two years of age are at higher risk of contracting pneumonia as their immune systems are still developing, said Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry while talking to 'media' in connection with World Pneumonia Day being observed on November 12 (today). He said that World Pneumonia Day is observed to raise awareness of pneumonia as a public health issue and help prevent millions of avoidable deaths from the infection that occur each year. ""The theme of this year is: ""Innovation"" highlighting innovative solutions to end childhood pneumonia while at the same time emphasising that there are existing simple interventions that need to reach the most vulnerable children.""/Dr. Ashraf said that pneumonia is preventable and treatable with host of proven interventions, including exclusive breastfeeding infants in their first six months of life, ensuring an environment free of indoor air pollution and promoting frequent hand washing, immunising against leading causes, and ensuring access to medical care and antibiotics when cases do emerge. He said that appropriately treating underlying causes such as malnutrition, and exclusively breast-feeding children for the first six months of their life can decrease the risk of pneumonia./He believes that a child's immune system may be weakened by malnutrition or under nourishment, especially in infants who are not exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their life./He said that more than 50 per cent children under five years of age are malnourished in Pakistan. HIV infections and measles also increase child's risk of contracting pneumonia. Environmental factors such as indoor air pollution caused by cooking fires and heating with biomass fuels such as wood or dung, a coal, living in crowded homes and parental smoking also increase a child's susceptibility to pneumonia, he said./He pointed out that alarmingly Pakistan has the lowest breastfeeding rates in South Asia, 37 per cent. He added that ignoring early signs of pneumonia can be death sentence. The symptoms of pneumonia include: rapid or fast breathing, cough, fever, chills, loss of appetite, wheezing, lower chest wall in drawing; very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience convulsions, he explained./Talking of remedies, he said that limiting exposure to smoke from cigarettes or indoor cook stoves and fires can help limit the risk of pneumonia. ""Research has shown that hand washing with soap and water can reduce the number of pneumonia -related infections in children under the age of five by more than 50 percent."" Dr. Ashraf added that immunising against pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia. Parents should not be hesitant about taking their children to the nearest health facility for the administration of vaccines that are available free of cost./To a query, he said that by managing cases of pneumonia in children with antibiotics at community level, pneumonia-related child deaths can be reduced by 70 percent. Lady Health Workers can be trained to assess signs of pneumonia, determine appropriate treatment and guide parents, administer antibiotics and provide home care. They can also refer sick children to a health facility if complications arise, said Dr. Ashraf./He added that government should also utilize Lady Health Workers to educate mothers to recognize the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. It must also prioritise routine immunisation coverage. When children suffering from pneumonia can be treated promptly and effectively with antibiotics, their chances of survival increase significantly, he said./He, however, added that overuse of antibiotics should be prevented in order to curb microbial resistance and children with upper respiratory infections mainly cough and colds should not be prescribed unnecessary antibiotics. He suggested that indiscriminate use of cough medicines should be reduced./Pneumonia control and other child health interventions must be accelerated to meet Millennium Development Goal 4 that is reducing under-five mortality by two-thirds by 2015, concluded Dr. Ashraf/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

In the past, the IARC had measured the presence of individual chemicals and mixtures of chemicals in the air -- including diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals, and dust./The predominant sources of outdoor air pollution were transport, power/generation, emissions from factories and farms, and residential heating and/cooking, the agency said. ""Classifying outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans is an important step,"" said Wild./""There are effective ways to reduce air pollution and, given the scale/of the exposure affecting people worldwide, this report should send a strong signal to the international community to take action without further delay.""/The IARC said it had also conducted a separate evaluation of what is/known as ""particulate matter"", classifying it as a Group 1 cancer cause./Particulate matter includes both solid particles and liquid droplets/found in air such as soot which can penetrate deep into the respiratory system./Beyond cancer, known health effects include coughing or difficulty/breathing, chronic bronchitis, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease./In addition, such matter has environmental effects such as corrosion,/soiling, damage to vegetation and reduced visibility due to haze/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Don't ignore persistent coughs, check for signs of lung cancer","ISLAMABAD, Dec. 2 -- Lung cancer, like all cancers, arises when there is an unrestrained growth of lung cells due to mutations caused by various factors. It is the most common cancer in the world and is responsible for approximately 1.4 million deaths annually./There are two major types of lung cancer; small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) - it accounts for 15% of the disease and is usually caused by smoking and typically begins in the large airways of the lungs from where it can spread to the brain. The other is non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) which comprises 80% of the cases. It has three main types--adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. NSCLC arises from the epithelial cells lining the larger and smaller airways./The main causes of lung cancers include smoking (active and passive), radon gas, asbestos, familial predisposition, air pollution and lung diseases./The symptoms are a persistent cough or worsening of an existing chronic cough; Prolonged chest or shoulder pain; Unexplained weight loss and/or fatigue; Coughing up blood; Repeated chest infections and Breathing problems./A chest x-ray is the first diagnostic step taken to detect cancer, if a person shows symptoms of infection. CT imaging and bronchoscopy are used to gather more information about the extent or location of a tumour. Methods of treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy depending upon the stage and type of lung cancer and also the patient's overall heath condition./Cessation of smoking, reducing radon levels at home, limiting air pollution, eliminating passive smoking and avoiding carcinogens at work; these are some of the measures an individual and the public at large can take to prevent lung cancer/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: People indulged in outdoor activities may suffer from smog,"Islamabad, Dec. 23 -- The people who get indulged in massive outdoor activity in the winter season-from jogging to manual labour-may suffer smog-related health effects as haphazard construction of industries such as factories, mills and brick kilns has made it difficult to control smoke that finally suspends in the air and produces smog./There are around 200 kilns operating in the vicinity of the twin cities. Though these were initially located outside city limits, the mushroom growth of private housing societies in the last few years had brought them within the city confines./Fog is these days is generally observed in early morning and late night but most of the experts termed it smog as it is made up of a combination of air pollutants that can harm health, harm the environment, and cause property damage. Numerous people suffer during smoggy conditions, including children and the elderly. People with respiratory conditions may also begin to feel unwell, since smog is very hard on the airways./The mucus membranes of the eyes and nose can also become irritated by smog, leading to soreness and discomfort. In addition, smog is harmful to plants and animals. Persistent smog can damage crops and cause long term health problems for pets and farm animals./The experts were of the view that physical activity causes people to breathe faster and more deeply, exposing their lungs to pollutants. Three groups of people are particularly sensitive to smog including children, adults who are active outdoors and patients with respiratory problems./They said the people should avoid lighting bonfire when air pollution levels are high and never burn household waste, especially plastics and rubber as it increases smog level in the air/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Gas heaters can put your life at risk,"ISLAMABAD, Dec. 24 -- With the setting in of winter and chilly weather particularly at night, people in this region of the country have started using gas heaters to keep rooms warm that can be fatal even in case of a little negligence./Majority of people use gas heaters extensively to get warmth ignoring the fact how fatal it could prove without taking safety measures. Studies reveal that gas stoves, smoke hoods and heaters substantially increase indoor air pollution and health risks./Every year during winter season many families suffocate to death in Pakistan due to keeping the gas heaters on for the whole night during sleep. Gas heaters release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide directly into the room increasing the level of indoor pollutants, which can potentially harm your health including high incidence of respiratory diseases./Gas heaters also consume oxygen while burning, causing lower amount of oxygen in the room which is life threatening if the room is not properly ventilated. Poisoning can also result due to leakage of gas heaters accidentally in closed rooms./Some people are more susceptible than others to suffer health effects of the heating systems in rooms such as heart disease patients, asthmatics, pregnant ladies, children and elderly, said Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry while talking to 'media'./He added that Carbon monoxide is invisible, odourless, colourless and tasteless gas, so is difficult to detect. It is highly poisonous and deprives the body of oxygen. The individual is rendered completely helpless without warning and without feeling that he is being affected by the gas. Thus one may become unconscious during sleep and ultimately die, he said./Talking of the affects of burning, he said if the level of carbon monoxide in a room goes above the safe levels, people with heart disease may get chest pain or angina. Smokers with heart disease are particularly at risk. Young children, unborn babies and the elderly may also be affected./He added that exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Symptoms include tiredness, shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, nausea, muscle weakness, confusion etc. ""Exposure to extremely high levels of carbon monoxide can result in death."" To a query, he said that constant heat causes loss of moisture from the environment causing dryness and irritation of the skin. Warming your hands and feet by sitting very close to the heater is very harmful. This can give rise to various skin problems, he explained./""Do not let cold temperatures put you at a greater risk of a home heating accident, such as a fire or carbon monoxide poisoning,"" said Dr. Ashraf. He added that many deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning can be avoided if some simple safety measures are ensured./He suggested that the room needs to be well ventilated. Keep internal doors and at least one window open to allow fresh air to enter the room when gas heater is on. Check that room vents are not blocked. Never keep gas heaters on while going to bed. Ensure that gas supply is disconnected from the main supply line before going to bed. Even the 'pilot' should not be kept 'On'. If the gas leakage is suspected, it should be detected by gas smell or by sound of escaping gas and not by the application of naked lights./In case of gas leakage, he said one should open doors and windows immediately to ventilate the area and should turn off all consumer safety shut off valves and the meter shut off valves and report immediately to gas authorities. ""One should keep a vessel containing water near the heater to minimise the affects of burning,"" he said./He advised to minimise the length of time that gas heater is used. Avoid continuous use. Use it at intervals. Do not over heat the room. Also check that the heater has a safety system that shuts the heater off when there is not enough gas pressure.

Pakistan: Polluted air linked to autism risk,"LAHORE, Dec. 28 -- Pregnant women who live in smog-filled areas may be twice as likely to have children with autism, a new study suggests./""The study does not prove that pollution increases risk for autism. It found an association,"" cautioned lead author Andrea Roberts, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. ""It adds to the weight of the evidence that there may be something in air pollution that increases risk for autism."" Researchers compared exposure to air pollution among 325 women who had a child with autism and 22,000 women who did not./The women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study II. Pollutants measured included diesel particulate matter, lead, manganese, mercury, methylene chloride, and a combined measure of metal exposure./Twenty percent to 60 percent of the women lived in areas considered highly polluted. And the study showed that: those women who lived in the 20 percent of locations that had the highest levels of diesel particulates or mercury in the air were twice as likely to have a child with autism, compared to those who lived in the 20 percent of areas with the lowest levels of these pollutants. In addition, those who lived in the 20 percent of locations with the highest levels of lead, manganese, methylene chloride, and combined metal exposure were about 50 percent more likely to have a child with autism than those who lived in the 20 percent of areas with the lowest concentrations./The findings held even after the researchers took into account other factors known to affect autism risk, such as income, education and smoking during pregnancy. Overall, the association was stronger for boys than it was for girls, but the number of girls included in the new study was too low to draw any firm conclusions. The findings, which were published June 18 online in Environmental Health Perspectives, do add to a growing body of research that suggests the air women breathe while pregnant is one of many factors linked to autism risk./Previous studies have shown that pregnant women who live in polluted areas or close to freeways are more likely to have a child with autism, but the studies were done regionally. The new data is nationwide. Exactly how, or even if, air pollution affects the developing brain is murky. ""By definition, pollution is stuff that is not good for us,"" Roberts said./Still, the overall increase in autism risk that may be attributed to pollution is low. ""Let's say a woman's risk for having a child with autism is one in 100, women who live in the most polluted cities have a risk that is about one in 50, which means that 49 children would not have autism,"" Roberts said. ""Even if the risk is doubled, it's still low,"" she explained./The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now estimates that about one in 50 children aged 6 to 17 in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder, the name for a larger group of disorders that can range from the mild to the severe, and affect social and communication skills. Other experts also urged caution in interpreting the new findings./""There many genes, probably hundreds, and many environmental factors, probably hundreds, that increase risk of autism,"" said Alycia Halladay, senior director for environmental and clinical sciences at the advocacy group Autism Speaks./""The real message is that a lot of things cause autism, namely genetics and the environment and their interaction.""/Laura Anthony, the associate director of the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., said that these risks accrue during pregnancy, delivery and within the first month of a newborn's life./""Everything points to that as the critical period. This is the time when the brain is most sensitive because it is still developing,"" she said. The new findings don't mean that pregnant women should head for the hills to avoid smog, Anthony added./""Even if you live someplace rural, you may be exposed to pollution while driving or you could live in a rural place right next to a plant [or factory],"" she said. ""We all need to campaign for cleaner air for a lot of reasons.""/Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center in Lake Success, N.Y., said that the new findings do add weight to previous studies that looked at the connection between prenatal exposure to airborn pollutants and later autism./""While they do validate and affirm what other studies have found, there are many risk factors and genetic causes identified with autism,"" Adesman said./""Even with the strength of this study, parents can't presume that most cases of autism are due to airborne contaminants. It's easier said than done to suggest that she move or not breathe the air./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: India admits its coal plants causing fog inside Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 8 -- Every winter major parts Pakistan's Punjab get exposed to a thick blanket of fog mainly because of coal based power houses in India and trans-boundary pollution is inflicting millions of dollars loss to the country's environment and economy./This has been unveiled in a letter written by eminent climate expert Arshad H Abbasi, associated with SDPI, to Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif.""India has itself acknowledged in the international courts while defending the controversial hydropower project on Pakistan's rivers, arguing that the thermal electric power generation based on coal is not sustainable environmentally. India says: ""Our coal based thermal power plants are emitting ash, causing serious pollution and helping to forming fog in the Sub-Continent.""/""India further maintains in the international courts to justify the erection of hydropower projects on Pakistan's rivers that the ash generation was not only polluting the environment but also adding fuel to global warming,"" mentions the communication of Arshad Abbasi to the prime minister./When contacted, former DG Met Office Dr Qamaruz Zaman Chaudhry, who is currently associated with LEAD-Pakistan as Senior Adviser on Climate Change, confirmed that the carbon emissions from the coal based power houses in India is the main reason of fog in many areas of Pakistan's Punjab. He said two years back the Met Office had conducted a study on fog and reached the conclusion that coal based power plants in India's Punjab are contributing a lot in generating fog in eastern part of Pakistan's Punjab. ""We are witnessing extended fog in Pakistan and this phenomenon has started occurring in last 7-8 years.""/However, in the letter to the chief executive of the country, Arshad Abbasi highlighted startling disclosures, saying that in South Asia, the total coal consumption was 685 million tones out of which 98% was in India, with the majority of coal consumed in the power sector./The energy mix in India is heavily dependent on coal, and electricity generation on coal fuel is 71%, the highest in South Asia. Yet, the coal in India is of poor quality, with high ash content and low calorific value. He also quoted an interesting report by Centre for Study of Science & Technology, Bangalore that reveals that the Indian coal's quality is very poor having 35%-45% ash content, low heating value thus generation of one unit electricity emits one kilogram of Carbon Dioxide and almost annually, 200 million tons of ash is generated using coal in power sector./The Indian coal unlike the rest of the world has the highest arc contents, 25%-45%, with low heating value, thus to generate one unit electricity, coal power plants emit one kilogram of carbon dioxide. The emission of other more hazardous gasses, such as sulphur oxides, nitrogen, fly ash, and suspended particles are responsible for the greenhouse effect.Arshad Abbasi appreciated the PML-N government's efforts in making peace with India, admitting that this is necessary for the future prosperity of our two nations./However, this should not be at the expense of our citizens' health and environmental sustainability in the region. In fact, environmentalists in India are concerned about the negative environmental effects of coal. Citizens in Saarc nations are concerned about trans-boundary externalities of coal and call for an agreement similar to the Asean Agreement on Trans-boundary Haze Pollution model in South Asia./Arshad Abbasi also mentioned that while it is a common error to think of climate change as something in the future, every single day we are affected by poor decisions that are leading to terrible environmental degradation. As a thick blanket of fog envelopes Pakistan, a phenomenon that only seems to increase every year, it is integral to understand the reasons why this is happening and take urgent action to mitigate its effects./It is a mistake to think of haze creation and fog formation in Pakistan as a natural effect of falling temperatures and relative humidity. The distinct fog formation in Pakistan - the persistence, and the intensity - signals a deeper problem: air pollution. While automobile exhaust and burning of dried leaves contribute to this effect in smaller doses, the single biggest factor is the use of coal in thermal power plants for electricity generation./Flying ash and trace elements in atmosphere after coal is burned is a major environmental hazard and public health concern, causing respiratory ailments like asthma, impairing the immune system and even causing cancer. Moreover, power plants running on coal emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Absence of solid waste management system in capital astonishes legislators,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 26 -- Senate Sub-Committee of the Functional Committee on Human Rights on Friday expressed concern over the absence of proper solid waste management system in the capital city to dispose around 1,000 tons of solid waste produced per day in the city./The committee members suggested the relevant departments to consider proposals from private companies for the installation of such system. The committee was apprised about the present situation of environment degradation in the city./In her presentation, Environment Activist Cristina Afridi said steady degradation of environment in Islamabad has reached state of emergency. She pointed out illegal constructions on natural watercourse, hospital waste, industrial waste, and occupation of green belts, stone crushing and vehicle pollution as some of the major sources of environmental degradation./She said that hotels and huts in Margalla Hills are adding to noise and environment pollution and damaging the flora and fauna of the city. She also briefed the Committee members about the existing laws on environment protection but regretted that those responsible for the implementation of these laws are not aware of the gravity of the situation./Columnist and politician Ayaz Ameer gave a thought provoking talk on the hazards of plastic bags and inaction of the government to control the situation. He said that according to one estimate, our country produces 30-40 billion plastic bags per year. ""Wherever there is empty place, there are plastic bags. I can assure you that droughts can go away, even Taliban can go away but these bags would never go away."" He said that even the security issues of Pakistan can be solved by making it a disciplinary society.""/Ayaz demanded complete ban on plastic bags. He suggested incentives for general public for cleaning up the cities form plastic bags. ""These bags are destroying our fields, choking our drainage system and devastating or environment.""/President Islamabad Chambers of Commerce (ICC) Shaban Khalid briefed the precautions adopted by the industries to protect the environment. He said that concept of modern city is incomplete without industrial area and there are 30,000 to 40,000 people employed in the industrial area of I-9 and I-10 in Islamabad./He disclosed that in 2009, ICC proposed to shift the industrial area outside the city in I-17. The land was identified but later the land was utilised for other purposes. He said that illegal constructions, non-existence of proper transport system and vehicular pollution is also damaging the environment and need equal attention./In his presentation, Director General Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Asif Shuja Khan agreed to the issues faced by Islamabad and shared the steps taken by the agency to ensure environmental protection. He said that out of 365 days of the year (From July 2009 to June 2010), residents of Islamabad breathed healthy air in only 94 days. He stressed the need to allocate landfill site and install waste-to-energy plant in Islamabad for proper disposal of solid waste./Convener Sub-Committee of the functional committee on Human Rights, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed said a concrete solid waste disposal management plan should be introduced urgently to safeguard beauty of the federal capital./He said availability of clean drinking water is also prerequisite as it is basic need of every citizen and people are suffering through a number of diseases especially water-born diseases due to scarcity of this basic need./Senator Farhat Ullah Baber said a mass transit system is also imperative exclusively for the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to check air pollution increasing day by day causing negative effects of health of masses due to increasing number of private vehicles./The proposal has been given in response to the point raised by Director General Environment Protection Agency who informed the participants that almost 300,000 vehicles are running on the roads of the capital among which 90,000 enter into the city through Kashmir Highway./Senator Hadayat Ullah recommended that a strict regulation of cement factories is also need of the hour so that their production should be restricted according to the requirement of the country as export of cement on the cost of city beautification is not justified./Member National Assembly Asad Omer who attended the meeting on the special request said import duty of polyethylene should be increased, which result in high cost of production of these plastic bags and ultimately discourage use of these bags in daily life./He also recommended that to cope with the issue of 'kachi abadi' of the federal capital, a comprehensive study should be conducted besides a concrete plan for relocation of the inhabitants, as it is responsibility of the government to take care rights of every citizen./The meeting members were also informed that Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman is directed to constitute a team including member state and member environment, which shall put up a report that no activity of constructing of tunnel, crushing stones, encroachments or any other activity in the national park area and stop such activity at once if found any./On this occasion, a documentary prepared by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) screened a documentary highlighting the damage done to the environment of the capital city/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: India slips in green index, Delhi world's most polluted city","New Delhi, Feb. 1 -- It's no surprise that pollution is a perpetual problem in India. But it's definitely disheartening to hear that India has slipped 32 ranks in the global Environment Performance Index (EPI) 2014 to rank a lowly 155 and its capital Delhi has earned the dubious tag of being the world's most polluted city./A comparative study of 178 countries on nine environmental parameters released earlier this month by the US-based Yale University shows that one of the world's fastest growing economies is a disaster on the environmental front./What's worse, India's pollution levels could be playing havoc with the health of its citizens. ""A bottom performer on nearly every policy issue included in the 2014 EPI, with the exception of forests, fisheries and water resources, India's performance lags most notably in the protection of human health from environmental harm,"" said a statement issued by Yale./The study described India's air pollution as the worst in the world, tying with China in terms of the proportion of population exposed to average air pollution levels exceeding World Health Organisation (WHO) thresholds./A deeper look at the data gathered by a Nasa satellite showed that Delhi had the highest particulate matter 2.5 pollution levels followed by Beijing. Delhi, with 8.1 million registered vehicles, has repeatedly beaten the Chinese capital on particulate matter pollution./The high PM2.5 pollution caused by high vehicle density and industrial emissions is the reason for the dense smog that has been engulfing Delhi during the winter months in the last few years, with adverse health implications. And while Beijing's infamous smog has hogged headlines and prompted government action, even led to the announcement of rewards for cutting back on pollution, the dangers in Delhi have been largely ignored./According to a study by the Harvard International Review, every two in five persons in Delhi suffer from respiratory ailments. The Lancet's Global Health Burden 2013 report termed air pollution the sixth biggest human killer in India. The WHO last year termed air pollution carcinogenic./Particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5 in shorthand) are fine enough to lodge deep in human lung and blood tissue and cause diseases ranging from stroke to lung cancer, the Yale study said./Anumita Roy Chaudhary, executive director of Delhi-based advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment, said policy-makers have failed to take the kind of action needed to check phenomenal growth in air pollution in India. ""The gains of the introduction of CNG in 2000 have been lost. We are heading for dark days if policy-makers fail to wake up to the growing environmental health hazard,"" she said./The Central Pollution Control Board's report of 2011 said only two cities, Kochi and Coimbatore, met the national ambient air quality standards, which are six times higher than WHO standards.

Pakistan: Cancer cases on the rise in Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD, Feb. 7 -- The incidence of cancer is on the rise in Pakistan but the concerned government authorities have not been giving due attention to it. There has been no planning to cater to the treatment needs of an estimated 300,000 individuals who contract cancer every year./There is no population-based cancer registry for systematic reporting of cancer incidence in the country, therefore actual cancer statistics are not available. According to estimates, about 50,000 deaths are reported every year due to different cancers in Pakistan./The current healthcare facilities are unable to provide health care to over 60 per cent of the cancer patients leaving majority to wander in different corridors of hospitals and even a number of patients do not have access to the healthcare facilities for treatment of cancer, said Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Professor Dr Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry while talking to 'media' in connection with World Cancer Day./He added that there are number of reasons for the increase in number of patients with cancer, however the four main ones being a longer life expectancy, more accurate diagnosis, alarming prevalence of Hepatitis B and C and the rise in cigarette smoking./He said that at least, there should be facilities for palliative care in Pakistan, the treatment to relieve symptoms caused by cancer. Palliative care can help people live more comfortably. It is particularly required in places like Pakistan with a high proportion of patients with advanced stages where there is little chance of cure. Thus there is a need to establish new palliative care facilities, said Dr. Ashraf./Studies reveal that cancer affects everyone - the young and old, the rich and poor, men, women and children - and represents a tremendous burden on families and societies. Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. It can affect almost any part of the body. The growth often invades surrounding tissues and can metastasize to distant sites. Lung, stomach, liver, colon and breast cancer cause the most cancer deaths each year./""Aging is the fundamental factor for the development of cancer and the incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age,"" said Dr. Ashraf. He added that the life style and environmental factors the things we eat, drink, whether we smoke or exercise, how much sun we get and where we live have a powerful effect on cancer risk./To a query, he said that one possible promoter in food is fat, especially saturated fat from animal products like meat. Tobacco use, pan, 'chalia', alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, exposure to occupational for example asbestos carcinogens, radiation including ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, excessive X-Rays, low fruit and vegetable intake, excessive consumption of red and preserved meat, estrogens tablets, high fat diet, genetic factors, having unsafe sex, infections from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, Human Papiloma Viruses, Helicobacter pylori, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels are major risk factors for cancer, he said./Talking of the warning signs, he said there are seven warning signals including change in bowel or bladder habit, a sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, thickening or lump in breast or elsewhere, indigestion or difficulty in swallowing, obvious change in wart or mole and nagging cough or hoarseness./Dr. Ashraf said that this year the focus of the World Cancer Day was on Target 5 of the World Cancer Declaration: Dispel damaging myths and misconceptions about cancer./He said that four basic components of cancer control are prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, and palliative care. ""At least one-third to 40 per cent of all cancer cases are preventable, mainly by not using tobacco, using healthy diet rich in fresh, green vegetables and being physically active (30 minutes daily walk), avoiding alcohol, narcotics, and most importantly obesity and preventing infections that may cause cancer.""/He added that tobacco is the single largest preventable cause of cancer in the world today. It causes 80-90 per cent of all lung cancer deaths, and about 30 per cent of all cancer deaths in developing countries./To a query, Dr. Ashraf said dietary modification is another important approach to cancer control. Because there are many promoters and inhibitors in food, scientists believe that the food we eat is very important in the growth, or the prevention of cancer. Diets high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pistachios, peanuts, walnuts, soybean, tomatoes, beans, pulses and legumes and avoiding processed foods high in fat, salt and or sugar and sugary drinks, bakery items have a protective effect against many cancers, he said./Talking of prevention, he said regular physical activity and maintenance of healthy body weight, along with a healthy diet can considerably reduce cancer risk. Vaccination against human papiloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus vaccination (HBV) can prevent cervical and liver cancer respectively, said Dr. Ashraf./""If prevention fails, catch it early. Unfortunately in Pakistan, a large number of cancer patients are presented at an advanced stage due to lack of awareness,"" he said. He added that about one-third of the cancer burden can be decreased if cases are detected and treated early./He said that early diagnosis can save significant number of lives, however, illiteracy, lack of awareness, social taboos and lack of facilities are challenging. ""Education and screening to help people recognize early signs of cancer and seek prompt attention for symptoms, which might include lumps, sores, persistent indigestion, persistent coughing, and bleeding from body's orifices can help saving lives.""/He said that there is a need to enhance screening programmes in Pakistan such as mammography for early detection of breast cancer and cytology (Pap smear) for cervical cancer, colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy to detect colon cancer, chest X-Ray, CT scan or sputum cytology for lung cancer./""Never let fear prevent you from being properly screened for cancer,"" he said. In the scenario of limited resources for implementation of screening programmes in Pakistan, the only practical option for early detection is through mass education about the cancers and their risk factors, concluded Dr. Ashraf/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Tackling water, sanitation, energy nexus key to sustainable future: UN officials","UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 20 -- The water, sanitation and sustainable energy crises are the among the world's pre-eminent development challenges, senior United Nations officials have warned, and called for coherent integrated policies and innovative strategies to tackle these issues. ""Lack of access to water, sanitation and sustainable energy services is a compound magnifier of poverty, ill-health and mortality, and gender inequality,"" General Assembly President John Ashe said while opening the 193-member body's thematic debate on the issue. Tuesday's gathering is the first in the series of such debates and high-level events he will host this year to provide a platform for Member States and other stakeholders to set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda. /Ashe has made the effort to achieve a new post-2015 agenda to succeed the ant-poverty UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) the hallmark of his year-long Assembly presidency, which ends in September. The MDGs, agreed by world leaders at a UN summit in 2000, aim to slash extreme hunger and poverty, cut maternal and infant mortality, combat disease and provide access to universal education and health care, all by the end of 2015. But these targets will likely not be reached in many countries and areas, and they will be incorporated in an even more ambitious post-2015 agenda. ""Addressing this nexus of water, sanitation and sustainable energy is not just a matter of grave concern, it is a matter of moral imperative for the entire international community,"" said Ashe, explaining that the magnitude of the problem is great: 783 million people live without clean water; 2.5 billion have no adequate sanitation; and 1.4 billion people are without access to electricity. He said the international community is already in agreement that energy, water and sanitation are essential to the achievement of many development goals.""They are inextricably linked to climate change, agriculture, food security, health, gender and education, among others,"" said Ashe, adding:""So today, I ask you to consider how we can develop a more integrated approach to problem-solving so that we can best address this development nexus."" ""Let us not forget that we are working on behalf of countless millions who are currently consigned to eking out a living in the dark, who watch their infants die of dehydration, and who are mothers and wives, fathers and sons suffering the adverse effects of indoor air pollution that accrues from the use of inefficient energy services,"" he said. Tackling such 'complex and self-reinforcing problems' will require Member States to dig deep, to express your creativity, to share your experiences and to provide your guidance and inputs in collaborating to achieve these goals, and in creating a post-2015 world that allows every member of the global family to live in dignity, said Ashe. That call for diligent and creative action was echoed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene must feature prominently in the post-2015 development agenda. ""We must improve water quality and the management of water resources and wastewater. This is a matter of justice and opportunity."" With that in mind, he recalled the UN's launch in 2007 of the CEO Water Mandate to engage the international business community in water and sanitation. In a similar vein, the Organization launched a ""Call to Action on Sanitation"" last year to drive progress on sanitation and water goals towards the 2015 target date and beyond. ""Affordable and reliable modern energy services are essential for alleviating poverty, improving health and raising living standards,"" Mr. Ban continued, explaining that this is why he launched the Sustainable Energy for All initiative in 2011. The initiative has three goals: universal access by 2030; improve efficiency of energy and cut waste; and to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. ""We need clean efficient energy to combat climate change,"" he said, noting that with the global population now at 7 billion and rising,""by 2030 we will need 35 per cent more food, 40 per cent more water and 50 per cent more energy."" Climate change will also exacerbate water stress and scarcity in many regions. If the current global warming trend is allowed to continue, all the international community's efforts to provide universal and equitable access to water and energy will be undermined. As such, he intends to convene a climate summit on 23 September for global leaders from government, business, finance, and civil society.

Pakistan: PCS moot ends with identification of key action areas in health for progress,"ISLAMABAD, April 23 -- The 11th biennial congress of the Pakistan Chest Society (PCS) concluded here on Monday with several direly needed health interventions, which have conveniently been pushed to the backburner by the country's health authorities, being tabled for meaningful action./Controlling the rising incidence of tuberculosis as well as allergy and asthma, tabling a resolution against tobacco use and the hazards of active and passive smoking, and preventing the indiscriminate use of hormones and artificial additives in food were some of the key issues that were flagged at the conference, with action areas also being identified for progress./Dr. Shereen Khan, chairman of the scientific committee, expressed satisfaction over the outcome of the conference, which had leading national and international speakers from different subject areas./Professor Syed Muhammad Naeem Agha, outgoing president of PCS, said the main respiratory health problems being faced by Pakistanis include TB and Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB, environmental air pollution and pollution caused diseases, tobacco dependence, and both active and passive hazards of smoking, allergic diseases and asthma, and respiratory infections, among many other chest diseases. He was concerned to note that the prevalence of TB has increased in Pakistan, which has jumped from 8th to 4th rank in the list of high TB-burden countries. ""We are now behind many developing countries,"" he said. The causes and strategies for improvement of TB control were debated at length./Professor Agha also mentioned that a committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Dr. Javaid A Khan, chairman of the National Tobacco Alliance, to formulate recommendations and pass a resolution against tobacco usage and the hazards of active and passive smoking in Pakistan, for presentation to the National Assembly and Senate. The controversial issue of e-cigarettes was also hotly debated, and the need for a consensus statement on this was highlighted./Professor Agha noted the well-researched findings of Dr. Osman Yusuf on the hazards caused by indiscriminate use of hormones in poultry feed, cattle and milk cows breeding, and various foodstuffs which are responsible for increase in hormonal disorders. These hormonal disorders also reflect adversely on the respiratory health of the population and are aggravating factors for asthma and allergic diseases. The PCS will be formulating recommendations to control the indiscriminate use of hormones and artificial additives in food, as well as the dangers of pollution and pollution-induced diseases./Professor Kamran Chima, incoming president of PCS, was concerned to note that the prevalence of TB has risen to 276 cases per 100,000 population, and sleep apnea has increased to 5,000 cases per 100,000 population. He emphasised the need for an aggressive campaign against Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB./Professor Chima also highlighted the need to find proper centres abroad where patients could be sent for lung transplant, as advised by Dr. Imran Nizami from Saudi Arabia. He commended the efforts of Professor Dr Liaqat Ali Chaudhry from Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City, Riyadh, who has agreed to help the labour workforce from Pakistan, which is denied work visas in Saudi Arabia on the basis of ""spots"" in their lungs. Professor Liaqat promised that he would try to affect a change in Saudi Arabian guidelines so that healed TB shadows on X-rays are not seen as active TB. This will improve job prospects of several thousand Pakistani workers who are denied work visas on this very basis./In an interview, Dr. Osman Yusuf, advisor to WHO's Chronic Respiratory Diseases Global Programme, said This is the first time that allergy has been included in the active programme of such an important conference. He said almost 15 million children in Pakistan suffer from asthma, and twice as many from allergy. ""Only a third of the asthmatic children are diagnosed as asthmatic, and despite being diagnosed, an even smaller fraction is treated properly. The prevalence of asthma in adults is close to 10% but proper studies are lacking,"" he added./Dr Naghman Bashir, finance secretary of PCS, who conducted an effective programme on smoking cessation, emphasised the need for physicians to be sympathetic rather than authoritative towards smokers. ""The causes that trigger the initiation of smoking should he investigated, and maximum support should be given to the patient by his family, friends and physicians to help him quit the habit,"" he added./The outgoing general secretary of PCS, Professor Sohail Mushtaq, thanked the organisers, speakers, resource persons, participants and sponsors for contributing to the success of the conference/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Earth Day observed amid rising pollution,"LAHORE, April 24 -- The Environment Protection Department (EPD), Punjab, observed Earth Day here Tuesday as all kinds of pollution, especially air and water, remained on rise throughout the province, causing serious problems for the citizens and environment./The department's policy makers remained busy making presentations and policy papers for higher authorities to tackle the grave concerns, instead of taking concrete steps on the ground leaving citizens at the mercy of environmental hazards. The lack of enforcement of environmental laws and rules to discourage to polluters has made the EPD a real toothless tiger, which today proposed establishment of ""Green Force"" to enforce environmental laws in the province./During the past several years, no practical move was launched to shift light and heavy industrial units established in various residential city localities i.e. Misri Shah, Baghbanpura, Moghalpura, Daroghewala, Bhagat Pura, Chah Miran, Shadbagh and others along the Bund Road and GT Road. All the industries in the area are adding pollution to the environment./According to a recent survey, over 4000 industrial units have been operating in residential areas causing serious environmental hazards and threat to human life. Besides the residential areas, a good number of industrial and commercial ventures are operating around historical monuments i.e. Shalimar Garden, Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque. A good number of industrial units of manufacturing spurious motor oil were established in Badami Bagh while the Rim Market along the historical Lahore Fort is still a serious threat to the biggest archaeological site of the city./The point of concern is that a majority of the industries, especially those related with steel, are using used tyres and sub standard rubber products to keep their machines alive and releases pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur oxides and toxic metals, considered a major source of air pollution in the provincial capital. Small drives were launched against violators in the past./The problem of urban congestion in the provincial metropolis severely affected air and water quality while insufficient waste management skills of the City District Government Lahore (CDGL) added the already deteriorating atmospheric conditions. Though the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) is doing a good jab, there is a lot more to do, said environmental experts./High concentrations of pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides and sulphur in the air is seriously affecting the health of general public and ironically EPD's air monitoring vehicles and stations are out of order. Short-term and limited campaigns against smoke emitting vehicles and two stroke motorcycle rickshaws failed to improve the air quality. The department has no vision to reduce vehicular pollution from the provincial capital./Another issue of air quality in the city was the excessive presence of Suspended Particulate Matter (PM10) in the ambient air, environmental experts said, adding that major sources of the PM(10) in the city are unplanned industrial clusters, open burning of solid waste, brick kilns and natural dust. Experts claimed average PM10 concentration in Lahore exceeded three times the Japanese standard (200 ug/m3) and eight times the WHO guidelines (120 ug/m3). Unpaved roads and absence of green belts are the originators of Particulate Matter (PM10). Likewise, the Kot Lakhpat Industrial Area is also surrounded by residential colonies and residents of these localities are daily facing the air and other kinds of pollution of the industries. Another serious threat facing the nearby residents is the discharge of polluted water by the industries in local drains./Brandreth Road has become the hub of mechanical spare parts while the inner localities like Rehman Gallian, Landa Bazaar, Prem Gallian and Adda Crown have changed into the manufacturing areas of these spare parts. People have installed high temperature furnaces, steel rubbing and polishing and other related cottage industries in their homes. No serious drive was launched to curb the trend./Gulshan-e-Ravi, a purely residential locality, is also rapidly changing into a cottage industry zone. A large number of machinery-manufacturing units were established in various blocks of this locality, especially those close to the Bund Road. Motor workshops and heavy body vehicle manufacturing is another rapidly increasing industry in this locality. These industries are still working and no legal action has been taken for shifting them outside the city./Anwar Rasheed, Provincial Secretary EPD, while talking with media, said a consultative workshop was organized today in which all stake holders participated and proposed various suggestions to the proposed amendments to environmental laws.

Pakistan: Asthma be dealt appropriatley: Health experts,"ISLAMABAD, May 10 -- Health experts on Friday said that appropriate management of asthma can enable people to enjoy a good quality of life. According to them, the strongest risk factors for developing asthma are inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways. They said medication can control asthma while avoiding asthma triggers can also reduce the severity of asthma. /Asthma is one of the major noncommunicable chronic disease of the air passages of the lungs which inflames and narrows them, they added. They said that there is a need for primary prevention to reduce the level of exposure to common risk factors, particularly tobacco smoke, frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood, and air pollution. They said it is also important for improving access to cost-effective interventions including medicines, upgrading standards and accessibility of care at different levels of the health care system. A public health expert Dr Sobia Faisal said that asthma is a major noncommunicable disease characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to person. She said that symptoms may occur several times in a day or week in affected individuals, and for some people become worse during physical activity or at night. During an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial tubes swell, causing the airways to narrow and reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs. She added recurrent asthma symptoms frequently cause sleeplessness, daytime fatigue, reduced activity levels and school and work absenteeism. She said asthma has a relatively low fatality rate compared to other chronic diseases. She said asthma is a public health problem not just for high-income countries but it occurs in all countries regardless of the level of development. She urged to surveillance to map the magnitude of asthma, analyse its determinants and monitor trends, with emphasis on poor and disadvantaged populations. Dr Wasim Khawaja from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said that the strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways. He said that the fundamental causes of asthma are not completely understood but there are some risk factors for indoor allergens including house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander. He added outdoor allergens factors include tobacco smoke, chemical irritants in the workplace and air pollution. Other triggers can include cold air, extreme emotional arousal such as anger or fear, and physical exercise. Dr Wasim Khawaja said that even certain medications can trigger asthma which are used to treat high blood pressure, heart conditions and migraine. He said short-term medications are used to relieve symptoms, adding, people with persistent symptoms must take long-term medication daily to control the underlying inflammation and prevent symptoms and exacerbations. He, however, said that medication is not the only way to control asthma. ""It is important to avoid asthma triggers that irritate and inflame the airways. With medical support, each asthma patient must learn what triggers he or she should avoid,"" Dr Khawaja said/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: India's capital is the most dirty city of the world,"New Delhi, May 11 -- An effort by the World Health Organisation to measure pollution in cities around the world has found New Delhi admits to having the dirtiest air, while Beijing's measurements, like its skies, are far from clear./The study of 1,600 cities found air pollution had worsened since a smaller survey in 2011, especially in poorer countries, putting city-dwellers at higher risk of cancer, stroke and heart disease./Air pollution killed about seven million people in 2012, making it the world's single biggest environmental health risk, the WHO, a United Nations agency, said last month./Thirteen of the dirtiest 20 cities were Indian, with New Delhi, Patna, Gwalior and Raipur in the top four spots. New Delhi had an annual average of 153 micrograms of small particulates, known as PM2.5, per cubic metre./Beijing, notorious for the smog that has prompted some Anglophone residents to dub it ""Greyjing"", was in 77th place with a PM2.5 reading of 56, little over one-third of Delhi's pollution level./WHO experts said the Chinese data was from 2010, the most recent year made available to them by China. But Beijing's city government began publishing hourly PM2.5 data in January 2012./A year after it started publishing data, Beijing's air quality hit the ""worst on record"" according to Greenpeace, with a PM2.5 reading as high as 900 on one occasion./Beijing's government said last month that PM2.5 concentrations stood at a daily average of 89.5 micrograms per cubic metre in 2013, 156 percent higher than national standards. Such a reading would put Beijing 17th in the WHO database. The WHO says there is no safe level for PM2.5 pollution./At the cleaner end of the table, 32 cities reported a PM2.5 reading of less than 5. Three-quarters of those were Canadian, including Vancouver, one was Hafnarfjordur in Iceland and the other seven were American./WHO experts insisted the survey was not intended to name and shame the dirtiest cities, since the cities involved were volunteering the information to try to help themselves clean up./Maria Neira, WHO Director for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health, said the aim was to ""challenge"" cities and thought the survey would help them to become more open about their dirty air, which is often caused by burning coal, smokestack industries and heavy traffic./She rejected any suggestion that China might be cheating and said it was becoming much more sophisticated about collecting air pollution data, with a new push to clean up the big cities./""We are very much discussing with China putting on the table the issue of air pollution. Our director general (Margaret Chan) was recently there and she declared that China was one of the countries with major problems with air pollution. We will continue discussions on that to make sure that relevant measures are in place to reduce air pollution.""/HT had in January reported India had slipped 32 ranks in the global Environment Performance Index (EPI) 2014 to rank a lowly 155 and its capital Delhi had earned the dubious tag of being the world's most polluted city./A comparative study of 178 countries on nine environmental parameters released earlier this month by the US-based Yale University showed that one of the world's fastest growing economies was a disaster on the environmental front./What was worse, India's pollution levels were believed to be playing havoc with the health of its citizens.

"Pakistan: Water, air and soil pollution causes 40 percent of deaths worldwide","ISLAMABAD, May 17 -- About 40 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by water, air and soil pollution, concludes a Cornell researcher. Such environmental degradation, coupled with the growth in world population, are major causes behind the rapid increase in human diseases, which the World Health Organization has recently reported. Both factors contribute to the malnourishment and disease susceptibility of 3.7 billion people, he says, The telegraph reported. /David Pimentel, Cornell professor of ecology and agricultural sciences, and a team of Cornell graduate students examined data from more than 120 published papers on the effects of population growth, malnutrition and various kinds of environmental degradation on human diseases. ""We have serious environmental resource problems of water, land and energy, and these are now coming to bear on food production, malnutrition and the incidence of diseases,"" said Pimentel. Of the world population of about 6.5 billion, 57 percent is malnourished, compared with 20 percent of a world population of 2.5 billion in 1950, said Pimentel. Malnutrition is not only the direct cause of 6 million children deaths each year but also makes millions of people much more susceptible to such killers as acute respiratory infections, malaria and a host of other life-threatening diseases, according to the research. Nearly half the world's people are crowded into urban areas, often without adequate sanitation, and are exposed to epidemics of such diseases as measles and flu. With 1.2 billion people lacking clean water, waterborne infections account for 80 percent of all infectious diseases. Increased water pollution creates breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes, killing 1.2 million to 2.7 million people a year, and air pollution kills about 3 million people a year. Unsanitary living conditions account for more than 5 million death each year, of which more than half are children/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Pollution link to irregular heartbeat and lung clotting,"ISLAMABAD, June 6 -- Air pollution is linked to increased risk of developing an irregular heartbeat and blood clots in the lung, research suggests. The impact of air pollution on the risk of heart attack and stroke is less clear, say UK experts. Analysis of data from England and Wales shows air pollution is particularly harmful in the elderly, BBC reported. /A team at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine analysed data collected in England and Wales between 2003 and 2009 on links between cardiovascular problems and short-term air pollution. They found short-term air pollution was linked to arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) and blood clots in the lung. The strongest link was in the over-75s and in women, lead researcher Dr Ai Milojevic said. ""Our main message is that we didn't have clear evidence for air pollution impact on stroke or heart attack, which ultimately represent general blood clotting processes,"" she said. ""This research adds weight to what we already know, but goes further to suggest a link between air pollution and an increased risk of blood clots in the lungs and heart rhythm atrial fibrillation,"" said Julie Ward, senior cardiac nurse. ""But, as with many studies, we do need to look at the bigger picture and, although this is a large comprehensive study, it did have its limitations. ""We do, therefore, recognise that further research into exactly how air pollution particles affect the cardiovascular system needs to be carried out."" Seven million people died as a result of air pollution in 2012, according to World Health Organization estimates.

"Pakistan: Air pollution linked to irregular heartbeat, lung blood clots","ISLAMABAD, June 8 -- New research published in the journal Heart cites evidence that air pollution is linked to irregular heartbeat and lung blood clots, while also suggesting an effect on other cardiovascular diseases. High levels of certain air pollutants can cause such cardiovascular concerns, but exactly how this association works has not been clarified. /Researchers set out to explore this idea using data from three national collections in England and Wales from 2003 to 2009: the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), which tracks hospital admissions for heart attack/stroke; hospital episode statistics (HES) on emergency admissions; and figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) on recorded deaths, Radio Pakistan reported. According to MINAP data, there were 400,000 heart attacks during this time period, 2 million emergency admissions for cardiovascular problems, and 600,000 heart attack and stroke deaths were related to average levels of air pollutants over a 5-day period. Air pollutants investigated included carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur dioxide and ozone. The study showed that PM2.5 is clearly linked to a heightened risk of irregular heart rhythms, irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) and blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). And only nitrogen dioxide was linked to more hospitalizations for cardiovascular problems, including heart failure, and an increased risk of a particular type of heart attack referred to as non-ST elevation/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Drink broccoli sprout to lower air pollution risks,"ISLAMABAD, June 18 -- A novel way of curbing health risks associated with air pollution could be consuming a broccoli sprout beverage. Researchers have found that daily consumption of half a cup of broccoli sprout beverage produced rapid, significant and sustained higher levels of excretion of benzene - a known human carcinogen - and acrolein, a lung irritant,the study appeared in the journal Cancer Prevention Research. Broccoli sprouts are a source of glucoraphanin - a compound that generates sulforaphane when the plant is chewed or the beverage drank. It acts to increase enzymes that enhance the body's capacity to expunge these types of pollutants. ""Air pollution is a complex and pervasive public health problem,"" said John Groopman, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US. ""This study supports the development of food-based strategies as part of this overall prevention effort,"" Groopman added. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, of which broccoli is one, have been found to reduce risk of chronic degenerative diseases including cancer. For the study, researchers conducted a 12-week trial that included 291 participants who live in Jiangsu province in China.

"Pakistan: Industrial Area at I-9, I-10 causing health hazards to residents","ISLAMABAD, June 29 -- The Industrial Area at sectors I-9 and I-10 is causing health hazards to the residents of the surrounding residential areas who have become prey to a number of respiratory diseases. The residents frequently complained about diseases like chest congestion and asthma, which are directly linked to air pollution. The Steel and Marble industry is a big source of pollution as it uses low -quality scrap as a raw material which releases a huge number of harmful particles into the air. /Kamran Hanif, a resident of I-9 sector, said it was becoming difficult day by day to live in such environmental conditions as the residents were frequently being affected by different types of diseases. It is pertinent to mention that the elimination of the buffer zone between the industrial and residential areas in sectors I-9 and I-10 has also increased the risk of health hazards for the residents. The Islamabad's master plan was prepared by a Greek firm - Doxiadis Associates - in 1960, the Industrial Area (sectors I-9 and I-10) was isolated from residential areas through a buffer zone.

Pakistan: What is asthma?,"ISLAMABAD, July 7 -- Asthma is a complex clinical syndrome of chronic airway inflammation characterized by recurrent, reversible, airway obstruction. Airway inflammation also leads to airway hyperreactivity, which causes airways to narrow in response to various stimuli./Asthma is a common chronic condition, affecting approximately 8% to 10% of Americans, or an estimated 23 million Americans as of 2008. Asthma remains a leading cause of missed work days. It is responsible for 1.5 million emergency department visits annually and up to 500,000 hospitalizations. Over 3,300 Americans die annually from asthma. Furthermore, as is the case with other allergic conditions, such as eczema (atopic dermatitis), hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and food allergies, the prevalence of asthma appears to be on the rise./What causes asthma?/Asthma results from complex interactions between an individual's inherited genetic make-up and their interactions with the environment. The factors that cause a genetically predisposed individual to become asthmatic are poorly understood. The following are risk factors for asthma:/* Family history of allergic conditions/* Personal history of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)/* Viral respiratory illness, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), during childhood/* Exposure to cigarette smoke/* Obesity/* Lower socioeconomic status/What are the signs and symptoms of asthma?/The classic signs and symptoms of asthma are shortness of breath, cough (often worse at night), and wheezing (high-pitched whistling sound produced by turbulent airflow through narrow airways, typically with exhalation). Many patients also report chest tightness. It is important to note that these symptoms are episodic, and individuals with asthma can go long periods of time without any symptoms./Common triggers for asthmatic symptoms include exposure to allergens (pets, dust mites, cockroach, molds, and pollens), exercise, and viral infections. Tobacco use or exposure to secondhand smoke complicates asthma management./Many of the symptoms of asthma are nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions as well. Symptoms that might suggest conditions other than asthma include new symptom onset in older age, the presence of associated symptoms (such as chest discomfort, lightheadedness, palpitations, and fatigue), and lack of response to appropriate medications for asthma./The physical exam in asthma is often completely normal. Occasionally, wheezing is present. In an asthma exacerbation, the respiratory rate increases, the heart rate increases, and the work of respiration increases. Individuals often require accessory muscles to breathe, and breath sounds can be diminished. It is important to note that the blood oxygen level typically remains fairly normal even in the midst of a significant asthma exacerbation. Low blood oxygen level is therefore concerning for impending respiratory failure./How is asthma diagnosed?/The diagnosis of asthma begins with a detailed history and physical examination. A typical history is an individual with a family history of allergic conditions or a personal history of allergic rhinitis who experiences coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, especially with exercise or during the night. There may also be a propensity towards bronchitis or respiratory infections. In addition to a typical history, improvement with a trial of appropriate medications is very suggestive of asthma./In addition to the history and exam, the following are diagnostic procedures that can be used to help with the diagnosis of asthma:/* Lung function testing with spirometry: This test measures lung function as the patient breathes into a tube. If lung function improves significantly following the administration of a bronchodilator, such as albuterol, this essentially confirms the diagnosis of asthma. It is important to note, however, that normal lung function testing does not rule out the possibility of asthma./* Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO): This can be performed by a quick and relatively simple breathing maneuver, similar to spirometry. Elevated levels of exhaled nitric oxide are suggestive of ""allergic"" inflammation seen in conditions such as asthma./* Skin testing for common aeroallergens: The presence of sensitivities to environmental allergies increases the likelihood of asthma. Of note, skin testing is generally more useful than blood work (in vitro testing) for environmental allergies. Testing for food allergies is not indicated in the diagnosis of asthma./* Other potential but less commonly used tests include provocation testing such as a methacholine challenge, which tests for airway hyperresponsiveness. Hyperresponsiveness is the tendency of the breathing tubes to constrict or narrow in response to irritants. A negative methacholine challenge makes asthma much less likely. Specialists sometimes also measure sputum eosinophils, another marker for ""allergic"" inflammation seen in asthma. Chest imaging may show hyperinflation, but is often normal in asthma. Tests to rule out other conditions, such as cardiac testing, may also be indicated in certain cases./What is the treatment for asthma?/As per widely used guidelines, the treatment goals for asthma are to:/* adequately control symptoms,/* minimize the risk of future exacerbations,/* maintain normal lung function,/* maintain normal activity levels, and/* use the least amount of medication possible with the least amount of potential side effects./Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the chronic treatment of asthma and are first-line therapy per most asthma guidelines. It is well recognized that ICS are very effective in decreasing the risk of asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, the combination of a long-acting bronchodilator (LABA) and an ICS has a significant additional beneficial effect on improving asthma control./The most commonly used asthma medications include:/* Short-acting bronchodilators (albuterol [Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, Maxair, Xopenex]) provide quick relief and can be used in conjunction for exercise-induced symptoms./* Inhaled steroids (budesonide, fluticasone, beclomethasone, mometasone, ciclesonide) are first-line anti-inflammatory therapy./* Long-acting bronchodilators (salmeterol, formoterol) can be added to ICS as additive therapy. LABAs should never be used alone for the treatment of asthma./* Leukotriene modifiers (montelukast, zarirlukast) can also serve as anti-inflammatory agents./* Anticholinergic agents (ipratropium, tiotropium) can help decrease sputum production./* Anti-IgE treatment (omalizumab) can be used in allergic asthma./* Chromones (cromolyn, nedocromil) stabilize mast cells (allergic cells) but are rarely used in clinical practice./* Theophylline also helps with bronchodilation (opening the airways), but again is rarely used in clinical practice due to an unfavorable side effect profile./* Systemic steroids (prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisone, dexamethasone) are potent anti-inflammatory agents that are routinely used to treat asthma exacerbations but pose numerous unwanted side effects if used repeatedly or chronically./* Numerous other monoclonal antibodies are currently being studied but none are currently commercially available for routine asthma therapy./There is often concern about potential long-term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Numerous studies have repeatedly shown that even long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has very few if any sustained, clinically-significant side effects, including changes in bone health, growth, or weight. However, the goal always remains to treat all individuals with the least amount of medication that is effective. Patients with asthma should be routinely reassessed for any appropriate changes to their medical regimen./Asthma medications can be administered via inhalers either with or without an AeroChamber or nebulized solution. It is important to note that if an individual has proper technique with an inhaler, the amount of medication deposited in the lungs is no different than that when using a nebulized solution. When prescribing asthma medications, it is essential to provide the appropriate teaching on proper delivery technique./Smoking cessation and/or minimizing exposure to secondhand smoke are critical when treating asthma. Treating concurrent conditions such as allergic rhinitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may also improve asthma control. Vaccinations such as the annual influenza vaccination are also indicated./Although the vast majority of individuals with asthma are treated as outpatients, treatment of severe exacerbations can require management in the emergency department or inpatient hospitalization. These individuals typically require use of supplemental oxygen, early administration of systemic steroids, and frequent or even continuous administration of bronchodilators via a nebulized solution. Individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes are referred to a specialist (pulmonologist or allergist). The following factors should prompt consideration or referral:/* History of ICU admission or multiple hospitalizations for asthma/* History of multiple visits to the emergency department for asthma/* History of frequent use of systemic steroids for asthma/* Ongoing symptoms despite the use of appropriate medications/* Significant allergies contributing to poorly-controlled asthma/What is an asthma action plan?/Patient education is a critical component in the successful management of asthma. An asthma action plan provides an individual with specific directions for daily management of their asthma and for adjusting medications in response to increasing symptoms or decreasing lung function, as usually measured by a peak flow meter./What is the prognosis for asthma?/The prognosis for asthma is generally favorable. Children experience complete remission more often than adults. Although adults with asthma experience a greater rate of loss in their lung function as compared to age-controlled counterparts, this decline is usually not as severe as seen in other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or emphysema. Asthma in the absence of other comorbidities does not appear to shorten life expectancy. Risk factors for poor prognosis from asthma include:/* History of hospitalizations, especially ICU admissions or intubation/* Frequent reliance on systemic steroids/* Significant medical comorbidities/Can asthma be prevented?/With the increasing prevalence of asthma, numerous studies have looked for risk factors and ways to potentially prevent asthma. It has been shown that individuals living on farms are protected against wheezing, asthma, and even environmental allergies. The role of air pollution has been questioned in both the increased incidence of asthma and in regards to asthma exacerbations./Climate change is also being studied as a factor in the increased incidence of asthma. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a risk factor for asthma and poor outcomes. Tobacco smoke is also a significant risk factor for the development and progression of asthma.

Pakistan: Inaction makes air pollution stay in I sectors,"ISLAMABAD, July 9 -- Residents of I sectors of the federal capital have long been suffering industrial air pollution./Now, Pakistan's chief environmentalist has promised action against the polluters after seeing the enormity of the problem during an early morning drive through the area on Sunday./""I was simply shocked,"" said Dr M. Khurshid, Director General Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (EPA) about the grey smoke that greeted him on the drive that steel factories in the area start belching out around 5am every day./Dr Khurshid plans to serve notices on the owners of the steel mills ""immediately""./Citizens skeptical of latest plan of action against polluters/But the residents of the area are skeptical about government translating its plans into action. Inaction has been the hallmark of all such plans in the past, according to the residents./A senior official of the Climate Change Division of the federal government confirmed the citizens' skepticism./""EPA had forced the steel mill owners to install air filter bags but the agency failed to follow it up and monitor the levels of emissions from the mills and ensure that the filters were working properly,"" the official confided to media./He explained how Environment Protection Agency never checked if the owners of the steel mills operated the filters that were supposed to absorb noxious content from burning and melting of scrap to produce steel./The smell around the mills is so toxic that it forces drivers to roll up windows of their vehicles while driving past and pedestrians and cyclists cover their faces instinctively./The official explained how all steel mills used low-grade bundled scrap to produce steel./""The low-grade bundled scrap is more often than not contaminated with oil and grease and even paint. And the reason we see thick black smoke is because the mill owners do not operate filters because operational costs run as high as the cost of one melting process of scrap that lasts three to four hours roughly,"" the official explained./""The Supreme Court ordered the shutdown of two steel mills in 2007 and then another two four years later for violating the environmental laws.""/Retired government officer Abdul Haq takes an early walk every day and has been doing so for many years./He wears a wet handkerchief across his face like a bandana./""I can't help it. The smell is just too strong sometimes. The mills operate non-stop round the week. Our children breathe the same contaminated air,"" said Mr Haq, who lives across the greenbelt from one of the steel mills./The residents in the neighbourhood complained that the smoke was so thick in the early morning that it seemed to be choking the whole Islamabad./""It is easy to conclude that the city managers lack resolve to deal with this problem,"" said a shopkeeper in the I-10 Markaz./And the working conditions in these steel mills are so bad that they sap the life out of the work force./""If the smoke is so dangerous for the residents in the area what about the workers in the mills? We deal with it everyday,"" said Abdul Razaq, who has been working in a steel mill at I-9 for three years without proper gear./""Working in a steel mill is hot and hard,"" said Mohammad Ramzan./As serious as the problem of air pollution from these mills is, there are no quick fixes, said the EPA director general./""With the environment tribunal non-functional, there is little EPA can do except serving notices on the owners./""However, we intend to come down hard on the violators of the environmental laws. It is imperative that the media highlights the problem and creates awareness about how steel mills in the sectors are contaminating the air,"" said Dr M. Khurshid, arguing that it was about time the government relocated the mills far away from the residential sectors./The air pollution caused by the mills is intolerable. It is affecting the quality of air in Rawalpindi and Islamabad alike,"" said Dr Khurshid./When two steel mills were approached, the security and even some labourers became hostile. ""Photography is not permitted. The owners of the steel mills do not approve it.

Pakistan: Karachi: the City of Smog!,"KARACHI, July 22 -- Karachi was once the City of Lights, but perpetual electricity outages have plunged us into darkness. As if that wasn't enough, traffic-related air pollution has turned the metropolis into the City of Smog./Traffic fumes are known to cause a variety of daunting illnesses, some of them chronic in nature./Some cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly known as COPD, are also caused by fumes and air pollution./People afflicted with COPD can't breathe properly, especially when they are actively engaged in some work./Constant coughing with phlegm and recurrent chest infections are quite common in COPD patients./There's no other way to deal with the pressing issue apart from banning all vehicles emitting dangerous fumes from plying the roads of the city with immediate effect./Moreover, instead of bothering random drivers, the traffic policemen should concentrate on stopping all those people whose vehicles are found to be emitting fumes that even an ordinary citizen would know to be dangerous./Besides our drivers, the industries should also be monitored for air pollution. Their owners should be penalised for causing pollution that exceeds the allowed limits./Where the industries and vehicles have made our lives easier, they are also causing us to die sooner/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: CDA chairman being made to look through wrong pair of glasses,"ISLAMABAD, July 22 -- All of a sudden, the CDA chairman seems to have 'zeroed in' on the infrastructure development in sectors D-12 and D-13. Funds are being released for construction and repair of roads, laying and repairing of sewerage pipelines. Water supply issues are being tackled on priority./All this sounds so good really! The chairman is caring for those living in bad conditions in 'D' sectors./But somehow he has forgotten those living in sectors I-9 and I-10. We will not talk about the development of Sector I-11 because there our Afghan brethren, the refugees from the 'Afghan war against the then Soviet Union,' are still living. Even if it has become a mini Helmand of Islamabad./Those living in these two sectors of Islamabad, I-9 and I-10, have been leading a tough life for over 35 years now. With the passage of time, the problems have not only increased but aggravated too./The things started turning bad when the late military dictator, General Zia-ul-Haq, approved the proposal to turn the 'cottage industry plots' in sectors I-9/2, I-9/3 and I-10/3 into 'industrial plots'./This particular issue took turn for the worse when the steel furnaces and steel re-rolling mills were granted permission to operate. The smog and the solid waste particles emitting from these steel re-rolling mills and furnaces turned these sectors into the most polluted parts of the federal capital./These iron factories were operating without any environmental protection rules. Then in 1991, the then chairman, Fariduddin Ahmed, Member (Planning) Sabir Pervez Chohan and DG (Environment) Rashid Randhawa responded to the hue and cry raised by the public./A 'public hearing' was arranged, which held quite a few sessions with the doctors from the National Institute of Health, the NGOs and the public representatives from the area participated./And the owners of these iron factories were directed to install proper filters and raise chimneys to the recommended levels to minimise environmental pollution./Some factories complied for a few days and then things returned to as those were in the past. Installing filters and raising chimneys was too expensive a business to invest money on. And all these iron factories continued to defy the directions and are still defying the environment protection laws, under which they should be operating./People living in residential parts of sectors I-9 and I-10 are continuing to suffer from lung and other air pollution related diseases because of the outrageous and most hazardous emissions from these iron factories operating in their neighbourhood. But that seems okay. Human lives are cheaper than the iron being rolled out of these factories./The Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) is in a deep, blissful slumber in the adjacent Sector H-8./The CDA chairman, seemingly, has been made to cast a blind eye to this nagging problem.

Pakistan: Air quality deteriorating in many of the world's cities,"ISLAMABAD, Aug. 27 -- Air quality in most cities worldwide that monitor outdoor (ambient) air pollution fails to meet WHO guidelines for safe levels, putting people at additional risk of respiratory disease and other health problems. WHO's urban air quality database covers 1600 cities across 91 countries - 500 more cities than the previous database (2011), revealing that more cities worldwide are monitoring outdoor air quality, reflecting growing recognition of air pollution's health risks, CBC News Reported. Only 12% of the people living in cities reporting on air quality reside in cities where this complies with WHO air quality guideline levels. /About half of the urban population being monitored is exposed to air pollution that is at least 2.5 times higher than the levels WHO recommends - putting those people at additional risk of serious, long-term health problems. In most cities where there is enough data to compare the situation today with previous years, air pollution is getting worse. Many factors contribute to this increase, including reliance on fossil fuels such as coal fired power plants, dependence on private transport motor vehicles, inefficient use of energy in buildings, and the use of biomass for cooking and heating. But some cities are making notable improvements - demonstrating that air quality can be improved by implementing policy measures such as banning the use of coal for ""space heating"" in buildings, using renewable or ""clean"" fuels for electricity production, and improving efficiency of motor vehicle engines. The latest available data have prompted WHO to call for greater awareness of health risks caused by air pollution, implementation of effective air pollution mitigation policies; and close monitoring of the situation in cities worldwide. ""Too many urban centres today are so enveloped in dirty air that their skylines are invisible,"" said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for Family, Children and Women's Health. The Organization also emphasised that indoor and outdoor air pollution combined are among the largest risks to health worldwide. There are many components of air pollution, both gaseous and solid. But high concentrations of small and fine particulate pollution is particularly associated with high numbers of deaths from heart disease and stroke, as well as respiratory illnesses and cancers. In high-income countries, 816 cities reported on PM2.5 levels with another 544 cities reporting on PM10, from which estimates of PM2.5 can be derived. In low- and middle-income countries, however, annual mean PM2.5 measurements could be accessed in only 70 cities; another 512 cities reported on PM10 measurements. ""We can win the fight against air pollution and reduce the number of people suffering from respiratory and heart disease, as well as lung cancer,"" said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. ""Effective policies and strategies are well understood, but they need to be implemented at sufficient scale. Cities such as Copenhagen and Bogot?, for example, have improved air quality by promoting `active transport' and prioritizing dedicated networks of urban public transport, walking and cycling."" The report notes that individual cities can take local action to improve air quality and thus go against regional trends. And good air quality can go hand in hand with economic development, as indicated by some major cities in Latin America which meet, or approach, the WHO air quality guidelines. ""We cannot buy clean air in a bottle, but cities can adopt measures that will clean the air and save the lives of their people,"" said Dr Carlos Dora, Coordinator, Interventions for Healthy Environments, WHO Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. Measures include ensuring that houses are energy efficient, that urban development is compact and well served by public transport routes, that street design is appealing and safe for pedestrians and cyclists, and waste is well managed/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Steel, marble factories threat to environment","ISLAMABAD, Aug. 30 -- Dozens of marble and steel factories, set up close to the residential area in sector I-9 have become the major threat to the environment. Air pollution is increasing day by day in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi as industrial zone was getting close to residential area. /The residents frequently complain of diseases like chest congestion and asthma, which are directly linked to air pollution according to residents. Talking to media, Daud Ali, a resident of sector I-9 said ""we are living in worst environmental conditions, but the concern authority was not taking steps to shift this industry. The marble factories caused air and noise pollution also, he added. The residents demanded of CDA to take immediate action for shifting the industries far from the residential place. These factories throw their waste into the nearby natural streams. None of these factories follow any environmental or labour laws, says Aslam Tahir, a worker. He said most of the workers developed chest diseases due to inhaling dust frequently and that the factory owners adopted no safety precautions. A factory owner said that they need much money to shift their factories from the sector I-9, saying that the expenditures were unaffordable for them. He said industries were adopting precautionary measures to avoid air pollution. When contacted, an official of CDA Environment Wing, he said the authority was pursuing industrialists, with a special focus on steel and marble factories, to use treatment plants to filter hazardous smoke emissions. The official agreed that the residents of the sectors close to the industrial area were suffering from air pollution, and as a result they were more prone to respiratory diseases. He said the authority had devised a plan to check air pollution in the federal capital territory/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Burning wood indoors to cook raises healh risks for billions,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 4 -- Indoor air pollution from burning fuels such as wood to heat or light homes or cook is putting nearly three billion people worldwide at risk of ill health and early death, new research suggests. It's estimated that a third of the world's population uses plant-based fuels such as wood or charcoal, often in an open fire or simple stove that can release many tiny particles that can get deep into the lungs, causing irritation, CBC News Reported. /In Tuesday's Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission, researchers examined the evidence on the effects of those kinds of household air pollution.Professors Stephen Gordon from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the U.K. and William Martin from Ohio State University and their team conclude that an estimated 600 million to 800 million families worldwide are at increased risk of illnesses such as respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder asthma and lung cancer. ""Women and children are particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of pollution and are exposed to the highest concentrations. Interventions should target these high-risk groups and be sufficient quality to make the air clean,"" the authors conclude. Clean cooking technologies, such as advanced cook stoves and solar powered systems, exist. But they need to be affordable, efficient and long lasting to replace traditional methods, Gordon said in a journal release. Estimates suggest that household air pollution killed up to four million people in 2010. While overall rates of exposure have been declining slowly, population growth means the number of people exposed has been steady at around 2.8 billion people worldwide, the researchers said. In a journal comment on the series, Lancet editors said they hope the content ""will provide the impetus to drive change and tackle what is a preventable, but devastating, burden on the health of the world's population, not least in terms of the morbidity and mortality associated with acute and chronic respiratory diseases./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Drink broccoli sprout beverage to lower air pollution risks,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 21 -- Broccoli sprouts are a source of glucoraphanin - a compound that generates sulforaphane when the plant is chewed or the beverage swallowed. A novel way of curbing health risks associated with air pollution could be consuming a broccoli sprout beverage, said the study in the journal Cancer Prevention Research. Researchers have found that daily consumption of half a cup of broccoli sprout beverage produced rapid, significant and sustained higher levels of excretion of benzene - a known human carcinogen - and acrolein, a lung irritant. Broccoli sprouts are a source of glucoraphanin - a compound that generates sulforaphane when the plant is chewed or the beverage swallowed. It acts to increase enzymes that enhance the body's capacity to expunge these types of pollutants.

Pakistan: Environmental degradation - lethargy may cost more,"PESHAWAR, Sept. 30 -- Environmental degradation in the country continues to affect livelihoods and health increasing vulnerability of the poor to natural disasters and costing billions of rupees annually to national kitty.Urban and rural poor having meager or no access to basic facilities regrading environmental improvement and usually using fossil fuel as energy resource, are more prone to health hazards and ailments./Surveys carried out in the country by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), Provincial EPAs and SUPARCO revealed presence of very high levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in major cities (about 6 times higher than the WHO's guidelines)./As in rural areas, there is no mechanism for monitoring pollution level, the residents are more exposed to dust, smoke and particulate matter contamination./Over the decades, environment of the country continued deteriorating costing billions to national kitty and affecting health and hygiene./The World Bank, in its report in 2006 estimated the cost of environmental neglect and degradation around Rs. 365 billion annually. Experts consider that 60-70 percent cause of urban air quality degradation is due to vehicles./""Every body least bothers about how much we are losing due to environmental degradation,"" said an environmentalist, Sohail Khan./Resident of Rawalpindi, Mr Sohail regretted the improper implementation of laws even Environmental Act 1997 and said, ""apparently we lack political will and commitment to the cause.""/He urged awareness raising at grassroots and involvement of communities and called upon the government and other organizations working in the sector, to collectively move forward to take on this dilemma./Almost all metropolitan cities have industrial estates where cluster of industries of different types exist and majority of cement, fertilizer, sugar units, power plants and steel furnaces located in the vicinity of towns, cause excessive air pollution./Brick kilns are another source of pollution in many areas. Use of low-grade coal and old tires in brick kilns generate dense black smoke (soot) and other kind of emissions./Out of 6,634 registered industries in Pakistan, 1,228 are considered to be highly polluting./Presently it is estimated that 54,888 tons of solid waste is generated in Pakistan every day, of which 50 percent remain uncollected./Since none of the cities has proper waste disposal system, even the waste collected is either dumped in low lying areas or along the road sides and set on fire. Burning of solid waste at low temperature not only generate particulate matters like CO, NOx but also produce dioxin, a persistent organic pollutant./Regarding air pollution, data is generally available about ambient air quality focusing on outdoor air such as concentrations of SOx, NOs, CO, CO2, PM10 and PM 2.5. But, these key air pollutants are reported at selected urban locations only./As indoor air pollution (IAP) has not been recognized as a hazard as yet, data is very sparse or even not available./In rural areas biomass fuels meet about 86 percent of the total domestic energy requirements as 90 percent of rural and 50 percent of urban population depend on wood and other biomass fuels./Indoor cooking and heating with biomass fuels or coal produces high level of indoor pollutants that is evident from ailment like acute respiratory infections and even lung cancer./Environmental degradation eventually translates into socio-economic problems retarding development and growth and there is need to address environmental issues through policies and institutional reforms that create the right incentives for administrators to effectively enforce policies and for polluters to comply with regulations./Director General Pak-EPA Asif Shuja Khan said, the government initiated a number of projects to control pollution but lot more is needed to be done./He described the lack of proper implementation of laws and certain legal bottlenecks as one of the reasons behind continued pollution./""We have installed air monitoring systems at big cities. We have found the air pollution level four to six times higher than prescribed limits,"" he said./Shuja agreed that pollution causes respiratory diseases, lung cancer, heart attack and even pre-mature deaths./When asked about non-implementation of laws, he said, the Environment Ministry is taking and number of measures like capacity building of Environmental Tribunals, review of Environmental Act, appoint Environmental Magistrates and raising of Green Task Force for implementation of decisions./People can only hope that these measures will be implemented as they have no other option./But, if the ministry fails and the situation continues to aggravate, the present loss of Rs 365 billion may rise to another bench mark./In view of present economic crunch and energy crisis, the authorities need to evolve prudent conservation strategies as water scarcity is already looming large on the country./It is high time to tackle these problems failing which not only the environment would further deteriorate but also the food security of the country would be under severe threat/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: First winter rain expected today,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 15 -- First winter rain with thunderstorm is expected in most parts of the country including twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad today (Tuesday)./On the other hand, experts said, first winter rain, which would not only provide people respite from the dry weather-related diseases but also kill all kinds of mosquitoes particularly dengue in this regard./According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), first winter rain is expected in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad in next 24 hours, which would increase intensity of chill. The cold and moist winds coming from west and the north contributed to the rain that lashed wide-ranging areas of northern Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Fata, Gilgit-Baltistan and twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad./PMD Director Dr. Muhammad Hanif told 'media' that cloudy weather is expected in Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Tuesday, which would increase the intensity of cold weather. Day and night temperature would continuously come down after first winter rain, he said. He said that now farmers could sow wheat because these days are ideal for this purpose./Peshawar, Swat, lower and upper Dir, Chitral, Malakand Agency, AJK and parts of Mardan district would also receive rain in next 24 hours, he predicted./He warned people, particularly children, to wear warm clothes to avoid cold winds in initial stage of winter./According to weather experts after a good monsoon, winter is expected to be chilly this year.

"Pakistan: 'Vaccine refusal, malnutrition leading causes of childhood pneumonia'","KARACHI, Nov. 14 -- Inefficient vaccination programmes and malnutrition are the two main causes for the high prevalence of childhood pneumonia in Pakistan, agreed experts at a seminar held on Wednesday at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH)./The seminar held to mark the World Pneumonia Day was titled ""Saving Children Together""./Speakers said pneumonia remained one of the leading causes of under-five child mortality, responsible for one-fifth of the total number of child deaths in the country. Tragically, all the deaths were preventable./What was worse, they said, three-quarters of children who died from pneumonia lived in Africa and South-East Asia. Pakistan is one of the 15 countries, where two-thirds of the cases of this infection occur./Just last year, the launch of WHO's Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of pneumonia and diarrhoea and a special series in The Lancet, both with research contributed by the Aga Khan University, had called for an integrated approach to end deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea./""The majority of pneumonia-related deaths in children are caused by two bacteria - Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza - which can be effectively targeted through vaccination,"" said Dr Syed Asad Ali, an associate professor at the department of paediatrics and child health at the AKUH. ""Health campaigns should focus on getting people to vaccinate their children. Unfortunately, just half of children less than two years of age in Pakistan are vaccinated, with parents refusing inoculation and the refusal cases presenting significant health challenges.""/Experts stressed the need for strong and complete immunisation programmes, especially at the community levels. They reinforced the statement of WHO's independent expert review group on information and accountability for women's and children's health, that ""The political will and financial resources needed to protect the lives of children at risk of pneumonia falls well short of what is needed.""/The experts reiterated pneumonia was a preventable illness which can be managed when diagnosed early and treated promptly while delays in diagnosing it disease could increase the risk of it becoming severe./Dr Gaffar Billoo, paediatrics professor at AKUH, said children under five years of age remained at high risk of mortality in Pakistan owing to pre-disposing risk factors, including rampant malnutrition, indoor air pollution and a poor history of vaccination./Paediatrics professor Dr Ali Faisal Saleem said: ""Severely malnourished children are nine times more likely to die from pneumonia than children of the same age group with adequate nutrition. Malnutrition is rampant among children in Pakistan, with more than 50 per cent of the children showing signs of severe to moderate malnutrition./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: KPT directed to ensure safe storage, transportation of coal","KARACHI, Nov. 21 -- The Sindh High Court has directed the Karachi Port Trust to take appropriate measures for safe handling and transportation of coal and submit a report within a month./The court also ordered environmental impact assessment of the handling facility that deals with over 4.5 million tons of imported coal./The directions came on a petition of Ashfaq Qureshi and other residents of the Shireen Jinnah colony against coal-storage facility near the residential area. Petitioners' counsel Khawaja Shamsul Islam had submitted that handling of millions of tons coal at the KPT terminal was causing serious threat to the health of residents of the area and the environment./He stated that due to the coal terminal inhabitants of the area were facing the serious consequences of environmental effects which had resulted in raising number of cases of respiratory diseases in the locality besides the road from Shireen Jinnah Colony to the sea always remain clogged with heavy vehicles transporting coal to various industrial units./Report submitted by the Sindh Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on import, handling and storage of imported coal at Karachi Port Trust said that the KPT neither had carried out the Environmental Impact Assessment mandatory under the Pakistan Environment Protection Act nor obtained an environmental approval for handling and transportation import of over 4 million tons coal./Director General SEPA Naeem Mughal said that in view of coal storage site in a densely populated area the entire locality seems an environmental disaster. He said that it was obvious that hundreds of people in the particular location could be affected with respiratory, eye and other diseases due to air pollution containing coal dust particles./The report said that dust pollution was causing respiratory and other diseases at the location and local people also expressed their grievances due to pollution generated from the coal yard./The DG submitted that the SEPA entirely remained unaware of such large activity of coal import, although it was being carried out for last 8 to 10 years, having serious environmental issues, adding that in case compliance of environmental laws, the SEPA would have imposed some specific bindings on the KPT for taking strict careful measures to minimise the present environment concerns through implementation of a management plan./The SEPA submitted that the KPT should conduct detailed environmental audit through a reputable and independent environmental firm for coal import, handling and storage and a report be provided to the agency so that mitigation measures may be taken by the KPT to deal such an environmental issue./It was also suggested that huge quantity of coal may not be stored for a long time and cycle of import should maintain quantity of coal and its onward transportation in order to minimise the adverse effects on environment and residents of the locality./The report suggested that all operation must be carried out in such a manner that flow of dust particles into the air were minimised and this could be achieved if transportation of coal be made thoroughly in completely covered vehicles. Besides, the SEPA should be allowed to form a committee of experts who shall be authorised to inspect the coal handling and give suggestions to ensure protection of the environment./The division bench, headed by Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, after perusal of the report directed for safe storage and transportation of coal and for submission of a report with a month./The court also ordered environmental impact assessment of the coal-handling facility, reduction of coal quantity to 300,000 tons, transportation of coal through covered vehicles and regular spray of water on coal stakes/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Power generators add to pollution,"LAHORE, Nov. 25 -- Heavy power generators installed in residential and commercial localities are posing a serious health hazards to citizens./The Environment Protection Wing of City District Government Lahore (CDGL), which is supposed to protect citizens from pollution and its effects, is only acting as observant. During the current year no major campaign has so far been launched to check the major cause of pollution and only individual raids have been conducted to increase the volume of progress files./The sale of generators, especially diesel generators, has surged in the city due to loadshedding. Another important point is that there is no authority to regulate installation and use of heavy generators, which have increased noise and air pollution in residential and commercial localities./The city is already facing increased levels of noise and air pollution and residents are suffering a lot. Now the use of high power diesel generators installed outside business outlets in commercial localities in almost every nook and corner of the city has increased poison in the atmosphere./Use of generators was once confined to industrial areas, but following the ongoing loadshedding businessmen have started installing generators at their shops, offices and outlets. Majority of the generators were installed and operated without any precautionary measures to contain discharge of air pollutants and noise./One can hear heavy noise of generators in almost every commercial area during electricity breakdowns. In most of the cases, people have placed these heavy generators outside their shops and offices or on footpaths. On the other hand, the rules and regulations of Environmental Protection Department are not clear about installation of generators. The rules only cover industrial sector and these consumers are bound to get an NOC from the department. A senior official of EPD revealed that noise releasing from generators should not be more than 70 decibels but in majority of cases this noise is more than 80 decibels. He claimed majority of public complaints filed before the Environment Department of CDGL were either used to get some favours from the violators or would be used later on. He revealed noise level has already crossed the permissible limits of National Environment Quality (NEQ) standards in majority of the city's congested areas such as Bhatti Gate, Railway Station, DCO Office, Mozang, Charing Cross and Yateem Khana Chowk is between 102 to 114 decibels. ""Sustained noise over a period of time can engender deafness in the form of gradual losses in hearing. This is the most common loss in teenagers today listening to loud music,"" said Dr Hamza Imran, a TNT specialist. He said rising level of noise pollution is one of the major sources of heart, mental and ear diseases among the Lahorites, he said, adding voice unit beyond 75 decibel become injurious to human health. He said hospitals and educational institutions are among the places badly affected by noise pollution and now unchecked installation of generators in the residential localities will be injurious to human health./On Tuesday, officials of Environment department, CDGL issued notices to two business concerns of Gulberg for causing pollution through generators. Multiple complaints from general public were pending against these concerns./When contacted, District Officer (Environment) Younaz Zahid refused to give any data or answer any question officially.

Pakistan: MKRMS holds seminar on COPD,"ISLAMABAD: An awareness seminar on 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)' was held here on Tuesday. The seminar was organised by the Mir Khalil-ur-Rehman Memorial Society (MKRMS) , Nov. 27 -- Jang Group of Newspapers, in collaboration with GSK Pakistan and Pakistan Chest Society and was largely attended by health officials, patients of pulmonary diseases and students./The speakers on the occasion were Brigadier (r) Dr. Mohammad Babar Cheema, who is professor of Medicine and Chest Diseases, visiting pulmonologist at Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, Margalla Institute of Medical Sciences, and Dr. Kausar Rehana, assistant professor of Pulmonology at PIMS./Brigadier (r) Dr. Mohammad Babar Cheema, while speaking on the occasion, said COPD can occur due to many factors. The major factor for COPD is cigarette smoking, smoke-emitting cars and factories and indoor fuel burning. ""It is quite different from allergies that does not grow with time but these diseases grow with time silently and the patient knows when the damage is done. It is never too late and regular checkups from doctors help stop its progression. The quality of life can be improved if there is an early detection. If a person experiences shortness of breath, he should immediately consult the doctor so that early diagnosis can lead to proper treatment at an early stage. Further delay can cause inflammation and destruction of walls and can obstruct oxygen transfer from atmosphere to the blood. Doctor's invention is a must before the damage is being done. In Northern Areas, the major cause of COPD is fuel-burning without proper ventilation,"" he said./Dr. Kausar Rehana said that COPD is a common and treatable disease that is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The causes for COPD includes smoking, air pollution (environmental pollution), biomass inhalation, passive smoking, genetic factors and aging can somewhat contribute to these chronic illnesses. After 40 years of age, the functions of the airways of the lungs start deteriorating. ""When we breathe in air, the air travels through airways in our lungs to millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli but in COPD the airways may become inflamed and clogged with mucus. There can be occupational exposures to people i.e. coal mines, asbestos, etc. that can lead to respiratory infections. In cigarettes there are 70 chemicals that can lead to cancer. 'Sheesha', 'Beeri', 'Niswar' are no less dangerous than cigarette because they all lead to pulmonary infections and if left unattended can lead to death. There is a test being done for people which is called spirometry test, through this test the doctors can determine COPD and the treatment can be started. People think that they are having smoking cough taking it lightly until it's too late. They don't consult the doctor and 50% of the lung function is damaged. This problem should be captured in stage 1 and stage 2, but nothing can be offered in stage 3 and stage 4 and that damage cannot be reversed,"" she said./Dr. Rehana said that if a person experiences shortness of breath, persistent cough, coughing up mucus/phlegm, wheezing, fatigue, tiredness, weight loss or weight gain, morning headaches then he should immediately consult the doctor. ""A person with COPD sees worsening of cough, a change in the colour or amount of phlegm, should also consult the doctor immediately. According to WHO survey done in 2010, 2.9 million death in the world. Exacerbations of COPD in Pakistan is highest in the world. Ion from COPD, the experts suggested that a person should avoid these triggers that are cigarettes, chemicals, fumes, dust, air pollution, flu and pneumonia. To avoid COPD from occurring, a person should wash their hands regularly, develop healthy eating habits and exercise. Proper usage of inhalers and vaccines for flu should be done to avoid these diseases,"" she said./Later, the experts took questions from guests and patients and answered their queries relating to pulmonary illnesses/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution with specific reference to smoking causes surge in COPD,"KARACHI, Dec. 25 -- Growing atmospheric pollution and non- implementation of ban imposed on smoking, of all categories, at public places with little consideration towards public health have caused surge in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) across the country. Chest specialists alongwith general physicians in a joint statement Wednesday feared that steady increase in numbers as well as intensity of COPD is likely to cause more deaths. /""We fear that COPD induced deaths are fast emerging to be most fatal than any other disease in the country,"" said Assistant Professor and Head of Pulmonology Department Multan Institute of Cardiology, Dr Anjum Naveed Jamal. The chest physician said non-availability of data on COPD related deaths in the country is aggravating incidence rate of the ailment without being noticed. Dr Anjum said COPD patient who could be managed through proper medication often gets ignored and labelled with other respiratory diseases, hence Pakistani health professionals do not have an insight due to lack of data collection. About vulnerability of people in general and population with weak immunity in particular, he said pollution particles including smoke, dirt, mould or pollen and their fine size are the biggest risks to human health as they can easily be inhaled and stuck in the respiratory system. A senior general physician from Karachi, Dr Rashid Zubeiri, said social set up in the country in general coupled with standard of living, illiteracy, rampant trend of self medication and unawareness are also among the triggering factors for COPD. The doctors regretted that while smokers are themselves at high risk to suffer from COPD they appear to be indifferent towards their contribution in exposing others around to the killer disease. Air pollution caused due to smoking is in itself a major risk factor for non-smokers as passive smoking is as dangerous as smoking, said Dr Anjum. The experts also referred to WHO reports about indoor air pollution caused due to the use of bio-mass fuels contributing to nearly two million premature deaths each year worldwide. It will be of no surprise that any person with exposure to pollution might have become a victim of lung disease or COPD for quite some time, said the pulmonologist. He said indoor pollution in third world countries is playing havoc with the lives of the people as the people there are exposed to household induced air pollution owing to poverty level, in particular context of rural to urban migration. Moreover, inadequacies that exist with regard to safe disposal of non-biodegradable goods, most prominent being plastic bags that generate more pollution when burnt, was also identified as a major risk for people. Black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful climate change pollutants and these factors were identified to have their heavy toll on adult population as over one third of premature deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (falling in their most productive years of lives) are because of household air pollution, the doctors said/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.
