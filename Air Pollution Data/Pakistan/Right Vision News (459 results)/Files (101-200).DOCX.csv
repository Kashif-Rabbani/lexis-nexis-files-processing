Exposure to air pollution linked to reduced heart rate variability,"ISLAMABAD, July 13 -- A new study has revealed that in patients with pre-existing heart or lung disease, exposure to high levels of traffic-related air pollutants is linked to reduced heart rate variability (HRV) - a risk factor for sudden cardiac death./The study included 30 Atlanta-area residents with lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or heart disease (previous myocardial infarction)./Ambient levels of air pollutants in the areas where the patients lived were unrelated to HRV./However, when the patients wore 24-hour monitoring devices, their personal exposure (levels of traffic-related air pollutants-specifically, elemental carbon and nitrogen dioxide) were significantly related to reduced HRV./In contrast, the Atlanta patients were spread out over a larger area, with differing population densities, distances from major roads, etc./The results add to recent evidence that short-term, personal exposure to traffic-related pollution is linked to decreased HRV and increased cardiac risk Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Maricopa County-based Summit Builders Construction Co. required to pay more than $100K for Clean Air Act violations,"Karachi, July 15 -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has fined Summit Builders Construction Co., based in Maricopa County, Arizona, $105,610 for allegedly failing to comply with Clean Air Act regulations. In addition to the monetary fine, Summit is also required to take steps to minimize the generation of dust at its construction sites, according to a press release issued here./""Air pollution from particulate matter directly impacts the health of the community. It's an especially serious issue in Maricopa County, where air quality does not meet the federal standard,"" said Jared Blumenfeld, EPA's Regional Administrator for the Pacific Southwest region. ""EPA will not tolerate companies who fail to comply with dust control regulations. We are working closely with local air quality agencies to enforce rules to protect the community from airborne dust.""/""Air quality is a concern for many who live in and travel through Maricopa County. The resolution of this case provides for positive measures which will help improve air quality in the future,"" stated Dennis K. Burke, U.S. Attorney, District of Arizona./In 2006 and 2007, the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAD) inspected five commercial construction projects in Maricopa County and uncovered eight violations for failing to perform various measures required to reduce particulate matter emissions, such as:/* Failure to install a trackout control device to remove particulate matter from vehicles;/* Failure to immediately clean up dirt that is tracked more than 50 feet beyond the site;/* Failure to operate a water application system during earthmoving operations;/* Failure to comply with the dust control plan./In addition to the penalty, Summit is required to train employees in basic dust control; document such training; and employ qualified dust controls at larger work sites for two years./Maricopa County exceeds the national health standard for particulate matter, PM-10 (one-seventh the width of a human hair), and has been classified by the EPA as a serious non-attainment area. In May 2010, EPA denied Arizona's claim that dust storms caused the high pollution readings in Phoenix. Because of this, Arizona must submit an adequate plan to EPA on how they plan to come into attainment for PM-10. Failure to do so will result in a freeze to the state's federal transportation funds./Particulate matter affects the respiratory system. Particle pollution is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets in the air. When breathed in, these particles can reach the deepest regions of the lungs, and is linked to a variety of significant health problems-ranging from aggravated asthma to premature death in people with heart and lung disease. The elderly, children and people with chronic lung disease, influenza, or asthma are especially sensitive to high levels of particulate matte Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Compliance and Enforcement News Release (HQ): Hoosier Energy Agreement Marks 20th Settlement Under EPA's Power Plant Enforcement Initiative,"Karachi, July 24 -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Justice Department, and the state of Indiana announced that Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $950,000 and install and upgrade pollution control technology at its two coal-fired power plants in Indiana to resolve violations of the Clean Air Act. The settlement, filed in federal court today, will reduce harmful air pollution by more than 24,500 tons per year and requires Hoosier to spend $5 million on environmental projects./""This settlement continues our important enforcement initiative to reduce harmful air pollution from coal-fired power plants and provide the public with cleaner, healthier air to breathe,"" said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. ""Pollution from these sources can cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular impacts, and are significant contributors to acid rain, smog, and haze. Coal-fired power plants are large sources of air emissions, and EPA is committed to making sure that they comply with the law.""/""The large reductions in harmful air pollutants including sulfuric acid mist emissions secured by this settlement will have a significant beneficial impact on air quality in Indiana and downwind states,"" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. ""The Justice Department is committed to vigorously enforcing our nation's environmental laws, and we are pleased that Hoosier has agreed to install state-of-the art controls that will significantly reduce harmful emissions.""/EPA issued a notice of violation to Hoosier, an Indiana electric generation and transmission cooperative, alleging that in 2008 it made modifications at its Merom coal-fired power plant without first complying with New Source Review requirements, including obtaining pre-construction permits and limiting emissions based upon best available control technology./The settlement requires Hoosier to reduce air pollution from the cooperative's Merom and Ratts Stations, located in southwest Indiana. Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) will be reduced by approximately 20,000 tons and nitrogen oxides (NOx) by more than 1,800 tons. The settlement will also reduce harmful sulfuric acid mist and particulate matter (PM) emissions. To achieve these reductions, Hoosier will upgrade existing, and install new, pollution controls at the Merom plant, install new pollution controls at the Ratts plant, and comply with annual tonnage limitations across its system. Hoosier estimates that it will spend between $250 and $300 million upgrading and installing pollution controls at its coal-fired units through the end of 2015./Hoosier will spend $5 million on environmental mitigation projects in its service territory to address the impacts of past emissions. Hoosier must direct $200,000 for projects to mitigate the harm caused by Hoosier's excess emissions at lands owned by the U.S. Forest Service. The remaining $4.8 million will be spent on one or more of the following projects:/* Coal Bed Methane: Hoosier will capture and combust methane from coal beds to generate at least 10 megawatts of electricity. Carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the combustion of methane will be supplied to a greenhouse for use as a fertilizer./* Wood Appliance Change-out and Retrofits: Hoosier will sponsor a wood-burning appliance change-out and retrofit project. Hoosier will provide incentives through rebates, discounts, and in some instances, replacement of old, inefficient, high polluting wood-burning technology./* Clean Diesel Retrofits: Hoosier will retrofit in-service, public diesel engines with emission control equipment designed to reduce air pollutants./* Solar Technologies: Hoosier will install solar power systems on public schools or on buildings housing non-profit groups in the company's service territory./The settlement marks EPA's 20th settlement under its national enforcement initiative to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act's New Source Review requirements. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, two key pollutants emitted from power plants, have numerous adverse effects on human health and the environment./These pollutants can cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular impacts, and premature death. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are also significant contributors to acid rain, smog, and haze. In addition, air pollution from power plants can drift significant distances downwind, thereby effecting not only local communities, but also communities in a much broader area./The proposed settlement was lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Commuters lot worsens as city turns fifty,"Islamabad, July 26 -- After a half century of its existence which the Capital Development Authority (CDA) is coaxing the citizens to celebrate the capital city of Islamabad and Pakistan's most modern urban metropolis remains as backward as any other old town of the country in terms of essential services like transport, which is the life blood of civic mobility./As a result local residents and the tens of thousands of commuters who move in Islamabad are the most harassed of its 1.7 million population that is daily pushed around and robbed of precious hours and hard earned money by uncouth private transporters on its ever broadening roads and avenues. Years have gone by and no one in the government has ever bothered to improve the situation by introducing a decent bus service for the commuters who have to shuttle daily between Rawalpindi and Islamabad./Many commuters, including students and government servants, live in Rawalpindi. What they have to face daily why coming to and returning from Islamabad cannot be imagined by the ruling elite who travel in free chauffeur driven cars and have no idea what the common citizen has to go through to reach his or her place of work./It is a daily ordeal that ends in utter frustration and sense of loss. Its no surprise why the public servant is so nervy and ready to explode; why inefficiency is the order of the day./The cost of transport has multiplied in the last few years and now increases by the day at every rupee added to the cost of gas or petrol. The fares do not come down when fuel costs fall./The fares pinch because there is no improvement in the service. People might be willing to pay more for bus and van fares if the service was improved. Once a private company had started a decent bus service in the twin cities but it was soon closed down by connivance of the transport thugs and the civic authorities who have a stake in the profits./The SSP, Islamabad Traffic Police, Dr. Moeen said that there was no plan to start a public funded government transport service. The absence of an efficient public transport service has forced the public to maintain their own cars and motor cycles which even the new and broad avenues being built in Islamabad have been unable to contain and the problem of traffic congestion and jams was growing incrementally in addition to the great increase in pollution. Consumption of costly imported fuel that the country could save has increased beyond actual need as petrol guzzling cars are transporting single persons around the city./He agreed that all over the world governments provide subsidy to run public transport./He said they had proposed to the government that new schools should not be permitted if they did not have their own transport for the students./The Director General Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) Mr. Asif Shuja, said that traffic burden on the roads of Islamabad was increasing day by day due to non availability of public transport. While more than 100, 000 vehicles were entering Islamabad daily from different cities spewing their poisonous smoke into the environment. He said due to increasing air pollution more than 22,000 people were dying annually in Pakistan. Capital Development Authority was spending billions of rupees annually for expansion of old roads and construction of new avenues, which was also depleting the greenery of the city./Ramzan Sajid, spokesman of the CDA, admitted that lack of public transport in Islamabad was creating problems for the common man. Due to non-availability of public transport, people were forced to bring their private transport on roads creating traffic jams and air pollution./In previous years banks also financed car schemes on soft terms which aggravated the situation and presently more than 300,000 vehicles were registered in Islamabad, while 2,500 vehicles were being registered monthly./In the current budget Capital Development Authority had allocated Rs100 million to start a bus service initially within Islamabad before the end of the year, he said./He also assured that at a later stage the service will be expanded to serve Rawalpindi also. This will be done in collaboration with private companies Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Environmental pollution plagues city residents,"LAHORE, July 27 -- The city is becoming a living hell for the residents due to the presence of a massive amount of solid waste in and around their localities, with no facility ever established by the government to recycle or properly dump toxic material./According to environmental experts, the authorities, including Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) and the City District Government of Lahore (CDGL), have chosen not to determine a specific site for toxic waste dumping. Instead, poisonous waste is dumped in various residential localities, causing not only health hazards in general public, but also contributing its share of contaminants into the already polluted environment./The federal or provincial governments have so far failed to develop waste recycling facilities for industrial cities such as Lahore, Karachi, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Kasur, etc. As a result, these cities are the worst places to live in, in terms of environmental conditions./The air pollution in the city has reached an alarming level due to an increase in the number of vehicles and disregard for industrial standards and environment laws by those who matter./The district government machinery, including WASA, has been alleged to have a habit of throwing solid waste close to residential colonies./The deadly solid waste contains metals, plastic, textiles, rags, rubber, paper, cardboard, glass, wood and other organic matters. A major part of the waste is not recyclable and is extremely dangerous for the environment. The only way to get rid of such material is to dump it./The key sites where the toxic solid waste is being dumped include the Mehmood Booti, Saggian, Baggrian and Sabzazar areas. The densely populated areas of the city are not spared of waste either, most of which is thrown into drains and onto roads./The district government collects the waste from across the city only to throw it on the outskirts of the city, and has become a permanent source of pollution in this second-largest city of the country./City government sources told to media that the city produced 5,000 tonnes of solid waste a day till a few years ago, but this had multiplied with the passage of time./A World Bank study pointed out various factors contributing to the worsening environmental conditions in the city and other parts of the province. Insufficient legal and regulatory by-laws, lack of awareness among residents, lack of a comprehensive SWM administration, financial and technological difficulties to build and operate waste treatment facilities, shortage of experienced manpower, absence of private sector participation in the waste management process and lack of research facilities are a few factors to account for, the study says./Mohsin, a resident of J Block Sabzazar, told to media that the district government and WASA authorities mischievously dump solid waste in their locality, forcing the people to learn to live with a constant nauseous atmosphere. The contamination caused by the garbage, not only pollutes the locality, but also caused health hazards, he said./He said the presence of waste at such a large scale provided an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, increasing malaria cases in the locality./The situation at Mehmood Booti is not different either, where the people are made to suffer the worst kind of health issues when winds blow southwards and stink up the environment./Senior doctor and environmentalist Dr Yasmeen Rashid told to media that solid waste produced in the city was becoming one of the key causes of pollution and diseases in poor localities./She said that seepage of toxic materials in areas where solid waste was being thrown by government agencies was contaminating the underground water and causing severe ailments to the citizens, including stomach and lungs diseases, and even cancer./She said the government never heeded to the demands of the citizens to stop dumping garbage on the outskirts of the city and establish proper dumping facilities. She said 70 percent of the underground water in the city had been polluted./She said the city had one of the purest aquifers in the world because of its access to fresh water directly coming from the Himalayas, yet the successive governments in the country failed to act in time and understand the problem./Environment Protection Department spokesman Naseemur Rehman told to media that the department was concerned about the issue, and a multi-dimensional policy was being evolved to cope with the solid waste issues./He said the district government had signed a number of agreements with private stakeholders to collect, recycle and properly dump the solid waste, apart from developing different committees to study the problem./He said development of proper dumping sites to replace Mehmood Booti and other places was also on the cards, and the government was planning to build such facilities in the Kahna and Sundar areas where the solid waste would be properly classified and then dumped into deep excavations. Naseem said the Environmental Impact Assessment Report of the proposed site near Kahna had already been finalised by Nespa Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"More, Better Environmental Information Needed To Underpin Sustainable Development","Karachi, July 30 -- Countries have mixed track records over the past decade in managing the environment, according to the tenth edition of the World Bank's Little Green Data Book released today. Uneven availability of environmental data also emerges as a hindrance to promoting and monitoring environmental sustainability./Each year over the past 10 years the Little Green Data Book has taken the pulse of the world's environment, recording progress in some areas but regression in others, with wide disparities across regions. For example, urban air pollution declined in most countries between 2000 and 2006 (the most recent year for which data is available), with the greatest progress in low-income and lower middle-income countries. But concentration levels are still nearly three times higher in these countries than in high-income countries. Every year, an estimated 800,000 people die prematurely from lung cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases caused by outdoor air pollution./""Environmental data helps us to understand whether countries are on a sustainable development path or not,"" said Warren Evans, Director of the Environment Department, World Bank, ""Environmental sustainability underpins the factors of production and the well being and productivity of the labor force, but too often is relegated to the back burner when important investment and policy decisions are made. Policy makers need more and better environmental information to help them make better decisions.""/Since it was first published in 2000, the Little Green Data Book has tracked how the world has become drier as water resources per capita have diminished under the pressure of fast-growing population. Water availability is below scarcity levels in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia. Forest cover has fallen in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In developing countries the net loss of forest area for 2000-07 is estimated at 80,000 square kilometers a year./In addition, the lack of access to modern energy continues to be an important health risk factor in the poorest countries, where nearly 50 percent of energy use comes from biomass fuels and waste. Indoor air pollution is responsible for over 1.6 million annual deaths and 2.7 percent of the global burden of disease (in Disability-Adjusted Life Years or DALYs)./""The World Bank has worked hard on the analysis and advocacy that helps countries focus on the environment and has been the largest multilateral source of environment-related financing,"" said Kirk Hamilton, Lead Environmental Economist, World Bank, ""All policymakers and development professionals, no matter what sector they are active in, should be able to find much of the information they need in the Little Green Data Book.""/Under the headings of agriculture, forests and biodiversity, energy, emissions and pollution, water and sanitation, environment and health, and national accounts aggregates, the Little Green Data Book compiles 50 indicators for over 200 countries each year.

Social ties can add years to your life,"LONDON: Having good social relationships , July 30 -- friends, marriage or children -- may be every bit as important to a healthy lifespan as quitting smoking, losing weight or taking certain medications, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday./People with strong social relationships were 50 percent less likely to die early than people without such support, the team at Brigham Young University in Utah found./They suggest that policymakers look at ways to help people maintain social relationships as a way of keeping the population healthy./""A lack of social relationships was equivalent to smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day,"" psychologist Julianne Holt-Lunstad, who led the study, said in a telephone interview./Her team conducted a meta-analysis of studies that examine social relationships and their effects on health. They looked at 148 studies that covered more than 308,000 people for their analysis, published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine./Having low levels of social interaction was equivalent to being an alcoholic, was more harmful than not exercising and was twice as harmful as obesity./Social relationships had a bigger impact on premature death than getting an adult vaccine to prevent pneumonia, than taking drugs for high blood pressure and far more important than exposure to air pollution, they found./""I certainly don't want to downplay these other risk factors because of course they are very important,"" Holt-Lunstad said. ""We need to start taking social relationships just as seriously.""/Government policies to encourage social relationships will not necessarily be easy, Holt-Lundstad said. ""Air pollution and the clean air act -- that is simple policy,"" she said./But she has some ideas -- such as making it easier for friends or relatives to take part in medical care, and city planning that encourages interaction./The different studies measured social interaction in different ways, so the researchers said it was impossible to precisely define positive social interaction./It is equally difficult to study systematically, as it is impossible to randomly assign people to have friends or not have friends. But Holt-Lundstad said there is some evidence that assigning caretakers does not help improve people's health./""Naturally occurring relationships may be different than support received from someone who is hired for that purpose,"" she said./Her team found some troubling evidence that Americans are becoming more isolated, and thus losing the support and care that love and friendship provide./""For instance, trends reveal reduced intergenerational living, greater social mobility, delayed marriage, dual-career families, increased single-residence households, and increased age-related disabilities,"" they wrote./""More specifically, over the last two decades there has been a three-fold increase in the number of Americans who report having no confidant,"" they added./""Such findings suggest that despite increases in technology and globalization that would presumably foster social connections, people are becoming increasingly more socially isolated.

Garbage dumps creating health hazards,"ISLAMABAD, Aug. 11 -- Garbage dumps due to population explosions and over consumption in urban cities such as Islamabad and Rawalpindi has compelled citizens to live in a polluted environment that causes diseases and stench./Various studies say that on an average distance of every 2 kilometres in cities like Karachi, Rawalpindi and Lahore, there is a garbage dump. Garbage pickers usually select a point on roadside where they dump garbage and city government dumpers shift that load to another site away from the city./""By the time, they do it, it is already too late and people get suffered from the polluted and stinky heaps of garbage. They complain of skill irritation, breathing problems and some diseases,"" said Muhammad Sajid, a resident of a dumpsite locality near Pirwadhai./The studies show health deterioration in areas where there is no proper mechanism of garbage disposal. Amoebic diseases have been found concentrated in soil and air in proximity to these urban garbage dumps./There are many other problems, which are caused by garbage. These include contamination of ground water and surface water. These garbage dumps can also add to the acidity in water and even in the air. Landfills can also cause sealing of the ground surface, which leads to flooding. Garbage dumps are a hazard to human life./The studies further say garbage contaminates water resources and causes floods in nullahs such as Nullah Leh touching most parts of Rawalpindi. Rainwater percolates through garbage. Inappropriate disposal of sewage and garbage leads to substantial deterioration of ground water./Unfortunately, the growing population and inadequacy of municipal water supplies led to the exploitation of ground water for public drinking. Many of the bacteria and chemicals, which leak from garbage dumps also become airborne and pollute the air. If the garbage is exposed to air, localised air pollution is a likely result./The studies suggest a number of ways to reduce garbage dumps from residential areas. First of all there is need of infrastructure designed to address these problems. Most people are willing to cooperate with disposal regulations, as they don't want to live with the results of garbage accumulation. The studies found that garbage could also be an energy source./There is a plan being promoted in New York City to build high-temperature incinerators, which generate electricity. Garbage is burned in these incinerators and actually creates electricity. In this way, the garbage needs not to be disposed; instead, it becomes very useful./""If we do not want to use it for some creative purpose, at least it should be disposed off safely and properly to eradicate the risk of spreading diseases as well as to provide our people with fresh and pure air to breath in,"" said Dr. Asif Qureshi, an expert on environment and energ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Wildfire smoke could impact statewide air quality,"Washington, Aug. 19 -- The State Of Washington has issued following Press Release:/Smoke from several wildfires burning in Washington and British Columbia is spreading throughout the state./That trend is expected to continue for a few days. Some clearing of hazy skies is expected later this week, possibly by Wednesday./""Smoke from a wildfire can travel rapidly, affecting air quality hundreds of miles downwind from the fire's location,"" said Stu Clark, Air Quality Program manager for the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology). ""Smoke pollutes the air you breathe and harms your health, especially if you have existing health conditions.""/The Washington State Department of Health recommends that people who are sensitive to air pollution limit the time that they spend outdoors./The biggest health threat from smoke comes from the fine particles. These tiny particles can get into your eyes and lungs, where they can cause health problems such as burning eyes, runny nose, and illness such as bronchitis. Fine particles also can aggravate heart and lung diseases./Children also are more susceptible to smoke because:/* Their respiratory systems are still developing./* They breathe more air (and air pollution) per pound of body weight than adults./* They're more likely to be active outdoors./When smoke levels are high enough, even healthy people may be affected. It's important to limit your exposure to smoke - especially if you are susceptible. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself from wildfire smoke:/*/Pay attention to air quality reports. Ecology uses the Washington Air Quality Advisory (WAQA) to inform people about the health effects of air pollution. WAQA includes information about ground-level ozone, fine particles and carbon monoxide. WAQA is very similar to the national Air Quality Index (AQI). Both use color-coded categories to show when air quality is good, moderate or unhealthy. The difference is that WAQA shows the health effects of fine particles at lower levels than the AQI does. In other words, WAQA shows that air quality is unhealthy earlier - when there are fewer particles in the air. Here's where to find WAQA: /<a href=""http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/air/air_monitoring_data/WAQA_Intro_Page.html"">http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/air/air_monitoring_data/WAQA_Intro_Page.html</a>/*/Use common sense. WAQA and AQI may not have immediate information on conditions in your specific area. If it looks and smells smoky outside, it's probably not a good time to go for a jog, mow the lawn or allow children to play outdoors./*/If you have asthma or other lung disease, follow your doctor's directions on taking medicines and follow your asthma management plan. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen./*/If you have heart or lung disease, if you are an older adult, or if you have children, talk with your doctor about whether and when you should leave the area. When smoke is heavy for a prolonged period of time, fine particles can build up indoors even though you may not see them./*/Some room air cleaners can help reduce particulate levels indoors, as long as they are the right type and size for your home. For more information about home air cleaners, go to /<a href=""http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/residair.html"">www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/residair.html</a>/*/Don't think that paper ""comfort"" or ""dust masks"" are the answer. The kinds of masks that you commonly can buy at the hardware store are designed to trap large particles, such as sawdust. But they generally will not protect your lungs from the fine particles in smoke./For more information please contact /<a href=""mailto:info@plusmediasolutions.co"">info@plusmediasolutions.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Administrator Jackson Announces EPA's International Priorities,"Karachi, Aug. 21 -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa P. Jackson has announced the agency's international priorities at a meeting of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation she is attending in Guanajuato, Mexico. The international priorities echo Administrator Jackson's priorities for EPA, which she announced earlier this year, and aim to promote citizen engagement, improve public health and increase government accountability on environmental enforcement./""Pollution doesn't stop at international borders, and neither can our environmental and health protections. The local and national environmental issues of the past are now global challenges,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. ""This document sends a strong message to our partners in the international community that our challenges are shared challenges, and that we are eager to work together on solutions. Along with the seven EPA priorities I issued earlier this year, these six international priorities will guide our work during the months and years ahead.""/When EPA was established 40 years ago, Americans were concerned about lakes and rivers burning and air pollution in their own cities. In 2010, the environmental challenges are global, with pollutants from around the world ending up in America's backyards. EPA is working collaboratively with our international partners to protect human health and our shared environment./EPA's bilateral and multilateral partnerships have taken on new significance in the face of shared environmental and governance challenges, such as global climate change and improving children's environmental health outcomes. The agency's international priorities will guide EPA's collaboration with CEC and all international partners./The priorities include:/* Building Strong Environmental Institutions and Legal Structures. Countries need adequate governmental structures to enforce environmental protections. EPA will work with countries such as India, Ghana, Kenya and Brazil to develop and support the promotion of good governance, improve judicial and legal structures and design the regulatory systems necessary for effective environmental protection around the world./* Combating Climate Change by Limiting Pollutants. EPA has taken important steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home, but the global challenge of climate change requires a global solution. To make significant progress in reducing the effects of climate change, pollution must be cut throughout the world. EPA will promote global strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants such as methane from landfills and black carbon from cookstoves. These pollutants are damaging especially vulnerable regions such as the Himalayan glaciers and the Arctic./* Improving Air Quality. Much of the pollution that contributes to climate change and increases cases of asthma and other respiratory diseases is concentrated in urban areas, which are growing in the U.S. and around the world. EPA will work with organizations and local and national governments, such as Jakarta, Indonesia, to improve urban air quality in rapidly developing cities and communities./* Expanding Access to Clean Water. Water bodies in the United States and throughout the world remain imperiled. EPA will support global partners and regions, such as the Caribbean, in creating safe and efficient drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. The agency also will help in providing long-term, sustainable and high-quality drinking water and sanitation systems for overburdened and underserved communities such as those along the U.S.-Mexican border./* Reducing Exposure to Toxic Chemicals. Chemicals are prevalent in everything from food to baby bottles. As children develop, they are especially vulnerable to these chemicals, particularly mercury and lead. While EPA works closely with Congress to strengthen our chemical laws, the agency also will work with our global partners to provide protections for people and consistency for industry. In working with partners like the United Nations Environment Programme, EPA will strive to reduce or eliminate the impact of pesticides and other toxic chemicals./* Cleaning Up E-Waste. The electronics that provide us with convenience often end up discarded in developing countries where improper disposal can threaten local people and the environment. EPA recognizes this urgent concern and will work with international partners to address the issues of E-waste. In the near-term, EPA will focus on ways to improve the design, production, handling, reuse, recycling, exporting and disposal of electronics./The Commission for Environmental Cooperation was created by the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The group of U.S., Canadian, and Mexican environmental leaders has gathered to discuss the commission's strategic plan and establish priority projects for the next five years. Founded in 1994, the commission is an innovative organization that recognizes and acts to mitigate the impacts of cross-border commerce on the environment. Since then, EPA's cooperation with Mexico and other international partners has expanded to address the more complex role that environmental protection has played in ensuring our national security, facilitating global commerce, promoting sustainable development, and adapting to climate change Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

U.S. EPA funds over $2 million for Kern County clean air projects,"Karachi, Sept. 05 -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today announced more than $2 million in funding for air quality improvement projects in Kern County. The money, funded through the Diesel Emission Reduction Act (DERA), the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and other sources will result in cleaner air and improved public health. Since 2007, EPA has provided over $29 million to projects in California's San Joaquin Valley to improve air quality in our nation's agricultural hub. This funding is being used to retrofit and replace hundreds of diesel vehicles and equipment, including additional school buses, long-haul trucks, agricultural tractors and pumps, construction equipment and locomotives. These projects translate to over $146 million in public health benefits for people who live and work in the Valley./""The funding to Kern County Schools will reduce harmful tailpipe exhaust from school buses, so our children can breathe easier."" said Jared Blumenfeld, EPA's Regional Administrator for the Pacific Southwest Region. ""The San Joaquin Valley is burdened by some of the worst air quality in the country, and improving it is an urgent priority for EPA.""/""Given the Valley's enormous air-quality challenges, strong grant programs such as this are needed to complement our comprehensive regulatory program,"" said Seyed Sadredin, executive director of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. ""Incentive programs are critical to get the Valley into attainment as quickly as possible.""/EPA has awarded over $2 million to the Kern County superintendent of Schools, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, and to the California Air Resources Board to fund projects in Kern County, including replacing school buses, long-haul trucks, and agriculture and construction equipment./""Since 2007, $780,000 in EPA funds has been used to acquire buses powered by clean-burning, alternative fuels which benefit our students and community,"" said Kern County Superintendent of Schools Christine Lizardi Frazier./In total, these retrofits will result in the reduction of more than 1,800 tons of particulate matter, over 37,000 tons of nitrous oxide (NOx) and close to 3 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. In addition, because of the reduced particulate matter, public health will benefit, resulting in an estimated cost savings of over $146 million, from reduced medical needs, lost school and work days, and premature mortality./Diesel-powered vehicles are the workhorses of our economy, yet they produce emissions that pose a significant public health problem. Emissions from diesel engines - especially the microscopic soot known as ""particulate matter"" (PM) - can include effects on breathing and respiratory systems, damage to lung tissue, cancer, and premature death. The elderly, children, and people with chronic lung disease, influenza, or asthma, are especially sensitive to the effects of particulate matter./As part of the $29 million in clean diesel funding, $1.6 million is dedicated to accelerate the development and deployment of clean air technologies through the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District's Technology Advancement Program. Without new technologies the Valley will not achieve clean air. Demonstrating those technologies here will bring much needed green jobs to Kern County./In 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) which authorized $200 million per year for five years to support EPA in reducing diesel emissions. In 2009, Congress provided $300 million for DERA programs through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Since 2008, when DERA funds were first awarded, EPA's West Coast Collaborative has funded hundreds of projects, resulting in over $3 billion in public health benefits. DERA will expire in 2011 without Congressional reauthorizatio Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Respiratory diseases on rise,"HYDERABAD, Sept. 10 -- Respiratory diseases are on the rise in/Pakistan because of growing trend of smoking, particularly amongst young people./Epidemiological studies from other parts of the world have also/confirmed that asthma prevalence is increasing in the world especially/in the developing countries, eminent pulmonologist Prof. Dr. Rashid/Ahmad Khan said while talking to Right Vision News here on Wednesday./Treatment of Asthma cannot be cure but it can be effectively/treated and most of the patients with this condition live a normal/life in Pakistan, he added./According to Dr. Rashid Ahmad Khan smoking is currently responsible/for over 100,000 deaths annual./He said that asthma experts are emphasizing the need for increased/awareness of asthma and healthcare workers and governments should provide better treatment and control this common respiratory illness./He said that the nose and airways also trap large particles dust,/pollen, molds, bacteria, and chemical smoke, sprays and odors, which could cause serious injury to the lungs./Giving the possible reasons for the rise in asthma in Pakistan, he/said that the modern lifestyle, atmospheric pollution, smoking, increased use of carpets, were some of the reasons for the rise in asthma cases in this country./Regarding smoking he said that if any of the parents is a smoker/then their children have an increased risk of developing asthma./Dr Khan stressed that children should be protected from environment/tobacco smoke at all costs./He said that studies indicate that allergic reactions produce both/immediate and late phase (delayed) reactions. Research indicates that approximately half of the immediate allergic reactions to inhaled/allergens are followed by a late phase reaction./He said that cigarette smoke, air pollution, strong odors, aerosol/sprays and paint fumes are some of the substances which irritate the/tissues of the lungs and upper airways. The reaction (cough, wheeze,/phlegm, runny nose, watery eyes) produced by these irritants can be identical to those produced by allergens, he added./He further said that the emotional stress itself anxiety,/frustration and anger also can trigger asthma, but the asthmatic/condition precedes the emotional stress./Dr Rashid Khan suggested that treatment should be aimed at/controlling the asthma. When asthma is controlled, emotional stress/will be reduced and other emotional factors can then be dealt with/more effectively. Any chronic illness, especially if uncontrolled,/can have associated secondary psychological problems./He regretted that most people in Pakistan are not aware of the/serious dangers associated with smoking. ""Smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death in the country"", he said adding that through/will power and use of certain medicines most of the people can give up/this powerful addiction./Avoidance of allergenic and irritants are necessary in order to/avoid asthma symptoms. Regarding inhaler use, Dr. Rashid stressed that/the best way of delivering asthma medicines to the lungs is through inhalers, which are also are much easier than injections, tablets or/syrups. He said that the mainstay of the asthma treatment is in form/of inhalers (pump)./Inhalers are the safest way to deliver asthma medication to the/lungs, and these are not habit forming as commonly perceived by the/patients in this country."" It is wrong to think that inhalers are/given only in the advanced stage of the disease, he explained./He said that two type of the medicines can be delivered through/inhaler, the first is quick relief medicines known as bronchodilators/and the other group is called presenters and these are anti inflammatory agents which includes steroids.

Beautiful city with toxic air,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 17 -- City mandarins have spent billions in recent years on road building and beautifying the city but have done little to save its citizens from air pollution./Occasionally they issued warnings to smoke-belching factories and brick kilns in and around the city but just stop there./Perhaps the worst sufferers are the residents of I-9 and I-10 sectors who are forced to inhale the toxic smoke emitted by the steel furnaces and fine dust from marble factories in the nearby industrial area./Years ago the Capital Development Authority (CDA) announced a plan to shift the factory area outside the city limits but it continues to sit squeezed between the two residential sectors./When the issue was raised in the National Assembly recently, Environment Minister Hameedullah Jan Afridi informed the house that the CDA had not yet identified an alternative site./""Yes, it is a fact that smoke emitting from factories and brick kilns situated in the vicinity of Islamabad are causing air pollution,"" admitted the minister, replying in detail to a query about the pollution./However, despite strict monitoring and legal action by the ministry, the nine steel furnaces polluting the air in sectors I-9 and I-10 could not fully control their emissions, he said./Finally the ministry asked CDA to identify the alternative site to relocate the steel furnaces, but to no avail./A recent visit by a Pak-EPA monitoring team to the steel units found that the anti-pollution equipment installed by them were inefficient. Consequently, an environment protection tribunal fined two steel mills Rs50,000 each./Moreover, the Supreme Court, in its order of July 5, 2010, also directed CDA officials to cease operation of all steel mills till such time the online dust monitoring system was installed, said the minister./About brick kilns, he said, the ministry of environment had worked out a three-phase programme to relocate brick kilns from Islamabad./In the first phase, owners of 12 brick kilns located in red zone of the Islamabad airport were told to move out of the city./In the second phase, 20 brick kilns located between red zone and outer periphery of Islamabad Capital Territory will be taken out./In the third phase, 50 brick kilns falling on the fringes of the ICT will be targeted./In March 2009 Environmental Protection Order was served under Section 16 of the Environmental Protection Act 1997 on 12 brick kilns to stop their operations and move elsewhere within one month. Five brick kilns ceased operating while the remaining seven were referred to the environmental tribunal for trial./Meanwhile, construction of a model brick kiln unit based on Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln technology, was underway with the assistance of Swiss authorities./The Brick Kiln Association is keen to switch over to the new technology if proved a success Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"European Mobility Week 2010: 'Travel Smarter, Live Better'","Brussels, Sept. 17 -- European Commission has issued following Press Release:/From 16 to 22 September 2010, hundreds of towns and cities across Europe and beyond will take part in European Mobility Week, the biggest global event dedicated to sustainable urban travel. The 2010 campaign theme - Travel Smarter, Live Better - recognises the detrimental effects that current urban transport trends have on citizens' health. The aim is to encourage local authorities to promote alternatives to the car and highlight their positive impact on public health and the environment./Commission Vice-President Siim Kallas, responsible for transport, said: ""Most of the world's people live in urban areas. Most of our daily journeys start and end in urban areas, so we really depend on urban transport systems. We all suffer from the negative effects of urban transport such as congestion, accidents, poor air quality or noise, which clearly diminish our quality of life. These problems are not local matters but concern the EU as a whole. By working together, I am certain we can come up with innovative and sustainable ways to tackle the mobility problems in cities and give people more alternatives that would suit their needs.""/Environment Commissioner Janez Poto?nik said: ""Too many Europeans rely on their cars for short journeys. This is a concern: more driving means more accidents on the road and more air pollution. The theme of European Mobility Week 2010 - Travel Smarter, Live Better - should be a wake-up call to local authorities to think more about the impact of travel policies on the urban environment and quality of life and help people make smarter, healthier choices.""/Travel Smarter, Live Better/The heavy use of vehicles in cities, particularly private cars, creates many health challenges for citizens. These include injuries and fatalities due to road accidents, respiratory infections and diseases from air pollution, and chronic conditions such as obesity as well as cardiovascular diseases due to increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Other risk factors to physical and mental health include social isolation and community breakdown triggered by traffic congestion and reduced public space, and noise pollution leading to sleep disturbance and stress./Mobility Week is intended to change people's travel behaviour by offering environmentally-friendly alternatives to the car. The public get the chance to sample alternative forms of transport and local authorities have the opportunity to test-run new services and infrastructure. A lasting legacy is ensured as participating cities are encouraged to launch at least one permanent practical measure. The week culminates in a Car Free Day, officially designated as 22 September, when participating towns and cities set aside areas solely for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport./Mobility Week highlights for 2010/Among the many events being organised in Bologna, Italy, is an auction of second hand bicycles found abandoned around the city. The event is being managed by a university students' association in collaboration with the Municipality of Bologna. Lucky bidders will receive safety tools, brochures about road safety and other promotional material and gadgets./London's Smithfield Market is the venue for the capital's first City Cycle Style event on 17 September celebrating cycling as a fashionable form of transport. Participants are invited to turn up in their best cycling outfit and meet cycle fashion designers, try on outfits and sit on the saddles of some of the latest two wheel designs. Part of the money raised from the event will go to a charity which collects second-hand bikes and ships them to Africa./The city of Brno in the Czech Republic has developed a range of activities promoting Nordic walking, cycling and inline skating. The programme includes guided city tours, training and public exercises accompanied by open air music performances./Growing participation/Mobility week has seen a continuous increase in the number of cities taking part since its launch in 2002. Last year, a record 2,181 cities representing some 237 million people registered to take part. More than 4,440 permanent measures were introduced as a result of the week-long campaign. European Mobility Week's successful model is also increasingly being adopted by countries outside Europe including Argentina, Canada, Ecuador, Japan and Taiwan./European Mobility Week is coordinated by three non-governmental organisations specialising in urban environmental issues: Eurocities, Energie-Cites and Climate Alliance.

Health of SMI students suffering due to pollution,"KARACHI, Sept. 19 -- Principal of Sindh Madressatual Islam (SMI) College, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, has said that the health of students at his institute is suffering badly due to air and noise pollution created by heavy generators installed by a local bank in the vicinity./The bank is located on the opposite side of Talpur House Building of SMI on Hasrat Moohani Road. ""I wrote a letter to the president of the bank on September 16, 2010 where in I have mentioned that the noise and air pollution created by generators installed in their head office is badly affecting the health and education of young students,"" Dr Shaikh said./""In my letter I explained to them that noise pollution was leading to several ailments ranging from hearing loss to cardiovascular diseases. It was also causing annoyance, aggression, stress, irritability, sleep-loss, heartburn, indigestion, ulcers and high blood pressure,"" he added./He maintained that in addition to noise pollution, SMI students are also suffering from air pollution created by power generators. ""The smoke emanating from these generators directly enters in the classrooms. This smoke contains high content of hydrocarbons, which interfere with the oxygen intake in human beings, and carbon-mono-oxide, which displaces oxygen in red blood cells.

Residents of Haripur suffer noise pollution,"HARIPUR, Sept. 19 -- The residents of Haripur District are exposed to the increasing noise and air pollution caused by vehicular traffic especially the tri-wheelers. The noise from these vehicles is much beyond the permissible limit set under the National Environmental Quality Standards NEQS, medical experts and citizens say./The ever increasing number of vehicles, particularly old model buses, vans, Suzuki pick-ups, trucks and the two-stroke rickshaws are considered to be the major contributors to noise pollution./Despite the fact the government has banned the manufacturing and registration of two stroke tri-wheelers across the country, the rickshaw owners of Haripur enjoy immunity in connivance with the authorities concerned./With the increase in population and abandoning of the centuries-old means of transportation -- Tonga -- the three-wheelers made their way into the life of citizens; their number started increasing with every passing day posing health hazards to the residents./There are over 4,000 rickshaws of different models and designs plying on the city roads as compared to only 120 rickshaws which were allowed by the district administration in 1994. A good numbers of these tri-wheelers are those which were banned in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar./""These noise making rickshaws are plying on roads in connivance with the local motor vehicles examiners and traffic police as the rickshaw owners grease the palms of the officials of the two departments,"" alleged Mohsin, a passenger. He added that the wagons plying on Abbottabad-Haripur, Haripur-Rawalpindi, Haripur-Islamabad and Haripur-Ghazi roads were also in bad condition posing danger to the life of commuters./He asked the district administration to ban tri-wheelers and allow only the four-stroke new model rickshaws in Haripur.Although there was no mechanism available to measure the impinging noise created by vehicular traffic, some NGOs working on the pollution issues believed that it was much beyond the permissible limits set under the National Environmental Quality Standards NEQs. The noise level is higher than 120 decibel against the permissible limit of 85 decibels for new vehicles which is highly dangerous for the human health./Jehangir, a local auto mechanic, says that two-stroke engine produces noise and smoke and if we control the noise we have to use a specific sound control device, which resultantly affects the speed of a rickshaw./He said that the motor vehicle examiner has given sound control device but the rickshaw owners use it only at the time of getting their permits renewed and remove it thereafter./The noise pollution not only affects the hearing system but also other body systems, says Dr Gul Muhammad, an ENT specialist./Noise pollution causes psychological and physiological ailments like, blood pressure, hypertension, increase in heart beat and breathing rate and stress, sleep disorder and mental tension, he adds. Noise pollution affects inner ear and nerves the most./He said that the incident of hearing loss was on the rise in Haripur due to noise pollution. He claimed that about 30 per cent of the total patients come to the hospital with the complaint of hearing problems./He advised that in order to curb this problem the noise monitoring mechanism should be devised and laws be implemented in letter and spirit./Haripur's District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Hussain Khan, when contacted, said that owing to increasing public complaints about noise pollution, the traffic police were imposing heavy fines on the violators./We are taking action against pressure horns, motorbikes without silencers and all those vehicles which were in bad condition to minimise the noise pollution to a great extent in the days to come, he assured Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Rickshaw conversion project hits snags,"KARACHI, Sept. 19 -- A pilot project to convert 500 two-stroke rickshaws plying the city roads has hit snags after two companies that offered their services to fulfill the task failed to satisfy the Sindh Environment Protection agency (SEPA) experts regarding emissions from modified rickshaws, officials said./The Sindh government had assured the Sindh High Court (SHC)of converting all the noise- and smoke-emitting two-stroke rickshaws into four-stroke three-wheelers by June 30, 201, after the court had taken up the issue in a petition filed by a citizen./The authorities concerned, including the Sindh Transport Department could not start the pilot project after expiry of the court's deadline as a row between Transport and Finance departments over the modus operandi for spending Rs15 million obstructed the start of pilot project./Officials in the provincial Transport Department told media that the Sindh Chief Minister had approved Rs15 million for starting a pilot project by the start of this year and the money had to be spent on converting 500 two-stroke rickshaws into four-stroke ones./The Finance Department had not released the money to the Sindh Transport Department even by the end of June 2010, arguing that unless a committee of all stake-holders, including transport and environment officials, representatives of rickshaw and taxi owners association and others concerned was formed, they would not release the money./Later, Sindh Transport Department agreed to include experts from SEPA in the pilot project after former Chief Secretary of Sindh, Fazlur Rehman intervened and resolved the dispute between the two departments./The transport department then invited companies to the project in response to which two companies offered their services, Sindh Secretary, Transport Iqbal Dewan, told media on Friday./""But when the rickshaws, modified by these two local companies were sent for testing to the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, their experts said emissions from these rickshaws were still over and above the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS)"" the Secretary Transport disclosed./He said following the report from the environmental agency, offers of both the private agencies were rejected and now their department will re-advertise and call fresh bids./""So you can say that pilot project for conversion of rickshaws has not yet kicked off but it is not our fault any more as we have already started the process"" Dewan Iqbal said./He said that the tender notice for converting rickshaws into four-stroke vehicles was for local companies only and both the companies that applied for the job were local./An official of the Vehicular Emission Control Programme (VECOP) of SEPA confirmed to media that some rickshaws were brought to them for inspection and when they analysed their emissions, they were beyond NEQS./""Yes, we had analysed the rickshaws that were equipped with some parts to control their emissions but we found that noise and air pollution emissions from them were still not acceptable as they were way beyond NEQS, even though these are very lax in Pakistan"" the Deputy-Director, VECOP, Dr. Shafiq said./It is worth mentioning here that under the pilot project, half of the cost for converting a worn-out two-stroke rickshaw would be borne by its owner while the remaining would be provided as subsidy by the government./On the other hand, officials in the Sindh Environment Department claimed that although the job of converting rickshaws into environment-friendly vehicles could be done effectively by environment experts associated with them, their department deliberately avoided assuming the responsibility./""Environment Department has got the experts who can make these faulty and pollution-generating rickshaws into/environment-friendly vehicles without changing their engines. India and Thailand have done so and it is more cost-effective than changing their engines,"" an official informed./The official said that lack of will on the part of high-ups of the Sindh government was delaying the process of converting these rickshaws into environment-friendly vehicles, asking, if India, Thailand and even Sri Lanka could do this, why could we in Pakistan not./According to statistics of Sindh Transport Department, more than 60,000 two-stroke rickshaws are plying in Sindh, of which over 42,000 are plying on Karachi roads alone./The number of recently introduced four-stroke CNG-fueled rickshaws is still not more than 5,000 in the entire province./Mechanical engineers and auto-mechanics say that technology through which the engines of two-stroke rickshaws could be modified in such a way that they become environment-friendly, was fully available./""On the other hand, converting a two-stroke engine into four-stroke is nearly impossible,"" an expert sai Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Industries should have water treatment plants,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 24 -- Minister for Environment Hameedullah Jan Afridi has warned all industrial sector organisations that are becoming a source of industrial waste to initiate safety measures and ensure installation of treatment plants otherwise strict legal action would be taken against them./He issued these directives while chairing a meeting of environment ministry officials to review the main causes of environmental degradation and take steps to reduce it to protect natural environment./He directed the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) to take action against those industrial organisations that are releasing dangerous smoke without proper treatment and not taking steps to stop inclusion of sewage disposal into clean drinking water. ""Legal action would also be taken against all those concerned government officials who have failed to perform the duties in implementing environmental laws,"" he said. The minister said water and air polluters are national 'culprits' and they would be treated under the law, adding that special monitoring cell has been constituted to monitor industrial organisations./He appealed to citizens to identify those industrial units that are disposing off industrial waste in clean drinking water and the government would ensure legal action against them./Hameedullah Jan Afridi said that environmental protection is the responsibility of every citizen and the environment ministry is taking concrete measures in this context with the participation of general public. He emphasised on different environmental protection and welfare organisations not to depend on just organising seminars and workshops, but also promote outdoor activities while visiting congested cities, industrial zones and business sectors and critically analyse environmental issues, likewise identify those segments which are working against environmental laws./Moreover he emphasised on the need for highlighting environmental issues among different segments of society./He said that effective and comprehensive awareness campaign should be started with involvement of students and public-private sector.

Rickshaws invade Rawalpindi,"RAWALPINDI, Oct. 12 -- There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of auto-rickshaws in the garrison city of Rawalpindi where the number of rickshaws has swelled to over 2,800./Unlike in Islamabad where rickshaws are banned, its sister city Rawalpindi is a 'rickshaws market'. The noisy tri-cycle vehicle has become a hallmark of the city and its noise can be heard in almost every street./Amazingly there are no apparent rules regulating the operation of these rickshaws. A rickshaw owner does not need a license, a route permit or even a fitness certificate from the concerned Regional Transport Authority (RTA) to operate. Little wonder the smoke-emitting rickshaws have become a cause of the deteriorating environment in the city./Secretary RTA, Syed Raza, tells Right Vision News that the Punjab government has not provided them any rules regarding issuance of permits to rickshaw operators or any guidelines about imposition of penalty on rickshaws owners./""Thousands of rickshaws ply in the city without any license and there is no mechanism to take action against them,"" he said./The environment office of the district administration has so far not impounded or imposed penalty on a single rickshaw for noise or air pollution./Inhabitants in the residential areas often complain that the noisy vehicles are a nuisance. Many residents have also voiced concern about the parking of rickshaw vehicles in their streets. But their complaints have gone in vain./""Rickshaws are parked in long queues in my street despite our objection. The rickshaw owners pay no heed to our reservations and park their vehicles against our will,"" Ali Hussain, a resident of Dhoke Kashmirian, complained./""It seems as if the rickshaw owners pay charges for parking their vehicles here.

Possibility of more floods in future can not be ruled out: says environment experts,"PESHAWAR, Oct. 14 -- Haphazard mushrooming of industries, growing population, increase in carbon emission has resulted in climate change/and the recent devastating floods that hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa along other parts of the country./The experts have predicted more floods, droughts, and increase in duration of rainy and dry spells in future in view of the climate change in the region./The adverse effects of climate change have started emerging in the country with extended summers and extreme weather conditions. The possibility of recurrence of recent floods caused by rising temperatures/and global warming could not be ruled out./Talking to Right Vision News Director General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environment Protection Agency (EPA), Dr. M. Bashir Khan said that increasing/population, vehicles, industries and cutting of forests and trees/contribute towards carbon emission and enhancing green house gases that/in turn was affecting our environment./He said that eco balance was disturbed due to excessive/deforestation, increase in use of vehicles and extended towns that are developed to cater to the residential needs of the ever increasing population./Fifty Years from now Charsadda and Nowshera could be one city with growing markets and houses leaving no space for vegetation and trees,/he added./He said that effects of global warming were visible in different/parts of the world like melting of ice bergs in Iceland and China and/fire eruption in forests of Russia. Apart from hitting Pakistan,/flash floods have also been reported in China, Indonesia, Vietnam and/India./Describing different types of pollution, he said that pollution/was of various types including air, water, noise and solid waste/pollution. In Pakistan air pollution is caused by stationary and mobile sources and deforestation./Air pollution is caused by smoke from factories, waste materials, mobile sources including motor vehicles and deforestation, he added./The smoke which emerges from the chimneys of factories and vehicles/contain sulpher dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon mono oxide and other poisonous gases that are extremely hazardous for health./Similarly, water pollution is caused by sewage and industrial/discharge and leads to diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid and/hepatitis. Solid waste pollution was caused by municipal waste,/industrial and hospital waste./Dr. Bashir said that sources of noise pollution are vehicle noise, pressure horns, aircraft, rail noise and unwanted noise produced by factories./Responding to effects of recent floods on soil fertility, DG Environment said that certain quantity of river silt increases fertility/of land but increase in that quantity could create adverse effects making the land unfit for cultivation./It would be quite sometime before the effects of floods could be reversed in Nowshera, Charsadda, D.I. Khan and other flood hit areas, he maintained./He said that Environment Protection Agency has proposed/establishment of Climate Change Study Center (CCSC) and the project has/been included in 2010 11 ADP of KPK./With regard to monitoring of pollution level in the Provincial/capital, he said that Continuous Air Monitoring System has been/installed in the capital city that gives 24 hours data of the level of pollution. Moreover, we have other equipment that could monitor pollution/in other areas./He said that the level of pollution was well with in the WHO range in KPK adding that the job of EPA was environmental policing besides raising awareness and training on environment issues./Dr. Bashir said that EPA has the authority to prosecute companies, industries that do not abide by the rules of the agency and are hazardous for climate. So far we have prosecuted 478 companies including government departments and individuals./Moreover, he added that the agency also impose heavy fines besides sending the violators under section 16 behind the bars for up to two/years./He said that inspectors have been sent to flood hit areas to asses/the aftermath of the devastating floods in the affected areas. They would provide comprehensive report on level of water pollution and collecting/of solid waste by TMAs./The EPA inspectors would carry out detailed analysis of the residue/of DDT and transformer oil leakage in Nowshera, he said, adding that DDT/and transformer oil were extremely toxic and can be fatal if consumed./Dr. Bashir said that we have prosecuted 4 TMAs of the provincial capital for collecting solid waste in their respective areas./He said that EPA also held regular seminars and training workshops with civil society, media men and other relevant departments to raise/their knowledge about environment related issues./The EPA teaching staff also delivers lectures on climate issues at various schools of the province, he told./The agency also worked out system for safe disposal of industrial/waste including marble and chips industries that ultimately lands in/lakes, rivers and oceans making them unsafe for human consumption. These industries installed plants for treating industrial waste before it is carried into rivers and lakes./To reduce environmental pollution it is necessary to produce/awareness among the masses, he said, adding that the environment subject should be incorporated in the syllabus./We need education policy in which the educationists greatly emphasize on environment, its problems and solutions./Above all we need to increase our forest cover and plant trees and plants to counter the adverse affects of global warming and provide/better world to our coming generations, he concluded Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Environment and Natural Resources Management,"Karachi, Oct. 18 -- For the last 30 years, the International Development Association (IDA) has contributed substantially to policy reforms and institution building in environmental and natural resources management in the lowest income countries. IDA has provided important assistance in capacity building and investment for pollution management and conservation of key ecosystems. IDA has served a dual role of funding and leveraging additional funds to achieve this purpose. Challenge The world today faces an array of both persisting and new environmental challenges. Countries are dealing with local challenges such as, natural resource degradation and depletion, deterioration of local air and water quality, and increase in solid and hazardous waste, all of which are likely to be exacerbated by expected rapid urbanization and economic growth./The world also faces global challenges such as loss of biodiversity, deteriorating health of oceans, and climate change. Compared to other countries, IDA countries consistently struggle the most with these environmental challenges. Over the past twenty years, IDA countries experienced the highest rate of deforestation, losing an average of almost 50,000 sq km of forest area annually. The level of urban air pollution in IDA countries is among the highest, and the access to freshwater resources is among the lowest./Households, and particularly small children and women, remain exposed to very high levels of indoor smoke since the share of traditional fuels in total energy is still extraordinarily high in IDA countries (66 percent in 2007, compared to 9 percent in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries). IDA at Work Environment and Natural Resources Management 2 Though many environmental challenges of the past decade will persist into the next, recent developments-such as the energy, food price, and financial crises, and the heightened and widespread awareness of the risks to development posed by climate change-have substantially changed the context in which IDA operates and requires a fresh approach to environmental sustainability./Approach Building on the 2001 Environment Strategy of the World Bank, the new Environment Strategy for the World Bank Group (WBG) aims at ""Greening Development"" by transforming growth paths, leveraging natural resources for growth and poverty reduction, and managing the environmental risks to growth and development. IDA provides a unique platform for building growth paths that are environmentally sustainable and in which environmental and economic risks are minimized./This is possible through IDA's country-based development platform and by: ??mainstreaming environment into all relevant development sectors through credits and analytical work; ??convening stakeholders within and outside the national context to form partnerships; ??allocating significant financial resources as demonstrated by a lending volume of about US$5.2 billion in environmental and natural resources projects in the past decade; ??coordinating assistance on environment with the Global Environment Facility (GEF), bilateral agencies, and foundations; ??making available the largest contingent of experts in the world with an increasing presence in field offices; and ??developing global knowledge on a broad range of topics that help clients learn from each other./A major area of engagement for IDA is its work to improve environmental and natural resources governance through development policy operations (DPO). In Ghana for example, where alarmingly high rates of natural resource and environment depletion undermine the prospects for sustained growth, a programmatic DPO series (IDA US$50 million) addresses governance issues in key sectors and aims to strengthen environmental management. Results Achieved with IDA Support Through credits and analytical work, IDA has contributed to the increasing integration of environmental issues in national development strategies, and in the country assistance strategies the World Bank develops with client countries. IDA's support for investment in environment and natural resource management over the last decade has helped in mitigating air pollution in urban and industrial areas, the provision of cleaner and more reliable supplies of water, making land management more sustainable, dealing with climate change, protecting biodiversity and building environmental institutions. Independent evaluations have shown that IDA lending has been delivered effectively./The following projects exemplify what has been achieved with IDA financing: ??In the India Karnataka Watershed Development Project (IDA US$100 million), approved in 2001 and completed in 2009, IDA played a key role in helping the government 3 design a project to test new participatory approaches for integrated watershed planning and implementation. The new model also draws in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as active partners. Results include soil and water conservation works completed on over 200,000 hectares (ha), improving average crop yields by about 24 percent and broadening crop diversity./The Bosnia and Herzegovina Solid Waste Projects 1 & 2 (IDA US$66 million total), approved respectively in 2002 and 2008, target people's exposure to garbage in open dumps, which is one of the most serious public health risks in urban areas. The first project focused on regional landfills, safe disposal methods, and landfill rehabilitation. It also emphasized public awareness, training of sector staff, extending waste collection to areas not serviced, and the development of business plans. With six regional landfills established by the end of the first project in 2009, almost half of the country's population is benefiting./The second project supports the construction of six new sanitary landfills. Expected impacts include an improved disposal management system and enhanced coverage of formal waste management services, improved ground water quality at disposal sites, higher citizen satisfaction with waste management services, and an increased cost recovery rate of participating utilities. ??The Nepal Power Development Project (IDA US$9.3 million), launched in 2003, features a Micro-Hydro Village Electrification component that has successfully increased rural access to renewable energy sources and formed a solid foundation for scaling up impact. Steady expansion of communitymanaged micro-hydro systems has provided coverage to about 40,000 households in 40 target districts with potential for this form of power generation./These systems energize sustainable rural development by creating jobs, protecting the environment, and lighting up households for the first time. The project has also reduced environmental stress, as the micro-hydro replacement of biomass burning created a trend away from deforestation and toward lower carbon emissions. It has also created healthier households, as clean electricity allowed families to replace wood fires for cooking and lighting in traditional houses without proper ventilation, benefitting women and children in particular. In addition to lending, IDA has prepared an average of 36 Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) a year over the past three years, focused on environment and natural resources management. Among these, Country Environmental Analyses (CEA) have provided the analytical basis to integrate environmental considerations into projects and programs the Bank offers to support developing countries./Completed or ongoing CEAs in fiscal year 2010, included those for Benin, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Nicaragua, India, Sri Lanka, and Timor-Leste. Similarly, Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) provide a framework for integrating environmental issues in sector policies. In 2010, the World Bank completed a pilot program to test and promote policy SEAs that apply institution-centered SEA approaches in sector reform; the pilots were conducted for the most part in IDA countries (Kenya, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh, West Africa and Malawi), as well as China. 4 IDA Financing and Other Support Over the past decade, IDA has lent some US$5.2 billion to support investment in environment and natural resource management (ENRM)./A sizable portion (15 percent) of this portfolio allocates financial resources to environmental policy and institutions, indicating IDA's commitment to improving governance and strengthening environmental policy and natural resource management. In terms of areas of focus, IDA credits have been directed in large part to water resources management (29 percent) and pollution management and environmental health (22 percent). In addition to funding ENRM projects directly, IDA has leveraged additional funds through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other agencies and organizations. Specifically, GEF provides grants to IDA countries to address global environmental issues while supporting national sustainable development initiatives. Partners IDA borrower countries take a leadership role in preparing strategies that establish the priorities for donor support. Development programs are most successful when the borrower country takes ownership of the programs Figure 1. IDA Commitments for Environment and Natural Resources Management (ENRM) by Sub-theme, FY2001-2010 (US$ million) Source: World Bank Business Warehouse. Biodiversity $172 (3%) Climate change $523 (10%) Environmental policies and institutions $784 (15%) Land administration and management $681 (13%) Pollution management and environmental health $1,109 (22%) Water resource management $1,497 (29%) Other environment and natural resources management $411 (8%) 5 through deep involvement in their design and execution./In each country, IDA works with international and local development partners to ensure that the strategy is carried out in a coherent way and that IDA focuses on areas where it has comparative advantage. IDA also provides a broad-based financing platform. With respect to environmental sustainability, it mobilizes additional financial resources and coordinates assistance with the GEF, bilateral agencies, and foundations. IDA also works closely with environmental nongovernmental organizations through partnerships and implementation agreements. Moving Forward The 2010 Environment Strategy builds on the 2001 Strategy's goal of promoting environmental improvements as a fundamental element of development and poverty reduction strategies and actions. The goal of the new WBG Environment Strategy is to work with developing country partners to address new and persistent environmental challenges while working towards sustainable economic growth and poverty eradication, which are particularly relevant for IDA countries. This also entails increasing the environmental sustainability of the World Bank Group portfolio. The new Strategy has three components:/(i) Transforming growth paths;/(ii) Leveraging natural resources for growth and poverty reduction; and/(iii) Managing the environmental risks to growth and development. Transforming growth paths implies accelerating the diffusion of less environmentally harmful technologies in sectors such a transport, energy, and water management. The second component recognizes that natural resources are a form of capital, just like produced, human, and social capital, and thus contribute to well being. Natural resources supply ecosystem services, such as water flow regulation, pollution buffering, carbon sinks, habitat for commercially important species, and pollination, which underpin much economic activity. Natural assets also directly provide economic goods such as crops, fish, water, hydropower, and biomass fuels. Maintaining these assets is therefore essential for sustained economic growth. Finally, the third component recognizes the need to make growth and development resilient to environmental risks. Pathogens in natural media-air, water and soil-are a major contributor to the burden of disease in developing countries, with consequent negative impacts on labor productivity. Likewise, climate change threatens to derail development and progress in the achievement of the MDGs./Growth will need to be along a path that increases climate resilience. Achieving results through the implementation of the new Strategy will require working with countries without a preconceived notion about priorities and actions borrowers should take to pursue their environmental sustainability and development targets. IDA and the WBG are engaged with clients, civil societies, international organization and the public in general on a consultation effort to understand how to best serve the needs of our partner countries Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Experts lament smoke-filled environment,"KARACHI, Oct. 19 -- Top experts have underscored the need to reduce smoke and air pollution to a significant level so as to control lethal diseases including heart strokes, cancer and asthma./Provincial Coordinator People's Primary Health Initiatives (PPHI) and Adviser to Sindh Chief Minister for Information Sharmila Farooqui said that smoke and air pollution mostly caused by smoke-emitting vehicles, industries and other man-made sources was a growing concern because it increased the risk of heart diseases, blood pressure, cancer, asthma and other diseases among the people./""Risk of heart disease from air pollution is compounded because of long-term exposure. Toxins in the air are thought to produce inflammation that can lead to heart disease and increase risk of a second heart attack,"" she said./Farooqui said that air pollution was composed of many environmental factors. ""They include carbon monoxide, nitrates, sulphur dioxide, ozone, lead, secondhand tobacco smoke and particulate matter./""Particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, is composed of solid and liquid particles within the air. It can be generated from vehicle emissions, tyre fragmentation and road dust, power generation and industrial combustion, smelting and other metal processing, construction and demolition activities, residential wood burning, windblown soil, pollens, moulds, forest fires, volcanic emissions and sea spray"". These particles vary considerably in size, composition and origin and are very dangerous for human health, she said./She said, ""We have attached top priority to the health sector by increasing budgets and we are also joining hands with civil society organisations for ensuring good health to the citizens""./ENT Surgeon of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and Chairman Arts Council Health Committee Dr Qasir Sajjad said that the big reason of air pollution was the unfit vehicles plying on the roads of the city. He said that traffic smoke was hazardous to human health. He said that air pollution was rising day by day, causing lung cancer, tuberculosis and other diseases among the people./Dr Sajjad said that traffic smoke left negative effect especially on the mental health of school-going children, adding it had also affected the throats of the people. He said that more than 0.1 million cigarette smokers die every year in the country while millions of people suffer from it. He said that the traffic police should not allow smoke emitting vehicles including rickshaws, taxis and other faulty vehicles on roads./Chest Specialist of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre Dr Nadeem Rizvi said that patients of various diseases were increasing every year in the country due to air, smoke and other environmental pollutions. He said that the citizens were vulnerable to smoke emitted by vehicles in case of maintaining health./Dr Rizvi said that more than 25,000 patients of chest diseases were reported in Jinnah Hospital every year, out of which 50 per cent suffer from asthma. He said that Nicotine was the most addict substance in tobacco and smoke, giving rise to different health problems such as cancer, heart attack, regular cough and others. He said that every type of smoke was hazardous to human health. He said that according to the Pakistan Chest Society, 0.6 million people suffered from cigarette smoking./In-charge Physiology Department JPMC Dr Iqbal Afridi said that different chemicals were emitted by smoke-emitting vehicles which left the negative impacts on the human health. He said that noise and vehicle smoke strike hearing of the people and caused various diseases./He said that traffic jams on the roads directly affected the health of the commuters, causing irritation, mental problems and other diseases among them. He advised the angry people to observe tolerance in order to overpower their anger. He asked the aged people and children to remain away from the vehicles smoke, adding they should put a piece of cloth on their mouth while travelling on the busy roads./Chest Specialist Lyari General Hospital Dr Mehboob Ali Baloch said that effluents of industries were causing air and environmental pollution, inducing life-threatening diseases./He said that vegetables were being cultivated by the contaminated water of the industries which were the factors of fatal and chronic diseases including cancer and tuberculosis. He said that dozens of people with various diseases caused by pollution were being reported in the Lyari General Hospital. Most of them were children, he added./In-charge cardiovascular diseases, Civil Hospital Karachi Prof. Khalida Soomro said that air and environmental pollution directly affected the heart and lungs. She asked the heart patients to adopt precautionary measures./Prof. Soomro said that millions of people were suffering from poor air quality caused by traffic smoke. She said that the government should not allow the smoke emitting vehicles on the roads so that the people could be saved from the fatal diseases like cancer, tuberculosis and other diseases./Former Secretary General Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Dr Habib-ur-Rehman said that the PMA had been calling for the last 10 years to impose ban on plying of unfit vehicles on the roads but due to the mafia tactics, it could not be ensured as yet. He said that for the sake of the citizens' health, various departments of the government including transport, health and environment could impose the ban on plying of unfit vehicles./He said that the PMA had raised their voice against the pollution at every channel but the rulers should also pay attention towards the health of their citizens to avoid the mortality rate.

Adoption can help reduce pollution,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 19 -- Adoption of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in brick industry can not only help reduce air pollution, but also provide a normal and respectful life to thousands of labourers, who are social victims of unethical practices and outdated system based on injustice and inequality./The environmentalists were of the view that the initiative now taken by the environment ministry through Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) to remove 95 brick kilns operating in the capital city and provide alternative business opportunities to owners under CDM mechanism can very well pave the way for a countrywide campaign that can effectively help reduce carbon emission in the air and give better living conditions for mostly poor labourers./According to official data the environment ministry has offered owners of brick kilns to shun outdated methods and adopt CDM measures that would help them establish their business at alternative locations on modern lines without posing any threat to the natural environment./Fauzia Minallah, an environmentalist, who closely studied the phenomenon of brick kilns, told this correspondent, if owners shun old practices and manufacture industry material with low level of carbon emission under CDM mechanism then they would be able to earn carbon credits and sell these out in the international market./The environment ministry is also evaluating a proposal in which it can also offer owners a community benefit plan to ensure social improvement for the employees in the brick making sector by making first aid room, developing sanitary facilities and improving safety methods./A research report available with the environment ministry stated that the process of brick making has undergone a major shift in many countries where wet clay and pulverized coal are mixed together and bricks are dried up in a drying chamber using waste heat from the firing chamber. The dried bricks are loaded into the firing chamber. The combined use of waste heat and the internal combustion of coal reduce consumption per brick and emission of greenhouse gases./It said burning of coal in brick kilns results in release of several air pollutants such as Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphurdioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter./Dr. Imdad Hussain, a medical practitioner at Holy Family Hospital, said very fine particulate matters emitted from brick kilns are amongst the most harmful air pollutants. When inhaled, these particles evade the respiratory system's natural defence and lodge deep in the lungs and cause asthma, aggravate bronchitis and other respiratory diseases as well as reduce the body's ability to fight infections./He said other chemicals commonly found in brick kilns smoke is Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHC) that may cause short-term symptoms such as eye irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Long-term exposure to PAHC may cause cataracts, damage to kidney, liver and even cancer./It is expected that removal of brick kilns from vicinity of the capital city would greatly help reduce air pollution that once reached to 'severe' level this year in summer, just one step behind from 'hazardous' level. The data about air pollution was last updated by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) on 19th July this year and at that time the air index showed 'good' level. But after that no official data is available in this regard./Fauzia Minallah said that the government should initiate a national level campaign to make owners of brick kilns aware about how they can perform better in terms of earning and profit besides contributing in the efforts to protect natural environment from greenhouse gase Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Trash heaps threat lives,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 19 -- The residents of slum area of twin cities are an easy prey to spread of different diseases due to the improper dumping of solid waste./Trash of garbage in different areas, particularly Sohan, Faizabad, Satellite Town, Awan Town, Iqbal Town, and Alnoor Colony, Muslim Town, Model Town Adiala road and other areas of Rawalpindi and some areas of Islamabad are providing a habitat to epidemic carriers such as flies and other kinds of insects./Most of the waste generated in these areas remains dumped either on streets or around empty plots.The residents are not only facing foul smell from the garbage heaps but also air pollution generated by burning of waste plastic bags and other material, as setting solid waste on fire has become a common practice of the people and sanitary workers. ""The municipal authorities are not doing their duty properly for the last several years,"" complained Muhammad Umair, a resident of Muslim Town./He said people in his area dispose of solid waste at vacant plots and huge piles of trash could be seen everywhere. ""This is a source of constant botheration for residents as it causes a lot of trouble,"" he added. ""The smell at some places is disturbing that pedestrians cannot pass without covering their nose./Many residents of the area said that as no sanitary worker comes to their area, they hired services of private workers to collect solid waste on daily basis.He said he was living in the area for last many years and throughout this period he had never seen proper disposal of waste and garbage./Usman Ali, a resident of Alnoor Colony said the issue of waste disposal requires immediate attention of the authorities. ""A long term sustainable approach should be adopted to solve the problem"".Health experts have advised people to desist from setting fire to grass and garbage in residential areas because chemical fumes are dangerous for their health./Dr. Hasnain Ali Johar told Right Vision News that a huge chunk of garbage that is dumped particularly at the landfill sites contains plastic. This contains a compound called phthalate. ""The burning of this component fumes out dioxin, which is dangerous,"" he added. He added that 0.1 per cent of poisonous garbage contains heavy metals like chromium, iron, copper, mercury and some organic components like phinolics. He said it acts as slow poison on the human body.

Asthma treatable but not fully curable: Dr. Rashid,"HYDERABAD, Oct. 22 -- Treatment of Asthma cannot be a cure but/it can be effectively treated and most of patients with this condition/live a normal life in Pakistan./This was stated eminent pulmonologist Professor Dr. Rashid Ahmad/Khan, while talking here on Wednesday./He said that the respiratory diseases are on the rise in Pakistan/because of the growing trend of smoking, particularly among young/people. He further stated that epidemiological studies from other/parts of the world have also confirmed that asthma prevalence is/increasing in the world especially in the developing countries./According to Dr. Rashid Ahmad Khan smoking is currently responsible/for more than 100,000 deaths annually./Dr. Rashid Khan said that asthma experts are emphasising the need/for increased awareness of asthma and healthcare workers and governments should provide better treatment and control this common respiratory/illness./He said that the nose and airways also trap large particles of/dust, pollen, molds, bacteria, and chemical smoke, sprays and odours,/which could cause serious injury to the lungs./Giving possible reasons for the rise in asthma in Pakistan, he/said that the modern lifestyle, atmospheric pollution, smoking,/increased use of carpets, were some of the reasons for the rise in/asthma cases in this country./Regarding smoking he said that if any of the parents is a smoker/then their children have an increased risk of developing asthma./Dr. Khan stressed that children should be protected from environment/and tobacco smoke at all costs./He said that cigarette smoke, air pollution, strong odours,/aerosol sprays and paint fumes are some of the substances which irritate/the tissues of the lungs and upper airways. The reaction (cough, wheeze,/phlegm, runny nose, watery eyes) produced by these irritants can be/identical to those produced by allergens, he added./Dr. Rashid Khan suggested that the treatment should be aimed at/controlling the asthma. When asthma is controlled, emotional stress will/be reduced and other emotional factors can then be dealt with more/effectively, he said./Any chronic illness, especially if uncontrolled, can have/associated secondary psychological problems. More severe psychological/problems require a specialist to help the child and his or her family,/he added./He regretted that most people in Pakistan are not aware of the/serious dangers associated with smoking./""Smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death in the/country,"" he said adding that through will power and use of certain/medicines most of the people can give up this powerful addiction./Dr. Khan said that almost 20 percent of the country's children/and 10 percent of adults in the country suffer from asthma, but/unfortunately most patients do not receive optimal treatment./""People need not suffer from this condition because with modern/treatment almost all asthma patients can lead a normal life"", he/explained./Avoidance of allergenics and irritants are necessary in order to/avoid asthma symptoms. Avoidance to allergen may not always be possible/because most patients do not know to which agent they are allergic, he/said./Regarding inhaler use, Dr. Rashid stressed that the best way of/delivering asthma medicines to the lungs is through inhalers, which are/also are much easier than injections, tablets or syrups./He said that the mainstay of the asthma treatment is in the form/of inhalers (pump). Inhalers are the safest way to deliver asthma/medication to the lungs and these are not habit forming as commonly/perceived by the patients in this country./""It is wrong to think that inhalers are given only in the advanced/stage of the disease,"" he explained./He said that two types of medicines can be delivered through/an inhaler. The first is quick relief medicines known as bronchodilators/and the other group is called presenters and these are anti inflammatory/agents which includes steroids. He said that these medicines when taken/regularly prevent asthma attacks./Dispelling fears about the use of steroids, he said that steroid/taken in the inhaled form are very safe and currently the best available/medicines for the prevention of asthma attacks./He suggested the asthma patients to eat a balanced diet./The pulmonologist advised that any person suffering from a cough/and chest pain for more than three weeks or fever for over two weeks/or presenting unexplained weight loss or blood stained sputum, must/consult an expert for diagnosis Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

States facing extreme risks from climate change,"Karachi, Nov. 07 -- BANGLADESH happens to be the world's most climate-vulnerable nation, according to a British-based global risks advisory firm, Maplecroft, whose survey of 170 nations released on October 20 lists 16 countries being at ""extreme risk"" from climate change during the next 30 years and that their economies will suffer most if adaptation not undertaken./Of the 16 countries, five are from South Asia, with Bangladesh and India in first and second places, Nepal in fourth, Afghanistan in eighth and Pakistan at 16th place. Bangladesh is rated the worst because of a double whammy. It has the highest risk of drought and the highest risk of flooding. Only this month (October 2010) 500,000 people were driven from their homes by flood waters created by storms./On September 21, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed fears of displacement of about 30 million people in her country because of climate change effects. They would be moving north in a region with the highest density of population in the world, leading to formidable social and even cross-border problems, according to her. But what is so surprising is the fact that despite the country's plethora of problems, its economy is forecast to grow 5.4 per cent in 2010 by the IMF/India, ranked 2nd, is already one of the world's emerging economies, but climate vulnerability could still adversely affect the country's appeal as a destination for foreign investment in coming decades. Almost all regions in India are extremely prone to climate change effects. Then, unbearable population pressure, acute poverty, poor health and dependence on agriculture make India highly unpredictable in terms of consequences./Meanwhile, speaking at the Asia Society on September 25 in New York, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that India and Pakistan were the most natural partners on issues of climate change. ""We share water...the Himalayan glaciers. If they (India) get affected...we both get affected,"" he added. He advocated the need for overcoming the ""trust deficit"" so that the region could benefit from mutual cooperation in combating climate change, terrorism and poverty./Pakistan's national policy on climate change which will include incentives for increasing forest acreage is in final stage of its preparation. The government has involved all the stakeholders including farmers, foresters and the private sector in its formulation. President Zardari while informing Pakistan's position to chairman of UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPCC) Dr R. K. Pachauri, who was here last week in connection with a climate conference in Islamabad, suggested cooperative relationship between institutions in Pakistan and Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) for combating climate change in the two countries./Climate change is often seen as a development issue, Zardari says, but for developing countries like Pakistan, it is a matter of survival because extreme weather pattern threatens availability of food, water, energy and health. It poses a direct and serious threat to sustainable development in our part of the world. Although Pakistan contributes too little to global emissions, yet it faces severe climate change impacts such as sea level rise, melting of glaciers and droughts and floods besides stress on agriculture. The rise of deadly monsoons this year was a new but terrible development for Pakistan./Prime Minister Gilani ,while speaking at the climate conference on October 21, said climate change, with all its severity and unpredictability, has become a hard reality to live with for Pakistani population. The massive devastation caused by the recent floods reconfirms the country's extreme vulnerability to the adverse impact of climate change./Pakistan, hence, has set eyes on a substantive outcome at United Nation Climate Change Conference (COP16), being held in Cancun in December. It should pave the way for a consensus that covers an overall commitment to reduce emissions by the developed countries, support for developing countries for mitigation actions, improving the governance and creation of a new global climate change fund./Among the regions likely to suffer most, South Asia is the most vulnerable because of changes in weather patterns that resulted in natural calamities such as floods in Pakistan and Bangladesh this year. Maplecroft's Climate Change Vulnerability Index is seen as a guide for strategic investment and policymaking. Its findings are in consonance with the contents of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report which also identified South Asia as the most vulnerable region./Sir Nicholas Stern, the eminent climatologist, had advised South Asian countries in 2007 to brace for combating the effects of global warming, even as they work to combat the human causes of climate change. He had warned South Asians that they would get torrents during the wet season and dry rivers in the dry season. So they would get a combination of flood and drought./The barometer of Maplecroft's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is based on 42 social, economic and environmental factors to assess a nation's vulnerabilities across three core areas. These are: firstly, exposure to climate-related natural disasters and sea-level rise; secondly, human sensitivity in terms of population patterns, development, dependence on agricultural; thirdly, future vulnerability by considering the adaptive capacity of a country's government and infrastructure to combat climate change./The index rates 16 countries as ""extreme risk,"" with five from South Asia and the sixth, Sri Lanka (34), is rated ""high risk."" Other ""extreme risk"" include: Madagascar (3), Mozambique (5), Philippines (6), Haiti (7), Zimbabwe (9), Myanmar (10), Ethiopia (11), Cambodia (12), Vietnam (13), Thailand (14) and Malawi (15). Africa is home to 12 out of the 25 countries most at risk./There are 11 countries considered ""low risk"", with Norway (170), Finland (169), Iceland (168), Ireland (167), Sweden (166) and Denmark (165) performing the best. However, Russia (117), the US (129), Germany (131), France (133) and the UK (138) are all rated as 'medium risk' countries, whilst China (49), Brazil (81) and Japan (86) feature in the ""high risk"" category./The urgency of addressing Pakistan's environmental problems has probably never been greater. Conservative estimates suggest that environmental degradation costs the country at least six per cent of GDP, or about Rs365 billion per year. The most significant causes identified and cost estimated in a 2006 World Bank report on Pakistan are (1) illness and premature mortality caused by air pollution (almost 50 per cent of the total damage cost); (2) diarrhoeal diseases and typhoid due to inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene (about 30 per cent), and (3) reduced agricultural productivity due to soil degradation (about 20 per cent) Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Air pollution may cause appendicitis,"LAHORE, Nov. 09 -- Air pollution is already linked to respiratory and cardiovascular ills, and now researchers say the dirty air you breathe may also cause appendicitis./Authors of a new study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that cases of appendicitis go up when the air is dirtier./""This makes us think about the underlying cause of appendicitis that could potentially be linked to air pollution,"" said Dr. Gilaad G. Kaplan, senior author of the study and assistant professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology at the University of Calgary in Alberta. ""Air pollution is a modifiable risk factor. If these findings are confirmed and we are able to legislate better air pollution control, cleaner air, then potentially we could prevent more cases of appendicitis."" But at this early point in the research, the implications are not so clear-cut, warned another expert. ""It's provocative, but there's a huge difference between correlating any number of factors with a disease and proving that any of these factors might actually cause a disease, and this study fails to show causation,"" said Dr. F. Paul Buckley III, assistant professor of surgery at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and a surgeon at Scott & White Healthcare Round Rock, Texas.""Do we all want to decrease pollution? Yes. Is that going to decrease the incidence of appendicitis? I doubt it,"" said Buckley. No one really knows why appendicitis, or swelling and infection of the appendix, occurs.

"USA: Ecology issues burn bans for Chelan, Douglas and Kittitas counties","OLYMPIA, Dec. 01 -- The State Of Washington has issued following press release:/The Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) is issuing burn bans in Chelan, Douglas and Kittitas counties because of worsening air quality./Ecology's Stage 1 burn bans for those counties are effective immediately and will continue until at least 10 a.m. Saturday (Nov. 27, 2010). The Stage 1 ban applies to unnecessary use of uncertified wood stoves, inserts and fireplaces, and to all outdoor burning./Smoke from outdoor burning, wood stoves and fireplaces is likely to build up where cold air is trapped near the ground. Fine particles in smoke are so small they can easily get into your lungs. Once there, they can cause heart and breathing problems, and even death. Children, people with asthma and respiratory illnesses, and adults older than 65 are most at risk./Under a Stage 1 ban:/* Use of fireplaces, uncertified wood stoves and uncertified inserts is prohibited unless they are a home's only source of heat./* All outdoor burning - including residential, agricultural and forest burning - is prohibited./* Use of certified wood-burning devices and pellet stoves is allowed. Ecology recommends burning hot fires using only clean, dry wood./A 2009 Ecology analysis estimates that fine particles contribute to about 1,100 deaths and millions of dollars in health-care costs each year in Washington. (See Health Effects and Economic Impacts of Fine Particle Pollution in Washington)/For updates, check local media reports and Ecology's daily burn decision hotline (1-800-406-5322)./The Washington State Department of Health recommends that people who are sensitive to air pollution should limit the time they spend outdoors. Air pollution can trigger asthma attacks, cause difficulty breathing, and make lung and heart problems worse./Ecology recommends that people limit vehicle trips, combine errands or use public transportation to reduce air pollution./You can track air quality in your area by using the Washington Air Quality Advisory (WAQA). This is Ecology's tool for informing people about the health effects of air pollution, including fine particles. It's very similar to the federal Environmental Protection Agency's national information tool, the Air Quality Index (AQI). Both use color-coded categories to show when air quality is good, moderate or unhealthy./The difference is that WAQA shows the health effects of fine particles at lower levels than the AQI does. In other words, WAQA shows that air quality is unhealthy earlier - when fewer fine particles are in the air./For more information please contact /<a href=""mailto:info@plusmediasolutions.co"">info@plusmediasolutions.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Dry and hazy weather poses health hazards,"LAHORE, Dec. 3 -- Dry and hazy weather has added to air pollution in the provincial capital, posing serious health hazards to the citizens, especially children and road-users./With the citizens praying for the first proper winter rain, the MET office had predicted dry weather for the next several days, saying that there is no chance of rain in near future./Maximum and minimum temperature in the city remained stagnant during the last two days as, on Tuesday and Wednesday, maximum and minimum temperature was 25 and eight degree Celsius respectively./Ajmal Shad, Director Metrological Department, Lahore, claimed that a new westerly wave was moving towards the upper part of the country and would reach there in the next four to five days. He said light rain was expected over upper KPK and Gilgit Baltistan./The city received around 6.5 mm rain every November but this time the month passed sans a single drop of rain, he said, adding that maximum and minimum temperature was normal, with no unusual change. He predicted a marginal rise in cold during the next four to five days./Dry chill accompanied with high pollution level in the air are targeting citizens who are falling prey to various diseases, especially cough, throat infection, asthma and other respiratory problems./With dust level 268.30, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city was 217 on November 24, which comes in the category of unhealthy weather, says an Air Quality report of the Environment Protection Department./On November 23, the situation was almost similar as the AQI was 253 and the dust level was 362.50. On November 14, the AQI was 217 and the dust level was 259.10 in the provincial capital./Environmentalists believe that an immediate rain as well as heavy wind is needed to cleanse the air quality of the provincial metropolis which seems to be engulfed by dusty clouds and toxic metals and vapors./The government seems to be indifferent to the rise in pollution level as it has taken no sold step to overcome the challenge./The EPD's not having magisterial powers is said to be a major hindrance to curtailing smoke and noise pollution in the city. Public transport vehicles are a big source of air pollution./Most of the main city roads are immersed in the smoke and noise emitting from public transport vehicles./It is pertinent to mention that, recently, the EPD announced launching a Green Sticker Scheme in cities, including Faisalabad, Multan, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi and Lahore. The objective of the scheme is to monitor smoke emission from government and private vehicles around the city. Heavy diesel engine vehicles, like buses, trucks, etc, and two stroke rickshaws are major sources of air and noise pollution in urban areas, officials say./In the first phase of this scheme, the department monitored smoke emission from buses of different companies in Lahore, including NEW KHAN, Premier Transport, NIAZI transport, Daewoo Express and Chenab Transport. According to NEQS values, the standard limit for smoke emissions in heavy diesel engine on ringlleman scale is 40%, carbon monoxide, in new and old vehicles it is 4.5% and 6% respectively. Noise on sound meter is 85Db (A)./The data collected by the department indicates that old, unfit and poorly maintained buses, like New Khan, Niazi and Premier, etc, are polluting air quality. It could become a serious health hazard for the general public in future./The objective of Green Sticker Campaign is to differentiate the environment friendly vehicles from the polluted vehicles by issuing green stickers to the former, to provide environmental education to the general public.

USA: Living near a major road tied to preterm birth: study,"NEW YORK, Dec. 08 -- Women living near major, heavily-trafficked roads were more likely to give birth prematurely, perhaps due to traffic-related air pollution, according to a Japanese study./But Takashi Yorifuji, of the Okayama Graduate School of Medicine, and his team said it was still too early to see a clear link, while other medical experts said noise pollution might also be a factor./In the study, published in ""Epidemiology,"" Yorifuji and his colleagues studied more than 14,000 babies born between 1997 and 2008 in Shizuoka, about 150 km (94 miles) west of Tokyo, obtaining detailed records on each pregnancy and how close to major roads the mothers lived./""Air pollution is considered to be a potentially important risk factor of preterm births,"" Yorifuji saod./Overall, 15 percent of women living within 200 meters of a major road gave birth before 37 weeks, compared to 10 percent of those living further away. A normal pregnancy is 40 weeks./Other factors have been tied to preterm birth as well, such as age, job, and smoking. But even after accounting for those, the research team found a 50 percent increase in preterm births among women living next to highly trafficked thoroughfares./These women also had a higher risk of delivering before 32 and 28 weeks. Very premature births carry an especially heavy public health burden./""In addition, we found a higher risk in housewives than outside workers, and housewives would probably spend more time at home during their pregnancy, and reflect more accurate exposure,"" Yorifuji added./Women living close to busy roads also had about double the risk of both high blood pressure and early rupture of the membranes surrounding the fetus, both potential causes of prematurity./Other exports said the findings squared with previous studies linking air pollution to high blood pressure and inflammation, which could lead to premature rupture of the membranes./""Everybody always worries that it's not really living by busy roadways, but that it's other things that makes these mothers different,"" said Beate Ritz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who reviewed Yorifuji's study for publication./""After all the adjustments, the effect was still there,"" she added, noting that noise pollution also couldn't be ruled out./So what should a pregnant woman do if she lives under an expressway or a block from a national highway?/Yorifuji recommended that a pregnant woman who can't avoid living near a busy highway -- often unavoidable in densely populated Japan -- might want to reduce the time she is active outside, along with cutting out smoking and improving her diet./Others said that studies have shown that it is common for women to move during pregnancy, and that if possible they should consider moving away from busy roads Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

USA: Broccoli may not fight lung cancer in non-smokers,"NEW YORK, Dec. 12 -- Some studies have hinted that eating your broccoli might help prevent lung cancer. But a new study of non-smoking women finds no strong link between compounds found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and lower risk of lung cancer./The study, of nearly 1,000 non-smoking Chinese women with and without lung cancer, found no overall association between the women's risk of the cancer and their urinary levels of isothiocyanates -- compounds in cruciferous vegetables thought to have anti-cancer properties./The results, reported in the journal Lung Cancer, conflict with those of some previous studies finding that among smokers and non-smokers alike, people who eat more cruciferous vegetables tend to have a lower lung cancer risk than those who shun the vegetables./However, those studies do not prove that the vegetables -- which include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage and turnips -- are themselves protective. In addition, some research has suggested that if the veggies do offer a benefit, it may vary according to people's genetic make-up./Specifically, studies have implicated variations in certain genes that govern the activity of GST enzymes, which, among other jobs, help regulate isothiocyanate levels in the body./Isothiocyanates, or ITCs, trigger an increase in antioxidant enzymes that help counter cell damage and inflammation brought on by oxidative stress -- from sources like air pollution and tobacco smoke. Because cruciferous vegetables are the main dietary source of ITCs, researchers have speculated that the compounds may explain the connection between high consumption of the vegetables and lower lung cancer risk./For the current study, researchers led by Dr. Jay H. Fowke, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, used data from a large health study following 75,000 Shanghai women between the ages of 40 and 70./The researchers focused on 209 non-smoking women who were diagnosed with lung cancer after the study's start. They matched each woman with several other women the same age who remained cancer-free./When the researchers divided the women into four groups based on ITC levels -- measured from urine samples collected at the study's outset -- they found no overall relationship between the compound and lung cancer risk. That was true regardless of factors like the women's age and exposure to secondhand smoke./There were some hints that variations in the women's GST genes made a difference. Among women who carried one or two copies of the gene GSTM1, those with higher ITC levels showed a lesser lung cancer risk -- but the difference did not reach statistical significance, which raises the possibility that it was just a chance finding./On the other hand, among women who carried no copies of GSTM1, lung cancer risk tended to climb in tandem with ITC levels -- though, again, the statistical significance of that finding was not strong./According to Fowke's team, the results call for continuing research into the relationship between cruciferous vegetables and lung cancer risk, and the role, if any, of GST or other genes./Among the limitations of this study, they note, is the fact that the women were followed for only three years, and its reliance on a one-time measurement of ITC levels -- which would reflect cruciferous-vegetable intake over only the previous 8 to 72 hours./Smoking is clearly the major risk factor for lung cancer, and quitting -- or preferably never starting -- remains the primary lifestyle measure for preventing the disease./However, Fowke and his colleagues point out, about one-quarter of lung cancer cases worldwide are diagnosed in people who have never smoked. So it is important to identify any other modifiable risk factors for the disease./Regardless of whether cruciferous vegetables have an effect on lung cancer risk, they are considered a healthy diet choice. The American Cancer Society and other medical groups recommend that adults eat at least five servings of vegetables and fruit each day in order to curb their risk of chronic diseases Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution linked to babies' ear infection risk,"ISLAMABAD, Dec. 21 -- Babies and toddlers who live in areas/with moderate air pollution have a higher risk of middle-ear/infection than those breathing clean air./Middle-ear infections, also called otitis media, are common/among young children, with those younger than 2 years being most/susceptible, Health News reported./They are caused by a viral or bacterial infection, and usually/arise after a child has had a cold, sore throat or other upper-/respiratory tract illness./Earlier studies have suggested that air quality plays a role/in young children's vulnerability to middle-ear infections; exposure/to second-hand smoke, for instance, has been linked to a higher/risk./Researchers tracked doctor visits for middle-ear infections/among 45,513 Canadian children followed from birth until age 2/years. All the children lived in an area of British Columbia with/relatively good air quality./Overall, 42 percent of the children visited the doctor for a/middle-ear infection at least once in the first two years of life./When the researchers looked at air pollution levels, they/found a correlation between ear infections and exposure to certain/pollutants even with factors such as the time of year (ear/infections are most common in autumn and winter), neighbourhood/income levels and whether mothers smoked during pregnancy./Children breathing the highest levels of wood smoke were 32/percent more likely to have doctor visits for middle-ear infections/than those breathing the least.

Pakistan: Poor lung function tied to higher stroke risk,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 01 -- The chances of having a stroke are modestly increased in people with impaired lung function, even if they have never smoked nor had respiratory symptoms, researchers report. However, that finding only applies to whites, it seems, not to blacks./Dr Aaron R. Folsom of The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis and colleagues note in the medical journal Chest that few studies have examined the relation between lung function and stroke, and none have studied African Americans./To do so, the researchers tracked 13 842 middle-aged adults, about a quarter of whom were black. During 13 years of follow-up, there were 472 strokes./The researchers found that chances of a stroke went up as lung function went down, but the relationship weakened once other risk factors were taken into account./Nevertheless, it remained statistically significant for white subjects. Their risk of having a stroke was 59 percent higher for those with the lowest lung function compared to those with the highest./Moreover, although the relationship was also seen in whites who had never smoked or had had no respiratory symptoms, this was not the case in blacks./The researchers suggest that the finding might be explained by chance, because of the relative small numbers of blacks in the study, or that the lung function measurements may have been less reliable in the African American group./Dr Stephan F. van Eeden, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, co-author of accompanying editorial, told Right Vision News that in a previous study he and his colleagues helped establish that exposure to air pollutants can lead to hardening of the arteries./This could explain the relationship between reduced lung function and stroke in people who had never smoked, he pointed out./These and other findings, he concluded, help put ""exposure to air pollution in the same category of risk for heart attacks and stroke as the other known risk factors ... such as cigarette smoking, high cholesterol levels and diabetes.

Pakistan: Housework wards off breast cancer,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 02 -- WOMEN who keep their homes clean and tidy are less likely to develop breast cancer than those who let the dust and dishes pile up, according to a new report./Researchers found regular moderate exercise such as housework provides greater protection from the disease than more strenuous but less frequent sporting activity. Around 44,100 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in the UK every year and more than 12,400 women die from the disease. Physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight have also been found to reduce the risk of some cancers in men.Previous studies have identified a link between exercise and reduced breast cancer risk in post-menopausal women, but this is one of the first to include a large number of pre-menopausal women./The researchers analysed data on work, leisure and housework activity levels among 218,169 women aged 20 to 80 from nine European countries including the UK./They followed the women for an average of 6.4 years, during which time 3,423 developed breast cancers./When all forms of activity were combined, being active appeared to offer a protective effect only to post-menopausal women.However when the results were examined in more detail it was found that women who did the most housework had significantly reduced risks while work- and recreation-based activity had less effect./On average, the pre-menopausal participants spent 17.7 hours a week doing housework while the post-menopausal women spent 16.1 hours a week on it.Writing in the January edition of the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention, Dr Petra Lahmann of the Medical Research Council's Human Nutrition Research unit in Cambridge, said: ""Increased non-occupational physical activity and, in particular, increased household activity, were significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk, independent of other potential risk factors.""Our results . . . provide additional evidence that moderate forms of physical activity, such as household activity, may be more important than less frequent but more intense recreational physical activity in reducing breast cancer risk.""/Another research shows that, the closer people live to a main road, the more likely they are to suffer from respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing./""These findings from a general population provide strong confirmation that living near busy streets leads to adverse respiratory health effects,"" Dr. Lucy Bayer-Oglesby, of the University of Basel, and colleagues write in the American Journal of Epidemiology./While outdoor air pollution - especially tiny particles that can be breathed deep into the lungs-is known to be hazardous to people's health, to date no researchers have looked at how proximity to main roads affects respiratory symptoms in a general population, Bayer-Oglesby and her team note./To investigate, they looked at data from a two-part study of air pollution and lung disease.

Pakistan: Thick layer of fog grips Capital,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 04 -- The thick layer of fog has gripped the capital, in wake of severe winter conditions and persistent cold season. According to details the recent drizzling rains has cleared the smog from the capital which was resulted due to air pollution and smoke of vehicles but on the other hand it has initiated the thick layer of fog in the capital which is getting more thicker with the passage of time. /After 6 p, in the evening daily, the fog starts to land on the streets of the capital making visibility level very low. It create the remarkable view of capital for the residents and the visitors both, who terms it identical to the fogy conditions at London, but on the other hand it raises difficulties for the road users as well as pedestrians. During the fogy seasons the ITP every year issues some directions for the road use to ensure the preventions from the accidents. Last year, due to fog the visibility level in capital touched zero level on several occasions which reflects the worst effects of the climate change as well. The traffic on the Motorway and National Highways has been badly affected due to the fog and Motorway police has also issued some warnings to ensure the safety of road users. The schedule of the trains, to other cities from the Rawalpindi is likely to get affected due to sfog which would get more thick in coming days as per weather experts. The fog on one hand forces the visitors as well as locals to visit the recreational places including the Damn-e-koh, Rawal Lake view point, Shakarperian, Pakistan Monument but on the other hand it contributes in raising the traffic volume on the roads. Due to fog the number of traffic accidents also rises every year putting the road users directly exposed to risk, where as it also raises various seasonal diseases like fever, RVNeumonia, flu and cough gripping people without discrimination which sums up into burden on health units and governmental hospitals. According to weather experts the fog will remain persistent for next few days unless introduction of a rain spell and would continue to get thicker Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Afghanistan: Kabul air pollution prompts advice on use of masks,"KABUL, Jan. 09 -- Worsening air pollution in Kabul has forced the Afghanistan National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) to advise people to use masks or other protective devices during the morning and evening rush hours. The NEPA and the Health Ministry say air pollution causes up to 3,000 deaths a year and spreads skin, respiratory and eye diseases, and even cancer. /The UN World Health Organization says air pollution causes about two million premature deaths worldwide every year. ""Anyone can observe that the air in Kabul is highly polluted,"" said Chiranjibi Gautam, an expert with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). ""Up to 75 percent of the air pollution is from transport,"" Najibullah Yamin, NEPA's deputy director, told IRIN. The country imports tens of thousands of second-hand cars every year. They predominantly use low-grade fuel which pollutes the air, NEPA said. To discourage the use of state-owned vehicles and reduce pollution, the government announced that Thursdays are to be public holidays until March 2011. Afghanistan normally only observes Friday as a day of rest. Critics, however, say the extra holiday is benefiting no one, as officials tend to use government vehicles for private purposes on days off. ""It's a joke which in fact is damaging the economy more than helping to reduce air pollution because congestion on Thursdays is no better than on other days,"" said Kabul resident Ahmad Temor. The government has not banned the use of government or private vehicles on Thursdays and Fridays, but merely ""requested"" that people refrain from using their cars ""unnecessarily"". Kabul's inadequate public transport system does not meet the needs of its estimated 4.5 million inhabitants, pushing more and more people to buy cars. ""Kabul is a valley where in winter there is thermal inversion and because of it very low dispersion of pollutants takes place, thus increasing pollution levels,"" said UNEP's Chiranjibi Gautam. Other main causes of air pollution [ /<a href=""http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77304"">http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77304</a>/ ] and environmental degradation are rapid population growth and a largely unregulated urbanization. The lack of trees, parks and other green areas exacerbate the city's air quality, experts say. In cold winter months air pollution increases due to the burning of fuel and firewood for heating, they add, though the use of generators has decreased over the past two years due to US-funded electricity imports from neighbouring Tajikistan. Meanwhile, officials accuse what they call a ""land mafia"" of plundering public land and illegally building houses, with little or no heed to the environment. ""The land mafia has seized green areas and builds houses and commercial buildings in areas which are crucial for environmental protection purposes,"" said NEPA's Yamin. A lack of public awareness on environmental issues is part of the problem, he adds Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: EPD inaction behind increasing pollution,"LAHORE, Jan. 09 -- DIFFERENT types of pollution remained on the rise during year 2010 because of no practical and effective effort on part of the Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) to bring down surging levels of water and air pollution across the province./Policymakers of the EPD did nothing except giving colourful presentations and policy papers to please politicians and ruling elite while on the ground people were compelled to drink contaminated water and inhale poisonous air especially in urban localities./In the budget 2010-11, the Punjab government introduced a new vision of encouraging use of clean fuels, green public transport and treatment of industrial effluents but ironically these visionary words remained in the budget books./Environmental issues seemed to be the last priority of the government as during the year 2010, Chief Minister Punjab Mian Shahbaz Sharif failed to ensure installation of any of the four approved waste water treatment plants for Faisalabad, Multan, Sundar Industrial Estate and Quaid-e-Azam Industrial Estate./It is pertinent to mention here that majority of the industrial units across the province throw their toxic and untreated waste water into the ground as well as water channels like canals and rivers ultimately affecting the overall environmental system of the nature./In urban areas, the department also failed in running any continuous and effective campaigns against smoke and noise emitting vehicles as well as the industrial units. It is also pertinent to mention here that in urban localities, the department also failed in taking any step to move industrial clusters from residential areas./In urban areas especially the provincial metropolis, the main cause of deterioration of air quality during 2010 was presence of excessive Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the ambient air. The major sources of the SPM are vehicles, industry, burning of solid waste, brick kilns and natural dust. The origin of the SPM may be a natural phenomenon such as unpaved roads and places uncovered by green grass or trees. The average SPM concentration in Lahore exceeded many folds from the international standards (120 ug/m3)./Free movement of vehicles using crude diesel oil, motorcycles and two stroke rickshaws were also the main causes of air and noise pollution in urban areas including the provincial metropolis. It is worth mentioning here that despite clear directions of the Lahore High Court, the City District Government Lahore, Punjab Transport Department and EPD had failed to enforce ban on two stroke rickshaws in the City./Another reason, which increased release of toxic gases from vehicles was overloading, faulty fuel injection nozzles and weak engines but none of the departments concerned including EPD took this seriously and failed to take any concrete action against this violation./During the 2010, most of the tubewells pumped out hazardous and polluted water and a study of EPD about Lahore in 2010 showed that over 90 per cent of the tubewells of Wasa were supplying contaminated water to the citizens./It is important to note that to tackle different environmental issues, the EPD established laboratories in eight different cities but interestingly the performance of these laboratories except the one in Lahore was nothing. For example EPD's laboratory in Murree was established in a two room house but most of the time one of these remained occupied by EPD officials who came to Murree alone or with their families to enjoy weather during the year./The EPD officials including its Director General Dr Shagufta Shahjehan also avoided giving research reports, analyses and laboratory findings especially pertaining to ground water contamination to media because of the fear of the provincial government./Other main environmental issues, which got less attention in 2010 and needs immediate and permanent solutions in 2011 included safe disposal of hospital waste and enforcement of Hospital Waste Management Rules 2005, regular and open monitoring of ground water, immediate construction of four approved waste water treatment plants for industrial zones, enforcement of rules regarding installation of water treatment plants by industrial sector, shifting of industrial clusters from outside residential localities and etc./The EPD officials said the main hindrance being faced by them was absence of legal powers to check the polluters. They said the government should make rules pertaining to administrative penalty powers given to EPD officials under PEPA Act 1997, so that officials could use these powers against the polluters./On the other side, EPD officials said they ran various successful campaigns against pollution besides issuing more than 1,500 Environmental Protection Orders (EPOs), which is a record. They added that special campaigns included action against stone crushers in Taxila and Sargodha, action against rice mills, action against illegal construction near Kalar Kahar Lake and Tharabi Dam in Chakwal District, land acquisition for over 300 tanneries of Sialkot and action against polluters dumping untreated waste water in Rawal Lak Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

USA: Ecology burn bans expire in Eastern Washington counties,"OLYMPIA, Jan. 11 -- The State Of Washington has issued Following Press Release:/Burn bans will expire today (Friday, Jan. 7, 2011) in several Eastern Washington counties because air quality is expected to improve there, according to the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology)./Ecology's Stage 2 burn ban for Kittitas County and Stage 1 bans in Chelan, Douglas, Okanogan, and Asotin counties will expire at 10 a.m. A cold front is expected to move into Eastern Washington today and help clear out stagnant air that has been trapping air pollution in those areas./Smoke from outdoor-burning and wood-burning devices, such as wood stoves and fireplaces, builds up where cold air is trapped near the ground. Fine particles in smoke are so small they can easily get into your lungs. Once there, they can cause heart and breathing problems, and even death. Children, people with asthma and respiratory illnesses, and adults older than 65 are most at risk./Under a Stage 1 ban:/* Use of wood-burning fireplaces, uncertified wood stoves and uncertified inserts is prohibited unless they are a home's only source of heat./* All outdoor burning - including residential, agricultural and forest burning - is prohibited./* Use of certified wood-burning devices and pellet stoves is allowed. Ecology recommends burning hot fires using only clean, dry wood./Under a Stage 2 ban:/* Use of all types of devices that burn solid fuels (such as wood, manufactured logs, and pellets) is prohibited unless they are a home's only source of heat./* All outdoor burning - including residential, agricultural and forest burning - is prohibited./A 2009 Ecology analysis estimates that fine particles contribute to about 1,100 deaths and $190 million in health-care costs each year in Washington./The Washington State Department of Health recommends that people who are sensitive to air pollution should limit the time they spend outdoors. Air pollution can trigger asthma attacks, cause difficulty breathing, and make lung and heart problems worse./Ecology recommends that people limit vehicle trips, combine errands or use public transportation to reduce air pollution./For more information please contact /<a href=""mailto:info@plusmediasolutions.co"">info@plusmediasolutions.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

USA: DES Declares Air Quality Action Day Unhealthy Air Pollution Levels Predicted for Today and Tomorrow,"New Hampshire, Jan. 30 -- The state of New Hampshire has issued following press release:/The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES) is expecting air pollution concentrations to reach unhealthy levels for sensitive individuals in populated valley areas in southwestern New Hampshire, especially in Keene, on Friday, January 28 and Saturday, January 29. DES officials are calling for an Air Quality Action Day and advise sensitive individuals in these areas to take precautions to protect their health by limiting prolonged exertion. Sensitive individuals include children, older adults, and anyone with heart or lung disease such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis. Even healthy individuals may experience mild health effects and should consider limiting strenuous or prolonged activities./DES forecasts concentrations of fine particle pollution to be unhealthy for sensitive individuals in the above-mentioned region. The expected unhealthy particle pollution levels are a combined result of pollution transported from surrounding areas and cold, calm air and temperature inversions which limit air movement. Much of this pollution is emitted from heating devices, especially residential wood burning stoves and boilers, and gets trapped and concentrated near the ground. Communities located in valleys or other low-lying areas where temperature inversions are common are more strongly affected. Conditions are expected to improve by Sunday morning as wind speeds increase, resulting in better mixing and cleaner air./The severity of the health effects increases as fine particle concentrations increase. Symptoms of particle pollution exposure for people with heart disease may include chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. People with asthma and other existing lung diseases may not be able to breathe as deeply or vigorously as normal and may experience symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath. In addition to harmful health effects, fine particle pollution may create hazy conditions that reduce visibility./For more information please contact: /<a href=""mailto:info@plusmediasolutions.co"">info@plusmediasolutions.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) said Islamabad received 34 mm rain on Monday. It has forecasted mainly cold and dry weather in the city and most parts of country during next few days./The twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi are in grip of cold wave due to the current rain spell that started on Friday evening. The rain has further dropped the mercury in the federal capital, as the temperature recorded on Monday stood at nine degrees Celsius minimum and 17 degrees Celsius maximum./The rain washed the roads and streets giving a new look to the city. However, the rainwater accumulated on 7th and 9th Avenues, H-9 Service Road, IJ Principal Road and roads in I-9 and I-10 sectors. The rainwater on roads created problems for the motorists and the pedestrians. The rain created traffic snarls in the city due to poor visibility, as long queues of vehicles were witnessed on the busy roads./The security personnel at almost all the check posts were seen sitting around bonfire to ward off cold. The commuters in the city faced trouble, as there were only a few cabs on the road. Traffic was also very thin, while a few shoppers ventured to visit most of the malls, shopping centres and markets due to rain. Those who live in the open air and cannot afford warm clothes suffered the most. The rain also created problems for the office-goers and businesspersons. The offices and educational institutions in Islamabad witnessed low attendance.

This test was its first since the scrubber began operating in 1984./Ecology received the test results on Aug. 19, 2010, that showed REC had been emitting more nitrogen oxides than allowed, violating its air quality permit./According to Ecology air quality specialist Dave Wendland, the equipment had not been maintained properly. REC reported that workers found that materials and liquids passing through the scrubber had developed into a solid, rendering the equipment ineffective./""It's extremely important to control pollutants from industrial sites as well as cars and trucks,"" said Karen Wood, who manages Ecology's Air Quality Program in Spokane. ""Nitrogen oxides can damage people's health if they are exposed long enough. REC will need to improve its maintenance procedures to make sure this doesn't happen again.""/Nitrogen oxides react with ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form small particles. When people breathe in these small particles, they travel deeply into sensitive parts of the lungs and can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, such as emphysema and bronchitis. They also can aggravate existing heart disease./Children, older people and people with lung problems are particularly vulnerable to smog. It causes a reduction in lung function and increased respiratory symptoms as well as respiratory-related hospital emergency visits. Nitrogen oxides also contribute to producing acid rain and ground-level ozone, or smog./The company can appeal the penalty to the state's Pollution Control Hearings Board within 30 days./For more information please contact /<a href=""mailto:info@plusmediasolutions.co"">info@plusmediasolutions.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Smoke allergy in Karachi on the rise,"KARACHI, Feb. 20 -- Karachi is the largest metropolitan city and business hub of Pakistan. Due to its growing population, industrial growth, and a large number of smoke-emitted vehicles on roads, pollution-related diseases in Karachi are on the rise, making levels of air and noise pollution in the city intolerable. Some 35 per cent of people in one way or another is affected by these ailments including cardiac, lung, ENT, skin, eye and psychological diseases./The main source of air pollution is the presence of two-stroke rickshaws and smoke emitting vehicles, these cause air and noise pollution and due to which nasal allergy, nasal polyp, sore throat and other ENT problems are increasing. Noise pollution is causing problems such as hearing impairment, headaches and hypertension./The experts are concerned over the government's apathy for not tackling this issue urgently. According to estimates, over 1.43 million vehicles plying on the city roads and the number is growing continuously as more than 300 vehicles are being registered in Karachi every day./Healthcare experts say nasal allergies can occur as a reaction to a wide variety of stimuli, most commonly those inspired from the air and through the nose. Medically, the condition is known as allergic rhinitis, rhinitis meaning an inflammation of the nose, allergic meaning, of course, an immunological reaction to an allergen, or particle your body decides to be foreign and harmful./Allergens vary from person to person, though some substances are better known to suit the role than others. Besides smoke, tree and plant pollen, mold spores, and pet dander are some of the most common nasal allergens, though common dust is a heavy contender./Symptoms of a rhinitis are divided into the short and long-term, as the immediate effects of an allergen on the system differ from the cumulative result./Immediate allergic symptoms include sneezing, repeated and insistent. While sneezing often occurs in response to physical stimulus of the nasal hairs and passage, it occurs also as a result of the chemical stimulation associated with an allergic response, a process that usually takes 60 to 90 seconds. Often, allergic sneezing is reported heaviest in the morning./Another symptom is rhinorrhea, or runny nose. Chronic stimulation of the nasal passage results in an increase in the production and drainage of mucus. Drainage will be thin and clear - other coloration may occur with minor illness or may indicate nasal infection, a possible result of chronic rhinitis./Watery eyes happen as a result of the body's defensive histamine secretions. Eyes may itch and burn, especially with further inflammation caused by rubbing or scratching./Yet another symptom is post-nasal drip (PND). Usually a discomfort or tickle in the upper-rear of the mouth or throat. This results from increased nasal drainage in the back of the throat as well as front. PND can result in nausea, chronic cough, and inflammation of the throat's glands./Long-term effects include worsening of initial symptoms, as well as numerous complications, including: Nasal congestion, caused by prolonged rhinitis; chronic cough, and minor ear pressure or hearing difficulty. As qualified ENT doctor should be consulted for treatment of nasal allergy./The government should ban plying of smoke-emitting vehicles on roads including two-stroke rickshaws, because vehicular smoke affects huge number of people. Controlling traffic jams may also help in reducing smoke pollution.

USA: Gov. Gregoire announces agreement with TransAlta,"OLYMPIA, March 08 -- The State Of Washington has issued following press release:/Gov. Chris Gregoire today announced a proposed agreement has been reached with TransAlta to significantly reduce emissions from the company's coal-fired power plant in the Centralia area. The agreement was negotiated by TransAlta, the state of Washington and members of the environmental community to ensure a transition to cleaner power while allowing the necessary time to provide economic stability to Southwest Washington./""What a proud day for the Centralia community, and all of Washington state,"" Gregoire said. ""I congratulate all of the parties involved who worked in good faith, and spent countless hours to achieve this agreement. This compromise promises cleaner air for our future, while providing the necessary time to ensure economic stability, job protection and enough power on the grid to keep our homes and businesses running. I encourage the Legislature to take timely action to ensure this agreement moves forward.""/In 2009, Gregoire signed an executive order directing the Department of Ecology to work with TransAlta to establish an agreed order that would apply the greenhouse gas emissions performance standards by no later than December 31, 2025./Today's agreement moves up the performance standards for one of two boilers to Dec. 31, 2020 and the other boiler on Dec. 31, 2025./""We're pleased to see all parties agree on legislation that balances the interests of jobs, the economy, energy and the environment,"" said Stephen Snyder, President and CEO of TransAlta. ""This legislation meets our commitment to a low-carbon future through transition from coal to gas in Washington, significantly reduces our environmental risk and allows us to provide fair shareholder value through favorable long-term contracts while protecting jobs and the economy of the local community.""/Senator Phil Rockefeller introduced an amendment which would incorporate the new agreement into SB 5769, which would establish the first coal-free date in law. This amendment includes:/* TransAlta will be allowed in the interim to sell coal power under long-term contracts within Washington - which will give the company the financial stability needed to transition to a cleaner source of energy;/* The plant's two coal boilers will meet the state's emissions performance standard for new and modified power plants, which will require the boilers to shut down. The standard will apply to one boiler on Dec. 31, 2020, and to the other boiler on Dec. 31, 2025 - essentially ending coal-fired power in Washington state in the next 14 years;/* In 2013, TransAlta will install additional air pollution control technology to further reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides at the plant. This technology is called selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). The TransAlta plant is the state's largest single industrial source of nitrogen oxide emissions. Nitrogen oxides are one of the causes of visibility-limiting regional haze in national parks and on federal lands; and/* TransAlta agrees to contribute $30 million in a community investment fund to help with energy efficiency projects, as well as $25 million in an energy technology transition fund, which must be spent on supporting innovative energy technologies and companies in Washington state./""It's great news that TransAlta and the people interested in the future of the Centralia community and clean air have come together on a proposed agreement,"" said Rockefeller. ""I congratulate them, but at the same time recognize we have a lot of work ahead of us. The amendment I have prepared will capture the recent agreement in legislative language. Sen. Dan Swecker from Lewis County has signed onto this amendment and I hope others follow. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the company and the governor to arrive at a final agreement.""/""Clean air and water have always been my top priority,"" Rep. Marko Liias said, ""and this compromise goes a long way towards protecting our environment and preserving good jobs. I'm glad to see TransAlta has agreed to this solution, which will provide $55 million towards the local community and economy.""/""This is a giant step forward toward a healthier and safer Washington, free from coal,"" said Bruce Nilles, Deputy Conservation Director with the Sierra Club. ""We are leaving coal pollution in the past as we continue building the clean energy economy of today. We thank the Governor, TransAlta, Sen. Rockefeller, Rep. Liias, the people of Lewis County and the Environmental Priorities Coalition for their efforts in achieving this historic agreement.""/""We are excited to be a part of this solution, which will help Washington transition to a clean energy economy, safeguard public health, and provide a secure economic future for Lewis County. We look forward to working closely with the Legislature to ensure passage of this groundbreaking agreement,"" said Rod Brown, President, Washington Environmental Council./""Our priority was maintaining family-wage jobs in the Centralia area,"" said Bob Guenther from the Thurston-Lewis-Mason Central Labor Council, IBEW 77. ""That's what every community needs to thrive, and Centralia is no exception. TransAlta provides critical employment opportunities to ensure a strong economy in Southwest Washington, and I'm pleased that our goal of sustaining good jobs was met with this agreement while providing certainty for all involved including the community, labor, the company, the environment and the grid.""/For more information please contact info@plusmediasolutions.c Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Spring and pollen allergy comes together,"ISLAMABAD, March 12 -- With the advent of spring season in capital, the number of pollen allergy patients has witnessed a significant increase at the city hospitals and clinics. Besides, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) has expedited its efforts against the disease by setting up nebulisers to treat the patients./According to a PIMS official, the current pollen patterns indicated that paper mulberry was likely to start shedding pollens around mid of this month. He said the rainy spell delayed the paper mulberry pollen. The pollen allergy patients, who are used to suffer from this disease from mid to end of March, may face a shorter, but slightly intense pollen season this year, he said, adding it then required two to five days of sunshine for the mulberries to start flowering./PIMS sources said 80-90 pollen allergy patients were visiting the hospital for nebulization and oxygen. ""Taking special steps, the PIMS administration has deputed 25 extra staff members in Emergency Department and has installed over 100 nebulizers at different wards of the hospital so that as soon as a patient enters the hospital premises, he/she could be treated immediately,"" the official said./Spokesman for PIMS, Dr Waseem Khawaja requested the pollen allergy patients, who are under 13, to come to Outdoor Patient Department (OPD) first and if OPD timings were over, they should go to the Emergency Department. He said in this way the rush of patients would be avoided and doctors would be able to treat every patient individually./He said the pollen allergy symptoms included sneezing and runny nose, itching and watering of eyes, coughing, difficulty in breathing, wheezing and eventually attacks of asthma. In addition, there may be itching on the skin and sometimes gastro-intestinal symptoms, he added./Khawaja said during periods of high pollen concentration in the air, people with pollen allergy should try to avoid unnecessary exposure to irritants such as dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution and fresh tar or paint. He added any of these could aggravate the pollen allergy. He said complications might occur if pollen allergy was not treated timely. The PIMS spokesman said people with seasonal allergies who could not avoid pollen, the disease can be controlled through medication on advise of physician./Precautionary measures: Talking about precautionary measures, Khawaja said, pollen allergy patients must avoid eating spicy food. ""No use of perfumes, avoid walking in garden, wear face mask, use wet cloth for dusting, avoid using carpets on the floor, do not open the window of car, use vacuum cleaner instead of broom, use sun glasses in outdoor, and apply fresh water in eyes and nose and avoid using hot water,"" he said./According to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the atmospheric concentration of pollens of pines, grasses and cannabis was in high category in the federal capital. The PMD advised the individuals sensitive to pollens to take precautionary measures. ""The trend in allergic pollen will change and the concentration of paper mulberry pollen will also increase and dominate the other allergic pollen after mid of March,"" the Met Office official said./He said as soon as the pollen count increased 15,000 cubic meters in the air, patients started suffering severely. ""On Thursday the pollen count in Islamabad was recorded 95/m3 that is relatively high for any allergy patient and they must consult physician as soon as possible,"" he said./According to health experts, the first affected sectors would be G-6, followed by F-6, F-7 and G-7 and then the other sectors of the capital./Bhara Kahu and Bani Gala, which were previously unaffected by paper mulberry pollen allergy, have now developed enough paper mulberry trees to start causing allergy. This has been due to the irresponsible construction work carried out in the area, in which residents cleared larger areas of land of their natural foliage and vegetation than they needed for construction./According to an estimate of Health Ministry, about 120,000 residents of the federal capital are the victims of this disease, which in some cases has become fatal. Since early 1990s, pollen allergy has become one of the gravest health problems of the city as every year hundreds of people visit hospitals or clinics for treatment against the disease./Some experts hold paper mulberry tree as solely responsible for the disease, while others associate multiple environmental pollutants such as dust and smoke emissions./According to a study conducted by National Institute of Health (NIH), during 1983-1993 as much as 15 percent of the population in the industrialised countries suffered from allergies Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: With spring comes pollen,"ISLAMABAD, March 12 -- Pakistan Meteorological Department says it was vigorously monitoring pollen concentration in each sector of Islamabad and has advised people suffering from Asthma and respiratory diseases to take precautionary measures./With the onset of spring season, pollen concentration sharply increases in the capital, and attains its peak around mid-March. On Thursday, pollen count in Islamabad was 95/m3./At least eight types of pollen from paper mulberry, pine, dandelion, cannabis, acacia, alternaria, eucalyptus and grasses are being monitored. Among them paper mulberry pollen is found in abundance and its concentration touches the extreme limits of 45,000 per cubic meter of air at the peak of blossom season./In an advisory for allergy patients, Met office says that atmospheric concentration of pines and grasses allergic pollens lie in high category. Similarly, atmospheric concentration of cannabis allergic pollen is in moderate category. Atmospheric concentration of paper mulberry and alternaria allergic pollens remain in low category. Most individuals with any sensitivity at all to these pollens and molds will experience symptoms./APP adds: Dr Waseem Khawaja of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) said that since early 1990s, pollen allergy has become one of the gravest health problems of the city as every year hundreds of people visit hospitals or clinics for treatment against this disease./Dr Khawaja said that during periods of high pollen concentration in the air, people with pollen allergy should try to avoid unnecessary exposure to irritants such as dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution and fresh tar or paint./He added any of these could aggravate the pollen allergy and complications might occur if pollen allergy was not treated timely./Talking about precautionary measures, he told, ""Pollen allergy patients must avoid eating spicy food, no use of perfumes, use wet cloth for dusting, wear face mask and use sun glasses, avoid using carpets on the floor, do not open the window of car, use vacuum cleaner instead of broom,"" he added.He further explained that ""the pollen allergy may turn into asthma i/f the patient exposes himself or herself to pollen grains, and all allergy patients are recommended to avoid visiting places having population of pollen producing plants and, if necessary, then they have to fully cover their mouths and noses with masks or handkerchiefs./Meanwhile, after recent rain spell in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the sun is getting warmer with every passing day and spring is ready to cast its spell with buds and saplings on the trees and birds chirping around./During the spring season, capital presents spectacular look with flowers of different kinds and lush green grass at every nook and corner./Capital Development Authority (CDA) has already launched its Spring Tree Plantation Campaign to make the capital clean and gree Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Healthcare for the Spring Season,"ISLAMABAD, March 17 -- Are you ready for the lovely, invigorating spring season? Flowers blooming all around, no more chilled-to-the-bone days and nights, pre-season drives to Murree and the Galis . and just plain joie de vivre! Just one thing though: with all its joys and pleasures spring also brings an alarming rise in allergy from pollens - and asthma attacks. Yes, those beautiful trees, flowers, plants and shrubbery are trigger factors for asthma, which affects all age and gender groups, though young children can be particularly vulnerable. Do consult your family doctor before the spring season starts./Pollen counts tend to be quite high in the Islamabad region and areas north. In fact according to medical experts over 70,000 fully grown paper mulberry trees are among the biggest sources of pollen allergy in the twin cities. Inhaling pollen can inflame airways of affected people and this also results in constriction of the airways which limits the flow of air into and out of the lungs - causing symptoms such as:/sneezing, coughing, runny or stuffy nose, wheezing, watery or itchy eyes, chest tightness, difficulty in breathing./One way out for asthmatic and pollen allergy patients is to move away from high pollen count areas during the peak period . but then not everyone can do so. Asthmatic people need therefore to adhere to the proper protocol for medication. It is wise to always keep your inhaler with you - there are two types of Asthma medication inhalers:/Preventer - this is used on a regular basis to prevent Asthma attacks./Reliever - this is a quick relief medication and is helpful only in emergencies./Consult your doctor for best professional advice. Some precautions that can be meanwhile taken are: avoid exposure to outdoors and keep windows and doors closed when pollen count is high - especially in mornings; cover nose in pollen rich areas; avoid unnecessary exposure to irritants like dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution and fresh paint/For children especially, try to find which pollen your child is allergic to - and then do all possible to avoid exposure to it; ensure he/ she showers after playing in the garden and green areas - face, hands and hair must all be properly washed; and see that the child always keep the inhaler spray with him or her - even at school./March to June is also school examination time - so ensure all the precautionary measures, proper medication and physician's advice on a regular basis. This would greatly help your child from absence at school and in achieving good grades through total asthma contro Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: One child dies every minute in Pakistan,"KARACHI, March 25 -- In Pakistan the situation of child health is pathetic and serious efforts are needed by the government and civil society to save lives of hundreds of thousands of kids, who die every year from preventable diseases./The grim picture of child health situation could be seen in the annual health report of Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) for the year 2011, which says one child died every minute from EPI (expanded program on immunization diseases), diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI). The report also reveals that every year about 400000 infants die in the first year of their life./Child health in Pakistan is among the most important national issues that need a proper and serious attention. The child mortality in Pakistan is a major cause of concern, with every 1 among 10 children dying before reaching the age of five and 1 among 30, just after they are born. Pakistan is among the developing nations of the world that has yet to do much for the welfare of the general public./Pneumonia and air pollution seem to be the factors affecting the health of the children in Pakistan. The air pollution is mostly caused by harmful emissions of biogas, which is used in most houses of Pakistan./The main reason behind growing child mortality in Pakistan is lack of child healthcare facilities in rural areas, where majority of population lives. Low state spending on healthcare, abject poverty, low literacy, lack of skilled birth attendants, widespread communicable diseases, insufficient emergency child health services in government run district and rural hospitals are amongst other major reasons behind growing diseases in children./Maternal, newborn and child health care statistics in Pakistan are some of the poorest in South Asia. A holistic approach is needed to improve maternal and newborn health, mainly by improving and upgrading facilities at the district hospitals./Most common and lethal diseases in Pakistan include (ARI) acute respiratory, infection, viral hepatitis, malaria, diarrhea, dysentery, scabies, goiter, hepatitis and tuberculosis./Among the victims of Acute respiratory infection (ARI) most vulnerable are children whose immune systems have been weakened by malnutrition. Majority of children visiting hospitals and dispensaries suffer from the respiratory ailments and serious attention is needed to provide better medical treatment to children living in rural areas./Viral hepatitis, particularly that caused by types B and C are major epidemics in Pakistan with nearly 12 million individuals infected with either of the virus. The main cause remains massive overuse of therapeutic injections and reuse of syringes during these injections in the private sector healthcare. Children are also amongst the hepatitis patients and their number is growing sharply./Malaria is a problem faced by the lower class people in Pakistan. The unsanitary conditions and stagnant water bodies in the rural areas and city slums provide excellent breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Like adults children also suffer from malarial diseases, which needs serious attention of healthcare policymakers./Diarrhea is rampant in the country due to use of contaminated water. It is estimated that about 20percent of diarrhea patients are children. Similarity, diseases like dysentery, scabies, dengue, goiter are also on the rise./Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) Pakistan provides vaccination against childhood tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenza type b and measles, besides protecting pregnant ladies with tetanus toxoid and their neonates against neo-natal tetanus. However, there is no success even to control polio./Most births which take place at home under untrained supervision, which are responsible for alarming mortality of mothers and newborns. Children under the age of five face multiple obstacles, including birth injuries and infectious diseases. Millions of children suffer from short- and long-term adverse consequences of illnesses, malnutrition and injuries that impact their well-being and options in life, including fewer educational opportunities and diminished future economic prospects./Child health is closely related to maternal health, as nutrition during pregnancy, birth conditions, birth spacing, and health status of the mother impact the health of the child prior to, during and after birth. Largely because of these factors, 3 million infants are stillborn each year./Recent devastation floods in Pakistan have further increased the disease burden. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) says as many as three and a half million children in flood-ravaged Pakistan may be at risk of contracting deadly diseases carried through contaminated water and insects./UNICEF says the greatest threats to public health in Pakistan at the current time are certainly from waterborne diseases, which can intensify in precarious hygiene conditions, and when people have limited or poor access to safe water and sanitation services./Diseases like cholera or acute watery diarrhoea, dysentery or bloody diarrhoea, typhoid fever and hepatitis, can all cause excess mortality and morbidity amongst the susceptible populations in the flood-hit areas. There is also an increased risk of malaria and dengue fever, since the stagnant water may provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes - the vector that is responsible for transmission./To cope with the situation, the government must open more children hospitals in the country. In Sindh province, there is just one big children hospital, National Institute of Child Health (NICH), running in Karachi by the federal government. There is dire need to open more children hospitals in the province and improve children departments in the hospitals of government-run teaching colleges in Karachi, Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Nawabshah, Sukkur and Larkana./In order to save lives of children, pediatric wards should be opened in all district headquarter hospitals, where emergency services along with trained child disease experts should be made available./Children are precious asset of the country and the government at federal, provincial and local government level should take serious efforts to improve healthcare facilities for the Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Overpopulation burdens economy and environment,"Karachi, March 28 -- Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world and fourth in Asia. Several demographers have been making some population projection for Pakistan and the figures have been alarming. Recently a Washington-based Pew Research Centre has concluded that by 2030 Pakistan's population is expected to grow from the current 180 million to 256 million, hence, Pakistan would be the most populous Muslim nation by 2030. Pakistan's population has increased 5.6 times during the past 63 years, implying an average annual rate of growth of 2.77 per cent, one of the highest in the world./The burgeoning population has major implications for availability and sustainability of resources needed for Pakistani people to survive./The abject poverty, rising unemployment, inflation, environmental pollution, air pollution, river water pollution, groundwater exploitation, plastic pollution, municipal solid waste, pollution due to biomedical waste, pollution due to e-waste, among others, food shortage, can be blamed for this woe./According to the World Food Programme, nearly half of Pakistan's (180 million) people are at risk of going short of food due to a recent surge in world food prices. The price of wheat flour this February was between Rs35 to Rs40 per kg in Pakistan, compared with Rs15 per kg three years ago. The recent sugar crisis reflects governance issues (hoarding) in the domestic supply chain. Further, the country's growth rate is merely two to three per cent. Wikipedia quotes $50 billion of external debt as on May 2010, 24 per cent people living below international poverty line, inflation rate at 14.17 per cent (2010) and public debt standing at a record Rs9.473 trillion. The frequent increase in oil, electricity and gas tariffs has exerted an upward pressure on the general price level./Aside from economic problems, environmental problems are growing in Pakistan rapidly. Overpopulation is putting a strain on the environment, infrastructure, and the country's natural resources. Industrial pollution, soil erosion, deforestation, rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and land degradation are all worsening problems. Over-exploitation of the country's resources, be it land or water and the industrialisation process has resulted in environmental degradation of resources. Environmental pollution is one of the most serious problems facing humanity and other life forms today. However, environmental pollution not only leads to deteriorating environmental conditions but also has adverse effects on the health of people. Pakistan is one of the most degraded environment countries in the world and it is paying a heavy health and economic price for it./Tens of thousands of people die prematurely every year as a result of air pollution, while many more suffer from breathing ailments, heart disease, lung infections and even cancer. Fine particles or microscopic dust from coal or wood fires and unfiltered diesel engines are rated as one of the most lethal forms of air pollution caused by industry, transport, household heating, cooking and ageing coal or oil-fired power stations. There are four reasons of air pollution - emissions from vehicles, thermal power plants, industries and refineries. The problem of indoor air pollution in rural areas and urban slums has increased./According to latest reports millions of people in Pakistan are exposed to dangerous levels of outdoor and indoor air pollution and vector-borne diseases and millions of people suffer from diseases because of having no access to clean and drinking water. Without water people die, but if it is clean and available in sufficient quantities, water can lead to healthier, more productive individuals and communities./Waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria and cholera are the main killers in Sindh province. On the other hand millions of people lack access to basic sanitation facilities which include clean sewerage services, toilets and wash basin./It is not out of place to mention here that the River Indus, which is the lifeline for the people of Sindh, is unfortunately being polluted. A steady deterioration in the quality of water of River Indus is reported due to millions of litres of sewage, industrial and agricultural wastes. At some places this river has been rendered to the level of sewage flowing drain. Hence, there are serious water quality problems in various cities, towns and villages of Sindh province. Consequently, heavy loads of biological and chemical pollutants usually enter the River Indus, to be consumed in some manner by the downstream user./In view of this sordid state of affairs, the ecologists, the conservationists and the Indus River lovers are furious. They have demanded the government and also the international organisations to launch river cleaning initiatives such as the Indus Action Plan and Indus River Conservation Plan so that the river may be sanitised and millions of people may be saved who breathe with the gush of River Indus./The increase in population has been tending towards an alarming situation. If the country's population continues to multiply, the impact on environment could be devastating. Population impacts the environment primarily through the use of natural resources and production of wastes and is associated with environmental stresses like biodiversity, air and water pollution and increased pressure on arable land. Sadly, our dangerously high rate of population growth is unaccompanied by complementary levels of economic expansion. It is very common in our country to see farmers with a cricket team of children and wives. One of the greatest problems of Pakistan is that many of them raise too many children without adequate income and plans on how to cater for them. Even though they actually know that with the present economic situation their daily survival would be exceedingly difficult. Babies are now being abandoned at an alarming rate. This has proved that families should cut their coat according to their size./However, the imperative need of the hour is to intensify the family planning programme in the country. Every Pakistani has to be exposed to the benefits of family planning so as to make them accept it. Pakistan should not wait till the population poses a greater danger like in China and India, before they act./The action taken now is going to determine the quality of life of people of Pakistan in the future. In order to make the population programme to be effective, the provinces should adopt a wholesome policy on it, i.e. on the one hand, the ulema play a motivating role and change the social attitudes of the people towards gender equality and family size. On the other hand, the government will have to improve the contraceptive delivery services in the country. In reality all these aspects are interlinked and, therefore, social sectors should be addressed simultaneously with a vigorous family planning campaign./I felt titillated when most enlightened women I spoke with on the topic of family planning in southern Sindh districts including Larkana, Qmabar/Shahdad Kot, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Sukkur, Ghotki and others, expressed the desire to have only three or four children./They will contribute immeasurably in controlling the population boom in Pakistan; therefore, all stakeholders should come forward and rise to the occasio Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Giant bees changing their abode,"Karachi, March 28 -- BOTH dwarf and giant honey bees are found in Sindh. Some time back, lower Sindh was the main abode of dwarf bees while giant ones were confined up to Mirpur Mathelo area of Ghotki district in the upper Sindh region. In the past few years, the giant bees have been moving to lower Sindh./Three years back hives of giant honey bees were seen in Badin and Golarchi, the coastal areas of Sindh. It was a new phenomenon as the habitat of giant bee was mainly the non-coastal area. In 2008-2009, they spread to Mirpurkhas and Tando Allahyar area./Prominent grower of Matiari Shafqat Jamote recently apprised this scribe that his area was devoid of dwarf honey bees. There is a general perception among the farming community that dwarf bees have been devoured by giant bees./Actually, giant bee does not predate upon smaller bee. However, the population of smaller bees, conspicuous in the lower and upper Sindh regions a decade ago, is shrinking day by day. Right Vision News reported on March 11 that decline in bee population is worrying the UN./According to the report, globalisation is killing bees, as the opening up of trade allows pest and diseases to travel swiftly around the world. The researchers are concerned that the loss in number of bees and other pollinating insects could affect crop production adversely and lead to serious problems with food supply. Of 100 crop species that provide 90 per cent of the world`s food, more than 70 are pollinated by bees. Bees contribute about Rs200 billion a year to the global economy./The factors behind declining bee population are attributed mainly to the increased use of pesticides, air pollution, fungal diseases, mites and loss of habitat for wildflowers. However, according to the Centre for Research on Globalisation dated March 23, 2008, the GMO crops have also been blamed for death of bees./The genetic modification of plants leads to concurrent genetic modification of flower pollen. When the pollen becomes genetically modified or sterile, the bee potentially goes malnourished and dies of illness due to lack of nutrients./So far the declining population of smaller bee species in Sindh is concerned, two new factors viz. mass destruction of riverine forest, the main sanctuary of dwarf bee, and wide spread cultivation of BT cotton in the province seem to be the apparent reasons./The government must take notice of this phenomenon, identify factors responsible for declining bee population in Sindh as well as in the country and initiate remedial measure Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

They include steel melting units, re-rolling mills, flourmills, oil and ghee industries, marble cutting and polishing units, pharmaceutical firms and metalworking and engineering units./Out of the seven steel melting units, only a few managed to acquire the anti-pollution equipment, which have now become partially non-operational due to lack of proper maintenance and other problems./The remaining units have been operating continuously without observing any safety measures to minimize the risk of air and water pollution./These units are producing metal dust, slag and gaseous emissions besides discharging untreated effluent in the main drain that eventually falls into River Soan./There are 25 flourmills in the Industrial Area that also lack proper system to filter or vet the flour dust that is usually thrown out in the open air./An employee of a company, Ali Ahmad working in I-9 Industrial Zone said that it is very difficult to breathe in the open as the steel mills emit a lot of smoke even during the day time./He suggested that ""environment officials should impose fine on the factories for polluting the air.""/The air of the city is 70 to 90 per cent polluted and the normal level of air pollution is less than 35 per cent./Research published in 2005 suggests that 310,000 Europeans die from air pollution each year.

Pakistan: Air quality monitoring system resumes work,"ISLAMABAD, April 17 -- Amid rising air pollution in the capital, the Air Quality Monitoring System of Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) has finally become functional after necessary repair work by Japanese experts./The state-of-the-art system installed to monitor environmental pollution with the help of financial assistance worth Rs660 million by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) got dysfunctional some six months ago due to non-availability of required funds by the Ministry of Environment./Under the system, seven fixed and three mobile laboratories were engaged in monitoring of air quality of Islamabad but stoppage of funds had made it difficult to even give monthly salaries to staff members and pay bills of petrol and diesel./The first air quality index issued yesterday (Thursday) showed moderate trend as level of particulate matter stood at 39.82 quite far away from unhealthy level. The index comprised five levels including Good (0-25), Moderate (26-50), Unhealthy (51-100), Severe (101-200) and hazardous (201-300)./Air pollutants, according to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997, means any substance that pollutes the air by unfavourably altering its chemical, physical, biological, and aesthetic properties and makes it unclean or detrimental to health and safety of humans. Among other things, this includes smoke, fumes, dust particles and odour./According to Pak-EPA, air pollution levels for the larger Pakistani cities - Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad - have been recorded seven times higher than those prescribed by the World Health Organization./The air pollution problem is aggravated by the aging fleet of vehicles in poor mechanical condition and low levels of fuel efficiency. The increasing number of diesel trucks has further added to the problem. The burning of municipal solid waste is also a significant source of air pollution in the urban area. Hundreds of tons of solid waste is generated each day in Islamabad, most of which is either dumped in low-lying areas or burned. The burning of solid waste at low temperatures not only generates particulate matter but also produces other carcinogenic pollutants./Pak-EPA Director General Asadullah Faiz told this correspondent that delay in repair of air quality monitoring system was due to advice of the Japanese experts who cautioned against doing any repair work in their absence./""The Japanese experts advised us not to even touch the system so we have been waiting for their arrival for last few months. Now the system is fully functional and we would issue air quality index on daily basis,"" he said./He said recent rains resulted in reduction of air pollution but advent of dry spell may cause some increase in it, adding ""we are quite vigilant and if there is any increase in air pollution we would issue warnings and also take steps to cope with it.""/Asadullah Faiz said environmental laws at the federal level are now quite strict and no development project in the capital city can be initiated without Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Islamabad, Quetta in 'unhealthy' category","ISLAMABAD, May 27 -- The air quality of federal capital Islamabad and provincial capital Quetta are still in 'unhealthy' category, while two provincial headquarters including Lahore and Peshawar have entered into 'severe' category, thanks to increasing construction activities and smoke emission from motor vehicles and industrial units./According to Air Quality Index (AQI) monitored in five major cities the ratio of suspended particles in the air in Lahore is 158 micro-gm/m3, Peshawar 104 micro-gm/m3, Quetta 74 micro-gm/m3 and Islamabad 68 micro-gm/m3. This ratio is quite in the safe limit in Karachi that falls into ""good' quality having 17 micro-gm/m3./AQI has five categories - good (0-25 micro-gm/m3), moderate (26-50 micro-gm/m3), unhealthy (51-100 micro-gm/m3), severe (101-200 micro-gm/m3) and hazardous (201-300 micro-gm/m3)./Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) has already conducted number of studies to investigate the ambient air quality in the major cities of Pakistan. Some of these studies were technically and financially supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). All these studies revealed that the number one problem relevant to the ambient air quality is the Particulate Matter (PM)./Pak-EPA has carried out investigation about level of NO2 in all major cities -Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Islamabad and Quetta - to determine its present level so that the future strategy could be chalked out to safeguard the public from its adverse effects./One of the reports prepared by EPA recommended a higher road tax premium for older vehicles in Lahore, and stated that ""every vehicle must pass emission standard criteria before coming on the road"". To implement this, the report recommended that motor workshops be equipped with emission testing kits and vehicles are routinely tuned./The Lahore University of Management Sciences is in a process to launch a website that will carry real time information about air pollution at various points in the city. Volunteer Internet-based Environment Watch (VIEW) website would monitor levels of air pollution at Baghbanpura, Garhi Shahu, Upper Mall, Awan Town, Cantt and Phases II and III of Defence. Solar-powered sensors have already been installed in these areas that would determine humidity, temperature, and the levels of carbon monoxide, ozone and nitrogen and sulphur oxides in the air./In the very recent investigation conducted by Pak-EPA in Quetta on ambient air particulate matter revealed that Imdad Chowk is the most polluted location compared to other locations in Quetta due to the high density of traffic at this point./According to the World Wide Fund (WWF) fact sheet, major air pollutants include: suspended particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, sulphur dioxide, lead and other heavy metals, ground level ozone and fuel wood./The environmental experts say that though many cities are adversely affected, air quality monitoring is restricted to six major cities. They link the environmental degradation to poverty because of the overwhelming dependence of the poor on natural resources for their livelihoods including agriculture, forestry, fisheries and hunting./Pak-EPA Director General Asad Faiz told this scribe that they are continuously providing the data about air quality of different cities to the relevant departments that would use it while making policies to ensure safe environment for the people./He said construction activities have increased manifold and it is expected that the air quality in major cities would show negative trends till October, adding ""a number of measures have already been taken and new policies are being formulated to protect natural environment from hazardous effects of industrialisation.

Pakistan: World Environment Day goes unnoticed in Peshawar,"PESHAWAR, June 07 -- The World Environment Day went unnoticed, as no relevant activity was held on Sunday in the provincial metropolis, thanks to the rising tide of terrorism in the country./Despite the fact that pollution is a silent killer and has an equal effect on our lives like terrorism, the government authorities as well as non-governmental organisations are paying little attention to the problem./In addition to other factors, increasing number of vehicles without proper testing, evaluation and proper planning and smoke and dust on the roads have created an atmosphere which is hazardous for human life as it is causing rise in the number of patients of heart attacks, stroke, and respiratory diseases./Pollution, in fact, is the name of undesirable state of the natural environment being contaminated with harmful substances as a consequence of the human activities in various ways like smoke, dust, wastage of both water and dirt, and of course, noise, which also has a negative impact on the weather./According to a source in the Pakistan Meteorological Department, pollution has been one of the reasons behind intensity of heat and low rainfall in the city during recent years. Smog (air pollution) and carbon dioxide pollution can contribute to warming of the climate in the region. Acid rain is another phenomenon connected to pollution, the source said./The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials say different kinds of vehicles and brick kilns are the main cause of pollution in the provincial capital while the funds provided to the EPA to control the problem are insufficient./Only a few public transport vehicles undergo the Vehicles Emission Testing Department (VETS) test or meet the requirements while the police are least bothered about checking smoke-emitting vehicles plying various routes in the city./Under the law the police have powers to fine and confiscate vehicles causing smoke and noise pollution, but it has miserably failed in fulfilling this responsibility./A study was conducted by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) under the ENERCON/UNDP Fuel Efficiency in Road/Transport Sector (FERTS) Project in six major cities including Peshawar in 2003-2004. The study was conducted for pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, lead, nitrogen oxide (NOx), ozone, particulate matter (PM), PM10 and sulphur dioxide (SO2)./The result showed that PM10 concentrations in Peshawar exceeded 150ug/m3 (micrograms/metre-cubed) levels. Since the study was conducted in 2003-04, the situation would be more alarming today, as the traffic on the roads has increased manifold./As per that study, the level of air pollution was 20 times higher than the standard of the World Health Organisation Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: 'Vehicular emissions remain unchecked despite campaign',"KARACHI, June 22 -- Possessing one of the world's highest multi-pollutant index, Karachi suffers chronic air pollution and, despite a recent campaign against carbon-emitting vehicles across Sindh, the air quality within the mega city remains dismal./Minister for Environment Sheikh Afzal stated this while addressing a Sindh Assembly session on Monday./Upon being questioned by Nusrat Abbasi, the minister said that his department had recently launched a 'vehicular emission control programme' at an estimated cost of Rs44.918 million and close to 10,000 vehicles were examined during 2010. He added that 2,950 of the vehicles were found to be exceeding the emissions limit as per the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS)./Responding to supplementary questions by Nusrat Abbasi, Saleem Khokhar, Humera Alwani, Bilquees Mukhtar and Ghulam Mujadid Isran, Afzal further explained that so far 12,000-15,000 vehicles had been examined. He added that during the process they collected the necessary data from vehicles that were in violation of NEQS on Sharea Faisal, MA Jinnah and II Chundrigar Road, and directed the traffic police to issue challans to these vehicles as it was their responsibility./The environment minister informed the assembly that owners as well as operators of such vehicles were warned and issued with red stickers, which would be replaced with green ones once the necessary repairs were made so as to reduce the level of harmful emissions./He admitted that the campaign failed to yield significant results as smoke-emitting vehicles were still witnessed navigating roads, whereas in other countries these vehicles were sold as scrap./Afzal also said that the department did not have the power to ban rickshaws. However, he added that rickshaws were being converted to four-stroke ones under the directives of the superior judiciary, making them more environmentally friendly./Responding to another question by Nusrat Abbasi, the minister said Rs16 million was allocated for the establishment of a 'planning and monitoring cell' but it was not approved by the Planning and Development department (P&D) in the outgoing year. However, in the 2011-12 financial year, Rs20m had been allocated for it, he added./Replying to a query from Arif Jatoi, he said they had submitted a proposal to the P&D for a Rs70 million scheme regarding the feasibility study as well as remedial measures for the restoration of lakes and other water bodies in Sindh. He then expressed his regrets that P&D officials were not accommodating the environment department appropriately./Misuse of BISP funds: Law Minister Ayaz Soomro informed the house that the government would conduct an inquiry into the alleged misuse of funds allocated to the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which had been earmarked for supporting poor women in Umerkot district./Responding to the point of order raised by joint opposition leader Jam Madad Ali, Soomro said that they had received complaints against a post office official who allegedly mishandled the transfer of BISP checks, adding that the provincial government would approach the federal government in this regard Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.
