Pakistan:Living near busy street ups breathing problems,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 01 -- The closer people live to a main road, the more likely they are to suffer from respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing, a new study from Switzerland shows.""These findings from a general population provide strong confirmation that living near busy streets leads to adverse respiratory health effects,"" Dr. Lucy Bayer-Oglesby, of the University of Basel, and colleagues write in the American Journal of Epidemiology.While outdoor air pollution -- especially tiny particles that can be breathed deep into the lungs--is known to be hazardous to people's health, to date no researchers have looked at how proximity to main roads affects respiratory symptoms in a general population, Bayer-Oglesby and her team note.To investigate, they looked at data from a two-part study of air pollution and lung disease. It involved 9,651 randomly selected men and women aged 18 to 60 who enrolled in the study in 1991, 8,047 of whom re-enrolled for the second phase of the study in 2002.People's risk of having attacks of breathlessness increased by 13% for every 500-meter segments of main street located within 200 meters of their home. The risk of such attacks among people who had never smoked fell by 12% for each additional 100 meters between their homes and a main street.Individuals whose homes were within 20 meters of a busy road were 15% more likely to regularly have phlegm in their breathing passages, while they were 34% more likely to have wheezing with breathing problems. /The effects of traffic on respiratory health were stronger for men and for people who had never smoked.The effects of living near main streets were weaker in 2002 than in 1991, which may have been due to stricter requirements on auto emissions, the researchers note.""Living close to main streets or in a dense street network increases the risks for certain respiratory symptoms in adults, particularly for asthma-related symptoms such as attacks of breathlessness and wheezing and for bronchitic symptoms such as regular cough and phlegm,"" they conclude.

Air of big cities unhealthy,"The air quality of the federal capital and two provincial capitals i.e. Lahore and Karachi is unhealthy for the citizens, revealed Economic Survey of Pakistan (ESP) here Thursday.It is pertinent to mention here that there is no system of checking air quality of the rest of the cities in the country on regular basis. Mobile air monitoring stations are sent to specific areas in case of a need, which is not a proper solution and can not give the exact picture of the air quality of the other cities.The ESP stated sustainable development is the cornerstone of all efforts by the government, therefore, concern for environment- its protection, renewal and enrichment - has been reckoned as obligation towards the betterment of all the citizens at large.According to EPA, Pakistan, common gases emitted by vehicles include carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and ozone, all dangerous to human health beyond certain levels of concentration. According to the World Wide Fund (WWF) fact sheet, major air pollutants include: suspended particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, sulphur dioxide, lead & other heavy metals, ground level ozone and fuel wood.The sources of air pollution have been highlighted as motor vehicles, industry, municipal solid waste, smog and medical waste.Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons released by diesel-powered vehicles are known carcinogens, while smoke from diesel engines has aggravated already elevated levels of airborne soot, it said. /Nitrous oxides are emerging air pollutants with the highest concentrations recorded in Karachi, followed by Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar, and Islamabad. Industries located in urban areas are the main source of sulfur dioxide (dangerous to human, animal, and plant life) while brick kilns powered by low-grade coal are notable sources of soot.According to the data mentioned in the ESP, 2.5 is the standard of Particulate Matter (PM) in the air, which is within the safe limits. It said in the federal capital the PM level was 166, which falls in the category of unhealthy. The same is the case of Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab where the PM level was also recorded as 166 through Mobile station at hockey stadium. The PM level in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh, was 101 and it falls in the category of unhealthy for sensitive group.The ESP also quoted the World Bank's report 2006 according to which an estimated 35 percent of Pakistan's population living in cities. A substantial body of research demonstrates that high concentrations of suspended particulates in urban areas adversely affect human health, provoking a wide range of respiratory diseases and heart ailments. Given the lack of enforcement of motor vehicle fitness regulations, the increase in air pollution from vehicle population alone could be alarming.The problem is compounded by the fact that the average life of vehicles in use in the country is quite long. As a result, vehicles in Pakistan are estimated to emit 25 times the amount of carbon monoxide, 20 times the amount of hydrocarbons and 3.6 times the amount of nitrous oxide of an average vehicle in the United States.Though many cities are adversely affected, air quality monitoring is restricted to the six major cities of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta and Rawalpindi. Ambient concentrations of particulates in these cities lie consistently above the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, and are on average two to four times the recommended levels. It said that studies conducted in Lahore and Karachi, the two largest cities; suggest that carbon monoxide, cadmium and lead levels, in particular, may exceed thresholds recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).The ESP said that it was encouraging to note that the government had been quite successful in taking preventive measures to curb the emission of poisonousgases. It said Pakistan had become the largest user of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in the world, as per the statistics issued by the International Association of Natural Gas Vehicles (IANGV). Presently, more than 2 million vehicles are using CNG as fuel and 2,760 CNG stations are operational in different parts of the country (as on April 2009).The CNG used as has grown substantially in the transport sector, replacing traditional fuels while greatly reducing the pollution load in many urban centers. As a result, Pakistan has the largest fleet of vehicles running on CNG in South Asia, and is third worldwide after Argentina and Brazil.The latest statistics collected by the Ministry of Environment (MoEnv) suggested that the use of coal in power sector has persistently shown a decreasing trend during the last five years. This has mainly been caused by the conversion of a number of plants to natural gas. Likewise, there has been a considerable reduction in coal usage for domestic purposes.The use of biomass fuels in unventilated rooms has been identified as the primary cause of indoor air pollution, particularly in rural areas. Women and children are the most affected by it as they are more exposed and vulnerable to smoke inhalation. It said according to a report of the ADB, about 86 percent of rural households and 32 percent of urban households use biomass fuels for cooking purposes.The ESP said that the GoP had ensured implementation of an Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) to monitor the air quality at both Federal and four Provincial Capitals to help in managing the ever deteriorating air quality in major cities. The government has also given a road map for introducing Euro-II compliant vehicles in the country under the given road map. The Euro-II compliant Petrol Vehicles shall be introduced from 1st July, 2009.The ESP also linked the environmental degradation with the poverty because of the overwhelming dependence of the poor on natural resources for their livelihoods - whether agriculture, forestry, fisheries and hunting etc. Poverty combined with a burgeoning population and rapid urbanization, is leading to intense pressures on the environment.It also stated that country's natural resources are increasingly under stress due to rapid population growth and environmentally unsustainable practices and collective estimated environmental degradation costs the country at least 6 percent of GDP or about Rs. 365 billion per year, and these costs fall disproportionately upon the poor.The most significant causes of environmental damage include illness and premature mortality caused by air pollution (indoor and outdoor), (almost 50 percent of the total damage cost); Diarrhea diseases and typhoid due to inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene (about 30 percent of the total), and Reduced agricultural productivity due to soil degradation (about 20 percent of the total) development concern.The government of Pakistan has also declared 2009 as the National Year of Environment, which shows that the government is considering the environment as important as any other sector.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Indoor air pollution kills 46,000 in Bangladesh","DHAKA, June 20 -- Over 46,000 people die of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in Bangladesh each year due to indoor air pollution (IAP), according to Andrew Trevett, acting country representative for the WHO. His findings and those of others set out at a workshop in Dhaka on 15 June revealed that 70 percent of IAP victims were children under five. Here are the other main findings:n The risk of diseases like pneumonia, asthma, low birth weight, cardiovascular failure and tuberculosis among children doubles due to IAP.n Cooking, heating with solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves results in high levels of IAP.n Some 4 percent of all diseases in Bangladesh can be attributed to IAP.n IAP from burning wood, animal dung and other solid bio fuels is a major cause of ALRI.n Over 92 percent of households in Bangladesh use solid bio fuel for cooking purposes, releasing toxic substances like carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and high levels of harmful particulate matter.n Lack of proper ventilation in most kitchens contributes towards the heavy concentration of particulate matter indoors.n The level of particulate matter inside a kitchen using solid bio fuel is 30-35 times more than the World Health Organization (WHO) standard.n Women and children are particularly vulnerable as they spend most of their time indoors.n Low-income groups are particularly vulnerable as they can only afford solid bio fuel.n ALRI is responsible for 59 percent of all premature deaths among infants, mostly in Asia and Africa.n In developing countries, respiratory infection caused by IAP accounts for 1.6-2 million deaths a year. /Around one million of the dead are children.n More than three billion people worldwide continue to depend on solid fuels like biomass fuels and coal for their daily energy needs (WHO).n Ventilation could be one of the most important interventions to reduce the risk of indoor air pollution (Joseph Graziano, chairman of the Department of Environmental Health Sciences of the Columbia University).n Incomplete combustion of biomass emits powerful greenhouse gas pollutants including methane and carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change (Graziano).n IAP is a leading threat to public health in South Asia, along with malnutrition and lack of safe drinking water (Graziano).n Bringing about a change in the traditional cooking system would not be possible overnight, but is a priority.n IAP is responsible for 2.7 percent of the global burden of disease (WHO).Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
PICT to build $175 million 'pollution free' facility at Port Qasim,"KARACHI , Aug. 08 -- Port Qasim Authority (PQA) and Pakistan International Container Terminal (PICT) are all set to sign an implementation agreement to develop the 'pollution free' Coal, Cement and Clinker Terminal (CCCT) worth $175 million at Port Qasim. According to sources, PQA has issued the Letter of Intent (LoI) to PICT last Wednesday after which the two sides started negotiating the modalities for establishing the specialised terminal.After successful negotiations the matter would be referred to Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCOI) for approval, they added. /""The project is being undertaken under the landlord concept ensuring that it would earn more royalty for PQA with low tariff rates at the proposed terminal,"" Chairman PQA Vice Admiral Asad Qureshi (Retd) told Business Recorder. According to sources the required formalities would take at least a month after which the two port operators would sign the implementation agreement.The sources said the CCCT, a state-of-the-art facility to be constructed on 32-year Built-Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis at Port Qasim, would have a handling capacity of up to eight million tons per year. The terminal would have the capacity to accommodate coal, clinker and cement vessels of 75,000 dead weight tonnage, they said.They said that PICT would be required to execute the implementation agreement within 120 days with PQA after acceptance of the LOI. The most special thing about the facility, the source said, would be that its modern equipment which would not create any air pollution, as was the case at the coal terminal at Karachi Port.They said big mountains of powdery coal, lying and being handled in open/bulk on dedicated berths at Karachi Port, are not only inflicting irreparable damages upon the environment, but also causing various respiratory diseases, like tuberculosis, asthma etc, among the poor people living in areas adjacent to the port.""State-of-the-art equipment would be there to handle the coal at the pollution-free terminal, where cement and clinker would also be handled in future,"" the sources said.The PQA chief eyes the project as a 'step forward' in the development of PQA in terms of capacity enhancement. ""The project would enhance the port's capacity manifold, all the developed and developing mega projects at PQA could be possible because of the proactive strategy of Federal Minister for Ports and Shipping Babar Khan Ghauri"", he added.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.For more information on news feed please contact Surit Das at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
The silent pandemic,"Pakistan, Sept. 19 -- Stop worrying about swine flu for a minute, there's another 'pandemic' we need to be concerned about.Doctor Sneh Khemka, medical director from Bupa International says while many of us are panicking about the H1N1 virus, we're overlooking another disease that is sweeping the globe in a silent, but deadly way of its own - asthma.'In many people's minds, asthma is a mild condition that requires nothing more than a couple of puffs on an inhaler to keep it under control,' he says.'But asthma is a condition that can cripple and kill.'It's estimated that 300 million people have asthma worldwide. And more importantly, last year asthma killed over a quarter of a million people around the globe.'These significant increases in the prevalence of the disease are causing widespread economic and health burdens to communities where these burdens did not previously exist. They're also changing the health landscape significantly in urbanised areas where the disease is more common,' adds Doctor Sneh Khemka.Research shows great variation in asthma levels between different countries, with more urban, westernised nations tending to have the most cases.The highest levels of asthma exist here in the UAE, in the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Republic of Ireland and the USA. /The lowest are found in some Eastern European countries, Indonesia, Greece, China, India and Ethiopia.But why is there such a difference between countries? And why is asthma growing at all? The medical community doesn't really know but there have been several theories put forward.'Asthma is an inflammatory condition of the airways, where the lining of the air passages become inflamed,' explains Doctor Khemka. 'Asthma episodes occur when these airways contract, causing the characteristic 'wheeziness' and tightness of chest. There are many things that can trigger the reaction such as exercise, or even changes in the weather.'The Doctor says there are many theories about what has caused this significant and sustained rise, but most of them are related to how our patterns of life have changed, like diet.'One theory centres around dietary change. As the 20th century progressed, the diet in English speaking 'westernised' countries has come to contain less and less fruit and vegetables. The link between diet and asthma is far from proven, but some studies suggest an association. For example, one piece of research showed that eating foods containing vitamin E was linked with lower asthma rates. Another found decreased levels of asthma among fish eaters,' he says.'Another obvious risk arises from smoking and air pollution although we do question whether pollution actually causes asthma. We do know that higher rates of pollution can trigger asthma attacks if the person already has the condition, but whether it can actually cause the condition is debatable.'Doctor Khemka admits that the fact that asthma is on the increase mostly in urbanised areas suggests that pollution is partly to blame. This is corroborated by studies with monkeys that were exposed to higher levels of pollutants, who then developed the signs of asthma.Nevertheless studies show rates of asthma are very high in areas that have been officially certified as having clean air but Doctor Khemka says this may just be because those living in nice areas with clean air are rich enough to seek medical treatment and diagnosis.He adds: 'The rise in asthma and allergies remains puzzling for the medical and scientific community. While looking at trends around the world helps to shed some light on the mystery, we can't explain it yet.'However, what we do know is that asthma affects more and more of us in everyday life.'

Red alert for Sydney,"Pakistan, Sept. 25 -- The worst dust storm in decades swept across eastern Australia yesterday, blanketing Sydney and snarling transport as freak conditions also brought earthquakes, giant hailstones and even a tornado.Gale-force winds dumped thousands of tonnes of red desert dust on Australia's biggest city, shrouding it in an eerie orange haze and coating the iconic Sydney Opera House in a fine layer of powder.The storm, reportedly the most serious since the 1940s, then spread 600km up the coast to Queensland and could even hit New Zealand, almost 4,000km away, experts said.Dust covered most of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, pushing air pollution to record levels and depositing about 75,000 tonnes of powder in the Tasman Sea every hour.'Dust storms like this occur quite regularly but they rarely travel this far east,' said John Leys, principal research scientist with New South Wales' Department of Climate Change and Water.Sydney residents wore face masks and covered their mouths with scarves as they travelled to work under hazy skies.Traffic was bumper-to-bumper on major highways.Air transport was severely disrupted with passengers facing long delays at Sydney airport and many international flights diverted to Melbourne and Brisbane.Flag-carrier Qantas urged passengers to cancel any non-urgent travel, while budget offshoot Jetstar offered free flight rescheduling and refunds.'We encourage any passengers with non-essential travel arrangements to reconsider their travel plans for the day,' Qantas said in a statement.Sydney Ferries suspended harbour services and police warned drivers to take extra care in poor visibility. /Ambulance workers reported a sudden spike in people reporting respiratory problems.'We have already seen an increase in calls to people suffering from asthma and other respiratory problems,' New South Wales Ambulance Service said.Australia, in the grip of a decade-long drought, is emerging from an abnormally hot southern hemisphere winter including the hottest August on record.Elsewhere in New South Wales, hail stones 'the size of cricket balls' smashed windows as thunderstorms and gale-force winds lashed the state late on Tuesday.'We've had reports of cars with both their front and rear windscreens smashed,' an official from the State Emergency Service said.Further north, Queensland imposed a ban on lighting fires across large parts of the state a day after a dozen bush blazes sprang up following a spell of prolonged hot, dry weather.Victoria state was on alert for flash floods as heavy rains fell, following a pair of minor earthquakes on Tuesday afternoon.The 3.0 and 2.6-magnitude tremors did not cause any serious damage and no one was injured, officials have confirmed.Police in southwestern New South Wales, bordering Victoria, reported bizarre conditions on Tuesday as dark red skies thick with dust cut visibility to just two to three metres in some areas.'I've never seen anything like it in all my life, and I grew up here,' a police officer at the town of Broken Hill said. 'It was darker than night-time, and lasted for about half an hour. You couldn't even see the street lights.' And residents near the capital Canberra described how a mini-tornado tore through the small town of Murrumbateman late on Tuesday evening. 'It sounded like a jumbo jet rumbling on top of the roofs,' one resident told the Australian public broadcaster ABC. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Ailments are on, but don't panic","Pakistan, Oct. 22 -- Chandigarh--Winter is considered a healthy season, but ailments do come with it, say doctors. However, there is no need for alarm. Many of the ailments can be avoided simply with some preventive and protective measures.The late night and early morning drop in temperatures aggravates some common diseases like cold and flu. /The beginning of winter can prove a particularly stressful period for asthma patients.Since winter is associated with a lot of festivity, including Diwali, a lot of air pollution, caused from everything from house dust to firecrackers, can trigger a lot of respiratory tract infections.In fact, doctors and experts warn that the H1N1 virus can turn active. ""As temperatures drop below 28 degrees, H1N1 will survive longer and start spreading faster,"" says an expert.Elderly people as well as children are particularly prone to bacterial and viral infections, which come with the change in weather.Besides, a general decrease in physical activity and overeating due to festivities add to some common health ailments like high cholesterol.In fact, in the past a few years, some diseases like dengue and chikungunya, known to be common in summer, are also being reported during winter, especially in its first two months.Dr SK Bhandari, physician and former deputy medical superintendent of the GMSH-16, says winter brings in more respiratory tract infections than other ailments.But other vector-borne diseases like malaria and leptospirosis also continue to prevail during winter.""During winter, elderly people, children as well as asthmatics need to guard against common ailments like cold, flu and allergies and avoid very early or late evening walks,"" he says.Dr Reeta Kalra, a physician in Panchkula, adds skin ailments to the list of health problems associated with winter.""During winter, the sweeping action of philia of cells in the respiratory tract decreases, causing accumulation of mucous in the pathway. This increases chances of more allergic and viral infections in adults,"" she says.She says those in the age group of 65 to 70 years and children are prone to diseases like cold, cough and fever.These can be treated symptomatically without antibiotics. Smokers and diabetics are more prone to winter disease like RVNeumonia.Dr Meenu Singh, in charge of allergy and asthma clinic at the PGI, says winter also increases allergies and viral infections and aggravates asthma.""Due to the festive season, people clean their houses, which causes exposure to dust. This affects the elderly and children, besides troubling asthmatic patients,"" she says.The body takes time to adjust to the variation in temperatures. The elderly should take adequate precautions like protective clothing with the onset of winter and go out for walks only after the sun is up.

Iran: 5 ways to improve indoor air quality,"Pakistan, Nov. 08 -- We tend to think of air pollution as something outside -- smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. But the truth is, the air inside homes, offices, and other buildings can be more polluted than the air outside. The air inside your home may be polluted by lead (in house dust), formaldehyde, fire-retardants, radon, even volatile chemicals from fragrances used in conventional cleaners. Some pollutants are tracked into the home. /Some arrive via a new mattress or furniture, carpet cleaners, or a coat of paint on the walls.In that mix, you'll also find microscopic dust mites -- a major allergen -- plus mold and heaps of pet dander, says David Lang, MD, head of Allergy/Immunology at the Cleveland Clinic. ""Even if you don't have pets, you've probably got pet dander,"" he tells WebMD. ""It's become what we call a community allergen. Pet owners carry it around on their clothes and shed it throughout the day. You can't get away from it.""Children, people with asthma, and the elderly may be especially sensitive to indoor pollutants, but other effects on health may appear years later, after repeated exposure.Indoor allergens and irritants have become much more important in recent decades because we're spending more time indoors, Lang says. And because modern homes are airtight, these irritants can't easily escape. ""We're all exposed to a greater degree than we were three or four decades ago,"" he says.5 simple steps to improve indoor air quality1. Keep your floors fresh.Suck it up. Chemicals and allergens can accumulate in household dust for decades. By using a vacuum with a HEPA filter you can reduce concentrations of lead in your home. You can also get rid of other toxins, like brominated fire-retardant chemicals (PBDEs) as well as allergens like pollen, pet dander, and dust mites.Using a vacuum cleaner that has strong suction, rotating brushes, and a HEPA filter ensures that dust and dirt won't get blown back out in the exhaust. In high traffic areas, vacuum the same spot several times. Don't forget walls, carpet edges, and upholstered furniture, where dust accumulates. For best results, vacuum two or more times each week and wash out your filter regularly.Mop it up. Mopping picks up the dust that vacuuming leaves behind. You can skip the soaps and cleaners and just use plain water to capture any lingering dust or allergens. New microfiber mops (and dust cloths) reportedly capture more dust and dirt than traditional fibers and don't require any cleaning solutions whatsoever.Keep it out. Put a large floor mat at every door. People track in all sorts of chemicals via the dirt on their shoes. A door mat reduces the amount of dirt, pesticides, and other pollutants from getting into your home. If the mat is big enough, even those who don't wipe their shoes will leave most pollutants on the mat -- not the floors in your home.If you live in a home built before 1978, there's a good chance that lead paint still exists on your walls. But even in a newer home, you may face lead exposure -- from lead dust tracked in from outside. Lead dust can raise the risk of exposure for young children -- a serious problem that can damage the brain, central nervous system, and kidneys. Pesticides are also linked with brain damage in young children. Kids are vulnerable to higher exposures because they tend to get dust on their fingers and then put their fingers in their mouths.To best protect your family, ask people to remove their shoes when entering your home. Keep house shoes, slippers, and socks near the door.2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold love moisture. Keeping humidity around 30%-50% helps keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioner during summer months) helps reduce moisture in indoor air and effectively controls allergens, Lang says. An air conditioner also reduces indoor pollen count -- another plus for allergy-sufferers.More tips for dehumidifying your home:Use an exhaust fan or crack open a window when cooking, running the dishwasher, or bathing.Don't overwater houseplants.Vent the clothes dryer to the outside.Fix leaky plumbing to prevent moisture-loving mold.Empty drip pans in your window air conditioner and dehumidifier.3. Make your home a no-smoking zone. ""Probably the single most important aspect of indoor air pollution is secondhand cigarette smoke,"" says Philip Landrigan, MD, a pediatrician and director of the Children's Environmental Health Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals. Research shows that secondhand smoke increases a child's risk of developing ear and respiratory infections, asthma, cancer, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). For the smoker, this addiction causes cancer, breathing problems, heart attacks, and stroke.If you want to stop smoking, support groups, nicotine-replacement therapy, and other medications can help. Find a method that works for you, get some support (friends, family, fellow quitters, counseling), and think positive. Focus on your reasons for quitting -- not on your cravings.More Americans than ever before have kicked the habit, according to the CDC. But if you relapse, make sure you don't smoke inside the house. ""If you just can't quit, at least smoke outside,"" Landrigan says.4. Test for radon. Whether you have a new or old home, you could have a radon problem. This colorless, odorless gas significantly raises the risk of lung cancer. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. today. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground and into your home through cracks and holes in the foundation. Drafty homes, airtight homes, homes with or without a basement -- any home can potentially have a radon problem.Granite countertops have also been linked to radon. While experts agree that most granite countertops emit some radon, the question is whether they do so at levels that can cause cancer. Testing is easy, inexpensive, and takes only a few minutes. If you discover a radon problem, there are simple ways to reduce levels of the gas that are not too costly. Even high radon levels can be reduced to acceptable levels. The Environmental Protection Agency offers a ""Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction.""5. Smell good naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean kitchen or clean clothes. But synthetic fragrances in laundry products and air fresheners emit dozens of different chemicals into the air. You won't find their names on the product labels. Conventional laundry detergents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets, and air fresheners in solid, spray, and oil form may all emit such gasses.In one study, a plug-in air freshener was found to emit 20 different volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including seven regulated as toxic or hazardous under U.S. federal laws. But these chemicals were not included on the label -- only the word ""fragrance"" is required to be listed. But the actual composition of the fragrance is considered a ""trade secret.""Most fragrances are derived from petroleum products, and generally haven't been tested to see if they have any significant adverse health effects in humans when they are inhaled. (Tests usually focus on whether a fragrance causes skin irritation.) Some that have been tested raise concern. Phthalates are a group of chemicals often used in fragrances and also used to soften plastics. Studies show that phthalates disrupt hormones in animals. What can you do?Look for fragrance-free or naturally-scented laundry products.Switch to mild cleaners that don't include artificial fragrances.Stop using aerosol sprays -- deodorants, hair sprays, carpet cleaners, furniture polish, and air fresheners.Let in fresh air. Open windows so toxic chemicals don't build up in your home. What if you or your child has pollen allergies? Then keep rooms ventilated with a filtered air- conditioning system.Use sliced lemons and baking soda to get a clean scent in the kitchen.Bring nature indoors. Any room is prettier with a fern, spider plant, or aloe vera. It's also healthier. NASA research shows that indoor plants like these act as living air purifiers -- the foliage and roots work in tandem to absorb chemical pollutants released by synthetic materials. If you have kids or pets, make sure the plants aren't poisonous if ingested. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

BAngladesh: Air pollution in Ctg city poses serious health hazards,"Pakistan, Nov. 13 -- The air pollution from emission of black smoke of the unfit and ramshackle vehicles coupled with dusts in the port city has hit the highest point posing serious health hazards. Various diseases like bronchitis, asthma, breathing problems are almost doubled among the city dwellers owning to air pollution for last five years, physicians observed. Environmentalists said the air pollution from thousands of unfit vehicles has reached 100 per cent instead of its maximum tolerable range as considered 65 per cent of Hard Ridge Unit. /Besides, the pollution from dusts has also reached 300-400 microgram, though its tolerable range is 200 suspended particulated matters, microgram. The environmentalists detected the reason of such environmental deterioration in the port city for joint black smoke air, left out by the old and unfit vehicles with dusts in the open space. The doctors observed that such environment deterioration will continue unabated in the port city the respiratory deceases will be four times higher among the city residents. Chittagong environment directorate source said, a few swarming places including Bahaddarhat intersection, GEC crossing, Chawk Bazar, New Market and Agrabad commercial areas are the worst hit the air pollution in the city . Chittagong environment directorate source said most of the unfit diesel run different modes of transports is solely responsible for causing serious air polluting in the city. The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, Chittagong office source said over 20749 unfit lights and heavy vehicles including trucks, pickup, car and bus have been plying in the roads in the Chittagong city district and its adjacent areas without fitness certificates, depriving the government of huge revenues. Among the vehicles, diesel driven truck and pickup are 9100, bus 2200, car 7600 and rests 1849 are different vehicles like tempo, human hauler and microbuses, the source added. The BRTA, CED and traffic department of Chittagong metropolitan police have realised nearly Tk 1.2 crore as fine from 12,273 unfit and old vehicles in the port city since August 2002. Among the penalty CED realised Tk 48,78,000 from 1084 vehicles, BRTA realised Tk 41 lakh and traffic department realised Tk 12,12,800 from 6064 vehicles during the said period. The three state own organisations also filed 4132 cases against the such vehicles for polluting air during the period. The BRTA assistant director, Masud Alam, said those unfit vehicles not only polluted the air in the port city but also dodged around one fourth of the revenue in per fiscal year. Sources in the Chittagong Medical College Hospital said the patients of bronchitis; asthma and respiratory diseases have become almost double in last five years. Emergency and casualty department of the CMCH said over 323 accidents took place in Chittagong, Cox's bazar, Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari district in 2008-2009, which left 321 people dead and 450 injured and many accidents remain unreported. An ENT specialist, Dr Abdus Sattar, said the patients of asthma, cough lung and other allergy related disease become almost double to triple due to air pollution. Mohammad Abdus Sobhan, director of the CED, said they are carrying out the drive against emission of black smoke of the vehicles with the help of Chittagong district administration, traffic department, metropolitan and district police. But he admitted that the lack of coordination among government monitoring bodies are also responsible for stopping air pollution. He also suggested for water spray in the roads and enough tree plantation and beautification works to arrest the air pollution. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Iran: Let the sky be blue again,"Pakistan, Nov. 16 -- BEIJING-- ""What is pink? A rose is pink, by the fountain's brink. What is red? A poppy's red, in its barley bed. What is blue? The sky is blue, where the clouds float thro'...""Today if you sing that old nursery rhyme again, some children might correct you: ""No, the sky is gray, not blue!""/That might sting you a little bit. Yes, our sky is no longer blue, but instead gray, brown, even black sometimes.Nowadays, the sky in many places has been grayed by polluted air. One-tenth of the world's rivers and lakes have been darkened by industrial wastewater. From the North Pole to the South Pole, the Earth's temperature is rising at an alarming rate ""thanks"" to the unrestrained emission of carbon dioxide. All of these ""masterpieces"" are being done by human beings, and it's human beings who will bear the grave consequences.Among the people, innocent children are the ones who suffer the most. Statistics show that every year, more than 3 million people die from air pollution, two-thirds of whom are children less than 5 years old.More than 3.1 million people die from drinking unclean water every year, nearly 90 percent are children under five.Environmentalist Rachel Carson said in her famous 1962 book ""Silent Spring"" that ""to have risked so much in our efforts to mold nature to our satisfaction and yet to have failed in achieving our goal would indeed be the final irony. Yet this, it seems, is our situation. The truth, seldom mentioned but there for anyone to see, is that nature is not so easily molded...""We can't change the past, yet we can design our future. Since Carson made her thought-provoking warnings heard around the world, more and more countries, governments, businesses and individuals have realized the dire urgency of environmental protection, and have speeded up their efforts to save the planet.The heavily polluted River Rhine, once called the ""European toilet,"" has returned to life after decades of cleaning treatment, with water birds, and wild ducks playing in its crystal clear waters again.The once ""foggy city"" of London has now made its appearance clear to its citizens and travelers, with Big Ben and Buckingham Palace shinning in the sunlight.The ozone destroyer Freon has been eliminated, car gas emissions have been restrained, no more plastics, renewable energies are actively promoted, and more people are participating in environmentally friendly activities such as ""car free day."" We are taking action to save our mother planet.More and more children are being influenced by the ""green idea.""

Bangladesh: Rise in birth defects,"Pakistan, Nov. 17 -- Doctors in Iraq's war-ravaged enclave of Falluja are dealing with up to 15 times as many chronic deformities in infants and a spike in early life cancers that may be linked to toxic materials left over from the fighting.The extraordinary rise in birth defects has crystallised over recent months as specialists working in Falluja's over-stretched health system have started compiling detailed clinical records of all babies born.Neurologists and obstetricians in the city interviewed by the Guardian say the rise in birth defects - which include a baby born with two heads, babies with multiple tumours, and others with nervous system problems - are unprecedented and at present unexplainable.A group of Iraqi and British officials, including the former Iraqi minister for women's affairs, Dr Nawal Majeed a-Sammarai, and the British doctors David Halpin and Chris Burns-Cox, have petitioned the UN general assembly to ask that an independent committee fully investigate the defects and help clean up toxic materials left over decades of war - including the six years since Saddam Hussein was ousted.""We are seeing a very significant increase in central nervous system anomalies,"" said Falluja general hospital's director and senior specialist, Dr Ayman Qais. ""Before 2003 [the start of the war] I was seeing sporadic numbers of deformities in babies. Now the frequency of deformities has increased dramatically.""The rise in frequency is stark - from two admissions a fortnight a year ago to two a day now. /""Most are in the head and spinal cord, but there are also many deficiencies in lower limbs,"" he said. ""There is also a very marked increase in the number of cases of less than two years [old] with brain tumours. This is now a focus area of multiple tumours.""After several years of speculation and anecdotal evidence, a picture of a highly disturbing phenomenon in one of Iraq's most battered areas has now taken shape. Previously all miscarried babies, including those with birth defects or infants who were not given ongoing care, were not listed as abnormal cases.The Guardian asked a paediatrician, Samira Abdul Ghani, to keep precise records over a three-week period. Her records reveal that 37 babies with anomalies, many of them neural tube defects, were born during that period at Falluja general hospital alone.Dr Bassam Allah, the head of the hospital's children's ward, this week urged international experts to take soil samples across Falluja and for scientists to mount an investigation into the causes of so many ailments, most of which he said had been ""acquired"" by mothers before or during pregnancy.Other health officials are also starting to focus on possible reasons, chief among them potential chemical or radiation poisonings. Abnormal clusters of infant tumours have also been repeatedly cited in Basra and Najaf - areas that have in the past also been intense battle zones where modern munitions have been heavily used.Falluja's frontline doctors are reluctant to draw a direct link with the fighting. They instead cite multiple factors that could be contributors.""These include air pollution, radiation, chemicals, drug use during pregnancy, malnutrition, or the psychological status of the mother,"" said Dr Qais. ""We simply don't have the answers yet.""The anomalies are evident all through Falluja's newly opened general hospital and in centres for disabled people across the city. On November 2 alone, there were four cases of neuro-tube defects in the neo-natal ward and several more were in the intensive care ward and an outpatient clinic.Falluja was the scene of the only two setpiece battles that followed the US-led invasion. Twice in 2004, US marines and infantry units were engaged in heavy fighting with Sunni militia groups who had aligned with former Ba'athists and Iraqi army elements.The first battle was fought to find those responsible for the deaths of four Blackwater private security contractors working for the US. The city was bombarded heavily by American artillery and fighter jets. Controversial weaponry was used, including white phosphorus, which the US government admitted deploying.Statistics on infant tumours are not considered as reliable as new data about nervous system anomalies, which are usually evident immediately after birth. Dr Abdul Wahid Salah, a neurosurgeon, said: ""With neuro-tube defects, their heads are often larger than normal, they can have deficiencies in hearts and eyes and their lower limbs are often listless. There has been no orderly registration here in the period after the war and we have suffered from that. But [in relation to the rise in tumours] I can say with certainty that we have noticed a sharp rise in malignancy of the blood and this is not a congenital anomaly - it is an acquired disease.""Despite fully funding the construction of the new hospital, a well-equipped facility that opened in August, Iraq's health ministry remains largely dysfunctional and unable to co-ordinate a response to the city's pressing needs.

UAE: A breath of fresh air,"Pakistan, Nov. 22 -- A major study of chronic respiratory diseases is to be carried out in the United Arab Emirates.The study will look at diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) across the country,It is due to be launched next week by doctors at the medical faculty at the University of Sharjah, with the backing of UAE health authorities.The research will cover up to 1,500 UAE residents who will be randomly approached and asked about symptoms or signs of chronic respiratory illness, including cough and shortness of breath.Participants will also be questioned about their smoking habits and the environment in which they live, to help determine the prevalence of smoking, and the impact of air pollution.The study's announcement coincided with World COPD Day, which was held on Thursday.COPD is a smoking-related disease that is often only diagnosed when people reach their 50s and 60s after years of tobacco use, and requires on-going drug and oxygen therapy.About eight out of every 1,000 people globally suffer from COPD, many of whom are undiagnosed, according to estimates from Dr Bassam Mahboub, Associate Professor of the Medical Faculty at the University of Sharjah, and Vice Chairman of the Emirates Respiratory Society, who will lead the new study.""This is an important study that will fill a large gap in knowledge about the prevalence of chronic respiratory disease, including COPD, asthma and allergic rhinitis across the UAE,"" Dr Mahboub said.""The first part of the research will look at prevalence of symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath in a representative group of the population. /We will also be asking participants about smoking which will give us a more accurate picture of tobacco and shisha use, about which we still have little information.""Stage two of the study will see participants with symptoms undergoing lung function tests to make a diagnosis of either, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or COPD, which is often misdiagnosed as asthma.A recent study carried out in Al Ain reported that around 13.5 per cent of the local population suffered from asthma and 25 to 30 per cent had allergic rhinitis.""The Al Ain study data suggests there is a high prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis, and we need a further study to see if this data correlates with the whole of the UAE. Our new study will ask about the environments people live in, through which we hope to be able to show differences in respiratory disease between those who live in heavily polluted urban areas, and rural areas,"" Dr Mahboub said.

Bangladesh: Air pollution linked to 10% of unnatural deaths,"Pakistan, Nov. 23 -- Dhaka, ) - Air pollution is linked to more than 10 percent of unnatural deaths in Bangladesh, environmental scientists said on Saturday.Speakers at a seminar Saturday, referring to a recent Country Environment Analysis by World Bank, said as many as 22 percent of unnatural deaths in Bangladesh are caused by environmental factors.They said half of the deaths attributed to environmental factors are caused by air pollution.The seminar, titled 'Environmental Pollution: A Dhaka Perspective', also heard that winter levels of air pollution in Dhaka was ""the worst in the world"".Thousands of lives can be saved each year by cutting air pollution in the capital, said M Khaliquzzaman, an environmental scientist with the World BankAn estimated 15,000 premature deaths a year are attributed to poor air quality in Dhaka, according to an Air Quality Management Project (AQMP), funded by the government and the World Bank.Khaliquzzaman said as many as 3,300 of these deaths, and treatment of more than 80 million illnesses a year, could be prevented through the reduction of air pollution in the capital. This alone would save 0.34 to 1.0 per cent of the national income.Speakers at the seminar, hosted by the French-Bangladesh Association of Scholars and Trainees at Sheraton Hotel, stressed the need to introduce CNG-run vehicles across the country, not just in the capital Dhaka.WB's Khaliquzzaman also observed that the city's air would be more tolerable now if diesel-run vehicles-such as the old auto rickshaws, as well as the thousands of buses and trucks that still use the highly polluting fuel-were converted into CNG-run ones much earlier.He pointed out that a diesel-run engine causes ten times more air pollution than a CNG-run one.Eighty per cent of Dhaka's air pollution is caused by vehicles and around 20 percent from brick kilns in and around the city, he said.BUET assistant professor Zia Wadud said 5,200 deaths have been prevented in the city since 2007 through the conversion of diesel-run vehicles into CNG-run ones.An estimated 80, 000 diesel-run auto rickshaws were taken off the streets of Dhaka in 2007 and replaced with vehicles that run on Compressed Natural Gas.It cut air pollution by nine per cent, said Wadud.He said the measure had also saved around Tk 100 crore, or 1.4 per cent of GDP, in fuel and health costs.But, Wadud said, air quality in Dhaka in winter remains among the worst, if not ""the worst"", in the world despite the move to convert auto rickshaws as well as private vehicles to run on CNG in a huge move to curb air pollution.High levels of toxic particulates are carried in the air throughout the year Dhaka, but the air is most polluted the dry winter months of November and December. /It lessens during the rainy season, said Wadud.French ambassador Charley Causeret and National Chest Disease Institute's Dr Asif Mujtaba Mahbub, among others, also spoke at the seminar.Causeret said the seminar was very timely with the Copenhagen Climate Conference just weeks away.

Bangladesh:Experts for formulating comprehensive policy for air pollution control,"Pakistan, Nov. 25 -- Experts Monday called for formulating a coordinated policy to control air pollution that kills at least 15,000 people annually in the country.Talking to BSS they observed that the government could benefit up to 3.5 per cent of national income by reducing exposure to the environmental health risks. According to a World Bank report, air pollution kills 15,000 Bangladeshis each year and 6.5 million people in the cities suffer each year. /And the major disease is not diarrhoea, as is the popular perception, but acute respiratory infections caused mainly by polluted air.'Only air pollution causes as much as 11 per cent of deaths and diseases in Bangladesh, 'Environmental and social unit representative of World Bank M Khaliquzzaman said.He said Air Quality Index value in Dhaka city has reached up to 350 against the standard 100 AQI value.Major sources of air pollution in Dhaka are: vehicular air pollution-of which more than 80 per cent is caused by diesel- fired vehicles, biomass burning, brick kilns, re-suspended road dust and fugitive emission by industries, he said.In Dhaka, cases of children suffering from asthma and bronchitis have increased. Brickyards, dust from construction sites and old vehicles are the major sources of this phenomenon, experts said. Air quality in Dhaka is among the worst in the world, said Dr Zia Wadud, assistant professor at department of civil engineering of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).The World Health Organisation estimates that about 7,00,000 deaths annually could be prevented in developing countries if three major atmospheric pollutants - carbon monoxide, suspended particulate matter, and lead - were brought down to safer levels.Sources said the standard of suspended particulate matter level in Bagladesh is 200 'g/m3 in residential areas while the WHO guideline of SPM level is fixed at 120 'g/m3 (24 hours) in commercial areas.'The occurrence of SPM in air of Dhaka is alarmingly higher than the standards, it said.'Air pollution is responsible for increasing mortality, causing problem in respiratory symptoms and pulmonary functions.'There is excessive presence of some major air pollutants in Dhaka such as ozone, particulate matter of 2.5, PM10, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide.

India: Cure for coughing is in offing,"Pakistan, Nov. 25 -- London--A cure for coughing is in the offing, thanks to scientists who have identified the process that leads to the reflex.Coughing has largely remained a mystery to science. Now, a team in Britain has found that the problem actually lies with receptors on nerve endings in the lungs which react to irritants.For victims of persistent coughing in which no useful purpose is being served, the receptors on these nerve endings are repeatedly prompting the cough reflex.If those receptors are blocked, coughing could be stopped, according to scientists from Britain's National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London and Hull University.Lead scientist Prof Maria Belvisi of the National Heart and Lung Institute and Imperial College said: ""For some people, chronic coughing can be annoying and uncomfortable, but for others it can be distressing and can have a severe impact on their quality of life.""Many people say that certain things in the air can make them cough and we are very excited that we have shown, for the first time, exactly what is probably happening inside the lungs. /Now that we think we have cracked the mechanism, we can start investigating whether we can stop people from coughing excessively by blocking the receptor protein that triggers it,"" says Prof Maria Belvisi.In fact, in their research, involving guinea pigs and human volunteers, the scientists showed that irritants in the air - including cigarette smoke and air pollution - switch on receptor proteins in lung nerve endings called TRPA1. This in turn causes the cough reflex, the Daily Mail reported. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

India: Cartoon exhibition on air pollution,"Pakistan, Nov. 27 -- Bangalore--Transport Minister R Ashok urged the people to use public and mass transport and said that both the government and the public should come together to prevent the destruction of the planet.Ashok was speaking at the inauguration of a Cartoon Exhibition at Chitrakala Parishat on Wednesday as part of the activities for 'Air Pollution Control Month - November 2009'. The exhibition organised by the Karnataka Cartoonists Association along with the Transport department was inaugurated by actor Ramya. Over 70 cartoons by cartoonists from all over the state were displayed. Over 200 entries came from about 75 participants for the competition and the cartoonists of the association also gave away prizes. Meanwhile, the Minister said that it had become hard to call the city 'Garden City' anymore and spoke about the importance of rejuvenating the lakes. Actor Ramya, who did her bit by drawing a caricature of what seemed like a BMTC bus billowing smoke said that the Government should consider an exchange scheme for old autorickshaws with new eco-friendly ones. In response, Ashok also said that a study between the amount of pollution caused by a bus and 50 luxury cars will set the matter straight.

Bangladesh: How do toxic chemicals move around planet?,"Pakistan, Dec. 03 -- Even hundreds of miles from the nearest industrial or agricultural activity, the sea ice, ocean, and Arctic plants and animals regularly yield evidence of elemental and synthetic chemical contamination. This contamination includes not only herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides-chemicals that are used in open air, may have washed directly into rivers or are released from factories-but also metals, among them mercury as well as flame retardants and water repellants, among other substances that are, at least in theory, incorporated into the materials of the products they're designed to enhance.Among the errant compounds now found regularly in the Arctic, for example, are brominated flame retardants, including those known as PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) used widely in upholstery foam, textiles, and plastics. Also routinely recorded in the far north-some at remarkably high levels-are perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) used as stain repellants, waterproofing agents, and industrial surfactants (think Scotch-guard, Teflon, Gore-Tex, and the slick coating on paper used in food packaging such as pizza boxes, candy wrappers, and microwave popcorn bags).These same compounds are now being detected in animals and people all over the world. A network of more than forty sampling sites has found evidence of synthetic chemicals that do not break down into nontoxic components-a mix of pesticides, fossil-fuel emissions, and industrial compounds-virtually everywhere it looked, from Antarctica, North America, Australia, and Africa to Iceland. /A recent five-year study conducted in U.S. national parks across the American West and Alaska found these same contaminants in the majority of its snow, soil, water, plant, and fish samples.It's not known when the first persistent synthetic chemical contaminants arrived in the Arctic, but this kind of pollution has been detected there on a regular basis since the 1960s. ""Everyone thought the Arctic was pristine, so we were taken aback to find such high contaminant levels in top predators,"" says Gary Stern, a senior scientist with Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans. But ""anything released in the mid-latitudes travels rapidly north.""Long-lasting synthetic chemicals are often referred to as ""persistent organic pollutants,"" or POPs for short. Used in this way, ""organic"" means that the chemical compound contains one or more carbon atoms and not all organic compounds are toxic or persistent.Public awareness of POPs such as DDT, PCBs, and dioxins has been growing. By 2001 concern about the environmental and health impacts of POPs had risen sufficiently to prompt the United Nations Environment Programme to formulate a treaty called the Stockholm Convention aimed at curtailing the use and release of these chemicals. ""Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) can lead to serious health effects,"" writes the organisation that administers the Stockholm Convention, ""including certain cancers, birth defects, dysfunctional immune and reproductive systems, greater susceptibility to disease, and even diminished intelligence."" (The United States has signed, but as of 2009 had not yet ratified, the Stockholm Convention-so it has not been a full participant in its meetings and decision making, and its use of chemicals is not yet formally bound by the Convention's regulations.)By taking samples at numerous study sites over extended periods of time, scientists have discovered that some contaminants travel entirely by air-these are what Frank Wania of the University of Toronto calls fliers. Some-the swimmers-stay in the water, circulating with ocean currents. Most are hoppers, though; they make their way north in what's been dubbed the grasshopper effect, a series of air- and waterborne hops, moving toward the Arctic with cyclical and seasonal patterns of evaporation and condensation.""Chemicals have several ways to be present in the atmosphere,"" explains Wania. Depending on temperature and weather conditions, as well as the size, shape, and the elements that make up the molecule, the same substance can be found dissolved in water, as a gas, or as a particle. The smaller the molecule, the more volatile it typically is, and therefore the more likely to be swept along with atmospheric currents as a gas. These gas phase molecules- the fliers-can move in several meters per second, making the trip from their points of origin to remote locations like the Arctic in days or weeks. At the opposite extreme, the waterborne swimmers can take years to reach the same destination.The hoppers, intermediate-sized molecules that can move between gas, liquid, and particle phase, may take days, weeks, or even years to reach the Arctic after their initial release. These hoppers may be present in liquid water, but as temperatures warm they will evaporate to gas phase but then condense and return to join water when temperatures cool. They'll repeat this cycle over and over again, rising and falling-or hopping-with daily and seasonal patterns of warming and cooling. It's in this way that many persistent chemicals move with clouds and precipitation as storm systems and ocean currents circle the globe, and why temperatures so strongly influence how and where pollutants travel.""Persistence and mobility is what makes something troublesome,"" says Wania. ""It's a very difficult, laborious, and time-consuming process to prove toxicity, and by the time you have evidence it may be too late."" If a substance is ""persistent, highly mobile, and can't be contained, you have a problem you can't rectify.""Another major influence on the movement and deposition of persistent pollutants is precipitation. Put simply, the more it rains or snows the more likely these contaminants are to wash out of clouds and be deposited on land, lakes, rivers, and oceans. In a recent paper Wania and colleague Torsten Meyer note, ""Real substances affected by changes in rain rate include lindane, aldrin [both highly toxic and persistent pesticides], highly chlorinated PCBs, PBDEs, and some currently used pesticides."" When it's warmer, more of these substances will tend to evaporate again and join the cloud layer, and from there the cycle of condensation and precipitation begins again. When present as aerosols, the contaminants may even accelerate precipitation as water droplets coalesce around the tiny solids.Whatever affects atmospheric and ocean circulation clearly plays an important role in where environmentally roving persistent pollutants end up. The big hemispheric wind and ocean patterns known as gyres and oscillations all play a part-as do more localised storm systems and currents. ""These routes all seem to force contaminants released in Europe to the Arctic,"" explains Derek Muir, a senior scientist in aquatic ecosystems research with Environment Canada who specialises in contaminants. ""Think about Chernobyl,"" Muir says by way of illustration. ""The radioactivity there ended up in western Scandinavia where a lot of reindeer were sacrificed as a result. Other contaminants follow the same pathway north from Russia.""What happens once pollutants reach the far north is very much influenced by where there is ice. Ice typically stabilises contaminants and holds them in place until they're released again when temperatures rise high enough for melting to begin. Greenland, which Muir describes as ""a big block of ice 3,000 meters or more thick,"" appears to be acting as a source of contaminants in the Arctic as well as a sink.On the east side of Greenland and across the Greenland Sea on the remote Norwegian islands of Svalbard that reach all the way up to 80 degrees north-in the path of air and water currents coming off of Greenland and the European mainland-levels of PCBs, PBDEs, and perfluorinated compounds have been found to be particularly high. Svalbard's polar bears have contaminant levels higher than bears on the west side of Greenland or in the Canadian Arctic, says Muir, largely because of increased melting.When pollutants are released within range of the Atlantic Gulf Stream or get picked up by northerly air currents that also blow east, North American pollutants can also be transported across the Atlantic toward Europe. Similarly, air masses may travel a northeasterly path from Asia across the Pacific to North America. Thanks to the trans-Pacific air currents, pollutants released in China make tracks across the north Pacific and cause local air pollution health problems in Japan and Korea. Dust from China can reach California in as few as four days and makes a regular contribution to formation of Los Angeles smog.The chemistry of some contaminants-those that are heavier and less volatile-causes them to drop out of the atmosphere into the northern Pacific Ocean where they may move slowly through the water or be taken up by fish and marine mammals. Persistent pollutants that include PCBs, brominated flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds have been consistently found in fish, seals, whales, and fish eating birds along the Pacific coast over the past decade. ""Fish can become their own transports of contaminants and fish-eating birds are known to excrete contaminants,"" says Robie Macdonald, a research scientist with the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. ""Migrating animals are not a huge transport mechanism but it's focused, because they take the contaminants to where they feed and hatch their young.""Lipophilic literally means ""fat loving,"" and this term is used to describe chemicals that have an affinity for and are soluble in fat. Materials with this property are also often persistent-that they are fat- rather than water-soluble makes them resist environmental degradation. And they are ""bioaccumulative""-when they lodge in fat cells they can accumulate in plant or animal tissue as part of the fat reserves being stored for energy. When an animal burns fat for energy-this happens in people as well as in birds and fish-the fat cells release their contaminants.There are multiple ways people may absorb a particular lipophilic chemical, however, which is one reason figuring out sources of human exposure to these contaminants is tricky. For example, people are exposed to brominated flame retardants through household dust but also through food they eat that has accumulated these chemicals in its fat. In the Arctic-where contaminants are aggregating and animals that are staples of the traditional Northern diet have large stores of fat-the region's top predators, polar bears and humans, have some of the world's highest exposures to these pollutants. -Scientific AmericanMonica Danon-Schaffer is a chemical engineer at the University of British Columbia who is investigating how and why these kinds of chemicals are ending up in water in the Canadian Arctic.

Sri Lanka:Childhood Asthma,"Pakistan, Dec. 04 -- The normally functioning lungs allow oxygen to enter the body in exchange for its waste product, mainly carbon dioxide. The air that is breathed is conducted from the environment to the gas exchanging deepest parts of the lung by a set of tubes known as the airways. As the air passes through the nose and mouth, it is rapidly warmed and moistened to avoid injury to the delicate lining of the airways. The air is then transported through smaller airways. /These airways branch like a tree, so that large numbers of small airways can carry oxygen to the tiny air sacs called alveoli. The airways have a delicate cellular lining which is coated with a thin layer of mucus. Foreign particles are trapped by the sticky mucus and eventually removed from the airways through the normal cleansing processes such as the cough. Bundles of muscles surround the airways and the contraction of these muscles allows airways to selectively direct the flow of air. These muscles are also able to contract in response to various types of inhaled irritants.Asthma in children is an obstructive respiratory condition characterized by recurring attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath, prolonged exhalation and an irritating cough. It is the commonest recurrent respiratory disorder in children. Although the disease can begin in infancy, it is often difficult to diagnose asthma in very young children. Once the full presentation with characteristic breathing difficulties develop at a later age the diagnosis becomes quite obvious. Asthma is a chronic disease that causes the airways, which are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs, to become sore, swollen and narrower. It is an inflammatory condition of the bronchial airways. This inflammation causes the normal reactions of the airways to become excessive and over-reactive, thus producing increased mucus, swelling of the mucosal lining and contraction of the muscle layer of the airways. These changes produce airway obstruction, chest tightness, coughing and wheezing. If severe, this can cause marked shortness of breath and lowering of the blood oxygen levels. Each individual suffers a different level of severity and there is a wide spectrum of severity. In the case of children, most of them who suffer from asthma do enjoy periods of reversal of symptoms until something triggers the next episode. Children have smaller airways than adults and this makes asthma especially serious for them.Worldwide, many millions of children suffer from asthma. The disease tends to show marked geographical variations, even within the same country. In the United States of America about 9 million children are afflicted by the disease. In Sri Lanka, the best estimates suggest that about 20 to 30 per cent of children suffer from asthma and this figure varies within these values in different areas of the country. The disease in a given population of children shows a rather broad range of severity as well and, in some children, long periods of remission are quite well known. Even in them, episodic attacks could occur without warning even after a considerable period of freedom from symptoms. While the majority has rather mild symptoms, about 1 to 2 percent of childhood asthmatics suffer from a severe form of the disease. Such children are at risk of even dying during an acute episode.Common symptoms of asthma include coughing which may be constant or intermittent, wheezing or whistling sounds audible when a child exhales and shortness of breath or rapid breathing. This implies that any child who has frequent coughing or so called ""phlegm"" should be evaluated for asthma. The child who coughs after running or crying also may have asthma since exertion is known to precipitate asthma. Recurrent night cough, especially around mid-night and up to about 4.00 am, is common as asthma often gets worse at night. Chest tightness and shortness of breath are other symptoms of asthma that may occur alone or in combination with any of the above symptoms. Since many of these symptoms can occur for reasons other than asthma, other respiratory diseases must always be considered. In a young child the discomfort of chest tightness may lead to unexplained irritability. They may complain that their chest ""hurts"" or ""feels funny."" Infants who have trouble feeding or who grunt during suckling may also have asthma. Until rapid breathing, wheezing and coughing become obvious, the condition of many children with asthma may go undetected. These children with asthma usually suffer some degree of airway obstruction, and unless it is brought under control the children may suffer respiratory illnesses more frequently than normal children. Hidden asthma, however, can produce so few recognizable symptoms that even a health care provider might not be able to distinguish abnormal breath sounds with his or her stethoscope, but it may cause subtle problems such as limitation of physical activity.There is a strong hereditary factor associated with the disease. Family members of the child may have a history of asthma, eczema and catarrh, singly or in combination. Such an association is strongest when it occurs in the mother and to a lesser extent in the father and other siblings of the affected child. However this is not an invariable finding and families with such profiles could have perfectly normal children. On the other hand, it is also true to say that asthma can occur in a child whose parents and other siblings are perfectly normal.A number of studies have shown that a considerable proportion of children who develop asthma have several allergies as a trigger for the asthmatic state. Often a child develops eczema, then develops allergic nasal symptoms such as catarrh and subsequently goes on to develop asthma. This progression has been termed the ""allergic march"". This of course does not mean that one invariably leads to the other. There is a commonly held myth that if eczema or catarrh is treated then the child could develop asthma. There is no scientific basis for this false belief.Many things can trigger asthmatic attacks in predisposed children. Some of these are exercise, respiratory infections, allergies, irritants, weather and even emotions. Running and other forms of exercise can trigger an episode in over 80 percent of children with asthma. Respiratory infections, including the flu, frequently trigger episodes of asthma. Research indicates that these infections are most frequently produced by viruses, rather than bacteria. Many children with asthma have their symptoms triggered by allergies. The allergens involved are common indoor inhalants such as dust mites, feathers, moulds, pets, insects such as cockroaches, outdoor inhalants such as moulds and pollen. Although in some cases, ingested foods are known to act as triggers, they are much less frequent causes of asthma. Allergy may be the cause of unrecognized or hidden asthma. Minor allergic reactions can be more important than more obvious or severe reactions in the sense that an allergic person tends to avoid exposure to allergens that have caused severe reactions while ignoring the minor allergens. Irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, strong odours, aerosol sprays and paint fumes are some of the substances which irritate the tissues of the lungs and upper airways. The reaction produced by these irritants can be identical to those produced by allergens.Children with asthma are known to respond adversely to a number of climatic conditions as trigger factors. Many identify cold air as triggering asthma. Esoteric lung function studies demonstrate that breathing cold air provokes asthma in most children with asthma. A commonly held myth is that children with asthma have a major psychological problem that has caused the asthma. Emotional factors are not the cause of asthma, though emotional stress can infrequently trigger asthma. Emotions are associated with asthma for another reason. Many children with asthma suffer from severe anxiety during an episode as a result of the feeling of suffocation produced by asthma. The anxiety and panic can then produce rapid breathing or hyperventilation which further triggers and perpetuates the acute attack of asthma.The two main factors that contribute to asthma are inflammation of the airway passages and hyper-reactive or over-reactive airways. When triggered by a stimulus, certain cells lining the airways release chemical substances called mediators that lead to inflammation. This inflammation causes the airway passages to swell, the cells lining the passages to produce excess mucus, and the airway opening to narrow. Hyper-reactivity means that when the bronchi are exposed to certain stimuli they respond in an exaggerated way by constricting the airway muscle, narrowing the airways and making it difficult to breathe.Asthma often worsens at night for a few reasons. The body releases chemicals during the night that may alter lung function. Also, the body's temperature tends to drop at night, which causes the airways to cool. Lastly, an exposure to allergens during the day may take up to several hours to affect the body. Asthma occurring during the night time, which is known as nocturnal asthma, even if mild, is considered dangerous because many asthma deaths occur during the early morning hours. If a child has even mild asthma symptoms during the night it is important that the doctor is informed of this symptom.A paediatrician relies heavily on the observations of the parents for diagnostic clues, especially in young children. Recurrent or constant coughing spells, sometimes at night, may be the only sign of an asthmatic state. Diagnosis is made by the medical history, including family history and symptoms and physical examination. Occasionally certain tests such as lung function tests, chest x-rays and even allergy testing may be necessary to establish the diagnosis in doubtful cases. However, in the majority, these tests are not indicated.The effects of asthma on children vary considerably. It is important that any acute attack of asthma is treated promptly, properly and adequately. If the attacks are frequent and severe there could be marked effects such as interference with normal activities and schooling, chest deformities, growth retardation and several psychological effects. Mild episodic attacks that occur infrequently are generally not associated with any significant long-term effects. However, any attack that is severe, even if it occurs once in a blue moon, may threaten life as well. Children who show rapid progression of the attack, those who have difficulty with speaking in sentences during attacks, episodes that severely interfere with feeding and food intake, those that respond poorly to the child's usual medications and those in which the child looks quite ill, need immediate medical attention and in most cases admission to hospital. Such attacks may be life-threatening and unless treated promptly and appropriateely, could lead to unfortunate fatalities. It must be noted that any acute asthmatic attack could be effectively treated with the medications and facilities available in any hospital of this country.

India: Vehicular pollution hits Noida hard,"Pakistan, Dec. 07 -- There has been no serious effort to reduce the level of air pollution. Vehicles alone are adding 70 per cent to city's pollution level these days. /Till CNG is made mandatory for all vehicles in the high tech city, black smoke emitting from vehicles of all variety will continue to constitute a major health hazard.To cap it, the sizeable industrial pollution and one can imagine the damage being done to public health in G B Nagar.Already Noida ranks among the five most polluted cities of Uttar Pradesh. If timely steps are not taken, it will soon become difficult to breathe in open air.In Uttar Pradesh, the first Pollution Day was observed in 1984 after which the level of pollution has constantly been on the rise. Even Pollution Control Board's role has become confined to periodically collecting data only. No concrete policy appears to have been framed to reduce the pollution level.Noida Authority and the district administration also appear to be neglecting their role and responsibility in this regard.According to Paras Nath, regional officer of Pollution Control Board, ""Increasing number of vehicles is playing havoc by alarmingly raising the level of pollution in the area. Conversion to CNG can greatly help in controlling its level,"" he said. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

India: Chennai among 16 most polluted cities,"Pakistan, Dec. 11 -- For a seaside city, Chennai is unreasonably 'polluted'. One would expect that the long stretch of the Marina beach would usher in ample fresh air to cleanse the usual pollutants in the city, but that is not the case. The Union ministry of environment has included Chennai city, home to over seven million people, in the list of 16 most polluted cities in the country.Suggesting that the government cut down on the number of vehicles registered each day, environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman, said, ""At present, over 800 new vehicles are registered each day. /It is high time that the government reduced the average registration per day.""""Schools and offices start and end at the same time and this common timing is the major reason for traffic congestion. Timings could be altered to make travelling within the city easier.""He added that the air quality in Adyar was good because of the numerous society grounds, the lush green cover and its proximity to the sea.Though Traffic Ramasamy fights for various social causes, he is always the first one to raise his voice against transportation problems. Commenting on the vehicular population he said, ""There is an urgent need to repair the roads in the city. I do not find a single road of decent quality, in the city. Good quality roads with proper traffic signals should be invested in, to avoid traffic congestion, which is said to be the major reason for the air pollution,"" said Traffic Ramasamy.The directorate of the public health and preventive medicine will soon sign an MoU with the Sri Ramachandra Medical University to check the levels of air, water and soil pollution in the city. ""We have decided to spread awareness among people about the dangers of pollution. Along with the environment department of the SRMC, we will collect samples from various parts of Chennai periodically and release the reports as regular bulletins.""Explaining the effects of air pollution, Dr.Elango said, ""Children and elderly people are the most vulnerable. Sore throat, watering of eyes and nose, and severe headache are the initial effects of air pollution. Prolonged exposure to polluted air will result in chronic asthma and other respiratory diseases.""State traffic commissioner, S. Machendranathan pointed out that his department had already instructed that all new auto-rickshaws, must run only on LPG. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Kuwait:Um Al Hayman factories'' relocations proposal ''misleading MPs'',"KUWAIT, Dec. 21 -- Dr. Mubarak Al Ajmi, a researcher in the field of environment, said that the recommendations made by the Environment Public Authority regarding the air pollution in Um Al Hayman area ""is misleading for the MPs in the National Assembly, who have been trying to expose the case.""Al Ajmi explained that recommendations suggested by the assigned team that inspected the western Shuaiba factories which endorsed ""shutting down and relocating 37 out of 156 factories which belong to the private sector from the outskirts of Um Al Hayman area to a deserted area, will never solve the problem of pollution for several reasons, notably the result of a study carried out in the area previously where the number of factories was only around 40.""Al Ajmi explained that the study even then showed that pollution would remain high and that S2O (Sulfur Dioxide) emissions were estimated at 998, 017, 10 times higher than the rate permitted by international standards. Similarly, NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), estimated at the time at 39, 721 tons, was 1,423 tons more than allowable amount of hydro carbonic substances, 690 times over the permitted limit of Carbon Dioxide, and 37 times over of ammonia limits.Al Ajmi argues that such huge quantities of poisonous gas have been the cause of different kinds of diseases to the residents of Um Al Hayman, ranging from deformities, heart attack, blood pressure and diabetes as well rheumatism. ""The number of factories is not the issue here. /The amount of gas emissions from these factories are intensive enough to cause such problems. Besides, it is not only the factories which contribute to the pollution but also the refinery oil factories and water and sewage plants relocated nearby,"" he remarked.Al Ajmi reasons that the Um Al Hayman area is not fit for humans as it is located in the middle of the wind course emanating from nearby oil factories owned by the government and the private sector. ""What makes matters worse is that north westerly winds and north easterly winds crisscross in this area almost 60 percent of the year, which makes the area a target of concentrated poisonous gases. It would be more fitting to have solutions based on scientific and technological concepts,"" he noted. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

India: Polluting Unit: Villagers' fight for health revival,"Pakistan, Dec. 22 -- Mandi Ahmedgarh--As environmentalists gather at Copenhagen to devise methods to counter growing pollution, residents of Jitwal village and localities surrounding it are waging a battle to seek revival of their health affected by uncontrolled carbon emissions from a factory situated at the village.Responding to an appeal by Dhuri legislator Iqbal Singh Jhoondan at Vidhan Sabha recently, the state government has initiated action against the erring industrial unit - Ralson Carbons - but steps have not been taken to gauge the loss caused to residents over the decades.Claiming that management committee of the industrial unit would not be allowed to run the plant without making necessary amendments under the guidelines of the Punjab Pollution Control Board, Iqbal Singh Jhoondan said he would take up the matter with the Chief Minister and get a medical team deputed to examin all residents.Jhoondan said a special committee led by a senior environment engineer of the PPCB had been constituted after the issue was raised in the Assembly recently.Acting under the provisions of the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, the board had proscribed the management committee of the industrial unit from running pollution causing plant till necessary amendments were made.The administration has also decided to send another team to evaluate pollution fighting arrangements already made.Investigations by The Media revealed that residents of Jitwal village and 12 other localities had been facing the brunt of pollution causing emissions of the unit established in 1984.The affect of the carbon particles could be gauged easily from blackened walls of buildings and road surface in the vicinity of the unit.Organised protests by social organisations of the area had failed to impress upon the authorities to direct the management cut the level of carbon emissions.This was probably the first time that the issue was raised in the Assembly.Recognising the role of the legislators in action initiated to curb the menace, residents have demanded that those suffering from diseases allegedly caused due to pollution should be provided treatment free of cost either by the government or the management committee of the unit. /Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Oman:Climatic cracks of doom surface in green Bhutan,"Pakistan, Dec. 27 -- For centuries Punakha Dzong monastic fortress in Bhutan's Himalayas has sheltered ancient Buddhist relics and scriptures from earthquakes, fires and Tibetan invasions. Now the lamas here may have met their match - global warming. At least 53 million cubic metres of glacier melt is threatening to break the banks of a lake upstream in the Himalayan peaks and spark a ""mountain tsunami"" in Punakha valley. /The government is pressing the lamas, so far unsuccessfully, to transport relics to a nearby hilltop for safekeeping. Massive flooding could inundate these valleys, which hold about a tenth of Bhutan's population, by 2015.""Pollution has disturbed our deities,"" Leki Dorji, a red-robed lama, said in a courtyard as monks chanted mantras. ""It's for that the rains have not come on time, that we have not had snow for five years."" Bhutan, one of the earth's greenest and most isolated countries and one of the few states that absorbs more carbon than it emits, faces the impact of a rise in global temperatures despite environmental polices lauded the world over. It is not just about holy relics, but the livelihood of a nation dependent on Himalayan glacier-fed rivers which are also the life-blood for hundreds of millions of people downstream in the plains of South Asia.""It has not been easy to conserve our ecological balance,"" Prime Minister Jigmi Y. Thinley said in an interview. ""It has come at a cost. We could have been much richer."" ""Now we are as vulnerable and exposed as other countries."" For the monks it may be angry deities. But science says the threat to Punakha is due to rising global temperatures melting the world's ""third pole"" of Himalayan glaciers. The government has identified 26 glacier lakes in Bhutan at risk of what is called Glacier Lake Outburst Floods, when accumulated melt breaks its moraine banks. Scientists say that glaciers in Bhutan are retreating by around 30 metres a year.Many lamas in Punakha Dzong - both a monastery and a fortress, and once Bhutan's capital - believe deities will ultimately protect relics from whatever extreme weather can throw at them. The monastery was damaged by a similar glacier outburst in 1994. Then monks gathered to pray for their treasures' safety, especially Bhutan's most precious relic - the Rangjung Kharsapani, the self-created image of the deity of compassion. At least 20 people in the valley were killed them. The next torrent of water would be three times greater.""We hope to convince the monks to move the relics. If the next lake bursts, you can imagine what it would trigger,"" Thinley said. ""Our valley, settlements, or farms would be swept away."" Bhutan, with under 700,000 people in an country roughly the size of Switzerland, has a constitution that guarantees 60 per cent of its land must be forested. Air pollution hardly exists. There are only 33,000 vehicles.THREATS TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL SHANGRI-LABut there are other cracks in this environmental Shangri-la.The government says global warming will soon not just impact its glaciers, but threaten its efforts to develop hydroelectric power and also damage crops with erratic weather. After an initial increase, melting will eventually lead to reduced river flows, threatening plans to increase hydroelectric power from 1,500 megawatts to 10,000 megawatts within a decade. ""Hydroelectric power is the backbone of our economy,"" said Sonam Yangley, director general of the National Environment Commission. Global warming is already blamed for increasing erratic monsoons and snows, making it hard for crops. Warming has led some farmers to grow oranges in Himalayan valleys.Pests like rodents are appearing higher up in the Himalayas. Cases of lowland diseases like malaria and dengue are increasing. ""For agriculture, erratic weather is the biggest challenge,"" said Agricultural Minister Pema Gyamtsho. ""Rainfall doesn't come to May, then there is a torrent for three days and causes a lot of damage. Then we have a spell of drought."" Bhutan plans to mitigate these risks. But that can be expensive for a nation with a $1 billion economy. The country already depends on official aid for nearly half its budget. Just take the Thorthormi glacier threatening the monastery. Some 300 workers hiked with yaks for 10 days to drain the lake. Two lakes are separated by a thinning 30-metre moraine. If they join, the combined force will spill down the valley.Working at more than 4,000 metres above sea level, workers drained around 0.86 centimetres, half what they aimed. The project cost $7 million, and that is just one glacier among hundreds. Many Bhutanese feel hard done by. Their government has made more efforts to lead the ways with environment policies, but its very success has often made its own problems ignored. ""We hope to get due compensation for increasing forest cover,"" said Gyamtsho, referring to the spread in forests from more than 60 per cent to 72 per cent of the country within a decade. Bhutan says it will commit at Copenhagen to being carbon neutral. But unless money is spend on mitigation, the economic sacrifices that Bhutan has made to stay green may be in vain.""Seven million dollars is quite a lot of money for Bhutan,"" said Claire Van der Vaeren, representative of the United Nations Development Programme, partly funding efforts to drain the lake. ""But certain funding windows are not available to Bhutan because it is doing well with emissions and forest cover. In a way, it is a victim of its own success."" In Punakha, the monks still refuse to move their relics, hopeful their faith means they will survive any ""tsunami"".""They say the dzong survived because of the relic,"" said Thinley. ""We'll see if they will stay put."" Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Afghanistan: Climate Change and Afghanistan,"Pakistan, Jan. 02 -- The recent Copenhagen summit and discus sions on climate change was given less cov erage in the booming Afghan print and electronic media, which is the only source of awareness for the mass uneducated population of the war-ravaged country. Our TV channels and newspapers were all busy with cabinet predictions and talks with Taliban, while the world was having an important discussion to come up with a deal about how to control the global warming. In poor countries such as Afghanistan, the mass illiterate population even does not know what climate change and global warming are?/ Fighting for earn enough to meet the day's end, a common Afghan has no interest to know what China or India is taking stance in Copenhagen, or what is the US perspective. Even some people say such issues are irrelevant to us; it's the business of big powers to deal with. They are right to an extent. But the poorest people of the world living in countries like Afghanistan are the very severe victims of global warming. To make it humorous, I give an example of a ""positive"" outcome of global warming. Draught and late rainfalls-caused by global warming-have affected poppy crops and there was a decline of 22 percent in opium cultivation this year. The Afghan Opium Survey 2009 by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) says opium poppy cultivation has fallen to 123,000 hectares, down from a peak of 193,000 hectares in 2007. Of course the late rainfalls-caused by global warming-are not causing the all-out decline in opium crops. It's the effective counter narcotics, but the fact is that harsh winter has stopped millions of poppy seeds from germinating. The recent UNODC report says the most significant decrease was recorded in Helmand Province, where cultivation declined by a third to 69,833 hectares from 103,590 hectares in 2008.And another report says they are the poppy farmers worst affected by this year's weather are those who planted in November, after the cold spell set in. That includes about half of Helmand's poppy farmers, and a third of growers nationwide. Other farmers were unable to plant on time because their fields froze. Poppy is a winter crop. It is normally planted before the frosts and the seeds germinate before the cold weather. They sit dormant through the winter, and then shoot up in the spring. So this is how climate change is affecting Afghanistan's poppy fields.Other than natural vulnerabilities, Afghanistan as a war-ravaged country is more prone to the tiny impacts of global warming. With Afghanistan's dry atmosphere, small changes in temperature will bring severe impacts. The people of Afghanistan are already the victims of climate change. Long before civil war, the change in weather during the last decades affected people's lives and livelihoods now that we are already having a conflict and war, our threats are more severe and we are more prone to it, compare to other third world countries. We have no control on nature. Winters are getting colder than usual. As an agricultural country, our vast farm lands depend on rivers where water comes from Hindu Kush mountain range being melt. Small changes in global temperatures tip weather cycles to extremes of hot and cold. National media as well as international media last week missed reporting of a very unique story. There was a protest demonstration demanding electricity in Bamyan province. Local people, including women and children, were chanting for their right to have electricity as this isolated province has been neglected by the Ministry of Water and Energy during the last eight years. What made me very curious about the protest demonstration was that participants were holding two ""statues"" made of bushes. They burnt it in front of the office of United Nation's Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) saying we have no electricity, thus we are compelled to burn bushes and pollute the atmosphere. They demanded of the international community to pay attention to their neglected province. The polluted environment of the Capital is causing severe problems and diseases. According to a report of Health Department more than one hundred thousand people have been having respiration diseases. Hospitals are filled with patients of diseases that are increasing as a result of air pollution. The excessive use of electricity-producing generators has severely polluted the Capital, thus lungs disease are common. Climate change is caused by an increase of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere of our earth changing its heat balance that increases temperature. The burning of fossil fuel by big and growing economies of the world has the more share of mess in global warming. Though Afghanistan is not an industrial or growing economy, but the impacts of global warming is objective. We are more prone to the threats of nature. Our farmers are already affected by the climate change. The giant economic powers were bargaining in Copenhagen and the summit ended up without any fruitful outcome. The poorest people from Afghanistan to Sudan, who have done nothing to pollute, are bearing the severe impacts of global warming. The entertainment-oriented channels should pay some attention to serious problems. The people should be aware of the dangerous changes in our climate within next few decades. The Government should do some awareness campaign in this regard. Though globally it's the bigger economies responsible, but as a responsible human being, we should protect our planet.

Iran: Breathe easy: 5 ways to improve indoor air quality,"Pakistan, Jan. 08 -- We tend to think of air pollution as something outside -- smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. But the truth is, the air inside homes, offices, and other buildings can be more polluted than the air outside. The air inside your home may be polluted by lead (in house dust), formaldehyde, fire-retardants, radon, even volatile chemicals from fragrances used in conventional cleaners. Some pollutants are tracked into the home. /Some arrive via a new mattress or furniture, carpet cleaners, or a coat of paint on the walls.In that mix, you'll also find microscopic dust mites -- a major allergen -- plus mold and heaps of pet dander, says David Lang, MD, head of Allergy/Immunology at the Cleveland Clinic. ""Even if you don't have pets, you've probably got pet dander,"" he tells WebMD. ""It's become what we call a community allergen. Pet owners carry it around on their clothes and shed it throughout the day. You can't get away from it.""Children, people with asthma, and the elderly may be especially sensitive to indoor pollutants, but other effects on health may appear years later, after repeated exposure.Indoor allergens and irritants have become much more important in recent decades because we're spending more time indoors, Lang says. And because modern homes are airtight, these irritants can't easily escape. ""We're all exposed to a greater degree than we were three or four decades ago,"" he says.1. Keep your floors fresh.Suck it up. Chemicals and allergens can accumulate in household dust for decades. By using a vacuum with a HEPA filter you can reduce concentrations of lead in your home. You can also get rid of other toxins, like brominated fire-retardant chemicals (PBDEs) as well as allergens like pollen, pet dander, and dust mites.Using a vacuum cleaner that has strong suction, rotating brushes, and a HEPA filter ensures that dust and dirt won't get blown back out in the exhaust. In high traffic areas, vacuum the same spot several times. Don't forget walls, carpet edges, and upholstered furniture, where dust accumulates. For best results, vacuum two or more times each week and wash out your filter regularly.Mop it up. Mopping picks up the dust that vacuuming leaves behind. You can skip the soaps and cleaners and just use plain water to capture any lingering dust or allergens. New microfiber mops (and dust cloths) reportedly capture more dust and dirt than traditional fibers and don't require any cleaning solutions whatsoever.Keep it out. Put a large floor mat at every door. People track in all sorts of chemicals via the dirt on their shoes. A door mat reduces the amount of dirt, pesticides, and other pollutants from getting into your home. If the mat is big enough, even those who don't wipe their shoes will leave most pollutants on the mat -- not the floors in your home.If you live in a home built before 1978, there's a good chance that lead paint still exists on your walls. But even in a newer home, you may face lead exposure -- from lead dust tracked in from outside. Lead dust can raise the risk of exposure for young children -- a serious problem that can damage the brain, central nervous system, and kidneys. Pesticides are also linked with brain damage in young children. Kids are vulnerable to higher exposures because they tend to get dust on their fingers and then put their fingers in their mouths.To best protect your family, ask people to remove their shoes when entering your home. Keep house shoes, slippers, and socks near the door.2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold love moisture. Keeping humidity around 30%-50% helps keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioner during summer months) helps reduce moisture in indoor air and effectively controls allergens, Lang says. An air conditioner also reduces indoor pollen count -- another plus for allergy-sufferers.More tips for dehumidifying your home:Use an exhaust fan or crack open a window when cooking, running the dishwasher, or bathing.Don't overwater houseplants.Vent the clothes dryer to the outside.Fix leaky plumbing to prevent moisture-loving mold.Empty drip pans in your window air conditioner and dehumidifier.3. Make your home a no-smoking zone. ""Probably the single most important aspect of indoor air pollution is secondhand cigarette smoke,"" says Philip Landrigan, MD, a pediatrician and director of the Children's Environmental Health Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals. Research shows that secondhand smoke increases a child's risk of developing ear and respiratory infections, asthma, cancer, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). For the smoker, this addiction causes cancer, breathing problems, heart attacks, and stroke.If you want to stop smoking, support groups, nicotine-replacement therapy, and other medications can help. Find a method that works for you, get some support (friends, family, fellow quitters, counseling), and think positive. Focus on your reasons for quitting -- not on your cravings.More Americans than ever before have kicked the habit, according to the CDC. But if you relapse, make sure you don't smoke inside the house. ""If you just can't quit, at least smoke outside,"" Landrigan says.4. Test for radon. Whether you have a new or old home, you could have a radon problem. This colorless, odorless gas significantly raises the risk of lung cancer. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. today. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground and into your home through cracks and holes in the foundation. Drafty homes, airtight homes, homes with or without a basement -- any home can potentially have a radon problem.Granite countertops have also been linked to radon. While experts agree that most granite countertops emit some radon, the question is whether they do so at levels that can cause cancer. Testing is easy, inexpensive, and takes only a few minutes. If you discover a radon problem, there are simple ways to reduce levels of the gas that are not too costly. Even high radon levels can be reduced to acceptable levels. The Environmental Protection Agency offers a ""Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction.""5. Smell good naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean kitchen or clean clothes.But synthetic fragrances in laundry products and air fresheners emit dozens of different chemicals into the air. You won't find their names on the product labels. Conventional laundry detergents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets, and air fresheners in solid, spray, and oil form may all emit such gasses.In one study, a plug-in air freshener was found to emit 20 different volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including seven regulated as toxic or hazardous under U.S. federal laws. But these chemicals were not included on the label -- only the word ""fragrance"" is required to be listed. But the actual composition of the fragrance is considered a ""trade secret.""Most fragrances are derived from petroleum products, and generally haven't been tested to see if they have any significant adverse health effects in humans when they are inhaled. (Tests usually focus on whether a fragrance causes skin irritation.) Some that have been tested raise concern. Phthalates are a group of chemicals often used in fragrances and also used to soften plastics. Studies show that phthalates disrupt hormones in animals. What can you do?Look for fragrance-free or naturally-scented laundry products.Switch to mild cleaners that don't include artificial fragrances.Stop using aerosol sprays -- deodorants, hair sprays, carpet cleaners, furniture polish, and air fresheners.Let in fresh air. Open windows so toxic chemicals don't build up in your home. What if you or your child has pollen allergies? Then keep rooms ventilated with a filtered air- conditioning system.Use sliced lemons and baking soda to get a clean scent in the kitchen.Bring nature indoors. Any room is prettier with a fern, spider plant, or aloe vera. It's also healthier. NASA research shows that indoor plants like these act as living air purifiers -- the foliage and roots work in tandem to absorb chemical pollutants released by synthetic materials. If you have kids or pets, make sure the plants aren't poisonous if ingested Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

India: Number of vehicles rises 70 times in 30 yrs,"Pakistan, Jan. 10 -- Srinagar--The number of vehicles in the valley has increased 70 times in the past 30 years compared to the length of roads and population that has grown three times, say the experts.""The number of vehicles in 2004 has increased by 70 times as compared to that in 1971. The length of roads during this period, however, has increased three times only,"" said Gurcharan Singh, former mass media officer of the Directorate of Ecology, Environment and Remote Sensing.Providing figures, he said there were 813 buses and 1,982 trucks in 1971, whereas in 2004 the figures stood at 20,139 buses and 29,924 trucks. Similarly, the number of taxis rose from 489 in 1971 to 10,306 in 2004.Gurcharan added that the number of cars rose from 1,828 in 1971 to 74,187 in 2004, whereas the number of motorcycles rose from 1,305 to 253,611 during the same period. /""The number of auto-rickshaws rose from 97 in 1971 to 20,578 in 2004. From just 17 tractors in 1971 the number rose to 10,969 in 2004.""He informed that the length of roads had increased from 4,790 km in 1966 to 15,113 km in 2004. Traffic in Kashmir had increased 70 times, whereas the length of roads had increased just three times, he added.Gurcharan said, ""These figures do not depict development exactly. The number of vehicles should keep pace with the length of roads and population.""""Despite directions from the High Court that vehicles ought to be phased out after 15 years, nothing is happening,"" stated Gurcharan, adding that ""the emission of smoke from old vehicles result in air pollution. New engines are fuel efficient. Consequently, the extent of damage is reduced.""Suggesting measures to cope up with such challenges, he said vehicles and engines should be perfect and fuel efficient. According to him, proper pollution checks should be maintained and shift to kerosene, gas and solar heaters should be eco-friendly.Mehraj Ahmad Kakroo, District Development Commissioner, Srinagar, during the inauguration of the Road Traffic Safety Week here on January 1, said traffic mishaps were a major cause of concern as ""road accidents claimed more lives than violence in the valley last year.""

Pakistan: Environmental degradation: lethargy may cost dearly,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 12 -- Environmental degradation in the country continues to affect livelihoods and health increasing vulnerability of the poor to natural disasters and costing billions of rupees annually to national kitty.Urban and rural poor having meager or no access to basic facilities regarding environmental improvement and usually using fossil fuel as energy resource, are more prone to health hazards and ailments. Surveys carried out in the country by Pakistan EnvironmentalProtection Agency (Pak-EPA), Provincial EPAs and SUPARCO revealed presence of very high levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in major cities (about 6 times higher than the WHO's guidelines).As in rural areas, there is no mechanism for monitoring pollution level the residents are more exposed to dust, smoke and particulate matter contamination.Over the decades, environment of the country continued deteriorating costing billions to national kitty and affecting health and hygiene. The World Bank, in its report in 2006 estimated the cost of environmental neglect and degradation around Rs. /365 billion annually. Experts consider that 60-70 percent cause of urban air quality degradation is due to vehicles.""Every body least bothers about how much we are losing due to environmental degradation,"" said an environmentalist, Sohail Khan.Resident of Rawalpindi, Mr Sohail regretted the improper implementation of laws even Environmental Act 1997 and said, ""apparently we lack political will and commitment to the cause.""He urged awareness raising at grassroots and involvement of communities and called upon the government and other organizations working in the sector, to collectively move forward to take on this dilemma.Almost all metropolitan cities have industrial estates where cluster of industries of different types exist and majority of cement, fertilizer, sugar units, power plants and steel furnaces located in the vicinity of towns, cause excessive air pollution. Brick kilns are another source of pollution in many areas. Use of low-grade coal and old tires in brick kilns generate dense black smoke (soot) and other kind of emissions.Out of 6,634 registered industries in Pakistan, 1,228 are considered to be highly polluting. Presently it is estimated that 54,888 tons of solid waste is generated in Pakistan every day, of which 50 percent remain uncollected.Since none of the cities has proper waste disposal system, even the waste collected is either dumped in low lying areas or along the road sides and set on fire. Burning of solid waste at low temperature not only generate particulate matters like CO, NOx but also produce dioxin, a persistent organic pollutant.Regarding air pollution, data is generally available about ambient air quality focusing on outdoor air such as concentrations of SOx, NOs, CO, CO2, PM10 and PM 2.5. But, these key air pollutants are reported at selected urban locations only.As indoor air pollution (IAP) has not been recognized as a hazard as yet, data is very sparse or even not available.In rural areas biomass fuels meet about 86 percent of the total domestic energy requirements as 90 percent of rural and 50 percent of urban population depend on wood and other biomass fuels.Indoor cooking and heating with biomass fuels or coal produces high level of indoor pollutants that is evident from ailment like acute respiratory infections and even lung cancer.Environmental degradation eventually translates into socio-economic problems retarding development and growth and there is need to address environmental issues through policies and institutional reforms that create the right incentives for administrators to effectively enforce policies and for polluters to comply with regulations.Director General Pak-EPA Asif Shuja Khan said, the government initiated a number of projects to control pollution but lot more is needed to be done.He described the lack of proper implementation of laws and certain legal bottlenecks as one of the reasons behind continued pollution.

Bangladesh:Ensure facilities for early diagnosis of cancer at UZ level,"Pakistan, Feb. 03 -- Pointing out the inadequate treatment facilities of cancer, experts at a roundtable discussion yesterday emphasised on ensuring facilities of early diagnosis tests of the disease at district and upazila level hospitals.They also stressed the need for creating awareness among the people to prevent cancer.According to our correspondent, in Bangladesh every year around 2 lakh people are diagnosed with cancer and 1.5 lakh die of the disease, they told the discussion at the National Press Club in the city.Referring to the Cancer Control Act enacted by some developed countries, they urged the government to formulate such an Act as the disease is caused by exposure to air pollution, water pollution, consumption of adulterated food etc.Bangladesh Cancer Society and Bangladesh Cancer Hospital and Welfare Home organised the discussion on the eve of the World Cancer Day 2010 to be observed on Thursday (Feb 4).The day will be observed in the country, as elsewhere in the world with the theme 'Cancer can be prevented too.'Though earlier cancer was considered as deadly and not curable, now the WHO says 40 percent of the cancer can be prevented, Mollah Obayedullah Baki, director of the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital, mentioned.""As diagnosis of cancer and its treatment are highly expensive, we should pay attention to boost preventive measures against cancer, "" he said.Bangladesh has found highest number of lung cancer among men. /Such cancer could be prevented by avoiding tobacco, as 90 percent of the lung cancer is caused by consuming tobacco.Cervical caner of women could also be prevented by making them aware of getting married after 20 years of age, avoiding taking babies frequently and extra marital sex as well as maintaining personal hygiene, Prof Mollah, also the president of Bangladesh Cancer Society, said.While presenting the keynote paper, Prof Shah Mohammad Keramat Ali said tobacco is responsible for 30 percent of cancer in the world while 50 percent of cancer is diet related but causes behind the 20 percent are yet to be identified.Prevention measures include cancer prevention, detection of the disease at early stage and relief to the terminally ill patients from pain, said Prof Ahmed Sayeed, secretary general of the society.He said cancer awareness messages can be included in school textbooks to prevent the disease.They suggested dissemination of awareness messages on consumption of balanced diet and more vegetables and fruits, doing regular exercise, reducing intake of foods that are high in fat and sugar, avoiding mental stress etc to prevent cancer.Prof Abdul Awal Rizvi, director of NITOR, Prof M A Hai, Dr M Mostofa Zaman, Dr AM Nuruzzaman of the Directorate General of Health Services, Ahad Chowdhury, chairman of Muktijoddha Command Council and Abu Naser Khan, among others, spoke at the discussion.

Oman: NACA launching 'Cancer can be prevented too' campaign,"Pakistan, Feb. 05 -- THE National Association for Cancer Awareness (NACA) today joins the rest of the world to mark the World Cancer Day (WCD) with the launch of a year-long campaign with specific focus on prevention of cancer. Held under the theme 'Cancer can be prevented too', this year's campaign is designed to promote ways to ease the global burden of cancer. The observance of the occasion is also aimed at preventing cancer and raising the quality of life of cancer patients in both the rich and developing countries all over the world.The WCD is led by the International Union Against Cancer (IUAC), an international non-governmental organisation, and with the support of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to raise awareness about prevention of cancer. According to a statement issued by NACA, annually worldwide over 12 million people are diagnosed with cancer and 7.6 million of them succumb to the disease.Nevertheless, the good news is that about 40 per cent of cancers are potentially preventable. /In this context, NACA will launch this year's campaign specifically focusing on how the risk of developing cancer can significantly be reduced through simple measures. Such measures include:* Stop tobacco use and avoid passive smoking* Limit alcohol consumption* Avoid excessive sun exposure* Maintain a healthy weight by eating a healthy balanced diet and promoting an active lifestyle with regular physical exercise* Protect against cancer-causing infectionsThe occasion will be marked in a special way by bringing together the survivors, members and sponsors of the association as well as media orgnisations. The association will also organise a get-together for children afflicted with the disease at the Paediatric Oncology ward of the Royal Hospital on February 7 to mark the World Cancer Day.The event to be held under the theme 'Children are Angles' is yet another cancer awareness campaign among children initiated by the IUAC.According to Yuthar bint Mohamed al Rawahiya, head and founder of NACA, cancer is a global burden and any person can be afflicted with this disease. However, the burden can be reduced and controlled by implementing evidence-based strategies for cancer prevention, early detection and management of patients with cancer.The WHO estimates that in 2005, about 7.6 million people all over the world died of cancer. It projects that between 2005 and 2015, 84 million more people could die of cancer if urgent action is not taken. Cancer is not simply or even primarily a problem of rich countries. More than 70 per cent of all cancer deaths occur in low and middle income countries, according to WHO reports.Likewise, according to a study by the international cancer collaborators, more than 30 per cent of cancer could be prevented by modifying or avoiding the key risk factors of cancer. Such risks include tobacco use, being overweight or obese, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity, alcohol use, sexually transmitted HPV-infection, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels.The study also suggested that some preventive strategies such as enhancement of awareness against risk factors, vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), controlling occupational hazards and reducing exposure to sunlight can help prevent cancer.Early detectionAbout one-third of the cancer burden could be decreased if cases are detected and treated early. Early detection of cancer is based on the observation that treatment is more effective when cancer is detected earlier through education to help people recognise early signs of cancer and seek prompt medical attention for symptoms, which might include: lumps, sores, persistent indigestion, persistent coughing, and bleeding from the body's orifices.Other measures include screening programmes to identify early cancer or pre-cancer before signs are recognisable, including mammography for breast cancer, and cytology (a pap smear) for cervical cancer. According to WHO reports, annually, cervical cancer kills more than 250,000 women worldwide every year, and 90 per cent new cases are in low and middle income countries. The tragedy is that almost all these cases could be prevented through effective screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. Those diagnosed with cancer can be successfully treated if detected at an early stage.Key facts about cancer* Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide: it accounted for 7.9 million deaths comprising around 13 per cent of all deaths in 2007.* Annually, the lung, stomach, liver, colon and breast cancer cause the most cancer deaths.* The most frequent types of cancer differ between men and women.* About 30 per cent of cancer deaths can be prevented.* Tobacco use is the single most important risk factor for cancer.* Cancer arises from a change in one single cell. The change may be started by external agents and inherited genetic factors.* About 72 per cent of all cancer deaths in 2007 occurred in low- and middle-income countries.* Deaths from cancer worldwide are projected to continue rising, with an estimated 12 million deaths in 2030.* There are more than 100 types of cancers; any part of the body can be affected.* One fifth of all cancers worldwide are caused by a chronic infection, for example human papilloma virus (HPV) causes cervical cancer and hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes liver cancer.* A third of cancers could be cured if detected early and treated adequately.* All patients in need of pain relief could be helped if current knowledge about pain control and palliative care were applied.* More than 30 per cent of cancer could be prevented, mainly by not using tobacco, having a healthy diet, being physically active and preventing infections that may cause cancer.Global burden of cancerGlobally, the main types of cancer leading to overall cancer mortality each year include lung cancer that accounts for about 1.3 million deaths, stomach cancer account for 803,000 deaths, colorectal cancer 639,000 deaths, liver cancer 610,000 deaths and breast cancer account for 519,000 deaths, particularly among women.The most frequent types of cancer worldwide in order of the number of global deaths among men include cancer of the lungs, stomach, liver, colorectal, oesophagus and prostate. The most frequent types of cancer among women include cancer of the breast, lung, stomach, colorectal and cervical.What causes cancer?Cancer arises from one single cell. The transformation from a normal cell into a tumour cell is a multistage process, typically a progression from a pre-cancerous lesion to malignant tumours. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors and three categories of external agents, including:* Physical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionising radiation.* Chemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, aflatoxin (a food contaminant) and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant).* Biological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria or parasites.Some examples of infections associated with certain cancers:* Viruses: hepatitis B and liver cancer, human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Kaposi sarcoma.* Bacteria: Helicobacter pylori and stomach cancer.* Parasites: schistosomiasis and bladder cancer.Ageing is another fundamental factor for the development of cancer. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age. The overall risk accumulation is combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as a person grows older.Treatment and care* Treatment aims to cure, prolong life and improve quality of life for patients. Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer, have high cure rates when detected early and treated according to best practice. Principal treatment methods are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Fundamental for adequate treatment is an accurate diagnosis through imaging technology (ultrasound, endoscopy or radiography) and laboratory (pathology) investigations.* Relief from pain and other problems can be achieved in over 90 per cent of cancer patients through palliative care. Effective ways exist to provide palliative care for patients and their families in low resource settings.* Generate new knowledge, and disseminate existing knowledge to facilitate the delivery of evidence-based approaches to cancer control;* Develop standards and tools to guide the planning and implementation of interventions for prevention, early detection, treatment and care;* Facilitate broad networks of cancer control partners at global, regional and national levels;* Strengthen health systems at national and local levels; and* Provide technical assistance for rapid, effective transfer of best practice interventions to developing countries.

Bangladesh: Air pollution in city takes alarming turn,"Dhaka, Feb. 09 -- Air pollution in the capital has taken an alarming turn, posing serious health problems for city dwellers.According to our correspondent, things get worse in dry season as air, thick with particulates, becomes a prevalent cause of chest and respiratory diseases, say health experts.According to some sources of Department of Environment (DoE), the density of airborne particulate matter (PM) has reached 247 micrograms per cubic meter (mcm) in Dhaka which is nearly five times the acceptable level of 50 PM per mcm set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of Bangladesh.Although there is no definite study, doctors suggest exposure to such a volume of air pollution may cause premature deaths and also various diseases including pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illnesses.This air pollutant also has an adverse effect on all other life forms including plants. Cost of maintaining building structures in the urban areas also rises significantly due to such air pollution.Doctors at the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH) in Mohakhali said number of patients soars at the very onset of the dry season and continues till the monsoon rain arrives.NIDCH Director and Professor Dr Mirza Mohammad Hiron told media that the number of patients with different chest and respiratory diseases is on the rise.""We have thousands of patients treated during dry season for diseases triggered by allergic reactions, which strongly suggests it is related to exposure to pollution,"" Hiron said.Airborne particulates are considered more harmful when they are 10 micrometers or smaller in diameter and in Dhaka the density of PM which is 2.5 micrometers or smaller has been found to be 9 times higher than the NAAQS recommendation.Ambient air in the city becomes extremely polluted between October and March every year when rain is scarce and when thousands of brick kilns become operational, burning used automobile and rickshaw tyres, low grade coal and in many cases fuel-wood.""Our study shows that during 120 days of the dry season the ambient air pollution remains very consistent in the city air,"" said a researcher of the Air Quality Management Project that ended in 2008.He said in addition to brick kilns, old buses, fleets of trucks and thousands of other poorly serviced vehicles contribute highly to the pollution. /Moreover, dust from roads and construction sites and toxic fumes from industrial sites turn the air quality scenario even worse.""The first thing we have to do is to ban these old buses and trucks from entering the city. The old buses engaged in city services must immediately be replaced by larger environment friendly buses,"" said the former AQMP official requesting anonymity.World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines of 2005 however recommend a maximum acceptable PM level of 20mcm compared to Bangladesh standard of 50. Cities with 70mcm are considered highly polluted. Airborne lead is the worst of the harmful PMs.Meanwhile, government's initiative to borrow $62.2 million from the World Bank for Clean Air and Sustainable Environment Project (CASE) brings some relief among environment activists.The project, which was launched in October 2009 and lasts until December 2014, mainly aims at addressing various aspects of city's transportation sector and also to modernise the brick kilns to reduce pollution.DoE and Dhaka City Corporation will jointly implement the project.A CASE official at the DoE office in Agargaon said under the project the 100 years old technology of brick burning would be replaced by modern methods.

Iran: Age for cancer diagnosis reduced to 25 in Iran,"Tehran, Feb. 11 -- The director of the Iranian Society of Internists has warned of the prevalence of cancer diseases among the Iranians under the age of 25.""Cancer had been most commonly diagnosed among people aged 50-plus (in 1979); but nowadays, after three decades, there is an increased incidence of cancer in those under 25 years and in some cases 18,"" Iraj Khosrownia lamented.Prostate cancer is mostly seen among the Iranian men, and among women breast cancer is most common, Khosrownia explained.Blaming environmental factors and inborn genetic factors for the spread of cancer among the Iranians, he said, poor nutrition, smoking, and air pollution are the main causes of the cancer in all types.According to latest official figures, 90 percent of various types of cancers are caused by smoking leading to an earlier death; cancer is responsible for 30 percent of deaths occurred across the country.Khosrownia described examinations every six months or every year for women as the simple method of detecting cancer at its early stages Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Peshawar's suburbs turn into waste dumping lots,"PESHAWAR, Feb. 19 -- Several suburban areas of the provincial metropolis are turning into dumping grounds for solid waste, multiplying environmental and health hazards in a city already ranked among the most polluted cities of the country.Officials of the city district government told that the four Town Municipal Administrations in the provincial capital collected 60 per cent of the municipal waste produced in the city but have no system to recycle or dispose it properly.Peshawar, with a population of over three million including around one million Afghan refuges, generates around 17 tons of solid waste every day that is dumped in open areas, mostly on the outskirts of the city.There are two main dumping areas, one near Hazarkhwani on Ring Road and the other on Charsadda Road. The land being used at the two places for dumping solid waste was originally acquired in the 1990s for setting up treatment plants for sewerage water under a foreign funded project.Multiple pools were constructed at each site with loanmoney. However, the project did not materialise as its second phase of linking the sewerage line with these ponds was abandoned on financial and technical grounds.""Since these ponds and open areas around them had no utility, we use them for dumping solid waste,"" said a sanitary worker, overseeing dumping process along Ring Road. /Before the municipal workers started dumping waste in such ponds and open area, a nullah passing through the locality was an easy solution to get rid of the waste.""We don't apply such method anymore because the people of the area don't allow us,"" said the official, adding now for the last one year waste was being dumped in the open area. According to him, daily 100 truckloads of solid waste, mainly generated from the Town-I areas, were dumped here.The environmental profile of NWFP, a study conducted by Environmental Protection Agency NWFP in 2008, puts per day per capita municipal solid waste generation in the provincial capital between 0.4 and 0.6 kilogram.As per this estimate total waste generation comes to around 15 to 17 tons a day.This study also points out that approximately 40 per cent of the generated wastes remain at collection points or in streets, to emit a host of pollutants into the air. Also on roadside, burning of the mu nicipal solid waste causes air pollution.""This was pollution that forced people of Musazai area, where municipal waste was used to be dumped earlier, to get further dumping of the waste in their area stopped,"" recalled an official at Town-I, adding people living adjacent to those dumping areas couldn't even breathe normally and were vulnerable to various diseases even though he claimed antibacterial spray was done on regular basis on such dumps.Since dumping of solid waste without any treatment had been declared an offense under Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997, the NWFP EPA had filed cases against the four TMAs of provincial capital for their inability to properly collect and dispose solid waste.Dr Mohammad Bashir, the director general of EPA, told that cases had been filed against the TMAs in the Environmental Tribunal.The TMAs claimed that 66 per cent of solid waste was collected from the entire city; however, Mr Bashir said that it was incorrect.District Nazim Haji Umer Ali, when contacted, conceded that the city didn't have any proper system of waste disposal. He, however, said that the city district government had recently signed an agreement with a private company -Waste Management of Pakistan -- for the waste collection and recycling.Under the project, he said, the company would install a garbage recycling plant in Peshawar costing Rs1.5 billion wherein 100 per cent investment would be ensured by the company as well as 12 new trucks and other equipment would be provided to the four TMAs.The district government, however, had provided 100 acre government land to the company at Dheri Baghbanan near Peshawar on 21 years lease.Under the agreement, the company will purchase the garbage of all the four towns of Peshawar, Hayatabad and Cantonment to the tune of 1000 tons daily at the rate of Rs100 per ton.""The project on implementation will on one hand eliminate the possibilities of spread of diseases and environment pollution due to dumping of the waste and garbage of the city on open grounds while the waste will be converted into useful material after recycling besides creating 200 new jobs in Peshawar on the other hand,"" he added Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Bangladesh: Can't we arrest the decline of Dhaka city ?,"Dhaka, Feb. 21 -- ONCE again Dhaka has attained the dubious distinction of being the second worst polluted and unlivable city of the world by a survey conducted over 140 cities by the Economist Intelligence Group, an organisation associated with the UK based journal, The Economist. The finding of this survey reveals that Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe ranks the first position in the worst cities' category. Shockingly, Dhaka , once the hub of dream and optimism of the country, has already descended into a nightmarish metropolis. People here now feel like being driven away by an accelerating deterioration in the quality of life : clogged thoroughfares, eye-stinging smog, polluted landscapes and streets, vanishing parks and lakes, crowded yet unaffordable housing, overcrowded schools and colleges, also hospitals, polluting industries and spiralling crimes.The very qualities that lured millions to this city in good old days have disappeared. /People now conclude that Dhaka has descended into a spiral of environmental and social calamities.The citizenry are living in an environmental crisis, an air pollution emergency of an unprecedented nature. Despite the fact that regulations exist, indifference, inaction, and failure in taking punitive measure against the offending vehicle owners and drivers fouling environment with noxious fumes has deteriorated the situation. The air in Dhaka city exceeds the safe level and the dust-load in the air is the highest in the world. A World Bank study suggests that the soaring pollution level in the capital city is causing premature death of about 40,000 persons every year.The picture is grim. Garbage has posed a major threat to health and sanitation of the people. The amount of garbage generated daily in the city comes to about 3500 tons and thanks to DCC, it can pick up only 44 percent of the total output. In many cases garbage is not picked up in the teeming city suburbs. Filthy water and human excreta along with other waste in choked drains stagnate till the rainy season washes a part of it into the river Buriganga, Shitalakhya and adjoining city lakes and wetlands.The sewage system covers only 30 per cent of the city population. Sewerage network with a lone waste treatment plant at Pagla has a capacity of treating 1.20 lakh cubic metre of sewage a day. About 15,000 tonnes of human excreta is generated every day by about 10 million city dwellers of which 6,000 tonnes is treated at the Pagla plant and by soak wells linked to septic tanks of the residents. Most worrisome, over 9000 tonnes is dumped into the rivers and water bodies surrounding the capital.The crisis of governance is particularly marked at the city corporation level. Whereas urban governance demands a coherent, coordinated and dynamic set-up, most of our big cities, especially Dhaka has been saddled with fragmented, fractured and imbecile authorities incapable of and least willing to tackle core problems.Apart from people living on jobs in government and private agencies, at least 20 lakh people including construction workers, hawkers and those working in different garment factories and other industries in and around the city live in slum shanty houses with no water, electricity, cooking gas and toilet facilities. As the capital city unfolds, population increases, and industrial concerns expand. The slum and squatter population has been increasing at more than double the general growth rate of urban population.It is not only the absence of amenities but also the unclean way of life and utter disregard for civic obligation that make these slums extremely filthy. Anyone visiting the slum areas of Kamarpara, Sinnirtek, Diabari Aminbazar near Ashulia and Mirpur would find to his horror the most unhygienic and primitive way people, mostly river erosion and disaster victims, are living there.Some five to six persons including infant babies of the same family are living in one room shanty covered by C.I. sheet in low land that remains submerged during rainy season. The women folk walk about a mile to fetch water that costs Tk. 2 per pitcher. With no works and no facilities for schooling, the grown up boys of 10-18 age range are moving aimlessly in the area, some of them taking drugs in broad daylight.As one walks from Baridhara to Banani to Gulshan to Uttara to Dhanmondi and even to old city areas, one would only find absence of urban discipline. Norms of organized civic life have been violated with impunity. Illegal encroachments and unauthorized constructions have become rampant. Land and building mafias have cropped up every where, not sparing even the rivers. Rajuk in recent time has catalogued about 5000 illegal encroachments and constructions that sprouted without any shadow of doubt with the knowledge and approval of its previous bosses.With rivers and lakes polluted, roads potholed, air fouled and land and parks encroached upon and unauthorized and illegal construction of malls and apartment blocks going apace unhindered, leaving no space for breathing, defying Rajuk regulations and building code in collusion with corrupt officials, the city now presents a dismal look. With seven persons of the same family dying of asphyxiation in a raging fire in an apartment at Japan Garden city in the Mohammadpur area because of lack of fire safety devices the other day, it seems all such high rise buildings in the city are just highway to hell.After the liberation of the country, our policy makers should have evolved a clear urban vision. Unfortunately those at the helm did not show any real ingenuity, competence and commitment. They became more imitative than creative. They failed to regenerate and resuscitate the Bangladeshi mind. The Dickensian blight and haze that hang over the capital city today is nothing but a fallout of a fake and foggy vision.There was ample scope to give Dhaka an urban vision. If, under an inspiring urban vision, Buriganga water had once again been made crystal clear, if a green vista had developed along the water front and if the excessive trade and industry had been relocated, Dhaka would not only have regained its glory but also emerged as a thriving and a dynamic centre of modern civic life. It would have become a symbol of resurgent Bangladesh.In the absence of a vision, Dhaka has lapsed into a beehive of filth, congestion and urban blight. With things going so awry, it boils down to the fact that most of our big cities, especially Dhaka has suffered at the hands of the policy makers. That the development of the city should not have been entirely left with either Rajuk or DCC. There should have been a super monitoring committee invested with proper authority to investigate, coordinate, adjust and correct lapses, loopholes and fraudulence resorted to starting from plot allotment to carrying on unauthorized constructions.The future seems daunting. Demographers estimate that between 2010 and 2030 , Dhaka city will add another 10 million at least to its present figure of 16 million. The blueprint that can be prescribed at the moment has two facets -- involving the mindscape and the landscape. City expansion and creation of facilities beyond the present city limits with all connectivity with the nerve centre must start without any further delay.Dhaka city, the focal point of the nation must experience an awakening that should stir people and create in them an inner urge to rebuild this great old capital.Overcrowding, noxious fumes, unhealthy slums, power shortage, water shortage and contaminated water have all played a part in turning this city into a choking hell. But public reaction to all these human factors is mostly mute. And surely unless the public takes an unanimous stand, Dhaka's decline will continue.

Bangladesh: 'One-third patients suffer from lung diseases',"Dhaka, Feb. 26 -- One-third patients of Bangladesh have been suffering from lung diseases, including lung cancer, tuberculosis and asthma, said health experts at a scientific seminar yesterday.According to our correspondent, al least 70 lakh people have been suffering from Asthma while 3 lakh people are newly diagnosed with tuberculosis every year and 70,000 die of the disease, they added.Even 20 percent of the patients, who seek treatment at the medicine department of medical colleges, come with different types of chest diseases, which indicate the severity of chest diseases in the country.The experts said this at the annual general meeting and scientific seminar of Chest and Heart Association of Bangladesh organised at Bangladesh College of Physicians and Surgeons in the city.President of the association Prof Mirza Mohammad Hiron said air pollution causes various types of diseases that finally lead to deaths of 25,000 people per year.He further said that a total of 47 posts for respiratory medicine have been created in 13 medical colleges.But unfortunately, he failed to set up a respiratory medicine department at National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital for lack of cooperation from various sectors, Prof Hiron added.The experts also said that the non-communicable diseases like heart and chest diseases, cancer and diabetes are on the rise for lack of awareness.For a resource-constraint country like Bangladesh, it is difficult to ensure treatment for all the patients by increasing health facilities, rather steps should be taken to prevent the diseases, they said.Speaking as the chief guest, State Minister for Health Mozibur Rahman Fakir said the government has taken steps to increase the facilities for specialised treatment of heart and chest diseases.President of Bangladesh Medical Association Prof Mahmud Hasan, Secretary General Prof Sharfuddin Ahmed, Joint Secretary General Dr Mohammad Abdul Aziz, Secretary General of Chest and Heart Association Dr Mohammad Jahirul Islam Shakil and Treasurer Dr Biswas Akhter Hossain also spoke. /Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Poor are agents, victims of environmental damage","Islamabad, Feb. 26 -- Growing environmental degradation is going to become one of the major problems even for economic managers, as the vicious combination of increasing population and deteriorating environment is expected to further worsen the state of poverty in the country.According to our correspondent, a research report still having great importance with regard to 'Analysing Poverty & Environment in Pakistan' by Dr Talat Anwar of Centre for Research on Poverty Reduction & Income Distribution pointed out that the poor are both the agents and victims of environmental damage, as they overuse environmental resources, which increases the burden of disease that eventually results in the loss of their income.The World Bank in its report in 2006 estimated the cost of environmental neglect and degradation to around Rs365 billion annually in Pakistan but it seems that it is yet to realise how much we are losing due to the increasing environmental degradation. The report underlined the need for a policy at strategy level that could address the linkage between environmental degradation and poverty, evaluate sectoral policies, and ensure the inclusion of environmental issues to monitor the effectiveness of strategy.It also pointed out that air pollution in Pakistan is adding about 500 million dollars per year to healthcare costs. The level of air pollution in major cities is much higher than WHO standards, as the average suspended particulate matters are 6.4 times higher than WHO guidelines and 3.8 times higher than the Japanese standards.Chief Executive Officer Subh-e-Nau Dr Jawad Chishti told to media that environmental degradation affects poverty situations in various ways, such as reducing sources of livelihoods for poor people and making them vulnerable to diseases. /On the other hand, poverty also affects environment in various ways - by forcing people to degrade environment and encouraging civic managers to promote economic growth at the expense of environment.""The impact of environmental degradation is unequal between the poor and the rich, as environmental damage almost always hits the poor the hardest. The overwhelming majority of those who die each year from air and water pollution are poor people, and they generally live nearest to dirty factories, busy roads, and dangerous waste dumps,"" he said. He claimed that environmental degradation is causing the fatal disease of cancer in some 40,000 people every year and the situation is getting worse with each passing day.The report suggested that at the programme level, policy should be a key tool to assist in mainstreaming environment such as Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) that is a systematic process for assessing the environmental consequences of policies and plans. At the project level, environment can be mainstreamed through environmental screening, environmental management and environmental auditing such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).The successive governments took some effective measures such as the formulation of a comprehensive strategy to develop provincial capacity for implementing environmental protection laws and monitoring their effectiveness, enforcement of National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS), introduction of EIA review procedures/system and regulatory regime for hazardous substances/wastes. But increase in the sources of pollution marred these efforts, aimed at protecting the natural environment.Given the declining air quality in major cities, the report suggested the introduction of cleaner fuels to improve environment, adoption of improved petroleum product specifications, initiation of filtration system in industries and plantation in open spaces.

"Bangladesh: Lax drives against unfit, over-aged vehicles","Dhaka, March 05 -- Lax drives against unfit and over-aged vehicles continue to cause manifold sufferings to city residents as the authorities concerned are trading blames over the plying of unfit vehicles on city roads. According to our correspondent, the communications minister, Syed Abul Hossain, on Wednesday told the parliament about 80,000 unfit vehicles were plying the roads in the capital. Both the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority and the Dhaka Metropolitan Police blamed each other for allowing the movement of unfit vehicles in the city. DMP officials said the Road Transport Authority was issuing fitness certificates to many unfit vehicles while the transport authorities said the police did not take any action against unfit vehicles despite repeated request for doing so. /The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority director (enforcement), Tapan Kumar Sarkar, on Wednesday told to media, 'We have sent letters to the office of the inspector general of police, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner and the Special Branch several times to stop the movement of vehicles having no legal documents and fitness but they are yet to take any effective action.' When asked about the issuance of fitness certificates to unfit vehicles in exchange for money, Tapan brushed aside the allegation against the national road transport agency but admitted that middle men or brokers were involved in managing licences, road permits and fitness certificates for vehicles from the agency. Asked about drives against unfit vehicles, he said, 'In fact, we do not have any enforcing authority and we depend on the police.' 'Law enforcers claim they have seized forged licences and fitness certificates. Then why do not they arrest the men involved in providing forged licences and fitness certificates?' he said. 'Only two magistrate's courts are now conducting drives against thousands of unfit and more-than-20-year-old vehicles,' he said. Mashiur Rahman, one of the BRTA magistrates, recently said when they conducted drives against old vehicles they did not find any unfit vehicles, probably because the owners of the vehicles were warned by some people to keep them off the road. Admitting that there is considerable shortage of manpower, the magistrate said, 'We depend on police sergeants in the drive but they do not extend full cooperation.' When approached for comments, the DMP commissioner, AKM Shahidul Haque, told to media, 'We are continuing with drives against unfit vehicles plying the city road but we have some limitations.' According to statistics, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested only 185 drivers and seized only 1,068 vehicles and 1,247 forged licences and realised Tk 26,18,700 in fine between December 8, 2009 and January 1, 2010. 'We seized a number of 20-year-old vehicles and later released them after the owners in undertaking gave an assurance that they would not run the vehicles in the city,' he said. He, however, said they had no authority to force the owners of the vehicles to withdraw them from the city roads. The communications minister on Wednesday said 79,245 vehicles ply the city roads without valid fitness documents while experts believe the figure could be much higher. Transport sector leaders also said the number of such vehicles is more than the figure but the authorities concerned do little to seize the vehicles. Syed Rezaul Karim, the president of the Association of Bus Companies the members of which operate some 5,000 buses in the city, said a large number of buses in the city were unfit but many of them had been given fitness certificates by corrupt officials of the Road Transport Authority. 'Most of such vehicles are in a frightening condition. Many of them do not have tail lights, indicator lights and even headlights and most of them have marks of accidents. But the police say that they have fitness certificates issued by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority,' he said. Besides contributing to city snarl-up, the old, run-down vehicles are also polluting the air, causing various diseases and respiratory problems, especially among the children, said several physicians, although the government has taken some measures to minimise environmental degradation. Air pollution, caused particularly by old vehicles, has made children vulnerable to asthma, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, said Professor Ruhul Amin, a physician at Dhaka Shishu Hospital.

Pakistan: No dust control methods in sight,"Islamabad, March 06 -- Improper land clearing activities and digging for road in almost every nook and corner have become one of the major factors that are directly responsible for the increasing air pollution in the capital.According to our correspondent, a large number of construction sites where work is underway are causing environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, creating health issues, particularly for those with respiratory problems, and offering unsafe working conditions to labourers.According to official statistics, over 180 road projects and construction work on approximately 300 high-rise buildings or plazas were initiated in the city during the last five years.Nauman Ashraf, conducting research on environmental issues, told to media that contractors and builders, whose activities result in dust emission, are duty bound to adopt one or several dust control methods during land clearing activities and storage of piles of construction material. But no dust control method has so far been adopted by contractors or developers despite knowing the adverse effects of their negligence or carelessness, he said.He said the contractors and developers are completely ignoring the dust control methods that include watering of the construction areas and materials by means of trucks and hoses, and application of non-toxic and environment-friendly chemical stabilisers that help control dust particles better than water by keeping the ground, stockpiles, roadways, construction and building sites wet for longer periods.Nauman said it is also necessary to ensure covering the storage piles by tarps or plastic material that should be properly anchored to prevent winds from removing them; wind fencing of construction sites, specially those adjacent to roadways or built-up areas; installation of barriers equal to the height of the storage piles; and water flushing of streets and surrounding areas where construction material has spilled over.Motor vehicles plying on under-construction or unpaved roads create fugitive dust particles, which pollute the air. /Moreover, uncovered piles of construction material at the sites also contribute to air pollution. The areas adjacent to the construction sites are enveloped in a grayish black haze that is quite visible throughout the day.""Construction of roads and multi-storey plazas is an unending phenomenon in the capital city and if dust control methods are not adopted, it means that whatever steps the relevant quarters take to reduce the air and water pollution, it will continue to increase in the coming years,"" he said.The Central Laboratory for Environmental Analysis (Clean), established by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), has all basic equipment to monitor air and water quality, including Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS), Mass Spectrometer (MS), High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) and UV-Visible Spectrometer. It prepares the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Islamabad regularly but it is yet to warn the contractors and developers against the violation of basic dust control methods.

Pakistan: Pollen allergy patients asked to adopt precautionary measures,"Islamabad, March 07 -- Medical experts have advised the pollen allergy patients to adopt precautionary measures to avoid any medical complication.According to our correspondent, they told that allergy patients should avoid moving such places where the offending plant grows and where its pollen exists in the air.They asked persons with pollen allergy who work outside to wear face masks designed to filter pollen out of the air reaching their nasal passages.According to Pakistan Meteorological Department the atmospheric concentration of pines, grasses and cannabis lies in high category in the federal capital and advised the individuals sensitive to these allergic pollens to take precautionary measures. It said the trend in allergic pollen will change and the concentration of paper mulberry pollen will also increase and dominate the other allergic pollen in the second half of March.Meanwhile, citizens asked the Ministry of Health that federal government hospitals in the federal capital should make proper arrangements for the critical patients of pollen allergy by providing ventilators to them in case of severe emergency.They also demanded that an awareness drive should be launched to educate citizens about disease, adding, literature about the disease should be provided to the patients of pollen allergy in the outpatient department of Pulmonology Department, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) for their awareness.They asked the ministry to provide concerned medical facilities to such patients free of cost while these patients should also be provided free life saving medicines in the emergency department besides nebulisation, bronchodilaters, steroids, oxygen therapy, nursing care and specialists' consultation.Dr. Wasim Khawaja from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said during periods of high pollen levels, people with pollen allergy should try to avoid unnecessary exposure to irritants such as dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and fresh tar or paint. /He added any of these can aggravate the symptoms of pollen allergy, adding, when pollen allergy is not treated, complications may occur.He said people with seasonal allergies who cannot avoid pollen, the symptoms can be controlled with medication on advise of physician including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and cromolyn sodium, any of which can be used alone or in combination.

Pakistan: Homeopathy can carry the day for asthmatics,"Islamabad, March 07 -- The world has so far failed to wipe out the age-old disease of asthma. According to the findings of World Health Organisation, this planet hosts as many as 300 million patients, 10 million of whom live in Pakistan.Asthma causes more than 250,000 premature deaths every year. Efforts to control this chronic disease have witnessed only five per cent success in Asia.Asthma causes airways - the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs - to become sore and swollen. Children having smaller airways than adults are prone to worse affects.When the airways react, during an asthmatic attack, the muscles around them tighten. /This causes the airways to shrink, thus less air flows to the lungs. The swelling can also worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways may make more mucus than normal. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways.This can result in asthma symptoms. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound produced when one breaths), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.Factors leading to asthma attacks are called triggers. People can eliminate the possibility of this fatal disease by keeping these triggers away from them. Any home can be full of triggers like extreme temperatures, humidity, mold, dust mites, second-hand smoke, cockroaches, cats and dogs etc. Other asthma triggers may be air pollution, different imbalanced foods, respiratory infections, even physical exertion and mental stress and pollens.A pollen count over 1,500 per cubic meter of air is considered to be a very high level. If it crosses 5,000 per cubic meter, it indicates an emergency condition for people sensitive to paper mulberry. Unfortunately, each year Islamabad sees the worst pollen counts ever recorded in the world.A research conducted by medical scientists at the University of Glasgow, the Europe's largest medical school, indicates that those patients given an exceedingly small homeopathic dose of whatever substance to which they are most allergic can provide significant relief within the first week of treatment.Homeopathy tries to 'cure' this disease, instead of trying to provide symptomatic relief. A homeopath not only records the symptoms of the disease but also studies the physical and psychological characteristics of the patient, his past medical history along with his family history. Of special interest to a homeopath is the history of suppression of any skin disease.It is often, though not necessarily always, observed by homeopaths that when a right medicine is given, the asthma disappears but the old eczema, if it were there originally, reappears for some time, before disappearing for good. This reappearance of old symptoms is seen as a reversal of disease process and is considered a very good prognostic sign by homeopaths.In children asthma is often preceded by eczema. The allopathic doctors have also observed this fact and medical textbooks recorded that the children often 'move out' of eczema and 'move into' asthma without known scientific correlation between these two phenomena. Homeopaths believe that the suppression of eczema with skin ointments does not cure the disease or sensitivity of the person, it merely drives it further 'inwards'.An e-mail message this writer received from the mother of an asthmatic child, who got rid of inhalers after taking the homeopathic treatment, is worth reading.""Dear doctor the last winter was the first cold season in my seven-year old son Zeeshan's life during which he was not nebulized. Moreover he was not given even a single puff of the inhalers! Alhamdulillah. We could not believe that homeopathic treatment could be so effective. His child-specialist had told us that after thirteen years of age 'hopefully' he will grow out of his asthma. We are so happy that the homeopathic treatment has given him so much relief.

Pakistan: Spring is in the air and so is pollen,"ISLAMABAD, March 07 -- The weather has become fairly warm after a mostly dry winter, heralding the onset of spring. But with the pleasant change, the blossoming shrubs and the most infamous paper mulberry trees have started releasing pollen, which comes haunting the allergy patients.According to our correspondent, already there must be thousands of people sneezing and wheezing, and the numbers will surely grow as the pollen explosion moves towards its peak.A recent report of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) shows an upward surge in the pollen count. Statistics released by the PMD offices say the pollen count has touched 96 per cubic metre (PCM) of air.The count still falls in the moderate category, however, even this small amount has been declared ""sensitive"" for those suffering from any sort of pollen allergy.This low pollen count in the beginning of March has been attributed by the experts to the recent wet spells, which have cleared the air of the damaging pollen. But with sun now shining brightly and the spring wind picking up, the amount of pollen in the air is likely to shoot up at an alarming rate over the next 48 hours.There are more than 350 species of plants in the capital city, out of which 35 are known to be capable of causing pollen allergies. /There are about 18 species of grasses, and in addition to the flora, there are several types of moulds present in Islamabad.Till Friday, grasses, paper mulberry and cannabis were among the top pollen shedding plants and trees.According to meteorological experts, the pollen count can touch as high as 40,000 to 45,000 PCM of air, with paper mulberry accounting for almost 90 per cent of the total.Paper mulberry pollens are maximum in number due to the fact that the vegetation of this species is huge in Islamabad and surrounding areas, and also due to the fact that this tree produces catkins.Each catkin can have around 200 flowers and each flower produces about 3 million pollens, whereas each flower of pine produces 160,000 pollens. Pollen during March and April mostly comes from the paper mulberry and pine trees.Dr Mohammad Hanif of the Met office as well as medical experts have already started issuing health warnings to those suffering from any form of pollen allergy, asking the patients to start taking precautionary measures to prevent any serious attack.The deputy commissioner's office in Islamabad, which organises special pollen allergy relief camps, has also started making preparations for the season.Health experts advice pollen allergy patients to try avoiding unnecessary exposure to irritants such as dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution and fresh tar or paint.A doctor in the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) said for the last five years, special arrangements were being made not only in Pims but also other hospitals of the capital to deal with patients suffering from pollen allergy.A sharp surge in the number of allergy patients is seen every year in the months of March and April, and Pims is ready to manage the expected rush, he said""I hope the administrations of other hospitals in the federal capital have also made similar arrangements to deal with this situation,"" he added.Hundreds of people suffering from serious form of pollen allergy prefer to leave the capital city and spend this particular season in drier towns with very low pollen like Lahore, Peshawar and Faisalabad, where there is far less green cover.They return to the Islamabad at the end of April when the pollen in air subsides and it becomes easier for them to breath.Major preventive measures suggested by the doctors for all those suffering from pollen allergy include using effective face mask, keeping the doors and windows shut and taking medicines recommended by their physicians.

Pakistan: Parents under stress cause of childhood asthma,"Karachi, March 08 -- A study of five to nine year olds living in areas of high traffic found those with mothers and fathers who felt most under pressure were the likeliest to develop the condition. Scientists say their findings show parental stress can combine with early exposure to pollution to play a key role in increasing the risk of childhood asthma.They support the idea that stress can be thought of as a social pollutant that, when 'breathed' into the body, may influence the body's immune response. It is thought the risk of asthma and allergy is controlled by a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors. /The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could help explain the huge rise in respiratory complaints and allergies in the last decade. Asthma now affects one in five children and one in ten adults in the UK. Dr Rob McConnell and colleagues said parental stress may make children more susceptible to developing asthma than children under less stress. The researchers followed 2,497 children in Southern California with no previous history of the condition for three years, tracking whether they developed asthma over time. They used a questionnaire that measured parent stress and collected data on exposure to traffic-related pollution and whether the children were exposed to tobacco smoke in the womb.On its own, personal stress or poverty did not increase the risk that children would develop asthma.But when children had stressed parents and lived around high levels of traffic-related pollution, their risk increased compared with those only exposed to car fumes. The researchers found a similar effect of parental stress on the relationship between tobacco smoke exposure in the womb and asthma. Dr McConnell, of the University of Southern California, said: ""These results suggest that children from stressful households are more susceptible to the effects of traffic related pollution and in utero tobacco smoke on the development of asthma.""He said asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness in developed countries and a growing concern worldwide and is considered to be a complex disease as established risk factors have failed to explain trends in the global epidemic. The incidence of asthma has been associated with environmental factors, including combustion products in tobacco smoke, especially exposure in the womb (in utero), and in air pollution.

Bangladesh: Urban Transformation calls for New Approach to Health Services,"DHaka, March 09 -- According to the latest projections by the United Nations Population Division, by 2030 each of the major regions of the developing world will hold more urban than rural dwellers, a development known as the urban transformation.Asia and Latin America already have several cities above 10 million in population, and in recent decades hundreds of large cities, each with populations exceeding one million, have emerged throughout the developing world.As they explore the wide-ranging social, economic, and political implications of the urban transformation, economists are hampered by a limited set of forecasting tools. New research by Population Council demographer Mark Montgomery aims to refine the data by applying new, spatially sensitive methods for estimating and projecting urban populations, paying close attention to where the urban poor are located within and across cities. His findings, summarized in a special section of the journal Science and as a chapter in a forthcoming book on climate change, analyze the health risks and benefits of urban living and dispel some of the assumptions surrounding urban poverty.Is there really an urban health advantage?""There's a common belief that urban dwellers are generally healthier than rural residents, in part because there are more health and social services in cities,"" Montgomery notes. For instance, one analysis of 90 Demographic and Health Surveys found that, on average, the urban populations of poor countries exhibit lower levels of child mortality than their rural counterparts. /Similar urban/rural differences surface across a range of health indicators. ""However, averages can be a misleading basis on which to set health priori-ties,"" Montgomery explains. ""Once we break down the data, it is clear that the urban poor often face health risks that are nearly as severe as or even worse than those of rural villagers.""According to Montgomery, who distinguishes between ""slum dwellers"" and the ""urban poor,"" much more needs to be done to determine the percentage of the urban poor living in slums. For example, one study of urban India found that of all urban households officially classified as poor in 2005, over 80 percent were in nonslum neighborhoods. Also, slums may contain significant percentages of households whose expenditures would put them above the official poverty line. ""Without this information, it is not clear whether poverty alleviation programs should target poor places, such as slums, or poor people, who may live in a variety of neighborhoods,"" Montgomery says.Montgomery's work attacks another myth: that most urban residents live in huge urban agglomerations, or megacities, with populations of more than 10 million. In fact, of all urban residents in cities of 100,000 and more in the developing world, only about 12 percent, or 1 in 8 urban residents, live in megacities.The majority of urban dwellers live in smaller cities or towns. ""The demographic literature tends to overstate the role of very large cities and underemphasize the importance of small- and medium-sized cities,"" Montgomery concludes.Natural population growth rate versus migrationWhen confronted with rapid urbanization, many governments try to expel slum residents and discourage further migration to densely packed urban neighborhoods. This response is likely based on another myth: that migration accounts for most of the urban growth. In developing countries about 60 percent of the urban growth rate is attributable to natural growth-the difference between birth rates and death rates-while the remaining 40 percent is due to migration and spatial expansion. Therefore, a better approach to controlling urban growth might be to promote voluntary family planning programs and work with government health agencies and advocacy groups to improve services to the poorest urban areas, Montgomery suggests.Urban health risks are often unacknowledgedAccording to Montgomery, these and other misconceptions have led policymakers to neglect several key areas, especially in the health field. In many countries residents of smaller cities go without adequate supplies of drinking water and minimally acceptable sanitation. Likewise, while rural shortages of health personnel and services have received attention in recent literature, similar shortages also plague smaller cities and towns. Conventional poverty measures also ignore the important factors of crime and violence, risks that threaten many city dwellers. Indoor and outdoor air pollution, as well as injuries and deaths stemming from traffic accidents, also plague the urban poor. In a bulletin published this summer by the Population Reference Bureau, Montgomery enumerates many ""under-appreciated"" health risks facing the urban poor:n Calling mental health a ""central factor in the health of the urban poor,"" Montgomery notes that community-based studies of mental health in poor countries suggest that 12 percent to 51 percent of urban adults suffer from some form of depression.n Violence in urban areas takes a variety of forms, ranging from political and extrajudicial violence to gang violence, local violent crime, and domestic abuse.n Although as a group urban women are more likely than rural women to use contraception, poor urban women face disadvantages not unlike those facing rural women. The fact that modem contraceptives are often more readily available in urban areas than in rural regions does not imply that poor urban women will be able to use them effectively. Many poor urban women have an unmet need for modern contraception. These women may want to prevent or delay their next birth, yet for various reasons they do not use modem methods to achieve their stated aims, or they use contraception inconsistently or improperly.n When it comes to HIV/AIDS, there is little evidence of the ""urban advantage"" that is seen for other health conditions. Community-based studies of HIV prevalence are now available for a number of developing countries. In at least three cases-Kenya, Mali, and Zambia-urban prevalence rates are much higher than rural rates.n Although malaria has often been regarded as a rural disease, and rural rates of transmission are higher than urban rates, there is evidence that malaria vectors have adapted to urban conditions in sub-Saharan Africa and in some parts of Asia. In urban sub-Saharan Africa, some 200 million city dwellers face appreciable risks of malaria.n Although data are scarce, it is likely that detection rates of tuberculosis among the urban poor are well below rates for other urban residents.n Recent estimates suggest that more than 2 billion people worldwide rely on solid fuels, traditional stoves, and open fires for their cooking, lighting, and heating. These fuels-often used by the urban poor-generate harmful gases that are believed to substantially raise the risks of acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders.New data analysis leads to a better approachBy relying on new databases, such as the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), part of Columbia University's Earth Institute, Montgomery has uncovered subtle new patterns in urban population projections. GRUMP is one of the first efforts to combine satellite map-ping data with population census information. This combination has led to new insights into the distribution of human populations across ecosystems, as well as into changes in patterns of rural and urban development.""Perhaps the greatest need on the demo-graphic front is to ensure that the censuses in developing countries are analyzed at the level of small geographic units and the results placed in the hands of the local and municipal governments,"" Montgomery suggests. ""The data can be an effective tool in planning the pace and spatial distribution of future growth."" Remote-sensing methods, such as satellite mapping, can serve as a valuable supplementary tool.While geographic targeting may be an effective health strategy for reaching slum dwellers, other approaches will need to be devised to meet the needs of the poor who live outside slums, Montgomery suggests. ""The public health sector needs to work in tandem with other government agencies,"" he says. ""Municipal, regional, and national governments need to join forces and form partnerships with private for-profit and nonprofit groups.""As an example of successful partnerships, Montgomery points to grass roots savings groups, which in some cases have collaborated with nongovernmental organizations to improve local sanitation and water supply systems, providing public toilets in Mumbai and extensions of water and sewer lines in Karachi. According to Montgomery, the changes need not be big to make a difference. In Mexico, for example, a program that replaced dirt with cement floors significantly improved the health of young children, leading to reductions in rates of parasitic infection, diarrhea, and anemia.""Among all the misconceptions that have hindered work on urban health, perhaps the most pernicious is the view that in contrast to rural villages, urban neighborhoods somehow lack the social cohesion needed to sustain community participation,"" Montgomery concludes. ""In an urbanizing era, there is every reason to design health programs for the urban poor that take full advantage of the social resources and resourcefulness of their communities.""

Pakistan: Pak-EPA DG floats idea of ring road to keep capital green,"Islamabad, March 13 -- Increasing vehicular movement at Kashmir Highway and GT Road is posing a big challenge to air quality controllers who now fully agree with the idea to construct a bypass or ring road for all heavy traffic in the capital city.According to the statistics provided by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), more than 300,000 vehicles move on Islamabad roads daily. As many as 90,000 vehicles pass through Kashmir Highway and GT Road, which is fast becoming a major source of air pollution in the capital.According to our correspondent, Pak-EPA Director General Asif Shuja Khan told to media that the situation has aggravated to the extent where it is necessary to build a ring road for all kinds of heavy traffic with an aim to decrease air pollution in the 'green city'.The air quality index designed by the Central Laboratory for Environmental Analysis and Networking (Clean) of the Pak-EPA has revealed that air quality of Islamabad is fast slipping into the 'severe category'.The Clean has made five categories for Air Quality Index (AQI) - good (0-25 micro-gm/m3), moderate (26-50 micro-gm/m3), unhealthy (51-100 micro-gm/m3), severe (101-200 micro-gm/m3) and hazardous (201-300 micro-gm/m3). Asif Shuja Khan said that the trans-boundary air pollution from neighbouring city is also a big problem so there is a need to take steps to improve air quality in Rawalpindi.He said that the Ministry of Environment has taken some concrete steps for protection of natural environment, including introduction of Euro-II Standards for vehicles, phasing out sulphur from diesel, strengthening motor vehicle examination emission testing system and large-scale plantation.The PAK-EPA and Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) had started a Vehicular Emission Testing System (VETS) four years back and so far 4,991 vehicles (diesel 2,906, CNG 1,724, petrol 361) causing air pollution were given 'red tickets'.Keeping in view the fact that nitrogen dioxide concentration in the air is precursor to secondary particulate formation and ground level ozone formation, which may become a problem in future, The Ecnec also approved an environment monitoring system at a cost of Rs1,089 million for setting up air monitoring stations and mobile laboratories, upgradation of analytical laboratories and water surveillance.Sources in the Capital Development Authority (CDA) told this correspondent that when they floated the idea to turn heavy traffic towards Rawalpindi then it was conveyed that the Rawalpindi Cantonment administration differed with it and would not support any such proposal. /Asif Shuja Khan said that the most adverse health impact of increasing vehicle emissions including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and tiny suspended particles is fast spreading respiratory diseases.""A small particulate matter PM 2.5 is so fine that once inhaled, it settles below lungs and can mix with blood. Not only does it reduce oxygen carrying capacity of lungs but also causes blood clotting,"" he said. The current and future construction projects also need the attention of the concerned authorities because if contractors or builders would not observe environmental laws then any effort to control air pollution can never ever produce desired results.

Pakistan: Medical assistance to pollen allergy patients initiated,"ISLAMABAD, March 15 -- The Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) has started providing medical assistance to pollen allergy patients in its emergency ward and Out Patient Department (OPD) of Chest disease section.According to hospital sources, around 100 patients visited the PIMS emergency for oxygen and nebulization during last 24 hours. Keeping in view the situation, extra staff has been deputed at the emergency ward to treat the pollen allergy patients, they added.Meanwhile, medical experts have advised the pollen allergy patients to adopt precautionary measures to avoid any medical complication. /They said allergy patients should avoid moving at such places having the offending plant grows and presence of its pollen in the air.They asked the persons with pollen allergy who work outside to wear face masks designed to filter pollen out of the air reaching their nasal passages.Dr Wasim Khawaja of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said during periods of high pollen levels, people with pollen allergy should try to avoid unnecessary exposure to irritants such as dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and fresh tar or paint. Any of these things can aggravate the symptoms of pollen allergy, adding, when pollen allergy is not treated, complications may occur.He said people with seasonal allergies who cannot avoid pollen, the symptoms can be controlled with medication on advice of physician including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and cromolyn sodium, any of which can be used alone or in combination.

Pakistan: China turns 'yellow',"BEIJING, March 24 -- China warned residents across a huge swathe of the country's north including the capital Beijing to avoid going outside Monday as a sandstorm blanketed the area in fine yellow dust. The meteorological administration told a sandstorm that swept down from the Gobi desert Friday would continue to shroud parts of northern China stretching from the far-western region of Xinjiang to Beijing.""We advise friends in these areas to reduce their outdoor activities as much as possible,"" the administration told on its website. ""When you go out, please wear items to protect against the sand such as cotton cloths, masks and glasses to avoid the sand harming your eyes and respiratory system."" Sandstorms are an annual occurrence in arid northern China in the spring, when temperatures start to rise, stirring up clouds of dust that can travel across China to South Korea and Japan, and even as far as the United States.Scientists blame a combination of deforestation, prolonged drought and resulting increase in desertification in northern China. /The sandstorm's impact stretched all the way to Hong Kong in southern China, where the government told it contributed to record air pollution on Monday. On Saturday, South Korea warned residents of the capital Seoul as well as central and western regions to stay indoors due to the storm, media reported. In Beijing on the same day, authorities issued a rare level-five pollution warning, signalling hazardous conditions.The respiratory department at Chaoyang Hospital, one of the city's biggest, told it had seen more than 180 people come with health problems -- 20 percent more than on a usual day, state media reported. The capital was still cloaked in a mustard-yellow haze on Monday and residents complained of coughing and noses clogged with grit, though the administration told the sandstorm was weakening. The storm comes as a severe drought grips the country's southwest, leaving an estimated 20 million people short of drinking water.Air pollution in Hong Kong and Taiwan soared to record levels as officials warned Monday of a public health menace from a toxic stew of particulates, fuelled by a massive sandstorm over Beijing. Readings of Hong Kong's Air Pollution Index were more than double the level at which the general public is advised to stay indoors.""Today's API is at record high levels,"" a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Department told media. Hong Kong's famed skyline and harbour is often shrouded in a blanket of haze which has been criticised as a public health disaster and blamed for driving many expatriates away from the international financial hub.Pollution in nearby Taiwan hit record levels Sunday, shrouding the island and forcing authorities on Monday to call on residents to stay indoors. ""This was the first time ever in Taiwan that air pollution was measured to be at such serious levels over such a wide geographic area,"" told Chang Shun-ching, an official at the Environmental Protection Administration.""Residents should stay indoors,"" he told. ""For those who need to go out, they had better wear face masks."" Doctors at two Taipei-area hospitals contacted by media told the number of outpatients complaining of respiratory difficulties and eye allergies had surged by 30 percent above normal rates. At all but three monitoring stations in Taiwan, each cubic metre of air was found to contain 1,000 micrograms of pollutants per hour. A level of 150 micrograms per cubic metre per hour is enough for the air quality to be described as ""poor"".Chinese authorities warned residents across a huge swathe of the country's north including the capital Beijing to avoid going outside Monday, as the sandstorm blanketed the region in fine yellow dust and a mustard-yellow haze. Residents complained of coughing and noses clogged with grit, although authorities told the sandstorm was weakening.Sandstorms are an annual occurrence in arid northern China in the spring, when temperatures start to rise, stirring up clouds of dust that can travel across China to South Korea and Japan, and even to the United States. Scientists blame a combination of deforestation and prolonged drought for the encroachment of desert into more of northern China. The consequences are felt near and wide.Hong Kong's API is a ratio based on the concentration of pollutants in the air, including sulphur dioxide and lead. Monday's record readings soared as high as 495 at one roadside station. People with heart or respiratory problems are advised to stay indoors at an API reading of more than 100. The public is advised to stay indoors or avoid prolonged exposure to heavy traffic areas at more than 200.""This is very scary, over 300 is very scary, very polluted,"" Edwin Lau, director of Friends of the Earth Hong Kong, told media. Schools across Hong Kong kept students indoors, with most cancelling outdoor playground activities and games, or off-campus trips. ""We have stopped any outdoor physical activity or playing to safeguard the children,"" John Ainsworth, a vice-principal at the exclusive Bradbury School, told media. The city's air quality problem was exacerbated by an unusual combination of the Chinese sandstorm and strong southerly winds which blew particulates into the city.Earlier this month, a group of Hong Kong businesses -- including Starbucks, Pacific Coffee, Ben & Jerry's and Pure Fitness -- launched an unprecedented petition campaign to combat Hong Kong's worsening air pollution. The organisers also placed ads in newspapers, warning that the city's smog ""kills three people a day"" and that its air is ""three times dirtier than New York City's Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Bangladesh: Experts caution on NCDs,"DHAKA, March 25 -- Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will be responsible for 59 per cent of deaths in the country by this year, 2010, compared to 40 per cent in 1990.According to our correspondent, the NCDs are heart diseases, stroke, cancer and respiratory illness.This was disclosed at a workshop at Hotel Sonargaon in the city yesterday. The World Health Organisation (WHO) organised the workshop. WHO's country representative Dunnsvadel Sungkhagol and experts and journalists participated in the workshop.The experts said globalisation, unplanned urbanisation, environmental and lifestyle factors and an ageing population contributed to an increased burden of NCDsExpressing grave concern they said changing dietary habits, unregulated growth of tobacco, processed food and beverages, indoor air pollution, road traffic injuries and widespread lack of awareness about healthy behaviour patterns contributed to the high and increasing incidence of NCDs in the country.The experts also said that prevention and control of communicable disease (CDS) continued to be of concern.New and re-emerging communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis also have to be controlled. /To effectively manage the double burden of disease, health systems need to realign its service-mix, workforce skills, and resource allocation, they added.The WHO's physicians and experts said Bangladesh was at risk of an HIV/AIDS epidemic due to the high prevalence of the disease in the neighbouring countries and due to the limited access to counselling and testing services on account of social stigma.There were also concerns over HIV-tuberculosis coinfection with Bangladesh being among the countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis, they pointed out.The physicians and experts said that malaria was epidemic in the east and north-east parts of the country with nearly 11 million people at risk of the most dangerous type of infection.

Brunei: Call to set up neighbourhood fire watch groups for residents' safety,"BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, March 26 -- SOME residents are taking extra precautions for the dry season and suggested setting up neighbourhood watch groups, following a recent bushfire which occured at Jalan Muara last Sunday.According to our correspondent, Noranisah Hj Rasidi, a 25-year-old living in the Salambigar area of Jalan Muara, expressed her disappointment in people who still conduct open burning.""It's very frustating to see and hear that people are still unaware of the health hazards that come with open burning because they're obviously thinking just for themselves in burning their leaves and tree branches to keep their garden clean but what about the neighbours?"" she said.""I was frightened when I heard that last week's fire was caused by someone irresponsible who did not properly extinguish their burning.""Noranisah said that she has spread the word about open burning to her friends and neighbours and made sure that parents were aware of it.""We obviously know that word travels fast in Brunei and thankfully, I hope that I've gotten the message out to them,"" said the 25-year-old.""My friends and I are actually planning a neighbourhood watch team, not for things like crime as we can rely on the police but for the smaller things like fires, stray animals etc.""Linda, who hails from America, said that a neighbourhood watch group would come in handy when a crime is committed.""Back in my country, we usually elect people from our neighbourhood to be part of a neighbourhood watch team where they would look out for things like house break-ins, damage of property and even for this case, bushfires,"" said the 32-year-old, who lives near Sungai Hanching.""Although, we often give these responsibilities to boy scouts as it is part of their duty and dedication but we do have proper adult watchmen who reinforce it when higher authorities can't attend to us.""Mohammad Farizali Osman, a Sungai Hanching resident, said that he has taken action as he believes that everyone has to prioritise their safety first in the sight of danger.""After I heard news that last Sunday's bushfire had spread all the way from Salambigar, I quickly told my parents about it in my panic state but to my disappointment, they didn't do anything to resolve the problem,"" said the 19-year-old.""So since I can't rely on my parents to prevent it from happening again, I made the effort to clean up all the dry leaves, broken branches and all the other flammable things that could catch fire.""He added that he is not only keeping his house compound clean, but is also helping the environment by not letting the fire spread and emit smoke that will contribute to air pollution. /Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Emission inspectors diverted towards solid waste disposal in SITE,"Karachi, March 26 -- The Vehicular Emission Control Programme (Vecop) staff have not inspected a single vehicle since March 12, because Sindh Environmental Protection Agency's (Sepa) Director General (DG) Naeem Mughal had diverted all the human resource of VECOP towards monitoring solid waste removal from the SITE industrial area.According to our correspondent, Sepa DG Naeem Mughal was directed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to remove all solid waste from the SITE Industrial Area, and the chief of the environmental watchdog had assured the apex court that the task would be completed within a week.Subsequently, sources in Sepa confirmed that not only the Vecop staff, but all other staff working on other projects were also asked by Mughal to concentrate on solid waste removal from the SITE Industrial Area.Vecop officials had been inspecting commercial and private vehicles on various roads in the city since January 27 under the mandate of Sepa and the Sindh environment and alternate energy department to collect data regarding air-pollution-causing vehicles and the impact of pollution on operators as well as other citizens.Sindh Environment Minister Shaikh Muhammad Afzal said that owing to the Supreme Court's orders, the removal of industrial waste had been put on highest priority - but the department was facing a shortage of staff. Hence the Vecop Inspectors were deputed to SITE to help with the effort.He, however, denied that the Emission inspection programme had been put on hold. /Meanwhile, the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) has barred Vecop from inspecting vehicles within the DHA's jurisdiction to gauge the quantum of smoke and other pollutants emitted by them, media has learnt.A couple of weeks ago, however, the DHA's vigilance staff barred the Vecop staff from inspecting vehicles in the DHA's jurisdiction. The Vecop officials were approached by the vigilance staff of the housing authority, who demanded that the staff either show permission from DHA authorities to carry out their work, or leave immediately. The Vecop officials were reportedly taken by surprise, and tried to convince the vigilance staff that they did not require any permission from anyone, because they were undertaking the inspection work for a government agency. The DHA's vigilance staff, however, refused to accept this and forced them to leave.A Vecop official confirmed the incident and said that the attitude of the DHA's vigilance staff created an impression that perhaps the DHA was a ""state within the state"" which prohibits even the provincial environmental watchdog from carrying out routine activities within the jurisdictions of military-led land-controlling authorities.DHA spokesman Lt Col (retd) Rafat Naqvi, meanwhile, expressed ignorance regarding the incident. ""If any such thing has happened, however, it could be a misunderstanding. The lower staff of the DHA vigilance department have been ordered to not allow anyone to film or shoot pictures without permission in the DHA's jurisdiction. The vigilance staff may have thought that the Sepa officials were a filming group,"" he added.Naqvi further claimed that the DHA believed in environmental conservation and protection and always went a step forward in facilitating organisations and authorities that work in the field of environmental conservation.The Sepa DG reportedly ignored a request from acting Vecop Incharge Dr Shafique, who had asked him to write a letter to the DHA to seek permission for Vecop staff to operate in their limits.Vecop officials said that since they were contractual employees of Sepa, they were not authorised to make correspondence with other agencies and authorities; unless the Sepa DG seeks permission from the DHA, Vecop officials cannot enter DHA to inspect vehicles.

Pakistan: Factories not good for city's health,"Islamabad, March 27 -- The environment ministry has once again asked the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to relocate industrial units running in the city's I-9 and I-10 sectors.According to our correspondent, a supplementary question, Minister for Environment Hameedullah Jan Afridi informed the National Assembly on Thursday that he was in active discussions with the CDA officials for relocating the industrial area away from the residential sectors.The civic agency is in the process of identifying an alternative site, and as soon as it will select one, the polluting industrial units will be shifted there, Mr Afridi said.Initially, I-9 and I-10 sectors were considered suburbs of the city, but due to the unprecedented rise in population, now the area is being surrounded by residential sectors.People living near the area have been complaining of increasing air pollution. They also reported increasing cases of respiratory diseases caused by inhaling dangerous particulates spewed out by industrial units.The conditions also caused persistent smog in adjoining residential sectors.Mr Afridi informed the lower house that over 100 industrial units in I-9 and I-10 were potential source of pollution. They include nine steel melting furnaces, 11 re-rolling mills, 25 flour mills, five oil and ghee mills, 31 marble cutting and polishing units, 10 pharmaceuticals, two galvanising units and 23 metal working and engineering plants.The minister further said that the steel melting furnaces had been identified as the major source of pollution.Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) had closed down four furnaces for causing excessive pollution and issued orders for installation of anti-pollution equipments in all the steel furnaces operating in I-9 and I-10.The problem, however, still exists as the owners use ""dirty scrap"" and do not operate the anti-pollution equipment on regular basis. /Interestingly, at the time of monitoring these units use clean scrap and keep the anti-pollution equipment operational.Pak-EPA has filed two cases in the Environment Protection Tribunal (EPT) Lahore for action against the offenders.When environment minister's attention was drawn towards increasing pollution in the Rawal Lake, a drinking water reservoir for Rawalpindi city, Mr Afridi said it was a collective responsibility of both the federal and Punjab governments.Shireen Arshad Khan of the PML (N) criticised the environment minister for mishandling the Rawal Lake issue, saying the issue had come up on more than one occasions in the National Assembly but the government was yet to come up with some actionable solution.In response, the minister said it was joint financial liability of both the CDA and Water and Sanitation Agency of Rawalpindi to put up a treatment plant for the inflow.Replying to another question, the minister said the government was working on a comprehensive plan to install treatment plants for all industrial areas in the country.

Pakistan: What's cookin'? It could be air pollution,"Islamabad, March 30 -- The enticing aromas that restaurants emit are actually a type of air pollution that could pose a risk to your health and the environment, US researchers report. Gases and tiny solid particles are among the pollutants pumped out by commercial food cooking, according to Deborah Gross, of Carleton College in Northfield, Minn.""While that mouth-watering smell may whet our appetite, it comes from the emission of smoke from the cooking process into the air that we breathe,"" she said in a news release.Gross and a colleague measured the aerosol particles - solid and liquid droplets - while cooking food using typical commercial appliances - pizzas in an oven, steaks in a broiler, and burgers on a griddle, clamshell broiler and charcoal fire.The highest levels of emissions came from fatty foods cooked with high heat, especially with open flames, such as cooking burgers on a conveyor broiler. For every 1,000 pounds of burger cooked, there were 25 pounds of emissions, they found. /For every 1,000 pounds of pizza cooked, there were three pounds of emissions. Noting that certain oils can increase emissions, they said that for every 1,000 pounds of chicken cooked in a wok with peanut oil, there were 45 pounds of emissions.This type of research may lead to better methods of food-related emission control, the researchers said.""Not only do these emissions affect air quality, but they contain chemicals that are known carcinogens,"" Gross said.The study was to be presented March 23 at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco.

Pakistan: Conjunctivitis infections up in summer season: expert,"HYDERABAD, April 01 -- Summer is a hottest season and this season starts in April when things begin to heat up many suffer from itching, burning, and watering of the eyes and this 'red eye' can either be due to allergies, called 'allergic conjunctivitis' and infectious conjunctivitis'./Talking to the media here on Tuesday Eminent Surgeon, Eye Specialist and Assistant Professor of Eye Department of ISRA University Hospital, Dr.Syed Jamil Ahmed has said that red, watery eyes, inflamed lids, blurred vision and a sandy or scratchy feeling in the eyes may indicate that you have conjunctivitis./He said that the Pus-like or watery discharge around the eyelids indicate an infectious form of the disease, commonly known as ""pink eye.""/Dr.Jamil Ahmed informed that the Conjunctivitis is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva, a thin, transparent layer covering the surface of the inner eyelid and the front of the eye and it affects people of all ages./About the causes of the Conjunctivitis he said that the three main types of conjunctivitis are infectious, allergic and chemical. A contagious virus or bacteria cause the infectious form, commonly known as ""pink eye,"" and patient body's allergies to pollen, cosmetics, animals or fabrics often bring on allergic conjunctivitis like irritants air pollution, noxious fumes and chlorine in swimming pools may produce the chemical form, he added./The certain forms of conjunctivitis can develop into a serious condition that may harm the vision and it is important to have conjunctivitis diagnosed and treated quickly, he said./He said that some common allergens include pollen from trees and grass, weed pollens and moulds, animal skin, fur and secretions such as saliva, perfumes and cosmetics and eye make up, skin medicines, air pollution and smoke./He said that the grass pollens tend to cause symptoms in early summer and various other pollens and moulds may cause symptoms later in the summer./Dr.Jamil said that in our city construction dust is a major cause of allergic conjunctivitis and the perennial form persists throughout the year and is usually triggered by dust mites. He said that in some cases, use of mosquito-repellent liquids used in a closed room throughout the night can cause allergies and puffy eyelids, viral and bacterial infections, added. About the symptoms of conjunctivitis Dr.Jamil Ahmed informed that the eyes are usually itchy, and the whites of the eyes look red or pink, a burning feeling may occur and it may be painful, eyelids tend to swell, eyes can water as in allergic conjunctivitis or become 'gluey' as in infective conjunctivitis but is vision is not usually affected, he added./He said that the in severe cases the conjunctiva under the upper eyelids swell and look lumpy. He said that the allergic conjunctivitis is irritating and uncomfortable, but it will not hurt patients' eyesight unless very severe and infectious conjunctivitis however needs urgent attention as the symptoms can worsen and become difficult to treat./About the use of the contact lenses he said that the its not a good idea to wear contacts while patients have conjunctivitis, Instead, wear glasses until patient eyes feel better./About the treatment Dr.Syed Jamil suggested that bathing the eyes with a cloth soaked in cold water soothe the eyes. He said that depending on the type of conjunctivitis, eye drops that reduce inflammation and treat infection (antibiotic) are prescribed by their eye doctor./He said that steroid eye drops are rarely needed or used and steroids are good at reducing inflammation and h However, they should only be used under the supervision of an eye specialist as infection and other causes of conjunctivitis need to be definitely ruled out. He said and added that steroids can make some other eye conditions worse./He said that Conjunctivitis treatment depends upon the cause and treatment of allergic conjunctivitis is by avoiding the allergen, viral conjunctivitis resists treatment, broad-spectrum antibiotic and eyedropper may prevent secondary infection./Dr.Jamil Ahmed said that the small children, who may forget these precautions, should be kept away from school, camp and the swimming pool until the condition is cured and antibiotic medication, usually eye drops, is effective for bacterial conjunctivitis./He further said that the infectious conjunctivitis caused by bacteria, is usually treated with antibiotic eye drops and ointment but other infectious forms, caused by viruses, can't be treated with antibiotics and must be fought off by patients body's immune system.

Pakistan: Korangi industrial waste burning poses public health hazard,"KARACHI, April 02 -- KARACHI: Owing to insufficient attention of the environmental watchdog and sanitation department towards the dumping of solid waste by industrialists, including several tanners, the Korangi Industrial Area is facing major health and environment challenges, it emerged on Wednesday./According to our correspondent, streets and roads of the vast industrial area are found littered with hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste./Residents of nearby localities, workers and visitors to the industrial area fear that the situation, if not checked properly, may have catastrophic effects on public health. The entire area reeked of chemical waste,/One can see the frequent and unchecked burning of tannery solid effluents, skin and chemically-treated leather waste along the roads and near sensitive installations, said a regular visitor to the area. ""The longstanding issue of environmental hazards perhaps needs a Supreme Court verdict to get resolved on a pattern of the case of polluting factories in SITE.""/A survey of Sector-6 comprising Mehran town and Sharifabad and Sector 7-A showed that even the combined effluent treatment plant meant for the effluents of tanneries was not following the safe operating practices./Last year, four workers died at this treatment plant after inhaling poisonous gas, but nobody heard if any step was taken by the relevant authorities to fix the leakage problem, said a vendor in the area. ""You can see the hazardous waste and sludge generated by the plant in the nearby depression areas and open plots. The rubbish strewn all over this place is meant for burning,"" he pointed out./At the tanneries, a chrome (chromium) tanning method is widely used to chemically alter animal skins into supple and strong leather. The technique involves large quantities of water and chemicals and so is the quantity of waste -liquid effluents, solid waste and air emissions- that is released by the tanneries. Solid waste include dusted curing salts, raw trimmings, wet trimmings, dry trimmings, wet shavings, dry shavings, buffing, and packaging material./Tanneries are generally blamed for adversely affecting the environment and health of their workers and surrounding communities. The common diseases due to unsafe handling of the solid waste are named as respiratory disorders and skin infections./While some motorcyclists passing through the thick smoke of burning waste were seen with their nose covered with masks and handkerchiefs, scavengers were found sifting through the industrial and hazardous wastes without taking any preventive measure./Town administration/Korangi Town Administrator Mohammad Sami Khan said: ""We have to handle thousands of tonnes of industrial solid waste, including hazardous and toxic, accumulated during the months mainly due to unsafe practices of many of the 4,000 industrial units in the town.""/The administrator said he had met the representatives of Korangi Association of Trade and Industries and the Pakistan Tanners' Association and had told them that the town administration was ready to provide logistic support to the industries if they contributed towards cost of fuel used for lifting of waste and its transfer to the landfill sites of the city government./He said that the town alone could not manage the waste problem and improve the overall environmental conditions in the vicinity and that was why he wanted the industrialists to have their own permanent system of the waste segregation at the source, and lifting and transportation to the designated dumping sites in their vicinity. For the purpose, they could hire the services of contractors, who might prove economical and effective as far as the lifting of the waste from their doorsteps was concerned./He said that he believed that polluters would have to pay to resolve the issue on an immediate basis so that the existing heaps of waste were removed from the streets and roads of the industrial area./In reply to a question, he said that the improper disposal of tannery solid waste was surely a matter of concern and in addition to industrialists, he would also take up the matter of dumping of the CETP' sludge solid waste in the open with plant managers./He said that the town administration could not take any severe action against the industries, as it was the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency's duty to ensure that the industries were not contravening the environmental laws./Sepa action/Director-General of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency Naeem A. Mughal said that Sepa's field officers off and on visited the tanneries and issued several environmental protection orders to the polluters./""Legal action will surely be taken against those who fail to comply with Sepa directives,"" he said./When asked, he said that it was true that no environmental impact assessment of the CETP had been conducted, but the body maintaining the plant claimed that it was running it in an environmental friendly manner./Sepa would, however, examine the matter pertaining to improper disposal of solid waste (sludge cakes) by the plant in places other than designated sites. The tanners' body might also be told to file monitoring reports and environmental compliance reports to Sepa in future, he said./The DG said that the issue of solid waste and dumping grounds, waste water discharge and emission of volatile compounds causing air pollution could be addressed by the industrialists of Korangi town only when they had a vigilance committee and an integrate system to refrain polluting units from causing any adverse impact on the environment./Officials of the tanners' association were not available for comment.

Pakistan: Air pollution at alarming level,"LAHORE, April 04 -- The level of toxic materials and pollution in the ambient air in the provincial capital has increased by almost 85 per cent which is more than National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), hence, posing serious threat to the health of the residents./According to our correspondent, officials of the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), Punjab, claimed that the increasing trend of air pollution had turned the provincial capital into one of the most polluted cities across the country./They said the deteriorating air quality was due to the increasing number of vehicles, site constructions, industries working in the premises of the city and other factors. Rapid motorization and urbanization had led to unacceptable air pollution in major cities, especially Lahore, they claimed./They said the concentration of respirable dust PM 2.5 was 122 microgram per cubic meter, three times higher than standard value of 40 microgram per cubic meter. They maintained that carbon-monoxide and sulphur-dioxide were within the permissible standards./The department officials revealed that the level of nitrogen-oxides was 148 microgram per cubic meter, almost 85 per cent more than the National standards of 80 microgram per cubic meter. The overall air quality index was 135 which indicated that ambient air was severely polluted from health point of view, they maintained./Vehicular Gaseuos emissions gases like oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, directly discharged by various sources, are injurious to the health of children and the old, especially, they added. They attributed the rise in pollution with the local transport which was contributing a major role in polluting air of the provincial capital. Local vans, buses and heavy diesel engines trucks were major sources of air pollution, they said./Air pollutants directly affect the respiratory system of human health, especially children with respiratory diseases, environmental experts said, adding, in addition to these, Ozone is produced as a byproduct of reactions between hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen increasing with strong sunlight./The EPD installed air quality monitoring systems in three different areas of Lahore to monitor the air quality, two stationery stations in Town Hall (the Lower Mall) and Township and the third one is a mobile van, which is presently monitoring the Gulberg area. Monitoring data of these stations indicates that the Town Hall area is more polluted than Gulberg and Township./The fluctuation of air quality depends upon two factors, intensity of pollutants being emitted from mobile and stationery sources and the stability of the atmosphere./As long as the volume of the vehicles is concerned, it remains almost the same throughout the year except for summer vacations. Dispersion effect is enhanced with rise in temperature, solar radiation and wind speed which ultimately minimizes accumulation of pollutants in a certain area. The air quality index for last 15 days has been improved as compared to winter season, but still falls in upper unhealthy index scale most of the time. The department has notified an advisory committee on air pollution comprises of different experts from academic and research organizations to give recommendations to address the issue of air pollution in Punjab.

Pakistan: World Health Day observed,"ISLAMABAD, April 09 -- World Health Day observed throughout the country on Wednesday with a theme of ""urbanization and health"", selected in recognition of the formidable health challenges faced in urban settings./Various events were organized on the day at various levels to raise awareness of the potential effects of urbanization on the health of individuals and communities. More than half of the world's population lives in cities, and this proportion is growing. It is estimated that by 2030, 60% population will be living in urban areas./The growing trend of urbanization brings many risks, including high population growth rates, air pollution, road traffic crashes, water and sanitation problems, food shortages, lack of sports and recreation facilities, congestion, growth of slum areas, etc. Urbanization is the main source of many social challenges, many of which directly or indirectly impact the health and livelihood of people living in the cities./Many health challenges are associated with urbanization like water, environment, violence and injury, non-communicable diseases and their risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity as well as the risks associated with disease outbreaks./The major drivers or social determinants of health in urban settings are beyond the health sector, including physical infrastructure, access to social and health services, local governance, and the distribution of income and educational opportunities./According to health experts, solutions exist to tackle the root causes of urban health challenges. Better urban planning can promote healthy behaviours and safety through investment in active transport, designing areas to promote physical activity and passing regulatory controls on tobacco and food safety. They said improving urban living conditions in the areas of housing, water and sanitation will go a long way to mitigate health risks.

Pakistan: Air-pollution tied to stroke death,"ISLAMABAD, April 11 -- Traffic-related air pollution may be linked/to a higher death rate among people who initially survived strokes./According to our correspondent, the impact of air pollution on survival after stroke is unknown. To/examine this, researchers studied 3320 men and women who lived in a/specific south London region and had a first stroke between 1995 and 2005, BBC reported./The researchers used 2002 estimates of two common traffic pollutants/nitrogen dioxide and small, inhalable particles called particulate matter (less than 10 micrometre in diameter) linked to breathing difficulties and other health problems. All of the areas were typical of London./The low-pollution areas typically did not have major roads running/through them. The higher pollution areas had levels of nitrogen dioxide/that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency consider the U.S. average./The study reported more deaths in the higher polluted neighborhoods -/975 of 1659 patients, or about 59 percent, in high nitrogen dioxide neighborhoods and 967 of 1658 patients, or about 58 percent, in high particulate matter areas./That compared to 881 of 1661 patients, or about 53 percent, in an/area less polluted by high nitrogen dioxide, and 889 of 1662 patients, or about 53 percent, in an area less polluted by high particulate matter./Thus the risk of dying increased 28 percent when nitrogen dioxide/levels rose by just 10 micrograms per cubic meters of air while a similar increase in particulate matter increased death risk by 52 percent./Risk for death remained higher with greater air pollution exposure/after the investigators took into account a number of other factors associated with stroke death including age, gender, ethnicity, smoking/and alcohol use, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes./The researchers suggest that improvements in outdoor air quality/might contribute to better survival after stroke.

Sri Lanka: High quality diesel for SL by 2012,"Colombo, April 11 -- By the year 2012, Sri Lanka would be in a position to introduce Euro 4 diesel, the best quality diesel used in developed countries, National Council for Economic Development Executive Director Don Jayaweera said./According to our correspondent, he told a recent workshop, titled 'Clean Fuels and Vehicles' organized by the South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme (SACEP) in Colombo, that though at present Sri Lanka used Euro 2 type diesel upgraded by refineries it would be in a position to use Euro 4./Senior officials of all member countries Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka participated in the two-day workshop./The objective of the workshop was to enhance knowledge among policy makers on the environmental and health benefits of using clean fuels./They conceded that air pollution objective of this workshop was to enhance knowledge among policy makers on the environmental and health benefits of using clean fuels./During the discussion they agreed air pollution in many cities in the developing world is reaching crisis proportions./According to the World Health Organisation, only 15 per cent of the largest cities in developing countries have acceptable air quality./According to Colombo Municipal Council Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Ruwan Wijaymuni the high levels of urban air pollution had attracted the growing attention of the governments, civil society, and industries as poor air quality is related to many deaths each year, and contributes to the plight of thousands more who suffer from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and lung cancer./He said that lead emissions are extremely harmful to children under age six, interfering with the development of brain and other organs and systems. These pollutants can be reduced by using lower-sulphur and lead-free fuels and by introducing the new vehicle technologies and emission control devices that require such fuels./The number of vehicles in the cities of South Asia has seen a rapid increase in the last ten years. In Delhi alone, the vehicular population has increased around tenfold in 20 years and accounts for more than 60 per cent of the particulate pollution. Two-wheelers and diesel driven heavy trucks are a significant source of urban air pollution. Another issue leading to this problem is the poor road infrastructure development, which had lead to traffic congestions which is the norm in most South Asian cities, he said.

Pakistan: Special arrangements at PIMS for pollen allergy patients,"ISLAMABAD, April 12 -- Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) has made special arrangements for pollen allergy patients./According to hospital sources, the number of pollen allergy patients are increasing and daily around 100 patients are being treated in the PIMS emergency and pulmonology department./They said best facilities are being provided to such patients alongwith life saving medicines at emergency department besides nebulization, bronchodilaters, steroids, oxygen therapy, nursing care and specialist consultation free of cost. Medical experts have advised the pollen allergy patients to adopt precautionary measures to avoid complications./They said allergy patients should avoid moving at such places where the offending plant grows and where its pollens exist in the air./They asked people having pollen allergy to wear face masks designed to filter pollen out of the air reaching their nasal passages. During periods of high pollen levels, they should try to avoid unnecessary exposure to irritants such as dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and fresh tar or paint./According to them, any of these can aggravate the symptoms of pollen allergy. If pollen allergy is not treated, complications may occur, they added. They said people with seasonal allergies who cannot avoid pollen, the symptoms can be controlled with medication./Air-pollution tied to stroke death: Traffic-related air pollution may be linked to a higher death rate among people who initially survived strokes./The impact of air pollution on survival after stroke is unknown. To examine this, researchers studied 3320 men and women who lived in a specific south London region and had a first stroke between 1995 and 2005, BBC reported./The researchers used 2002 estimates of two common traffic pollutants nitrogen dioxide and small, inhalable particles called particulate matter (less than 10 micrometer in diameter) linked to breathing difficulties and other health problems. All of the areas were typical of London./The low-pollution areas typically did not have major roads running through them. The higher pollution areas had levels of nitrogen dioxide that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency consider the U.S. average./The study reported more deaths in the higher polluted neighborhoods-975 of 1659 patients, or about 59 percent, in high nitrogen dioxide neighborhoods and 967 of 1658 patients, or about 58 percent, in high particulate matter areas./That compared to 881 of 1661 patients, or about 53 percent, in an area less polluted by high nitrogen dioxide, and 889 of 1662 patients, or about 53 percent, in an area less polluted by high particulate matter./Thus the risk of dying increased 28 percent when nitrogen dioxide levels rose by just 10 micrograms per cubic meters of air while a similar increase in particulate matter increased death risk by 52 percent./Risk for death remained higher with greater air pollution exposure after the investigators took into account a number of other factors associated with stroke death including age, gender, ethnicity, smoking and alcohol use, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes./The researchers suggest that improvements in outdoor air quality might contribute to better survival after stroke.

Bangladesh: Tobacco Control Act updating in limbo,"DHAKA, April 18 -- Although the process of amending the tobacco control act started ten months ago, little progress has been made so far despite the fact that the number of tobacco users is rising in the country./According to our correspondent, yesterday anti-tobacco campaigners told that the amendment which was essential to halt the increasing trend of tobacco consumption, could not preceded due to 'low priority' attached to it./Dr Syed Omar Khaiyum, joint secretary of the health ministry who is a key figure in the amendment committee, without elaborating, said, the amendment process was on track. ""We will complete it by this year.""/But, anti-tobacco campaigners alleged that the delay was 'unnecessary' and would increase the number of tobacco users and their sufferings./According to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2009, currently 41.3 million people aged above 15 use tobacco either in smoke or smokeless form. The number was 32.3 million in 2007./World Health Organisation's study observed that 57,000 deaths annually and 382,000 disabilities in the country were attributed to tobacco use. Stricter antitobacco legislation should be in place, it observed./Iqbal Masud, who was also a member of the amendment committee said, amendment of the Smoking and Tobacco products Usages (Control) Act 2005 was imperative to close the existing loopholes./For instances, he said, 25.9 million people currently use smokeless tobacco like zarda, sada pata and gul, but the act did not include these items./Besides, Masud who is also the coordinator of the Dhaka Ahsania Mission for Tobacco, Drug and Hiv/Aids, said, the 2005 act could not ensure smoke free environment as it kept provision for a designated place to smoke at workplace leaving people at risk of breathing air polluted by tobacco smoke./Quoting GATS statistics he said, at present 45 per cent people aged above 15 are exposed to such smoking which is as detrimental as smoking./Another big loophole in the existing act is not ensuring pictorial warnings at cigarette packets depicting the effects of smoking, observed programme manager of the WBB Trust Syed Mahbubul Alam, who is also a member of the amendment committee./He said, pictorial warning could discourage a significant number of people from smoking who cannot read the written warnings on tobacco packs./He said some 26 countries have started using pictorial warnings and that the government should force the tobacco companies to use such warnings covering 50 per cent of a cigarette pack./Economist Taifur Rahman who is also involved in campaigning for stricter tobacco control measures said, the amendment was necessary to remove these weaknesses in the present law which, he said, was not comprehensive./He added: ""The country is paying a price for its delay in adopting stricter tobacco control act to help smokers give up and dissuade young people from taking up the habit.""/""More than 40 million people are exposed to secondhand smoking but the 2005 act kept a provision for designating a place to smoke at workplace,"" he said./""Stopping smoking in the workplace is a very effective way of encouraging people to give up.""/He added: ""Though the government earns huge revenue from tobacco companies, more money is spent on the treatment of smoking-related diseases.""/""The 2005 act should be amended in such a way that the tobacco companies cannot take advantage of the loopholes to expand their market through various tricky measures,"" he said./Dr Omar Khaiyum said, they were receiving comments which would be incorporated in the updated act./""It is taking time as amending an act requires massive involvement of people,"" he said./WHO says tobacco alone is responsible for 30 per cent of all the diseases in the world, and 60 per cent of all the mortal diseases.

Bangladesh: Measures demanded to contain air pollution,"Dhaka, April 19 -- Green activists on Saturday demanded immediate and effective measures to contain air pollution in the capital city as the concentration of dust has crossed the standard limit by five to ten times in the city air depending on the areas./The green activists under the banner of Save Environment Movement formed a human chain in front of the office of Dhaka city mayor, Nagar Bhaban, to press home the demand./Save Environment Movement chairman Abu Naser Khan, Nirapad Development Foundation chairman Ibnul Sayeed Rana, Save Environment Movement joint secretary Sagiruzzaman Shakik, Puran Dhaka Unnayan Forum president Nazimuddin and Bishwa Sahitya Kendra representative Mesbahuddin Suman were present on the occasion./'The Bangladeshi standard for the level of suspended particulate matter (air pollutant) in the residential areas is 200 micro gram per cubic metre. But the level touched 2000mg/m3 in different parts of the city,' said Abu Naser Khan./He said average dust concentration in the air of the capital varies from 1000 to 1200mg/m3 which is five to six times higher than the Bangladeshi standard and seven to eight times higher than the WHO standard. WHO sets SPM level in the commercial at 120mg/m3, he added./'Road digging, plying of uncovered sand-laden trucks and keeping construction materials open on the roadsides are the major causes of dust in the city, which are responsible for severe air pollution, posing health hazards to the city dwellers,' he observed./The green activists called on the government to formulate special policy to contain the steady increase in dust concentration in the city and to instruct all the authorities concerned to take strong measures to follow the respective rules while constructing building, digging roads and sweeping the roads./Severe air pollution is threatening public health in the Dhaka city, they said./Due to the excessive dust in Dhaka's air, people are falling victim to different complex diseases including tuberculosis, asthma, respiratory complications, bronchitis and other skin diseases, they observed./Sweeping of the city roads during daytime is another reason for increase in dust./According to the city corporation rules, garbage collection and its disposal should be done before 8:00am but the rule is not duly followed.

Pakistan: 'Protect the environment to control asthma',"Karachi, May 06 -- In order to control asthma, we need to protect our surroundings and environment, said Dr Javaid A. Khan, chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), in a seminar organised on World Asthma Day./At present, he said, asthmais likely to increase in developing countries due to rising air pollution, lack of ventilation in homes, vitamin D deficiency and most importantly, lower trend of breast feeding. A mother's milk, he says, immunises a child from a lot of diseases and infection in the first year of birth and provides a complete nutrition as well, but for reasons best known to women, there is a lower trend of breast feeding, which can be one of the reasons for rising cases of asthma in newborn./""Nearly, 10 per cent of children and 5 per cent of adults in Pakistan suffer from asthma. And though the causes are varied but most prominent one among them is the smoking indoors which causes asthma among children."" He said that around 70 per cent of children in Pakistan are exposed to passive smoking, which is another cause for concern./Dr Khan pointed out the role of public, which he said was quite disappointing. ""The ministry of health started a campaign to ban smoking form public spaces but it has not been implemented as yet. The government can not do that we have to do it ourselves.""/He said that asthma can be managed by using medication and inhalers, and avoiding allergens like pollen and dust mites in homes./Asthma is hard to diagnose, especially in children under five, but regular physical checkups can help identify it, said Dr Ali Bin Sarwar Zubairi, Consultant Pulmonologist, AKUH. He added that reviewing a patient's medical history, physical examination, and lung function tests can provide the information needed to diagnose the disease. He said that the reason asthmatic dies is because of the wrong assessment of the severity of the infection, which a doctor must give importance to by re-examining. Dr Zubairi also cleared the misconception that blood tests can diagnose the condition of a patient./Head Nurse AKUH, Mehrunnisa Kabani refuted the misconception that rice causes development of asthma in a patient, whereas she also added that inhalers are not addictive. Speaking about the diet an asthmatic or other people should have, she said that eating fruits and vegetables is the best way of keeping the infection at bay, rather than opting for antibiotics or vitamin tablets.

Pakistan: 'Polluting' factory questions environmental tribunal's jurisdiction,"KARACHI, May 09 -- The Sindh Environmental Protection Tribunal has reserved its order on the maintainability of a complaint against a factory accused of creating health and environmental problems in its surrounding area./The tribunal comprising its chairperson Ashraf Jahan and members Dr Samiuzzaman (technical) and Abdul Karim Memon (legal) adjourned the proceedings till May 14 after hearing the arguments of the counsel for the complainant, the factory and the environmental protection agency./The tribunal also took notice of the absence of the chief executive officer of the factory and ordered his counsel to ensure the presence of his client on the next hearing./The factory is located in Manghopir area and manufacturing pipes and sheets by using a group of chemicals related to asbestos, which has been internationally condemned for their hazardous properties and for causing thousands of deaths from lung cancer and other fatal diseases across the world./Haroon Ahmed, a resident of Gulistan-i-Jauhar, filed a complaint against the factory, as his brother died allegedly due to poor conditions at his workplace./On Friday, counsel Jawad Hassan appeared on behalf of the alleged polluting factory and filed comments on the maintainability of the complaint and requested the tribunal that the latest written statement may be read as an integral part of the reply already filed on behalf of the factory./While requesting for the dismissal of the complaint, the counsel for the factory maintained that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint as under Section 17(2) of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (Pepa), 1997, only an environmental magistrate can hear the cases of hazardous substances under Section 24 of Pepa./The tribunal can only hear case under Sections 11, 12, 13 and 16 specified in Section 17(1) and the environmental magistrate can hear cases under Section 14 and 15 specified under Section 17(2), he added./He, however, said that Section 14 of Pepa dealt with the manufacturing of asbestos, which was hazardous, but the rules under that Section had not been notified yet. The federal environmental protection agency (EPA) has prescribed 425 substances under its Draft Hazardous Substance Rules, 1999 and asbestos is one of such substance, he said./The counsel said that despite the directives of the high court, the agency and the environment ministry had not yet prepared or notified the Hazardous Waste Rules, 1999 and asbestos can not be regulated by the EPA at the moment./He also stated that the complaint suffered from an excessive delay and is liable to be dismissed on the ground of latches because the death of the complainant's brother occurred on May 22, 2007, and the complaint was filed in January 2010./He submitted that the tribunal can only exercise its jurisdiction on the complaint of an aggrieved person when such person has given a notice of not less than 30 days to the federal or provincial environmental agency of his intention to make a complaint to the tribunal, while the instant complaint was made without giving any notice to the factory or the environmental agency./He further said that the complainant was not an aggrieved party, as he was not living or working in the area./He said that the instant complaint has been filed with mala fide intentions to gain financial benefits and to obstruct the business of the respondent./On the queries of the tribunal, the counsel for the factory said that there was no finding of surveys of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (the respondent No 2), which stated that effluents of the factory were violating the provisions of the Act. On the instruction of the EPA, the factory is also in the process of acquiring ISO-14001 certification as well, he added./The factory was using chrysotile fibre, which, according to him, is low biopersistent, silky in texture, with curly fibres and unlikely to remain suspended in the air, as one of the ingredients in manufacturing pipes and roofing materials./The fibre is being imported by the country for manufacturing purposes after acquiring permission under the Import and Export Act, 1950, with the consent given in the 1990s of the health and the environment divisions of the federal government./The factory has been dumping its industrial solid waste in a field five kilometres away from the factory. The factory in question is not manufacturing any asbestos and the process observed by it prevented even chrysotile fibre from becoming airborne, he added./While maintaining that the factory had a fully-fledged environmental management system, the counsel, however, failed to confirm whether the factory was also registered with the SMART programme of the federal environmental ministry./At one stage the tribunal chief also asked the counsel why the factory did not feel the need to acquire further or fresh clearances from the government agencies and continued relying on the CBR's permission for imports only, particularly when the world had changed a lot since 1998./In his argument, the deputy district public prosecutor, Abdul Maroof, said that the tribunal was competent enough to attend to the complaint./The prosecutor said that the environmental tribunal had two kinds of jurisdiction, i.e. original jurisdiction under Section 21(3) (a) and (b) and appellate jurisdiction under Section 22 of Pepa, 1997./The contents of Section 11, which prohibits certain discharges or emissions, is very much attracted and enable the tribunal to try the factory, which is reportedly discharging hazardous substances causing air pollution.

Pakistan: Environment dept oblivious to rising pollution,"RAWALPINDI, May 10 -- Noise and air pollution is on the rise in the congested Rawalpindi city posing serious health hazards to the people, as the local environment authorities are virtually oblivious to the issue and even lack basic data./The environment office, which is supposed to check air and noise pollution by penalizing smoke-emitting vehicles, measure the sounds of vehicles, aircraft, rail engines and other environmental hazards, has no data or equipment except for a spacious bungalow hired in the posh Westridge area./The staff of the environment office consists of a district officer, two field inspectors and three assistants for which the private house has been hired for Rs40,000./The monthly expenses of the office comes around Rs70,000./The Peshawar Road situated at a distance of a few meters from the office is bedeviled by the nuisance of noise and air pollution due to all types of vehicles using pressure horns and emitting smoke. However, the environment officials are totally unaware of the level of pollution on the busy road./District Office Environment Shaukat Hayat told this reporter that his job was to run the 'affairs' of his office, adding he had no data regarding measurement of noise and air pollution in the district./When asked how much penalties his office had imposed on smoke-emitting vehicles, the official again failed to share any data with this scribe and said he would direct the laboratory men to compile information in this regard./It is worth mentioning that former secretary Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Tariq Mehmood had banned entry of rickshaws into Benazir Bhutto Road to avoid noise and air pollution. However, at present the smoke emitting rickshaws are plying freely on the busy road./Moreover, the environment office has not launched any crackdown against stone crushing machines in Taxila which have created nuisance for the nearby residents./Similarly, the environment officials have issued no-objection certificates (NOCs) to a number of CNG stations in residential areas despite the fact that these filling stations pose serious health hazards to residents./It is also sad that not a single vehicle in the city has been penalised by the environment office for creating pollution. Besides, no campaign has ever been launched to check noise and air pollution. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Encroachers rule the roost on Pindi roads,"RAWALPINDI, May 10 -- The cantonment board has turned a blind eye to encroachments on roadsides and footpaths creating hurdles to the smooth flow of traffic and causing inconvenience to pedestrians./Besides shopkeepers and vendors, auto workshops have expanded their activities to parking zones, footpaths and roadsides. Such workshops abound in areas around Babu Mohallah, Chota Bazaar, Hathi Chowk, Railway Road, Cantonment Police Station Road, Kamran Market, Kashmir Road, Gawalmandi Road, etc./Most of them deal in car decoration and tyres. They hog parking zones forcing motorists to park illegally and pay fines besides creating traffic mess on roads forcing pedestrians to walk in the middle of the roads. Although Rawalpindi Cantonment Board launches anti-encroachment drives every now and then and claims of clearing the area of all illegal structures, these drives are more against stalls and pushcarts than any major encroachment./Complaints of the residents of the streets adjacent to these commercial areas also go unnoticed by the authorities concerned. They say they find it difficult to pass through the streets because of the rush of customers and vehicles./They complain that due to businesses like workshops electricity in these areas plays hide and seek, as because of the heavy load transformers trip several times a day./Locals say that the noise and air pollution by the vehicles disturbs them and they could not find space to park their vehicles near to their residence./""Traffic jams have become a regular feature and one finds it difficult to cover 50 yards between Bank Road and Ahatta Mitho Khan even in 15 minutes,"" Sheikh Fazal, a resident of the area, said./Another resident of the area, Zeeshan Naveed, said the smoke-emitting vehicles were a serious health hazard to the locals. He said besides loadshedding they suffer power outages due to tripping of transformers which had made their lives miserable./Irfan Malik, a resident of Babu Mohallah, said: ""In the evening, we had to park our vehicles on Kashmir Road and pass the area between Kamran Market and Babu Mohallah on foot due to traffic jam."" Akram Minhas, a resident of Gawalmandi, said the workshops had also been set up on Gawalmandi Road in front of F.G. Girls High School, Daryabad, creating problems for the students./Abdur Raheem, a shopkeeper on Kashmir Road, said: ""We have not encroached upon the footpaths rather they are temporary car decorators who have put up their stalls there.""/When contacted, RCB Cantonment Executive Officer Adil Rafi Siddiqui said the RCB was striving hard to provide better facilities to the residents in its jurisdiction. He claimed that there was no permanent encroachment in the cantonment and only a few vendors had their stalls on the edges of roads./When his attention was drawn to the encroachment in and around Chota Bazaar, Mr Siddiqui said the RCB launched anti-encroachment drive in the area and removed some encroachment around the church but some groups gathered and staged protest against the civic agencies./However, he said, the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board was committed to removing all types of encroachments in its jurisdiction without fear and favour.

Pakistan: Body formed to assess factory's impact on environment,"KARACHI, May 16 -- The Sindh environmental protection tribunal on Friday ordered the constitution of a three-member commission to ascertain the factual position regarding the working of a building product manufacturing and marketing enterprise located in Manghopir with special reference to its effects on the environment and human health./The tribunal headed by its chairperson Ashraf Jahan with members Dr Samiuzzaman (technical) and Abdul Karim Memon (legal) observed that the issue regarding the use of chrysotile asbestos was highly sensitive and critical and it was deemed appropriate that a commission of experts should look into its technical aspects and submit its comments to the tribunal.The commission comprising two respected chemists and an expert in medicine will evaluate the manufacturing procedure employed by the factory for producing asbestos building products and prepare a report on the impact of the factory on human health and the environment for the tribunal before the next date of hearing in the case./Syed Haroon Ahmed, a resident of Gulistan-i-Jauhar, had filed a complaint against the factory, because, according to him, his brother who worked at the factory had died due to poor working conditions at his workplace./He alleged that the factory used chemicals related to asbestos which had been internationally condemned for their hazardous properties and for causing thousands of deaths from lung cancer and other fatal diseases across the world./On May 7, a lawyer, Jawad Hassan, who appeared on behalf of the alleged polluting factory, made some verbal comments on the maintainability of the complaint, with the request to the tribunal that a written statement submitted by him the same day might be read as an integral part of the reply filed on behalf of the factory in earlier proceedings. The tribunal had reserved its order on the maintainability of the complaint against the factory./The tribunal on Friday said that since no separate application for the dismissal of the complaint had been filed, the decisions in respect of the legal and factual objections raised lately by the counsel for the factory would be taken along with the main case on the conclusion of the proceeding./The counsel for the factory was not present, while the chief executive of the factory, Sikandar Ali Dada, along with his counsel, complainant Haroon Ahmad, director laboratory of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) S.M. Yahya, and deputy district public prosecutor Abdul Maroof were present before the tribunal. Jam Asif Mehmood appearing on behalf of the CEO submitted an application for exemption of Mr Dada from attending the proceedings of the case./He said that his client was a law-abiding citizen and had to travel frequently inside and outside the country for his business requirements and as such the tribunal might allow that during proceedings of the case he might be represented through his lawyer./Mr Mehmood in his application filed under Section 540(A) (provision for inquiries and trial being held in the absence of accused in certain cases) read with Sections 205 (magistrate may dispense with personal attendance of accused) and 353 (evidence to be taken in presence of accused) of the criminal procedure code said that the trial was at an initial stage and there was no harm or prejudice to the complainant if the applicant (the CEO) was exempted from being present in court./""Since the enquiry report of Sepa has also absolved the CEO from violation of any law it is further averred that if the tribunal granted the exemption, Mr Dada will make sure his personal attendance in court, in case court required his personal attendance later on, in the proceedings,"" he added./The chairperson adjourned the tribunal to June 15 for arguments./Ice factory case/In the meantime, resuming proceedings in a case pertaining to the alleged spread of pollution by an ice factory in Lyari area, the tribunal on Friday ordered the deputy district officer (revenue) and a Mukhtiarkar of the Saddar town to appear in person before the tribunal along with relevant records of the Saddar town on May 20, the next date of hearing./The chairperson said that the revenue officials of the town where the ice factory was operating despite orders had been failing to submit any meaningful report on the status of the plot where the factory was established. The latest report received from the DDO (revenue) Saddar town office was vague and unsatisfactory, she remarked./A complaint against the operation of the ice factory was lodged by a resident of Lyari, Sarfraz Khan, under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997, requesting the tribunal that the factory be shifted to some industrial area because it was causing noise and air pollution in the residential area where it was located and discharging effluent carelessly, while there was also fears of ammonia leakages in the area due the factory operations./The tribunal had brought charges against the factory on Feb 13, which was denied by the factory owner, Amanullah./In some later proceedings the tribunal had asked the deputy district officer Lyari town to verify whether the ice factory was situated in an industrial or a residential area.However, the DDO reported to the tribunal that the factory was located on Taj Mohammad Khan Road, off Jamila Street, which did not fall within his jurisdiction.

Pakistan: Indoor air kills 2.2m young Chinese yearly,"BEIJING, May 18 -- More than two million Chinese youths die each year from health problems related to indoor air pollution, with nearly half of them under five years of age, state media cited a government study as saying./The study released by the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said indoor pollution levels can often be 5-10 times higher than those measured in the nation's notoriously bad outdoor air, the China News Service said./This indoor pollution causes respiratory and other conditions that kill 2.2 million youths each year, one million of whom are under the age of five, the report said, citing the study released yesterday./A French news agency was not immediately able to obtain a copy of the study./The study said dangerous indoor pollutants include formaldehyde, benzene, ammonia and radon./It said formaldehyde posed the biggest threat. It is often found in building materials and new furniture in China and can be slowly released into indoor environments over the course of several years./It said long-term exposure to such substances can cause a range of health problems including respiratory diseases, mental impairment and cancer, with young children, foetuses in utero and the elderly at most risk./China's massive economic expansion of the past three decades has made it one of the world's most polluted countries as environmental and health concerns are trampled amid an overriding focus on industrial growth./Countless cities are smothered in smog while hundreds of millions of citizens lack access to clean drinking water./A 2007 World Bank report said 750,000 Chinese die prematurely each year due to air and water pollution -- a figure edited out of final versions of the report, reportedly after China warned it could cause social unrest.

Michigan: DNRE Seeks Comment on Trash Burning Amendments,"LANSING, May 21 -- The State Of Michigan has issued following press release:/The Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) is asking the public to weigh in on proposed amendments to update the open burning provisions of the air pollution and solid waste management rules that would eliminate the current exemption that allows for the burning of household trash, including plastics, rubber, paper, shingles, treated wood, and other household waste./If adopted, the change would mean that the state would no longer consider the open burning of residential trash an approved method of disposal under state regulations after April 1, 2011. The changes would not effect the provisions that allow for the burning of leaves, brush, and other yard clippings, nor would they prohibit recreational campfires./""Open burning of trash emits contaminants that can have both long- and short-term health effects, especially for those individuals with cardiovascular and respiratory conditions such as asthma,"" said Vince Hellwig, Chief of the DNRE's Air Quality Division. ""Over the last decade, numerous human studies have demonstrated that the fine particulate matter created from burning is far more hazardous to people's health than previously known./"" Hellwig added that the smoke and odors generated from this activity do not remain on the property on which they are generated, and, as a result, household trash burning is the source of numerous citizen complaints reported to the DNRE and local authorities. Additionally, the open burning of trash and debris causes a third of all wildfires and is a significant cause of property fires throughout the state./A number of communities throughout Michigan already prohibit the burning of household trash; however, with the exemption at the state level that allows for the activity, residents are often unclear as to whether it is an acceptable practice and local governments have difficulty enforcing any local restrictions they may have. The DNRE hopes that by eliminating the exemption in the state rules, local communities will be better able to enforce existing ordinances or use the state rule as a means to address trash burning complaints when an ordinance does not exist./Michigan's open burning rules were established several decades ago, when many residents did not have access to waste disposal services and trash burning was their only practical disposal option. All Michigan residents have since gained access to waste disposal pick-up or drop-off services; and many residents now have access to recycling options as well, no longer making trash burning the only practical disposal option. The DNRE is working with County Solid Waste Management personnel as well as solid waste haulers and landfills to help inform residents of the alternatives to trash burning that are available to them./The DNRE does not intend to actively enforce this rule but rather implement the changes through education and outreach in coordination with local units of government. It is expected that any enforcement will primarily be conducted at the discretion of local authorities in response to complaints./For more information please contact /<a href=""mailto:plusnewspk@gmail.co"">plusnewspk@gmail.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Environmental degradation: Warrants for arrest of mill owners issued,"PESHAWAR, June 13 -- An environmental tribunal has issued arrest warrants of owners of two mills in different cases related to environmental degradation./In one of the cases arrest warrants were issued for the owner of Old Salar Textile Mills, Haripur, for not obtaining approval from the provincial Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for construction of a new unit of the mill./In the other case arrest warrants were issued for the chief executive of Mustehkam Steel Mills, Hattar, Haripur, as he had failed to turn up before the tribunal in a case about installation of smoke control system at the mills./The orders were issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Tribunal during a camp court in Abbottabad. The tribunal comprised of its chairperson, Musarrat Hilali, member (legal) Muhammad Farooq Khan and member (technical) Abdul Karim Qasuria. The tribunal adjourned the hearing of both the case till June 24./In the case of Salar textile Mills the EPA had constituted a special team consisting of a senior chemist, Naseerullah Khan, and two analysts, Faridullah Shah and Wajid Ali, to visit the site and submit a report to the EPA. The team visited the said mill on Dec 8, 2009 and reported that it was an old textile mill but now the new owner had installed another unit which was ready to start production./The EPA alleged that the respondents including the mill's owner had not applied for obtaining approval from the agency for the construction of the new unit which was mandatory under section 12 of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (Pepa), 1997./In the case of Mustehkam Steel Mills, Hattar, the complaint was filed by a senior analyst of EPA, Muhammad Irshad. A team of the agency after visiting the site observed that it was a re-rolling mill having kilns as well./""The mill was emitting hazardous gases and black smoke which had made the atmosphere cloudy, foggy and dusty,"" the team reported, adding that no one was able to inhale fresh air as there was no air pollution control system in it./On the basis of that report the director general of EPA issued a notice of hearing to the respondents to appear in person or through authorised representative on Oct 5, 2009./Subsequently, the EPA authorities also issued an Environmental Protection Order (EPO) on Oct 7 directing the respondent to install smoke control system within one month of the issuance of order. However, during a visit to the site on Jan 1, an EPA team found that the mill was operational with no smoke control system installed, which was violation of Section 16 of Pepa Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Construction of industrial estate in doldrums,"ISLAMABAD, June 28 -- Both the Ministry of Environment and Capital Development Authority (CDA) have failed to work on a proposed industrial estate, as in past both the authorities committed to shift 1-9 Industrial site either in Tehsil Kahuta or in the area near Fateh Jang but failed to do so./The high-ups of both the authorities were regularly giving statements that a proposed industrial estate for 1-9 Industrial site would be announced soon but the matter was only limited to the statements. Nothing was happening on ground level./An industrial estate would not only have lessened the burden on the existing industrial area but would also have served as an alternative site to shift polluting industries away from the thickly populated sectors I-9 and I-10./It learnt that presently almost five hundred factories are currently operating in the I-9 and I-10 industrial estates which are causing water and air pollution in the area. Out of the existing 500 plants, there are 204 manufacturing units in the area./Industries which contribute to pollution are steel furnaces, ghee/oil mills, GI pipes, soap, chemical, plastic, marble, spices and printing, which have either no or inadequate facilities for treatment of their waste emissions./Complaints of diseases like chest congestion and asthma, which are directly linked to air pollution, are frequent among I-9 and I-10 residents. The quality of air in these areas was never tested due to the non-availability of adequate facilities. Experts say that commissioning 500 more industrial plants in the area would increase pollution levels considerably./According to EPA sources, about 1,500 tonnes of effluents generated by the pharmaceutical industry, flour mills, oil and ghee mills, marble factories and plastic extrusion mills every day are being thrown into the Nullah Lai. Consequently, underground water reservoirs have been polluted to alarming proportions./Under the decision, CDA had number of times given deadline to owners of steel furnaces included in the CDA's negative list to control increasing pollution in the Federal Capital Industrial Estate. However, sources said that this was not pursued properly and the matter had been thrown into cold storage./There are only six steel furnaces out of a total of 400 in the federal capital's two industrial zones that have not followed the EPA-approved standards in controlling the emission of dangerous particles./The CDA has the authority to fine violators but it cannot force them to cease their business as the civic body had itself earlier allowed them to set up furnaces to meet the demands of capital Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Lahore air pollution worsens,"LAHORE, July 1 -- In June, the air quality of the provincial metropolis fell under severe category, posing a serious threat to the health of citizens./The major air pollutants present in the air of Lahore are: oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and respirable dust (PM2.5). Their level in the city was higher than the National Air Quality Index (AQI). According to the AQI, pollution level from 0 to 25 is considered clean, 26 to 50 moderate, 51to 100 unhealthy, 101 to 200 severe and 201to 300 hazardous./Data collected by the Environment Protection Department (EPD) during the June clearly reflected the severity of air pollution./On June 27, the AQI was 46 (moderate category) while, on June 25, the AQI in Gulberg area was 59(category of unhealthy). On June 23, AQI was 113 (severe category), which means that pollution levels remained higher than standard level./On June 21, the AQI was 128 (severe category). On June 18, the AQI was 136 (severe category). On June 9 and 15, the AQI was 90 and 105 respectively and they fall under unhealthy, severe category. On June 4, the AQI was 107(severe category). On June 01, the AQI was 136, which means that pollution levels remained 36 per cent more than the national standards and health wise falls in severe category./The recent Economic Survey of Pakistan states, ""Pakistani cities are facing problems of urban congestion, deteriorating air and water quality and waste management while the rural areas are witnessing rapid deforestation, biodiversity and habitat loss, crop failure, desertification and land degradation.""/Environmental experts say that common gases emitted by vehicles include carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and ozone - all dangerous to human health beyond certain levels of concentration. They say 2.5 is the standard of particulate matter (PM) in the air but, in the federal capital, the PM level was recorded as high as 166, which falls in the category of unhealthy. Same is the case of Lahore where the PM level was also recorded as high as 160 through a mobile station at hockey stadium. According to the World Wide Fund (WWF) fact sheet, major air pollutants include: suspended particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, sulphur dioxide, lead & other heavy metals, ground level ozone and fuel wood. The sources of air pollution are motor vehicles, industry, municipal solid waste, smog and medical waste. It adds poly-aromatic hydrocarbons released by diesel-powered vehicles are known carcinogens, while smoke from diesel engines has aggravated already elevated levels of airborne soot. Nitrous oxides are emerging air pollutants with the highest concentrations recorded in Karachi, followed by Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar, and Islamabad. Industries located in urban areas are the main source of sulfur dioxide (dangerous to human, animal, and plant life) while brick kilns powered by low-grade coal are notable sources of soot./Environmental experts say that though many cities are adversely affected, air quality monitoring is restricted to six major cities i.e. Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta and Rawalpindi. They link the environmental degradation to poverty because of the overwhelming dependence of the poor on natural resources for their livelihoods - whether agriculture, forestry, fisheries, hunting, etc. Poverty combined with a burgeoning population and rapid urbanization is leading to intense pressures on the environment, experts maintained./Environmentalists say that PM 2.5 is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets and made up of a number of components, including acids (such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. The size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Once inhaled, these particles can affect heart and lungs./Following the seriousness of the issue, the Punjab Environmental Protection Department (EPD) wrote various letters to different authorities, including Traffic Engineering and Planning Agency (TEPA), City District Government Lahore (CDGL), Punjab Transport Department, Planning and Development Wing Punjab, etc, to take different measures to control the rising air pollution in the city./In its letter to the TEPA manager director, the EPD officials said, After the analyses of air quality and its reasons in different parts of Lahore, the following control measures were suggested at your end: To construct over head bridges, under passes at congested crossings. To construct proper parking areas along the roads, broadening of roads and proper stops for urban transport and Improvement in traffic engineering for smooth, uninterrupted vehicular movement may be made. Underpasses and flyovers at most busy crossings may be constructed to reduce the emission load in ambient air of Lahore./In the letter written to the Lahore District Coordination Officer, the EPD said the CDGL should start paving of the shoulders and plantation along the roads to ensure control in dust emission. It said burning of solid waste should be banned completely across the city and effective campaigns be carried out to stop sale and manufacturing of adulterated fuel. The EPD also asked the DCO to launch effective and challenging campaigns against excessive vehicular emissions./The department also demanded the federal government encourage use of renewable energy sources at government level through promotion of solar energy, wind energy, water energy, etc, instead of conventional fuels. The federal government was also requested to sensitize public about health impacts of various air pollutants and their remedial measures, through various educational tools./The department in its letter to the Punjab Transport secretary said that two stroke rickshaws and old vehicles must be replaced with four stroke rickshaws and new vehicles respectively. They said the vehicle examination system should be improved and set up on scientific basis so that every vehicle must pass emission standard criteria before coming on the road./The department added that the traffic police should start a proper challan system in cooperation with the Punjab Environment Protection Department. It suggested that motor repair workshops having facilities of emission testing may be set up in city in large numbers./Experts believe that if the government adopts the measures, a remarkable decrease may be witness in the air pollution levels in future Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

DES Declares Air Quality Action Day,"New Hampshire, July 04 -- The New Hampshire state has issued following press release:/The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES) is expecting air pollution concentrations to reach unhealthy levels for sensitive individuals in Cheshire, Hillsborough, and Rockingham Counties on Tuesday, July 6. DES officials are calling for an Air Quality Action Day and advise sensitive individuals in these areas to take precautions to protect their health by limiting prolonged or heavy exertion. Sensitive individuals include children and older adults, anyone with heart or lung disease such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis, and people who are active outdoors. Even healthy individuals may experience mild health effects and should consider limiting strenuous or prolonged activities./DES forecasts unhealthy concentrations of ground-level ozone (the main component of smog) for sensitive individuals in the above-mentioned regions. In addition, concentrations of fine particle pollution are forecasted to approach unhealthy levels for sensitive individuals throughout the state. The combination of the two pollutants may intensify health effects./Unhealthy air quality is anticipated due to the persistence of high temperatures under sunny skies and light winds transporting pollution into New Hampshire from surrounding areas. Additional advisories will be made if unhealthy air quality is expected to continue later into the week./Symptoms of ozone exposure include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness or pain when inhaling deeply, and shortness of breath. Symptoms of particle pollution exposure for people with heart disease may include chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. People with existing lung diseases may not be able to breathe as deeply or vigorously as normal and may experience symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath. The severity of the health effects increases as ozone and fine particle concentrations increase. In addition to harmful health effects, fine particle pollution may create hazy conditions that reduce visibility./For more information please contact: /<a href=""mailto:info@plusmediasolutions.co"">info@plusmediasolutions.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Islamabad air pollution touches dangerous level,"ISLAMABAD, July 05 -- It seems the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) is helpless against I-9 industries which are producing pollutants of dangerous proportion./A senior official of Pak-EPA while talking to Right Vision News put the blame on steel mills for the rising air pollution as according to him their furnaces generated volumes of smoke./According to the official, there were 12 steel mills running their business in the I-9 Sector while six steel mills were already in court./The Pak-EPA official insisted: ""We have provided the steel mills and other factories in the industrial areas devices to monitor emission of gases and maintain their statistics,"" he said. But they did not use the devices accurately as suggested which can be gauged from the fact that the dust particles and smoke in the area are visible from a naked eye, he said./An employee of a multinational company, Imtiaz Azhar, working in I-9 Industrial Zone told this scribe: ""It's very difficult to breathe in the open as the steel mills emit a lot of smoke even during the day time.""/Imtiaz suggested that ""environment officials should impose fine on the factories for polluting the air.""/However, the environment official said that during surprise visits to the steel mills, their gauges recorded emission of dangerous gasses from the furnaces negative./Another major source, he said, of air pollution in the city other than steel mills was ongoing construction activity in the city./""We have recorded a high particulate matter at 10, which lessens the visibility and if they are small enough it can be inhaled and affect lungs,"" he warned./The air of the city, he said, was 70 to 90 per cent polluted and the normal level of air pollution is less than 35 per cent./The Capital Development Authority was running several mega development projects besides expanding and carpeting several arteries of the city./""The dust particles in the air are at abnormal level and we have to work on emergency basis to reduce the rising air pollution,"" he asserted Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Lung diseases due to gas or chemical exposure,"LAHORE, July 06 -- Lung diseases due to gas or chemical exposure are conditions that can be acquired from indoor and outdoor air pollution and from ingesting tobacco smoke./Description/The lungs are susceptible to many airborne poisons and irritants. Mucus present in the airways blocks foreign particles of a certain size, however it is unable to filter all airborne particulates. There are hundreds of substances that can pollute air and harm lungs. Harmful gases and chemicals are just one type of airborne pollutant that can adversely affect the lungs. They include:/* Vehicle exhaust/* Localized pollutants such as arsenic, asbestos, lead, and mercury/* Outdoor pollutants caused by industry and intensified by weather conditions/* Household heating, such as wood-burning stoves/* Household chemical products/* Tobacco smoke./Lungs respond to irritants in four ways, each of which can occur separately or, more often, trigger other responses./* Asthma occurs when irritation causes the smooth muscles surrounding the airways to constrict./* Increased mucus comes from irritated mucus glands lining the airway. Excess mucus clogs the airway and prevents air from circulating./* Constriction of the lungs results from scarring when the supporting tissues are damaged./* Cancer is caused by certain irritants, such as asbestos and tobacco smoke./The major categories that airborne irritants fall into are allergic, organic, inorganic, and poisonous, with many agents occupying more than one category./* Allergic irritants bother only people who are sensitive to them. Cat hair, insect parts, and pollen are common allergens. Chemicals called sulfites, which are widely used as food preservatives, also cause asthma./* There are many organic dusts that irritate the lungs. Most of them occur on the job and cause occupational lung disease. Grain dust causes silo filler's disease. Cotton and other textile dusts cause byssinosis. Mold spores in hay cause farmer's lun Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) and Okanogan County Solid Waste will collect and destroy the barrels. They want to reduce the risk of wildfires in the county, along with the harmful smoke that wildfires produce./Outdoor residential burning, which is illegal in most parts of Washington, is a leading cause of wildfire ignitions across the state. Wildfires destroy property, harm the environment and endanger people./They also produce smoke that can harm people. Breathing fine particles in smoke can cause health problems like asthma, emphysema and lung cancer./Here are event details:/* On Saturday, July 17, north Okanogan County residents can take their empty burn barrels to the Ellisforde Transfer Station between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. while compost bin supplies last.

Sen. Boots: Hoosiers Encouraged to Voice Opinions on New Rules for Outdoor Wood Boilers at July 13 Forum,"STATE HOUSE, July 08 -- The State Of Indiana has issued following Press Release:/State Sen. Phil Boots today encouraged Hoosiers with opinions on newly proposed regulations for outdoor wood-burning furnaces to attend a public hearing next week./Boots (R-Crawfordsville) said the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board - a voting body of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management - will host a 1 p.m. hearing Tuesday, July 13, at Indiana Government Center South, Conference Room C, 402 W Washington St., Indianapolis./""This meeting will give Hoosiers an opportunity to voice their opinions directly to the board,"" Boots said. ""Those who may be affected by these new requirements are encouraged to attend and express their thoughts before the board makes its final decision.""/Among the new regulations to be considered by the 12-member environmental board include chimney height requirements for the outdoor wood burning furnaces. The proposed rule would require smoke stacks to be 5 feet higher than any neighboring building that is within 150 feet./Board members will also discuss the use of the outdoor heaters during the summer months. Under the proposed rule, the heater could not be used from June through August, if it is within 300 feet of another building./Newly manufactured units would be required to follow new EPA guidelines as well, if the board approves the new rules.

"Air pollution health risk high for people with heart, lung disease","OLYMPIA, July 10 -- The State Of Washington has issued following Press Release:/Nearly everyone likes to spend time outdoors on warm sunny days, but poor air quality can harm people with heart and lung disease. Now, stronger evidence indicates just how dangerous air pollution can be, especially for people in high-risk groups./In May, the American Heart Association concluded that fine-particle air pollution is linked to cardiovascular disease (heart attack, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and stroke). It can cause illness and death from these diseases in susceptible people. Even brief exposure, as little as a few hours, can trigger problems. Risks also rise with long-term exposure./A recent Department of Ecology analysis estimates that fine particles contribute to about 1,100 deaths and millions of dollars in health-care costs each year in Washington./Air pollution can be a problem for everybody, but it's especially harmful to people with heart and lung disease. Older adults are also susceptible because they often have these diseases but don't recognize it. New research suggests that breathing fine particle air pollution can also be risky for people who are obese or have diabetes. Children are also vulnerable to polluted air because their lungs are still growing and they spend more time outdoors./Different things cause summer air pollution. Several consecutive days of hot, sunny weather will increase ozone. Wildfires like the ones that have broken out in central Washington in recent days produce smoky air that contains fine particles and toxic chemicals. Cars and trucks generate exhaust. On calm days when the air is still, air pollutants build up./This year, El Nino weather patterns meant a relatively dry winter in some parts of the state. Ongoing climate changes are projected to cause additional bad air quality by increasing wildfires and ozone pollution./People, especially those in high-risk groups, can lower their exposure to air pollution by checking air quality conditions before taking part in outdoor activities. When air pollution is high, people should limit outdoor activity and choose less strenuous things to do - such as going for a walk instead of a run. People who must work out should reduce the amount of time they spend exercising heavily. Pollution levels are often highest at midday or in the afternoon, so exercising earlier or later may be wise. Indoor exercise is another option. Where vehicle exhaust may be higher, it helps to spend less time in traffic and to avoid exercising near traffic./Information about air quality conditions can be found on the state Department of Ecology website or online from one of seven local clean air agencies. Regular e-mail updates on air quality are available by subscribing to the American Lung Association of Washington ""Breathe Easy Network."" Color-coded information on these sites puts air quality in different zones going from good (green) to hazardous (maroon). Plan outdoor activities when air quality is in the ""good"" or green zone./For more information please contact /<a href=""mailto:plusnewspk@gmail.co"">plusnewspk@gmail.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Warm temperatures could cause ozone build-up,"OLYMPIA, July 10 -- The State Of Washington has issued following Press Release:/Hot weather this week in Washington could cause a build-up of ozone in some locations./Weather forecasts call for high temperatures in the 80s and 90s throughout the state for the next several days before cooling begins during the weekend. Hot weather combined with little air movement could produce high levels of ozone, especially on Friday in some Western Washington locations./Unhealthy ozone levels can affect people with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active. Breathing ozone can:/* Trigger airway irritation, coughing and pain when taking a deep breath./* Cause wheezing and breathing difficulties during exercise or outdoor activities./* Inflame lung tissue./* Aggravate asthma./* Increase susceptibility to respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and bronchitis./* Permanently scar lung tissue after repeated exposures./""You can do a number of things to reduce the air pollution that forms smog in your community,"" said Clint Bowman, a meteorologist for the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology)./Here are some of the actions you can take:/* Drive less. Combine errands or use public transportation./* Postpone travel until cooler evening hours, if possible./* Don't use lawnmowers or other small engines that emit air pollutants./* Observe bans on outdoor burning because of high fire danger and health protection./* Don't idle your engine. Turn it off while your vehicle is parked or waiting in line./* Wait for cooler morning or evening hours to refuel your vehicle./* Don't paint or use aerosol sprays until temperatures cool off./There are two kinds of ozone. ""Good"" ozone forms naturally about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface. It helps protect life on Earth from the sun's harmful rays. But ozone at ground level is considered ""bad."" It is the main ingredient of smog, and can cause health problems./Ground-level ozone is a gas created by a chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. Vehicle and industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, and natural sources emit NOx and VOCs that help form ground-level ozone. Many urban areas tend to have high levels of ozone. But high ozone levels can also be found in rural areas, because wind carries ozone and ozone-forming pollutants hundreds of miles away from their sources./For more information please contact /<a href=""mailto:plusnewspk@gmail.co"">plusnewspk@gmail.co</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Grant County residents can trade burn barrels for compost bins,"OLYMPIA, July 13 -- The State Of Washington has issued following Press Release:/Grant County residents can swap their empty burn barrels for free compost bins as part of an effort to limit wildfires and air pollution./The use of burn barrels is illegal in Washington. The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) and Grant County Solid Waste are working together on a project that will collect and destroy barrels in Grant County. They want to reduce the risk of wildfires in the county, along with the harmful smoke that wildfires produce./Outdoor residential burning, which is illegal in most parts of Washington, is a leading cause of wildfire ignitions across the state. Wildfires destroy property, harm the environment and endanger people./They also produce smoke that can harm people. Breathing fine particles in smoke can cause health problems like asthma, emphysema and lung cancer./The project will start on July 20 and continue while supplies of compost bins last. Grant County residents can exchange their empty burn barrels at these locations between 7:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. Tuesday through Friday:/* Ephrata Landfill, 4002 13th NW, Ephrata./* CDSI Transfer and Recycling Center, 9524 Road 7 NE, Moses Lake./For information, call 509-754-6082./The agencies are using a grant from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for the work./Ecology and DNR also are working to schedule events in other counties.

No check on polluting brick kilns,"ISLAMABAD, July 13 -- Brick kilns in Zone-IV and V which come under the administrative control of the local administration, pose a serious threat to the area's environment./However chances of this problem being addressed are slim as the two authorities responsible for this area and this issue - the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and ICT administration - are busy passing the buck to each other. It appears that they do not even know who is responsible for addressing this problem./According to a recently conducted survey report of EPA, 42 brick kilns are functioning in Zone-IV and V. Local inhabitants residing in housing schemes alongside the Islamabad Highway, opposite of Zone-V, claim they are the prime victims of these kilns. Take Korang Town for instance. It is one of the modern housing societies located in the rural area and Hasan Ali who lives there told Right Vision News that: ""There is a foul smell in the air due to the brick kilns located in the vicinity. Sometimes it is very difficult to breath in the open air.""Hasan added that he had complained to the EPA but ""so far no action had been taken against the dangerous smoke emitting brick kilns.""/Another major aggrieved party is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) - which claims that the smoke emitted by the brick kilns affects visibility that in turn makes it dangerous for the small planes in the air. ""Small planes can face difficulty taking a landing position; this is why there is a strict ban on brick kilns within the five-kilometre radius of the Benazir Bhutto International Airport,"" said an official of the CAA./However, no steps have been taken to either re-locate these kilns or to ensure that they adapt more environment-friendly processes. The major reason for this is the lack of cooperation and coordination between the ICT, which administers the area, and the EPA, the main environmental protection agency./ICT's Assistant Commissioner (rural area) Naila Baqir is a case in point. She claimed that the ICT had no role to play in controlling the increasing air pollution in Zone-IV and V. ""It is up to the EPA to control the emissions in the rural area; we too will approach the agency to ask it to take action against the pollutant brick kilns,"" she asserted. While she admitted that residents of local housing societies ""were facing difficulty"" due to the kilns, the ICT had not received any ""complaints about the brick kilns"". Naila Baqir's point was that the authority could only spring into action if the kilns were involved in creating disturbance in the area./Her words were echoed by the deputy commissioner, Amir Ali, who told Right Vision News that ""the ICT administration is always willing to help the EPA if it needs magisterial cover"". What this means is that in case the EPA needs to forcibly end the functioning of a brick kiln, the ICT can provide it the manpower./Ali did, however, try to dispel the impression that the state had taken no action whatsoever against the kilns./He told Right Vision News that in the past the environmental authority had kicked into action against six kilns. But a day before the EPA could pass an order against them, the kiln owners went to the court and got stay orders against the former./However, the rosy picture painted by the ICT officials is dispelled by the EPA./Director-General Asadullah Faiz claims that the issue was the joint responsibility of ICT and the Capital Development Authority (CDA); and he put the responsibility of the lack of action against them on the ICT./""The Environmental Act as well as the environmental protection order can be used to remove the brick kilns emitting dangerous smoke located in Zone-IV and V. However, it is not possible to do this without the help of ICT,"" he said./Yet, he did offer a small ray of hope by telling Right Vision News that an emission inventory survey of brick kilns was in progress, as this would help strengthen the case for strict action against the brick kilns./However, observers point out that action against the brick kilns is a complex matter and it cannot be reduced to an environmental matter to be handled by the EPA or the ICT for that matter./""It is an issue that has social and economic implications as the closure of the kilns will affect the livelihood of many households./According to the EPA director-general, ""Around 500 to 600 people are working at a single brick kiln."" This leads to a rough figure of about 2,000 employees in total. No wonder then that Faiz said that ""removing these kilns from the area is a tough business""./The brick kiln owners also point out that their closure would affect the livelihood of many households. In addition they argue that most of them were established long before the residential areas around them./A brick kiln owner in Zone-IV said: ""We were working out of the limits of the city but due to the rapid expansion, we have now been encroached upon.""/When asked about the pollution he caused, the owner said: ""Kilns were using better scrap on a bid to cause less environmental damage.
