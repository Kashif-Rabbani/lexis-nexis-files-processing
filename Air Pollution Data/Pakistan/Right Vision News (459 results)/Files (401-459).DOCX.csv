Pakistan: Pulmonologist sees COPD as imminent threat,"KARACHI, Dec. 29 -- The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is likely to cause more deaths than any other disease in the country as it has direct association with smoking and pollution, Assistant Professor and Head of Pulmonology Department, Multan Institute of Cardiology, Dr Anjum Naveed Jamal claimed this on Saturday while talking to media../Dr Jamal, who is on a private visit in the city, said, ""Respiratory diseases are most predominant with the prevalence of 26.5 percent. The estimated COPD mortality rate is 71 deaths per 100,000, which is the further highest rate among the 25 most populous nations in the world. The current estimated prevalence of asthma is close to 15 percent in the general population with an expected 5 percent annual increase.""/The COPD patient who could be managed through proper medication often gets ignored and is confused with other respiratory diseases, that is why Pakistani health professionals do not have an insight due to lack of data collection, he stressed./The pulmonologist said that pollution particles including smoke, dirt, mould or pollen and their fine size is the biggest risks to human health as they can easily be inhaled and stuck in the respiratory system./The country's social set up, standard of living, illiteracy, practice of self-medication and unawareness along with exposure to air pollution is a big risk factor for having COPD, he mentioned./""Although, smokers are more at risk but they can also harm other people as well by sitting in a gathering and creating pollution for non-smokers. Similarly, air pollution is another risk factor for non-smokers and it is as dangerous as smoking, he further said./According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), indoor air pollution resulting from the use of biomass fuels is responsible for nearly two million premature deaths each year worldwide, Dr Jamal quoted./""It will be of no surprise that any person with exposure of pollution had become a victim of lung disease or COPD. People should have themselves diagnosed if they are exposed to pollution.""/Dr Jamal added that indoor pollution in third world countries was playing havoc with the lives of the people as in such countries people are exposed to household air pollution owing to poverty level, rural to urban migration, use of non-biodegradable plastic bags that generate more pollution when burnt./The doctor mentioned that nonetheless, black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful climate-change pollutants, adding these factors take more lives as over one-third of premature deaths from COPD in adults are because of household air pollution./The pulmonologist said that in developing countries like Pakistan men are at greater risk than women and more frequently catch up the COPD due to smoking habit. ""It is of no surprise that people who smoke regularly and live in dense indoor pollution are at double risk of premature death caused by the COPD. The outdoor air pollution also contributes to nearly 1.3 million deaths each year in underdeveloped and developed countries.""/According to a foreign-funded study aimed at delivering quality asthma and COPD care through primary health care facilities in Pakistan, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are among the top ten causes of mortality and morbidity in Pakistan, Dr Jamal stated./""Patients have to take care of their routines and habits, as they have to avoid triggers like cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes and dust. Once diagnosed with COPD, daily medication is vital to fight with the disease along with short-acting rescue inhalers. The COPD is a chronic disease and has no cure. Only way to counter it is through healthy living and using prescribed therapies./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Polluting away: Mingora's rickshaws whiz past govt regulations,"INGORA, Jan. 6 -- A large majority of the 16,000 rickshaws plying the roads of Mingora do not have legal permits and are fitted with engines that violate the government's regulations, causing noise and air pollution in the valley./Insiders within Swat's public transport sector say there a number of irregularities in the system. Thousands of rickshaws have been brought from Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, Nowshera, Karak, DI Khan and Mardan and running without check in Swat./""There are many vehicles with the same number plate; I have seen at least 11 three-wheelers with the same registration number,"" said a driver, requesting anonymity. ""If a traffic policeman stops them, the rickshaw driver says the registration papers are at home. He later gets the documents from the actual licence holder and shows them to the police.""/Centre of activity/Being the financial hub of the valley, many people from across the region make their way to Mingora to drive rickshaws and earn a livelihood, while many locals own the three-wheelers and rent them out as a business./""People from several districts come to Mingora. It doesn't matter if you have a valid driving licence or not; as long you know how to drive, it is easy money,"" said Abdullah, a rickshaw driver./Moreover, some rickshaw drivers have installed four-stroke 600cc engines believing them to be more efficient. This is in direct violation of the legal regulations which require rickshaws to be fitted with four-stroke 200cc engines./Of laws and violations/The district administration is trying to crack down on this illegal practice and many unlicenced rickshaws were recently impounded. ""Following our crackdown, the union of rickshaw drivers submitted a case in court and we were ordered to release the vehicles,"" said Zerab Gul, a traffic police in-charge in Mingora./Gul added the drivers also often complain to the army or MPAs to get their impounded vehicles released./The district administration has directed rickshaw owners and drivers to replace two-stroke engines with four-stroke 200cc ones. According to a study of the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency, the two-stroke rickshaw emits twice as much carbon dioxide and 37 times more hydrocarbons than a four-stroke rickshaw./However, many drivers are yet to comply. In fact, they openly flout the directives and use 600cc engines instead, claiming 200cc engines are not efficient on mountainous roads of the valley./""The 200cc engine is not powerful enough for a rickshaw to be driven on roads to mountains,"" said Suleman, a rickshaw driver in Amankot. He explained that he had earlier fitted his vehicle with the government sanctioned engine but the machine broke down within six months, causing him a huge loss./Suleman went on to install a 600cc engine but the traffic police has asked him to remove it. ""The 660cc engine is much better because it is powerful, noiseless and discharges no smoke,"" he added./Rickshaw drivers in Mingora demanded the traffic department to allow them to install the 660cc engine instead of 200cc engine which is a better fit for motorbikes/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Indian coal-based power plants causing fog in Islamabad,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 15 -- The air pollution caused by Indian coal-based thermal power plants is one of the basic reasons of fog in the capital city that has started experiencing span of winter fog especially in last few days./Dr. Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, lead author of National Climate Change Policy, told this correspondent that one of major cross-border air pollutant sources is Indian coal-based thermal power plants, which consume thousands of tons of coal daily and emit tons of sulphur dioxide and black carbon./""Sulphur dioxide is converted into sulphate and change the nature of regional aerosol to acidic. Sulfate, as hygroscopic species, strengthens the fog formation process, which we are witnessing in the capital city,"" he said./He said another source of black carbon in the air is incomplete combustion of motor fuel as diesel trucks and buses having faulty/injection nozzles and weak engines emit excessive black carbon that creates smog in the air./Dr. Qamar Zaman said winter haze has a drastic impact on the health of the people, especially those with asthma. Other sectors affected are transport, trade and commerce due to prolonged low visibility, agriculture not only due to inhibition of winter monsoons but the availability of low solar insulation and inhibition of the pollination process because of heavy concentration of aerosol particles in the air/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: World Cancer Day to be observed on Feb 4,"ISLAMABAD, Feb. 3 -- Like other parts of the globe, World Cancer Day will also be observed in Pakistan on February 4 to create awareness in masses on disease prevention and treatment aspects. The theme of year 2015 which is ""Not beyond us"", offers World Health Organization (WHO) an opportunity to demonstrate the Organization's policies and programmes for countries to reduce their cancer burden. The Global action plan calls for national, international and multisectoral action across multiple areas to reduce cancer risks in populations, and to strengthen health care delivery systems for people with cancer. /Environmental and infectious causes are important for cancer prevention so that WHO's guidance in those areas is part of the comprehensive approach. Dr Wasim Khawaja from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said that cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body, adding, other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. He said that one defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs. He said that more than 30% of cancer could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors, including tobacco use, being overweight or obese, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, alcohol use, human papillomavirus and Hepatitis B infection, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels. He added cancer mortality can be reduced if cases are detected and treated early. The awareness of early signs and symptoms are essential such as cervical, breast and oral cancers in order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment before the disease becomes advanced. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide as it accounted for 7.6 million deaths which is around 13% of all deaths in 2008. Lung, stomach, liver, colon and breast cancer cause the most cancer deaths each year. In the WHO Western Pacific Region, it is estimated that close to 4.07 million new cases occurred in 2008 with 2.31 million in men and 1.75 million in women. The most frequent types of cancer differ between men and women. About 30% of cancer deaths are due to the five leading behavioral and dietary risks included high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol use. Similarly, infectious agents are responsible for almost 22% of cancer deaths in the developing world and 6% in industrialized countries. Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of cancer in the world causing 22% of cancer deaths. About 70% of the lung cancer burden can be attributed to smoking alone. Deaths from cancer worldwide are projected to continue to rise to over 11 million in 2030. Early diagnosis programmes are particularly relevant in low- resource settings where the majority of patients are diagnosed in very late stages. The systematic application of a screening test in an asymptomatic population aimed at identifying individuals with abnormalities suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer and refer them promptly for diagnosis and treatment. Screening programmes are especially effective for frequent cancer types that have a screening test that is cost-effective, affordable, acceptable and accessible to the majority of the population at risk/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: 110 units threaten public health,"LAHORE, Feb. 11 -- OVER 110 different industrial units comprising steel mills, furnaces, foundries and tar coal drum makers are emitting carbon powder and other air pollutants posing a serious threat to the lives of thousands of citizens of various city localities./A recent list compiled by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Punjab revealed that majority of these industrial units are not following the environmental rules and regulations besides ignoring the guidelines of the EPA in controlling air pollution./Sources said EPA Director General Farooq Hameed Sheikh has directed the District Officer (Environment) Lahore to immediately initiate legal action against the polluters. DG EPA also directed DOs of Gujranwala, Sialkot and Sheikhupura Districts to launch a campaign against smoke-emitting vehicles immediately./Sources said most of these units use substandard fuel like rubber, rubber dust, plastic, coal and low quality furnace oil besides taking any emission control arrangements resulting in visible smoke emissions leading to environmental pollution and threat to public health./Sources in City District Government Lahore (CDGL) revealed that whenever the Environment Department seals any of smoke emitting industrial units, it becomes operative just after getting a conditional de-sealing approval from the DCO Lahore by submitting an undertaking that he will not use substandard fuel and will follow the rules and regulations related to environment./Sources

Pakistan: Traffic pollution tied to slower cognition in schoolchildren,"ISLAMABAD, March 5 -- Children who attend school in heavy traffic/areas may show slower cognitive development and lower memory test scores,/Spanish researchers have found./About 21,000 premature deaths are attributed to air pollution in/Canada each year, according to the Canadian Medical Association./The detrimental effects of air pollution on cardiovascular health and on the lungs are well documented and now researchers are looking at its effects on the brain, CBC news reported./To that end, Dr. Jordi Sunyer and his colleagues from the Centre for/Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona measured three aspects of memory and attentiveness in more than 2,700 primary school children every three months over 12 months./""What was surprising for us is among our children, we see very robust,/consistent effects,"" Sunyer said./The associations between slower cognitive development and higher levels of air pollutants remained after the researchers took factors such as parents' education, commuting time, smoking in the home and green spaces at school into account./The researchers measured air pollutants from traffic twice, in the school courtyard and inside the classroom for schools with high and low traffic-related air pollution./Pollutants from burning fossil fuels, carbon, nitrogen dioxide and/ultrafine particles were measured./For example, working memory improved 7.4 per cent among children in/highly polluted schools compared with 11.5 per cent among those in less/polluted schools./Sunyer called on politicians to understand and act on how air pollution can be harmful to the developing brains of children, given that one of the cognitive measures studied is a good predictor of learning achievement./The study builds on experiments in animal models and smaller human/studies, Sunyer said. But the only way to prove a link between air pollution/and poorer cognition would be to remove the cause and see if the effect improves./University of Toronto chemistry Prof. Greg Evans studies sources of air pollution, how people get exposed and health outcomes.

Pakistan: India measures air quality in world's most polluted capital,"Karachi, April 9 -- India's prime minister suggested Monday the country's ""age-old traditions"" could be used to ease its choking smog, as he launched a new air quality index for the world's most polluted capital./Narendra Modi proposed making every Sunday ""bicycle day"" and switching off street lights during a full moon, amid growing public concern over the impact of air pollution on the health of India's 1.2 billion people./""There can be green solutions in our age-old traditions,"" he said in a speech at a conference of environmental policymakers in the capital New Delhi./""What if our city governments. decided not to switch on the street lights during a full moon?"" he said./""It is only a small thing, but you can imagine how much energy could be saved and emissions could be cut if all the street lights were switched off during a full moon.""/The government said the new index would initially cover 10 cities - Delhi, Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow, Varanasi, Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad - each of which would have monitoring stations with Air Quality Index display boards./The government is under intense pressure to act after the World Health Organisation last year declared New Delhi the world's most polluted capital./At least 3,000 people die prematurely every year in the city because of air pollution, according to a joint study by Boston-based Health Effects Institute and Delhi's Energy Resources Institute./Modi also signalled that India would not bow to foreign pressure on tackling climate change, ahead of UN-led talks late this year in Paris on reducing greenhouse gas emissions./""The world guides us on climate change and we follow them? The world sets the parameters and we follow them? It is not like that. India can lead the world,"" he said./Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said the new index could drive efforts to ease air pollution./But he gave little indication of what the government would do except to promise new rules on disposing of construction waste./The dust from India's thousands of industrial and construction sites adds to the fumes from millions of vehicles to create the toxic cocktail that city-dwellers breathe./Many experts were unimpressed./""Monitoring pollution is not a solution to stop pollution,"" said ecologist Vandana Shiva, adding Modi's campaign to attract foreign companies to manufacture in India would only exacerbate the problem./""It's like finding a very sick person and instead of treating him, you hand him a thermometer. You have to take strict policy action, not launch symbolic measures.""/Greenpeace welcomed the new index but said it had expected the government ""to address the issue with more rigour and responsibility""./""Delhi is facing a public health emergency and an air quality index needs to be matched with actionable plans on how to bring the pollution levels down,"" said campaigner Aishwarya Madineni in a statement./""This is merely (a) bandaid on a wound that needs stitches, the bleeding is going to continue.""/A WHO study of 1,600 cities released last year showed Delhi had the world's highest annual average concentration of small airborne particles known as PM2.5 - higher even than Beijing./These extremely fine particles of less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter are linked with increased rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease as they penetrate deep into the lungs and can pass into the bloodstream./India disputed the WHO's assertion, but has conceded that air pollution in the capital is comparable with that of Beijing./An air quality index compiled by the US embassy in Delhi on Monday registered a PM2.5 reading of 175, which is considered unhealthy./The reading from the US embassy in Beijing was just 53, which is considered moderate./A new government website for the index, which will provide colour-coded air quality rankings ranging from ""good"" to ""severe"", went live on Monday morning, but could not be accessed. Officials said it had likely collapsed under high demand./The aim is for the index to eventually cover 66 cities./The government gave few details about the new rules on construction waste. Delhi generates up to 4,000 tonnes of construction debris every day, according to a 2014 study by the Centre for Science and Environment./Policymakers have suggested restrictions on private vehicles, higher pollution-related taxes and stricter enforcement of urban planning laws/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Pollution has become a major cause of public concern,"Karachi, April 16 -- Today's world is full of worries. Therefore, everybody seems upset and the next time to yearn for an escape from the worldly cares. He can hardly find the alternative, however./The obvious reason may be the bewildered mind to reach a decision about an option that is comparatively better enough for one to find momentary reprieve from the hubbub of daily lives. Ofcourse through some kind of outing, but the outcome may be far from promising./Like a shade, pollution will chase you everywhere. And you are less liable to feel comfort by the miserable story of rapid deterioration, which is now written in every nook and cranny. Unlikely to feel rejuvenated by the journey, one is probably to opt for staying indoors./Indeed, the borderless issue of pollution has become a major cause of concern. Rather to adversely affect our lives in the form of various contaminants introduced into the atmosphere. Besides, the same has resulted into global warming on the planetary level by harmfully influencing our natural environment./Looking around oneself at any ecosystem, what you see there are the multiple forms of contaminations-the city skies are covered in smog. The trash blowing away from landfills, streams full of toxic chemicals and rivers full of nutrients from farms./Besides killing plants and animals, the pollutants have its harmful effects on human beings by their long exposure to it. It may lead to many chronic respiratory diseases, such as lung cancer and other various kinds of ailments./Reportedly the pollutants have caused upto 40 percent of premature deaths in the world by the contaminants in water, air and soil. The majority of the deaths occur in the developing countries, due to the fact that the water used there is mostly contaminated, which approximately cause 80 percent of the infectious diseases in the world./In these countries, litter in water comes from various sources including containers that fall off ships during storms. Trash that washes off the streets or the wastes from landfills blows into the streams, rivers and into the oceans./Air pollution is equally growing as a contaminated problem throughout the world. It leads to severe health implications in many parts of the world as one of the leading causes of lung cancer, mostly spread by two common ways: indoor air pollution and outdoor air pollution./Indoor air pollution is common in families from developing countries, who use open stoves for cooking and heating their homes. These homes do not have proper ventilation. The smoke full of chemicals and carcinogens gets trapped inside, where families eat and sleep./Outdoor air pollution also causes various diseases and illnesses, especially in most of the cities of the industrial countries. It is a leading cause of death in many countries, particularly dependent on coal for survival of its economy being a cheap source of energy./It is also a major cause of concern in many wealthy countries. They rely heavily on the coal, which is considered the dirtiest source of energy. The countries, which receive this kind of pollution, have the form of acid rain. It results mainly from the coal powered factories. Those who live and work in big urban centers now experience warm days beneath the smog layer./Furthermore, the cities have become the centers of air pollution due to heavy traffic. That has created environmental problems with worst pollution by increasing car emissions. As a result the cities are less attractive places to live in due to the presence of the cloud of dust and smoke of vehicles, which is poising severe health problems for the local people./In a nutshell, the growing human activities are leading to large increases in the level of pollutants. It fills lands with muddy landscapes, poison soils and waterways. Even the landscapes that appear pristine can experience the effects of pollution in its various manifestations./The result is thinning of ozone layer and global warming, which may be attributed to tree cutting, pollution, reflective heat and radiation from roads and built areas etc. Besides, the near-ground composite temperature coupled with the thinning of clouds has led to erratic rainfall pattern with adverse impacts on the life and livelihoods of people of the vast areas/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Air pollution, dust cause increase in asthma patients: Dr Rashid","HYDERABAD, April 27 -- The increasing air pollution and dust put the number of allergic asthmatic patients high in urban populace and there is a need of formulation of an effective strategy in controlling air pollution. Eminent pulmonologist and Head of the Department of Pulmonology, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro, Dr Rashid Ahmed Khan expressed his concern over increasing allergic asthmatic disease in an interview with media on Friday. He said that smoke of increasing number of new and unfit vehicles as well dust were the main causes for increasing allergic asthmatics among the residents of urban localities. /Dr Rashid said the cigarette smoke, animal dander, mold, spores, house dust, feather pillows, some foods, or any other sensitive substance, infections, emotional stress, fatigue, endocrine and climate changes are also the main sources of emergence of the disease. About symptoms, he said that an attack may begin gradually; resulting in increasing respiratory distress and it could also begin dramatically with the onset of severe multiple symptoms such as tightness in the chest, difficulties in inhaling and exhaling, coughing.Feelings of suffocation and difficulty in speaking could also occur, he added. Dr Rashid said that asthma sufferers rarely die from an asthma attack, but the feeling of suffocation as their airways begin to close often makes them fear that they have already gasped their last breath. He said that asthma is the disorder of the respiratory system in which the passages that enable air to pass into and out of the lungs periodically narrow, causing coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. This narrowing is typically temporary and reversible, but in severe attacks, asthma may result in death. He said asthma most commonly refers to bronchial asthma, an inflammation of the airways, but the term is also used to refer to cardiac asthma, which develops when fluid builds up in the lungs as a complication of heart failure. He said that every cell in the human body requires oxygen to function and the lungs make that oxygen available and with every breath taken by the people, air travels to the lungs through a series of tubes and airways. Dr Khan informed that after passing through the mouth and throat, air moves through the larynx, commonly known as the voice box and then through the trachea or windpipe. He said that asthma attacks occur when the bronchi and bronchioles become inflamed, reducing the space through which air can travel through the lungs and this causes the asthmatic to work harder to move air in and out of the lungs. He said that asthma also occurs among those people who do not have allergies and in these persons, chemical irritants trigger an inflammatory response that is initiated in a different way than in allergen-triggered asthma and for example, some people are sensitive to certain common chemical irritants, such as perfume, hairspray, cosmetics, and household cleaners/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: CLIMATE CHANGE TO AGGRAVATE PAKISTAN'S DISEASE BURDEN,"ISLAMABAD, May 12 -- Federal Minister for Climate Change, Senator Mushahidullah Khan has warned that Pakistan's disease burden and its overall impact on socio-economic development gains made in recent years will further escalate. This will lead to rise in avoidable deaths in coming years because of rapidly changing and erratic climate./While talking to media here on Sunday the climate change minister warned most such deaths will occur in urban areas like Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar, where living standard and health quality of the people are continuously falling, particularly increasing air and water pollution. ""Lives of children and elderly people will be particularly at stake,"" he said. Primarily fueled by increasing levels of carbon pollution, climate change poses a grave risk to the health and wellbeing of people, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan right from aggravating the risk of asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses/allergies to changing the spread of certain vector-borne diseases including Malaria, Dengue fever, he said in a news statement released on Sunday./""Human health will particularly suffer from increasing ground-level ozone, which is a key component of smog. As average earth temperature continues to rise, the amount of ozone tends to increase. The ozone, which is associated with the increased risk of premature death in adults and diminished lung function, would also lead to increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits for asthma, particularly in children,"" Khan warned.

Patient body's allergies to pollen, cosmetics, animals or/fabrics often bring on allergic conjunctivitis amd irritants like air/pollution, noxious fumes and chlorine in swimming pools may produce the chemical form, he added./The certain forms of conjunctivitis can develop into a serious/condition that may harm the vision and it is important to have conjunctivitis diagnosed and treated quickly, he said./He said that some common allergens include pollen from trees and/grass, weed pollens and moulds, animal skin, fur and secretions such as saliva, perfumes and cosmetics and eye make up, skin medicines, air pollution and smoke./He said that the grass pollens tend to cause symptoms in early summer/and various other pollens and moulds may cause symptoms later in the/summer./Dr. Jamil said that in our city construction dust is a major cause of/allergic conjunctivitis and the perennial form persists throughout the/year and is usually triggered by dust mites. He said that in some cases,/use of mosquito-repellant liquids applied in a closed room throughout/the night can cause allergies and puffy eyelids, viral and bacterial infections./About the symptoms of conjunctivitis Dr. Jamil Ahmed informed that/the eyes are usually itchy, and the whites of the eyes look red or pink,/a burning feeling may occur and it may be painful, eyelids tend to swell, eyes can water as in allergic conjunctivitis or become 'gluey' as in infective conjunctivitis but their vision is not usually affected, he added./He said that in severe cases the conjunctiva under the upper eyelids/swell and look lumpy./He said that the allergic conjunctivitis is irritating and/uncomfortable, but it will not hurt patients' eyesight unless it is very/severe and infectious conjunctivitis. However it needs urgent attention/as the symptoms can worsen and become difficult to treat./About the use of the contact lenses he said that it is not a good/idea to wear contacts while patients have conjunctivitis. Instead, wear glasses until patient's eyes feel better./About the precaution Dr. Jamil said that it is a myth if patients/think that by staring into a red eye one may catch the infection./About the treatment Dr. Syed Jamil suggested that bathing the eyes/with a cloth soaked in cold water soothes the eyes. He said that depending/on the type of conjunctivitis, eye drops that reduce inflammation and/treat infection (antibiotic) are prescribed by the eye doctor./He said that steroid eye drops are rarely needed or used and steroids/are good at reducing inflammation, however, they should only be used under/the supervision of an eye specialist. He said that steroids can make some other eye conditions worse./He said that Conjunctivitis treatment depends upon the cause and/the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis is by avoiding the allergen./Viral conjunctivitis resists treatment, broad-spectrum antibiotic and eyedropper may prevent secondary infection./Dr. Jamil Ahmed said that the small children, who may forget these/precautions, should be kept away from school, camp and the swimming pool until the condition is cured and antibiotic medication, usually eye drops, is effective for bacterial conjunctivitis./He further said that the infectious conjunctivitis caused by bacteria,/is usually treated with antibiotic eye drops and ointment but other infectious forms, caused by viruses, can not be treated with antibiotics and must be fought off by patients' body's immune system/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: RECYCLED MATERIAL AT DISPLAY,"LAHORE, May 27 -- An Exhibition on Scientific models through recycled material was organized at University of Education (UoE) under the supervision of Dr. Sadia Shaukat. Students from B.Ed Hons designed different scientific models by using rash material and presented innovative concepts of recycling. Dr. Sadia stressed the importance of recycling and she highlighted the importance of recycling./Recycling is the process of separating, collecting and remanufacturing or converting used or waste products into new materials. Recycling helps extend the life and usefulness of something that has already served its initial purpose by producing something that is useable. Recycling has a lot of benefits and importance not only to us humans but especially to our planet./Recycling waste not only save our natural resources but also help save energy. By simply recycling an item or making a basic fix to it, we can we save all the energy that would have been consumed in the process of making it. The same example can be taken with plastic items./A large amount of energy can be saved by simply reusing the plastic items. To recycle waste is to simply reduce pollution. By recycling plastic material we can reduce air pollution as well as water pollution. Plastic factories produced large amount of smoke when producing plastic material at the same time if we don't have proper waste disposal system those waste emissions will cause water pollution./Almost Eighty students participated in this exhibition and demonstrated worthwhile scientific models. Students' scientific models such as moving water boat by use of mechanics, Aeroplane, Cotton Candy mini machine, water cooler, water turbine, Wind mill, water boats, washing machine, rotating lamps, remote controlled train and cars, lifting Car based in lever mechanism, table fans, solar microwave, small mosquito that moves, preparing electricity by salt water, Butterflies moving with music, sound speaker, globe, quadcopter and skeleton took the huge attention of audience. Guest, Teachers, students and outsiders appreciated the tremendous efforts of the students. Students' efforts were rewarded through certificates and with gratitude/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Cancer deaths worldwide to rise over 11 mln in 2030,"ISLAMABAD, June 25 -- World Health Organization (WHO) has said that deaths from cancer worldwide are projected to continue to rise over 11 million in 2030. According to WHO, cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide as it accounted for 7.6 million deaths which is around 13% of all deaths in 2008. Lung, stomach, liver, colon and breast cancer cause the most cancer deaths each year. In the WHO Western Pacific Region, it is estimated that close to 4.07 million new cases occurred in 2008 with 2.31 million in men and 1.75 million in women, it said. The most frequent types of cancer differ between men and women. /About 30% of cancer deaths are due to the five leading behavioral and dietary risks included high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol use. Similarly, infectious agents are responsible for almost 22% of cancer deaths in the developing world and 6% in industrialized countries, it added. Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of cancer in the world causing 22% of cancer deaths. About 70% of the lung cancer burden can be attributed to smoking alone. It said early diagnosis programmes are particularly relevant in low-resource settings where the majority of patients are diagnosed in very late stages. The WHO said that systematic application of a screening test in an asymptomatic population aimed at identifying individuals with abnormalities suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer and refer them promptly for diagnosis and treatment. Screening programmes are especially effective for frequent cancer types that have a screening test that is cost-effective, affordable, acceptable and accessible to the majority of the population at risk. It said that the global action plan calls for national, international and multisectoral action across multiple areas to reduce cancer risks in populations, and to strengthen health care delivery systems for people with cancer. Environmental and infectious causes are important for cancer prevention so that WHO's guidance in those areas is part of the comprehensive approach. Dr Wasim Khawaja from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said that cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body, adding, other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. He said that one defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs. He said that more than 30% of cancer could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors, including tobacco use, being overweight or obese, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, alcohol use, human papillomavirus and hepatitis B infection, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels.

Pakistan: Climate change threatens 50 years of progress in global health: study,"ISLAMABAD, July 7 -- Climate change threatens to undermine half a century of progress in global health, according to a major new report. But the analysis also concludes that the benefits to health resulting from slashing fossil fuel use are so large that tackling global warming also presents the greatest global opportunity to improve people's health in the 21st century. The report was produced by the Lancet/UCL commission on health and climate change, a collaboration of dozens of experts from around the world, and is backed by Margaret Chan, head of the UN World Health Organisation, the guardian reported. /""We see climate change as a major health issue and that it is often neglected in the policy debates,"" said Professor Anthony Costello, director of the UCL Institute of Global Health and co-chair of the commission. ""On our current trajectory, going to 4C [of warming] is somewhere we don't want to go and that has very serious and potentially catastrophic effects for human health and human survival and could undermine all of the last half-century's gains.

The comprehensive analysis sets out the direct risks to health, including heatwaves, floods and droughts, and indirect but no less deadly risks,including air pollution, spreading diseases, famines and mental ill-health. A rapid phase-out of coal from the global energy mix is among the commission's top recommendations, given the millions of premature deaths from air pollution this would prevent. The report states that political will is now the major barrier to delivering a low-carbon economy and the associated improvements to health and poverty, not finance or technology. The authors argue that health has been neglected from the climate change debate.

Pakistan: Polluted air raises risk of developing dementia: research,"ISLAMABAD, Aug. 6 -- Swedish researchers have uncovered a direct link between polluted air and dementia. People who live in homes exposed more heavily to pollution run a 40 percent greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia than those who live in areas with cleaner air, a study by researchers at Umea University has found. ""In total, about 16 percent of all the cases of dementia in the study might have been caused by exposure to pollution,"" participating researcher Bertil Forsberg told the daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter, describing the results as ""sensational."" The study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, studied nearly 2,000 people over a 15-year span while simultaneously tracking traffic patterns in the northern Swedish city of Umea. All participants were 55 or older and free of any disease symptoms when the study began, Press tv reported. The researchers established the elevated risk having controlled for factors such as age, education level, lifestyle and body fat, Forsberg said. While previous research linked air pollution to cancer, asthma and respiratory diseases, academics have in recent years begun to probe how air quality affects the brain.

Pakistan: Pollution from ships kills thousands each year: research,"ISLAMABAD, Aug. 6 -- Shipping emissions are invisible killer that cause lung cancer and heart disease, a new study has found, but researchers say the 60,000 deaths, they cause each year could be significantly cut by exhaust filtration devices. The University of Rostock and the German environmental research centre Helmholzzentrum Munich have established a firm link between shipping exhaust emissions and serious diseases, that cost European health services 58 billion annually. Conventional ship engines that burn heavy fuel oil or diesel fuel emit high concentrations of harmful substances including heavy metals, hydrocarbons and sulphur, as well as carcinogenic particulate matter (PM), the guardian reported. /People in coastal areas are particularly at risk, researchers said. Up to half of PM-related air pollution in coastal areas, rivers and ports comes from ship emissions, according to the study. Lief Miller, the CEO of conservation NGO NABU, said, ""The results are frightening and confirm our worst fears. Emissions from ships cause serious lung and heart diseases."" Fine particle emissions have been linked to increased health risks for decades. Although substantial efforts have been made to reduce the sulphur and diesel soot emissions from cars and lorries, no comparable efforts have been made for the shipping sector. The NGO Transport & Environment said, ""Marine fuel is 2,700 times dirtier than road diesel and ?35 billion of fuel tax is paid yearly in Europe for road transport, while shipping uses tax-free fuel."" Given that shipping accounts for over one fifth of global fuel consumption, the fact that its emissions are not more strictly regulated is cause for concern. For the researchers, legislation enforcing particle filtration and PM limits in shipping is the ""next logical target for improving air quality worldwide, particularly in coastal regions and harbour cities"". Dietmar Oeliger, NABU's transport expert, said, ""We really underline the recommendation of the scientists to urgently switch to low sulphur fuels together with effective emission abatement techniques."" The most effective method of cleaning up emissions from shipping is to combine PM filters with low-sulphur fuels, a measure that has long been in place on the roads. Other options include converting ships' engines to run on gas or retrofitting them with exhaust gas cleaning systems known as ""scrubbers"". The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has capped the sulphur content of shipping fuel at 3.5%. By 2020, the IMO will limit sulphur content in ship's fuel to 0.5% worldwide. In many of Europe's coastal waters the limit is 1%, and as of January 2015, the limit in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) of the North and the Baltic Seas is just 0.1%. According to Transport & Environment, the health benefits from the implementation of the new stricter SECAs are projected to be worth up to 23 billion. But these limits are not strictly enforced, and the options available for reducing sulphur and PM emissions remain too expensive for the majority of ship operators. As well as severe health risks to humans, sulphur causes acid rain and leads to a host of environmental problems including soil and water quality degradation and damage to biodiversity. ""We need meaningful measures to incentivise the uptake of cleaner marine fuels as a stepping stone towards cleaning up the sector,"" said Sotiris Raptis, clean shipping officer at Transport & Environment/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Climate change threatens 50 years of progress in global health, study says","ISLAMABAD, Aug. 13 -- Climate change threatens to undermine half a century of progress in global health, according to a new report. But the analysis also concludes that the benefits to health resulting from slashing fossil fuel use are so large that tackling global warming also presents the greatest global opportunity to improve people's health in the 21st century. The report was produced by the Lancet/UCL commission on health and climate change, a collaboration of dozens of experts from around the world, and is backed by Margaret Chan, head of the UN World Health Organisation, The Guardian reported. /""We see climate change as a major health issue and that it is often neglected in the policy debates,"" said Professor Anthony Costello, director of the UCL Institute of Global Health and co-chair of the commission. ""On our current trajectory, going to 4C [of warming] is somewhere we don't want to go and that has very serious and potentially catastrophic effects for human health and human survival and could undermine all of the last half-century's gains. We see that as a medical emergency because the action we ned to do to stop that in its tracks and get us back onto a 2C trajectory or less requires action now and action in the next ten years otherwise the game could be over."" The comprehensive analysis sets out the direct risks to health, including heatwaves, floods and droughts, and indirect but no less deadly risks, including air pollution, spreading diseases, famines and mental ill-health. A rapid phase-out of coal from the global energy mix is among the commission's top recommendations, given the millions of premature deaths from air pollution this would prevent. The report states that political will is now the major barrier to delivering a low-carbon economy and the associated improvements to health and poverty, not finance or technology. The authors argue that health has been neglected from the climate change debate. It says doctors and other health professionals must take a leading role in ending society's ""addiction"" to fossil fuels, having confronted ""powerful entrenched interests"", such as the tobacco industry, in the past. ""A public health perspective has the potential to unite all actors behind a common cause the health and wellbeing of our families, communities, and countries,"" the report states. ""These concepts are far more tangible and visceral than tonnes of atmospheric CO2, and are understood and prioritised across all populations."" The commission is seeking consciously to shift the balance from what Costello called ""catastrophism"" to a far more positive message about the potential for improving human health. ""We are getting fatter, we're getting heart attacks, strokes, diabetes,respiratory ill-health, depression, anxiety and virtually all of things we want to do to protect us against climate change will improve our health, whether it's active transport walking, cycling eating healthier sustainable local diets or cutting air pollution. All of that will have a huge health dividend, health benefits and save a lot of money,"" said Costello. The report is the latest in a line of significant interventions in the run-up to a crunch UN climate summit in Paris in December, when nations hope to agree a global deal on cutting emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in November of ""severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts"" from global warming, shortly after an international group of economists warned that the world's future economic growth depended on taming climate change.Last week, Pope Francis issued a rare encyclical which set out a passionately-argued moral case for acting on both climate change and poverty. The first commission report, which warned that ""climate change is the greatest health threat of the 21st century"", was published in 2009 ahead of the ultimately unsuccessful UN climate summit in Copenhagen/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Karachi needs proper planning to overcome environmental pollution,"KARACHI, Sept. 1 -- Proper planning is needed to meet growing urbanization in the country, particularly in Karachi where constant population influx has contributed towards environmental pollution besides adding burden to it's resources. Experts in their respective presentations during a seminar ""Urbanization and Environment,"" that also coincided with the 12th Annual Environment Excellence Awards ceremony, said there was need to address the issue of urbanization on modern lines alongwith promotion of agro- based industries in rural areas. /The event organised by National Forum for Environment and Health (NFEH) in collaboration with PARCO, Sindh Department of Youth Affairs and other organisations was addressed by Shamsul Haq Memon, Zaigham Mahmood Rizvi, Gulzar Firoz, Dr Najam, Senator Tajdar Haider and others. The speakers registered their concern that Karachi was registered to have one of the highest population growth rate in the world while little efforts were made to address the ensuing situation manifested through rise in air pollution, water scarcity and environmental diseases besides the social implications. It was warned that any delay in proper planning may enhance Karachi's vulnerability to severe environmental degradation. Former Secretary, Sindh Environment Department, Shamsul Haq Memon defined urbanization in local context as population shift from rural areas to towns and cities, where people come to get work and facilities. ""The rise in urban population puts burden on energy and food consumption, ultimately causing environment pollution,"" said Memon. He also mentioned that urban areas across the country were mainly suffering from air, noise and water pollution due to rising population leading to wide range of social and economy related issues. ""Urbanization is simultaneously noticed to provide education, health, employment, and transportation facilities to the settlers that otherwise is almost non existent in most of the rural areas,"" said Shamsul Haq Memon. He stressed need for proper planning to help meet essential civic needs crucial for socio-economic development of the people in the country/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Govt to achieve socio-economic development goals in climate change sector: Arif,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 4 -- Federal Climate Change Secretary Arif Ahmed Khan said Wednesday that climate change is posing a serious risk to Pakistan's development gains and new development plans being thrashed out for achieving sustainable socio-economic development goals. The secretary expressed these remarks while chairing a meeting with three-member delegation of World Bank and the ministry officials. The World Bank delegation was led by Lead Economist Mr. Muthukumara S. Mani. /""However, mainstreaming climate change into policymaking and development activities is vital to dealing with the various development and climate change issues in the country,"" Arif Ahmed Khan added. Discussing preparation for the Pakistan's case for global climate change in Paris later this year, deliberating on workable ways and means for boosting understanding about climate issues and their impacts on poverty reduction efforts and implementation of their national climate policy and climate resilience action plans in selected sectors included water, energy and urban development were among key objectives of the meeting held here in the ministry. Mr. Mani said that Climate change remains an economic development challenge for Pakistan in terms of threats to food and water security, agricultural productivity, rural and coastal livelihoods, disease processes and production of essential environmental services. The country's energy use is growing rapidly and becoming more emissions intensive because of the mineral intensive industrialization and rising use of motorized transport, which has become a major source of rising levels of air pollution and cause of health consequences, he added. ""However, the Bank is ready to support Pakistan's efforts to develop a lower carbon, more climate-resilient growth pathways, which are inevitable for building country's climate-resilience against negative impacts of climate change,"" the World Bank's leading economist told the meeting. He emphasized need for understanding impacts of climate change on poverty in the country and identifying viable policy measures to overcome these impacts. The World Bank delegation also underlined need for south- south exchange progrmmes for sharing knowledge and technical expertise in climate change adaptation and mitigation. Senior Environmental Specialist in the World Bank South Asia Region Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change Unit, Ms. Akiko Nakagawa, told the meeting participants that as far as the south-south exchange progrmmes are concerned Vietnam offers good lessons for Pakistan to learn about implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes for mitigating country's climate-vulnerability in the field of disaster management, energy efficiency, efficient water management, climate-smart farming and sustainable forest management. ""The World Bank is ready to actualize exchange programmes for Pakistan, under which government officials of the climate change ministry and relevant line and provincial departments can be enabled or provided with opportunities to learn from Vietnam's climate resilience building experiences in different socio-economic development sectors and replicate these mitigation and adaptation models in Pakistan,"" she said. The secretary appreciated the support of the World Bank in supporting Pakistan in all possible ways for achieving sustainable socio-economic goals, poverty reduction and climate-resilience building. He also appreciated the Bank's delegation for extending offers for making Pakistan climate-resilient, water & energy efficient and food secure country. The secretary told the delegation that these offers would be taken into account and all relevant government departments would be taking on board in this regard, if need be, avail these supportive offers.

Pakistan: Air pollution linked to increased deaths due to heart disease,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 17 -- Even minuscule increase in the amount of tiny chemical particles by 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air, lead to roughly a 10 percent increase in risk of death due to heart disease, says a study. ""Our data add to a growing body of evidence that particulate matter is really harmful to health, increasing overall mortality, mostly deaths from cardiovascular disease, as well as deaths from respiratory disease in nonsmokers,"" said lead study investigator George Thurston, professor at New York University Langone Medical Centre. For non-smokers, the risk increase rises to 27 per cent in cases of death due to respiratory disease, Medical Daily reported on Tueday. According to Thurston, fine particles can contribute to the development of potentially fatal heart and lung diseases because they slip past the body's defences and can be absorbed deep into the lungs and bloodstream.

Pakistan: Outdoor air pollution kills 3.3 million a year worldwide,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 19 -- Air contaminated with pollutants such as ozone and tiny particles could cause the premature death of about 6.6 million people a year by 2050 if nothing is done to improve air quality, scientists warned. In a study published in the journal Nature, they found that outdoor air pollution already kills about 3.3 million people a year worldwide. /The majority of those deaths are in Asia where residential energy emissions, such as those from heating and cooking, have a major impact, The Guardian reported. And that toll could double over the next 35 years, the researchers warned, unless clean-up measures are taken. ""This is an astounding number,"" said Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, who led the research. ""In some counties air pollution is actually a leading cause of death, and in many countries it is a major issue."" Air pollution deaths are most commonly from heart disease, strokes or a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also linked to deaths from lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. Calculating the health and mortality effects of outdoor air pollution on a global scale is not easy, partly because air quality is not monitored in every region and the toxicity of particles varies depending on their source. So for this study, Lelieveld's team combined a global atmospheric chemistry model with population data and health statistics to estimate the relative contribution of different kinds of outdoor air pollution, mainly from so-called fine particulate matter, to premature deaths. Their results show that in India and China, for example, emissions from heating and cooking, have the largest death toll, while in much of the US and a few other countries, emissions from traffic and power generation are crucial. In the eastern United States and in Europe, Russia and East Asia, agricultural emissions are the biggest source of the kind of fine particulate matter that gets into people's lungs, causing illness, disability and death. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric scientist at Britain's Lancaster University, said the study ""really brings home the need for air quality controls"", particularly in heavily populated parts of Asia/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution deaths to double by 2050: study,"ISLAMABAD, Sept. 23 -- Air pollution kills more than three million people annually and the number is set to double by 2050, says a study. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany found that death by air pollution exposure was especially common in Asia as it claims 1.4 million people in China and 650,000 people in India annually, reported BBC health news. /Other global hotspots include Nigeria, which has the highest population of any country in Africa, the Indonesia island of Java, and parts of the Middle East along the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates rivers. In the European Union, with a population of around half a billion people, air pollution is responsible for 180,000 deaths annually, highest in Germany at 35,000. In much of Eurasia, including parts of northern China and Japan, air pollution from agricultural activity is the leading cause of premature deaths. For most of southern China and much of India, however, the leading cause is smog from what researchers call small domestic fires, likely for cooking or heating. They make up a third of all domestic premature deaths from air pollution, and the researchers call them the worst air polluters. Looking at Canada, deaths from agricultural air pollution are most common along the Windsor-Quebec City corridor, while on the southern Prairies and British Columbia, industrial pollution seems to be the most harmful, while in the Rockies, pollution from transportation-related activities seems the most common. As for the kind of deaths caused by air pollution, the study found strokes and heart attacks accounted for almost three quarters, with lung cancer and respiratory diseases making up 27 per cent/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.
