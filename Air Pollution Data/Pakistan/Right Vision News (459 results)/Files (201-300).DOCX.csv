Pakistan: As environment agency gasps for funds: Air pollution rises in Islamabad,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 02 -- Air pollution is rising in the city`s I-9 industrial area but the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) can do little because its Environment Monitoring System (EMS) has been gasping for funds for months./Environmentalists say that the EPA is out on a limb since the Federal Ministry of Environment was devolved to the provinces and funds to the EMS blocked. An official watching the development told media that the EMS had been lying dormant since it was put under the development division of the federal capital`s administration. ""Because the EPA has no funds to run it, no notices could be issued to the polluting industries during the last three months,"" he said./According to the EPA website, Japan had granted the EMS project Rs973 million in the form of machinery and equipment while the Pakistan government was to provide Rs260 million to run it./Its function was to send weekly and monthly monitoring reports about air quality to EPA to warn and act against the pollutants./""There are several industries in the area which are the main polluters but cannot be taken to task because the EMS is not operational,"" sources said./A visit to I-9 industrial area revealed few steel mills still operating there, spewing poisonous gases into the air./""I can`t stand this massive black smoke, not even for a few minutes and have to wear a mask to pass through the I-9 industrial area,"" moaned Majid Khan, a resident of main market of I-9 sector.

"Pakistan: Noise, air pollution in Lea Market unbearable","KARACHI, Oct. 04 -- Noise and air pollution in Lea Market and its surrounding areas have become a permanent public nuisance and unbearable, causing an irreparable loss to public health./According to medical practitioners in the area and community activists, the situation is turning from bad to worse because of increasing congestion and heavy traffic on the main market road and adjoining roads. The experts and activists are of the view that noise level of vehicles' engines and horns is so high that one cannot talk to a person sitting next to them while passing through the area or crossing a road.Apart from smoke-emitting vehicles, regular burning of waste at some places in Lea Market/has been causing serious air pollution./Speaking to media, residents of the area have called for remedial measures, saying that air and noise pollution have made their lives miserable.

Pakistan: Rickshaws - affordable mode of advertisements,"RAWALPINDI, Oct. 26 -- With the crackdown against illegal billboards launched by the district government, the publicity campaign has become expensive but the smoke-emitting auto-rickshaws have emerged as an important and affordable tool for commercial and political advertisements./Earlier, the quacks, homeo physicians and other low-profile organisations put their posters on the exteriors of rickshaws as part of their publicity campaign. But now the lawmakers, leading multinational companies and public sector organisations prefer to display their ads at the auto-rickshaws./The rickshaw drivers roaming in each corner of the city are unaware of the importance of the posters they display on the rear parts of the vehicles and offer their services against nominal prices ranging from Rs1,000 to Rs1,500 for an indefinite period./A billboard located at a busy spot in the city costs one million rupees to two million rupees for a period of one year while the small hoardings are booked by politicians, companies and other organisations for Rs500,000 to Rs800,000 and thus these are costly mode of publicity campaigns./The noisy rickshaws, which can be observed squeezing through the heavy traffic on the city roads, are not liked by the people due to noise and air pollution but they have become favourite advertising tools./The district administration has removed some 150 billboards from the city roads including Benazir Bhutto Road, Airport Road and in the inner city areas and would auction the sites for earning money. Advertisements through billboards fetches Rs90 million annually to the district administration./Mukammal Khan, 35, a rickshaw driver who has displayed a portrait of PML-N MPA Sheharyar Riaz Khan said that he received Rs1,500 for pasting the poster of the lawmaker. He said that the banner would remain there as long as it lasted itself./""The poster is a decoration item for my rickshaw and I am thankful to the politician for giving me money and a beautiful banner. People often approach me for putting their posters on the rickshaw but there is no room for additional banners in my vehicle,"" Zarar Mohmand, another rickshaw driver said when asked./There are many rickshaw owners who display the portraits of certain lawmakers on their own so that they may get favour from the politicians in case they are booked or penalised for any violation./Interestingly, the rickshaws are not regulated by Regional Transport Authority (RTA) like other modes of public transport and are not required to get fitness certificates or route permits and other necessary formalities./""Rickshaws have been exempted from these formalities in the absence of legislation by the provincial government in this regard. I think the tricycles should get the necessary permissions from the office,"" Secretary RTA Agha Kazmi told media on Sunday./This trend has resulted in massive increase in the number of noisy rickshaws and the residents and motorists continue to suffer despite that environment authorities in the city have found that the tricycles are the major source of noise and air pollution Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Sprawling dumping yards,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 27 -- Residents of my city are sitting on the verge of catching deadly diseases as the deadly waste from butcher shops, medical waste from hospitals and private nursing homes, scattering of used and unused construction materials and the garbage of every kind are sprawling the existing dumping sites./The stink and garbage fumes have made life hell for them as people have begun contracting respiratory and lung diseases because of this./BUTCHERS/Butchers, poultry and fish sellers in Sector G-9/4 market, known as Peshawar Morr market, are cause of spreading stink and related pungent smells in the area. They slaughter animals inside their shops; blood and wastage of which are disposed through the sewerage lines causing frequent sewerage blockage every now and then hence the filthy water and blood overflows in the nearby low-lying streets posing severe health hazards to the residents./The offal, hides and pieces of skin are dumped in the CDA's already filled dustbins, which are seldom cleared. The butchers have virtually turned their shops into slaughterhouses in connivance with the authorities concerned. The hygiene conditions prevailing at these shops cannot be considered fit enough for consumption of meat./Like meat sellers, poultry sellers are also playing their role in vitiating the area atmosphere. The poultry stock mainly live chicken is stored in bulk without meeting the required hygiene standards./MEDICAL WASTE/It is alarming to note that the clinical waste is disposed of in the most unhygienic way; throwing it away in dumps or burning it in the open. In the absence of modern techniques, most hospitals are adopting waste disposal methods that are difficult for local people to accept./Mrs Murad says the stench of the garbage becomes unbearable when a piece of garbage is put on fire. Not only this, she says, the garbage also spreads around during the rains and becomes more stinking./Every other day, the employees of the Capital Hospital and the Federal Government Services Hospital (Polyclinic) put heaps of waste on fire and cause extreme inconvenience to the neighbouring localities and shopkeepers of adjoining shopping centers./Most other waste like pieces of human flesh, tissues, waste recovered from gynecological wards, pathological waste, blood and cotton swabs are simply thrown away in open garbage dumps. The hospital waste is said to include toxic, radioactive, inflammable and biological waste and a little mismanagement of it could cause lethal diseases./CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL/The Capital Development Authority has been busy in constructing new roads and buildings and repairing the damaged ones in almost every sector of the city for the last many months so are the businessmen of my city./The irony is that piles of construction material like iron bars, sand, crush, gravel, bricks and cement have been dumped alongside the construction site in open which hinders smooth flow of traffic in general and the pedestrians in particular./The contractors in most of the localities have either stacked construction materials in the nearby open grounds or on the roads. The construction material dumped in this way is found to be scattered on the road causing difficulties for the motorists and pedestrians alike./""The construction material dumped along roadside is a constant source of disturbance for pedestrian and vehicles till completion. There should be some specific rules and regulations, as the construction material placed along roadside create traffic problem as people have to pass their vehicles with great difficulty. The concerned authorities should check properly and impose fine on such violators,"" said Nisar Ahmad, a resident of G-8./Huge quantities of construction materials are brought to and kept at the site which gets scattered with the passage of time. The absence of specific rule and regulations for placing the construction material being used for construction of houses, plazas and shops has aggravated the situation. During the construction period, which goes for months, the residents of the surrounding areas and other road users are bound to face the situation./GARBAGE/The heaps of garbage lying unattended, dumped on roads or overflowing from garbage containers are serving as breeding grounds for the phenomenal growth of mosquitoes causing dengue virus through out my city./Since these waste containers often are overloaded and not emptied for days, people have started throwing the garbage on roads and streets with impunity. The filthy and stinking places have become ideal places for the spread of dengue virus./The stink and unhygienic atmosphere bothers commuters especially pedestrians using footpaths along the roads. As garbage gets dry and changes into dust particles, it becomes a part of the air disturbing and affecting the health of people driving motorbikes and other open vehicles. People inhale these particles and fell victim to various infectious diseases./A survey reveals that primarily Sector G-6 is the worst attended locality. The residents are exposed to different diseases due to the improper collection and disposal of solid waste. They are not only facing the foul stench, emanating from the garbage heaps but also air pollution caused by the burning of waste plastic bags and other material, as setting solid waste on fire has become a common practice here./""The people in this area kept on dumping solid waste in the open and huge piles of rubbish could be seen everywhere. This is a source of constant nuisance for the residents as it causes a lot of inconvenience,"" said Noor Hussain, a resident of G-6/1-2./Another resident, Raza Abbas, said that a filthy atmosphere had been prevailing in the locality for the past several months, and now it had become so bad that one felt nausea while crossing the roads and streets./The poor management of civic affairs in my city is leading to further deterioration of situation as the authorities concerned have not carried out anti-mosquito spray and fumigation for last many years./AABPARA/The Aabpara market on Khayaban-e-Suhrawardy in sector G-6/1 is the oldest shopping area of the capital city where one can buy each and everything of the daily useable. Unfortunately, parking area outside the main entrance of the market is being used as a waste and litter dump. The garbage's smell not only irks passers-by but the heap also takes up considerable space, which creates problems for motorists who cannot park their vehicles properly./WEEKLY BAZAAR/Similarly, the scattered garbage in and around the weekly bazaars in Aabpara and H-9 have become a nuisance for the shoppers. The situation is very poor in and around the bazaars as the sanitary workers do not remove the garbage regularly./PARKS/Even city's main recreational parks are not spared of garbage and litter which persistently perturbs the visitors of Rose and Jasmine Garden, Shakarparian, Fatima Jinnah and Japanese Park. The visitors express their annoyance over the apathy of the concerned authorities as one can notice foul stench from the children play areas of the picnic spots./Garbage dumped here and there is not simply an eyesore; entire landscapes are ruined and unique habitats for flora and fauna are lost.

Pakistan: Govt apathy to proper disposal of hospital waste,"KARACHI, Nov. 11 -- Though a critical subject directly linked to the people's wellbeing, hospital waste and its proper disposal has never been on the priority list of this government or that of the previous ones./This is despite having rules on the subject and the fact that the government annually spends a significant amount of money on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases./Hospital waste, according to experts, is a major source of the spread of communicable diseases as it can contaminate the environment, including water supplies, if it is not properly disposed of./The government's lack of commitment in this regard is obvious not only from the poorly-run facilities for the disposal of hospital waste, but also from the ineffective handling of waste at the public-sector hospitals, daily visited by thousands of patients, they say./A case in point is the Civil Hospital Karachi and the Services Hospital, two major public-sector hospitals operating under the Sindh government. A dump of clinical waste on the middle of the premises shared by these two hospitals has been a source of grave concern for doctors for a long time. But nothing has yet moved the hospital administrations to find a solution.""This is the height of inefficiency which makes meaningless our fight against infectious diseases - polio, tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV, malaria, dengue etc,"" remarks a CHK doctor./Staff at the hospital told media that they had regularly seen people picking up syringes from the waste which, they said, was not only a big nuisance in a hospital but posed a serious threat to patients' health, especially to those undergoing surgeries at nearby operation theatres./The Services Hospital with about 700 to 800 patients reporting daily in its out-patient department has no incinerator. The waste is dumped at a spot within the hospital premises and later picked up for disposal./The CHK, the second biggest tertiary care public-sector hospital in the city after the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, has only one incinerator, which, too, often remains inoperative or runs much below its capacity./At the same place, where the CHK and Services Hospital share a wall, a small entrance had been created more than a year ago for the convenience of patients of the civil hospital, whose eye and neurosurgery units had earlier been shifted to the Services Hospital to make way for a trauma centre, which is yet to be launched./According to experts, only a few hospitals in the city actually operate the costly incinerators in the absence of a strong regulatory body. Their incinerators are generally obsolete, handled unprofessionally with little maintenance and lack equipment to control and monitor air pollution as it would further increase costs./""The problem is huge especially in areas where people belonging to the lower strata of society live. This may be noticed at big hospitals where almost half of the patients come for treatment of infectious diseases, mostly relating to unhygienic living conditions and these are not those already covered by vaccines,"" says Dr Altaf Ahmed, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of Pakistan./According to Dr Ahmed, the intensity of the issue could be reduced to a great extent if the hospital waste is segregated at source as only 10 to 15 per cent of it is infectious. However, a large proportion of this is dumped into municipal waste, which humans are exposed to. ""And when that infectious waste joins the non-infectious material, the entire lot becomes contaminated,"" he said.Highlighting another aspect of the same problem, Dr Idrees Adhi representing the Pakistan Medical Association, said that there was a need to establish a mandatory protocol to handle the different type of wastes produced by a medical facility./""First, we need to know the number of health facilities that exist in the city and regulate them under certain rules. Second, you can't incinerate every thing that is coming out of a health facility. There are parts of human body, too, that require separate handling and disposal. Besides, we need to provide protective gear to the staff handling the waste,"" he said./The ground situation, experts believe, also points to a weak monitoring role of the Sindh Environment Protection Agency, which needs to be strengthened by qualified staff, facilities and greater powers./City govt's incineration facility/The city district government Karachi has been running two incinerators in the Haroonabad and Mewashah areas to dispose of hospital waste for more than a decade. A visit to the site showed that the incinerators run much below their capacity as the facility doesn't receive adequate quantities of waste from hospitals./The incinerators are designed to handle one tonne waste per hour, according to staff posted at the municipal facility./However, the facility receives only two to five tonnes of waste per day that also includes liquid waste which is treated with sawdust before incineration./Electricity breakdowns, according to the staff, frequently hamper functioning of the incinerators, reportedly operated by a contractor./The waste is brought without any segregation to the facility, a major violation of the hospital waste management rules. The ash of the incinerated waste, the staff claimed, was disposed of at the landfill site. The road leading to the facility, however, seemed to belie their statement as it was found lined with heaps of ash-mixed waste./""It's a common observation that most of the medical waste is sold for recycling through sweepers. At the facility, we receive waste only from a few hospitals, though 130 health facilities are registered with the CDGK for the disposal of waste,"" a city district government official at the site said, adding that the hospitals were charged between Rs2,400 and Rs50,000 monthly, depending on the number of their beds./According to the official, there are about 500 to 600 hospitals in the city whereas the number of clinics is around 2,000. The CDGK doesn't have powers to force health facilities to dispose of their waste properly. It has also come to light that no regular analysis of the flue gases and ash produced by incineration was carried out, a mandatory job under the relevant rules./Expired medicines and chemicals were also treated at the facility./Prof Dr Nasiruddin Khan, a senior teacher of Karachi University's chemistry department who accompanied media's team that visited the CDGK facility, said the city district government's dual-chamber incinerator was outdated and didn't have the mechanism required to filter out hazardous gases and seemed to work just like a furnace./""Besides, segregation of waste is a must for proper functioning of incinerators. Expired medicines and chemicals require special handling and specific incineration facilities with extra caution. The quantity of plastic being burnt in the incineration should be according to the WHO standards,"" he said./The deep black fumes coming out of the incinerators, he added, were due to the high presence of carbon particles which posed a serious threat to humans. ""It would be better if the incinerator located in a populated area right now is shifted to some other place,"" he said Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

WHO estimates that almost 2.4 million people die each year from the causes of air pollution. /Pakistan being a developing country is also faced with the same problem and Peshawar a metropolitan city is considered to be one of the most polluted cities. Greatest source of emissions here are industries and actually mobile sources principally automobiles. The emission of harmful gases from these sources are not only affecting health of inhabitants but are also major contributing factor to change in climate such as green house effect, acid rain, global warming, smog and haze are increasing at an alarming rate and if not controlled may lead to end of world. Air pollution is the presence of one or more contaminants in the atmosphere such as dust, fumes, gases, odors, vapors, in quantities and duration that may be injurious to human health, animal life, plants, and to property. The major contributors to air pollution are vehicles and industrialization. With improve in standard of living and increase in demand on transport sector, pollution is growing fast in Peshawar city. An overview reveals that diesel vehicles dominates the roads here and the large vehicles such as trucks, buses, wagons, tractors and rickshaws are all run by diesel. As vehicles run on petrol are less in number they are polluting the atmosphere more than diesel engine vehicles by emitting lesser amounts of harmful gases while diesel engine vehicles emit unburned particles of carbon. Carbon-monoxide is produced when complete combustion of carbon is not possible due to insufficient oxygen; affects the constituent of blood, as it combines with red blood cells reducing its ability to absorb oxygen. Nitrogen is major constituent of air does not combines with oxygen at normal temperatures but during combustion process in engine, where high temperature and pressure are available nitrogen reacts with oxygen to form NO. After being released from cylinders combines with oxygen to form NO2 both are regarded as stable but in high concentration of NO cause irritation of respiratory organs and inhalation over long period results in destruction of lung tissues. Hydrocarbons found in exhaust gas such as aromatic hydrocarbons are considered carcinogenic. Unsaturated hydrocarbons in combination with nitrogen oxides and sunlight are involved in smog formation and saturated hydrocarbons which are odorless; irritate mucous membranes and are playing an important role in damaging the forests. Lead, are used in fuels to prevent knocking, are also noticed in exhaust gases and function as poison for nerve cells, bone marrow and blood. Presence of sulfur in fuel results in formation SO2 causing asthma and chronic bronchitis. Sooth is created due to shortage of air during combustion. Besides the fact that these vehicles are responsible for air pollution the bad condition of vehicles are also contributing factor to it. Poorly maintained vehicles are not only polluting the air we breathe but are damaging our health, children are mostly affected Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Dry weather causes rise in seasonal infections,"TAXILA, Dec. 6 -- Patients suffering from upper and lower respiratory tract infections swarm different hospitals and clinics of Taxila and Wah Cantonment./Health experts held dry weather coupled with malnutrition responsible for the surge in the number of patients visiting the hospitals daily.They have expressed deep concern over continuous rise in number of cases of cold and flu that took the shape of an epidemic mainly because of dry cold weather accompanied with rising air pollution levels. A large number of cases falling prey to respiratory tract infections, cold, flu and throat infection is reported to have increased as severe cold wave gripped the cities./During a survey conducted by media it was observed that nearly 400 patients on average with seasonal infection visited emergency wards and outdoor patients department (OPD) of public hospitals, rural health centers and basic health units of the city on daily basis. Medical experts believed that the Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) mostly caused the infections, which were common with start of winters and intensified with growing intensity of cold. They said that moisture in the atmosphere decreased during dryness in weather, creating smog, which brought the smoke and dust back to surface and caused infections.Health experts said that if proper care is not taken complications such as ear and sinus infections in case of cold and pneumonia in case of flu may occur./""Majority of patients visiting Tehsil headquarters hospital (THQ) Taxila during past one week was with complaints of upper and lower respiratory tract infections,"" said THQ chief Dr Mohammad Shahid while talking to media. He said that a large number of patients particularly children, suffering from chest and throat infections were coming to the hospital for treatment./""The common cold and flu in children should be taken seriously as they may lead to lower respiratory tract infections/including pneumonia,"" said Dr Shahid while stressing on the need of giving additional care to the health of children in dry and cold weather. He said that severe cold dry weather may trigger asthma in persons of all age groups. ""It is need of the hour to create awareness among public regarding protection from infections,"" he said./President Young Doctors Association (YDA) Taxila chapter Dr Imran Younas while talking to media said that more than 265,000 Pakistani children die each year of pneumonia, making it one of the leading killers of under five-year-old children in the country. He said that aged persons and children should avoid going outside in extreme weather conditions, especially at mornings and evenings. Prolonged exposure to cold may cause hypothermia and to avoid it, wearing warm clothes was a must. Dr Masood, incharge of pediatric department at local private hospital here said that his department received about 300 children each day suffering from some form of seasonal infection Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Rise in lung cancer cases worries docs,"ISLAMABAD, Dec. 15 -- Incidence of lung cancer that has always been the most deadly form of the disease is on the rise in Central India./More than 3% people affected by cancer suffer from it at present as opposed to 2% until just a couple of years back./This startling fact came to light in a recent study undertaken by Rashtrasant Tukdoji Regional Cancer Hospital, one of the 27 regional cancer hospitals in the country. The hospital has been keeping a track of cancer patients in the region since the last ten years. They are specifically observing the incidence of lung cancer for the past few years./""Globally lung cancer causes most cancer related deaths. Until recently, its incidence was not very high in India. However, in the last couple of years there has been a steady rise in the cases,"" informed Dr Shantanu Chaudhari, director of RSTRCH. He added that the scenario was the same in most developing countries./Dr BK Sharma, joint director of the hospital, said, ""This is one form of cancer that can be cautioned against since most people acquire it through smoking. Ninety percent of the males and 83 percent females get the disease because of smoking.""/The risk of developing cancer among smokers is proportional to consumption and duration they have been smoking, informed Dr SB Sapre, medical superintendent of the hospital. ""For example, compared to non-smokers those who consume up to 14 cigarettes a day are eight times more likely to die of lung cancer and those who smoke 25 or more sticks a day are 25 times more likely to do so,"" he explained./Another causative agent of lung cancer is radon, a radioactive gas found in abundance in uranium mines. ""Radon is also present in high amounts in cities as it is a naturally occurring gas even inside homes and offices. In fact, a study has found that around 9% cases of lung cancer in Europe can be ascribed to indoor exposure to radon,"" said surgeon Dr Prasanaa Joshi./Other factors that can be responsible for the disease include occupational exposure to carcinogens, indoor air pollution, alcohol, family history and previous cancer treatment./Though early detection helps in treatment, many factors often delay the detection. ""Many symptoms that may warn people of the presence of lung cancer, like cough, weight loss and anorexia are also experienced in tuberculosis./TB being a much prevalent infection in India, many times patients is treated for it before it is found that they are suffering from lung cancer. Long bouts of cough, therefore, necessitate the patients to be screened for lung cancer to be on the safer side,"" said oncologist Dr Pranay Taori Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Transporters to protest: Aging vehicles banned from Peshawar roads,"PESHAWAR, Jan. 27 -- The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday banned plying of all public transport vehicles older than nine years on the main roads of Peshawar city due to increasing traffic burden and smoke pollution and ordered the officials concerned to cancel route permits of those violating the rules./However, the transporters have warned of protest if the decision is not withdrawn immediately./The decision to ban old vehicles on the city roads was taken in a meeting chaired by Provincial Minister for Information and Transport Mian Iftikhar Hussain here./Regional Transport Authority (RTA) secretary Naseem Bacha told media that routes for the purpose had been classified and transporters informed accordingly./The secretary said that vehicles up to nine years age could ply on 'A' class route (main city roads), between nine and 11 years on 'B' class route and all the vehicles older than 11 years would be allowed only on 'C' class routes leading to the rural areas, where the people had less or no other option for transportation./Mr Bacha said that the government's decision was for the entire province, but initially it would be implemented in the provincial metropolis. He said that registration of new commercial vehicles had been stopped in the province till further orders, as the number of vehicles was increasing day by day and the roads could not accommodate the traffic burden./Presiding over the meeting, the minister directed the authorities concerned of traffic and police departments to strictly follow the orders and remove older vehicles from the city roads. He asked the officials to implement the decision for reducing pressure on the roads and getting rid of the increasing air pollution./Mr Hussain also ordered immediate crackdown on all illegal bus, van and truck stands in the city and said that no pressure should be accepted in this regard as no one was above the law./He said that all the relevant departments should coordinate their efforts to streamline the vehicular traffic system in Peshawar city.

He said that though the transport department had, in principle, agreed to lift ban on route permits, it would stay for some time. He said that the government was seriously contemplating ban on individual permit system to streamline the traffic in the province./He made it clear that in future new stands could be opened only with permission of the Provincial Transport Authority (PTA) and RTA./The commissioners, who are the honorary chairmen of RTAs, would be asked to take the minister and secretary transport on board to settle the issues concerning route permits etc in their respective areas of the province./Mr Hussain said that all the permits issued during the ban were illegal and ordered action against the officers responsible for the violation. He also asked the transporters to pay outstanding route permit and other fee to save themselves from being blacklisted./When contacted, Peshawar (traffic) SP Najeebur Rehman told media that in the first phase the buses plying between Haji Camp and Landi Kotal and Karkhano Market had been banned on the main city roads and asked to ply on the Ring Road. He said that most of the Ford Wagons were 1965 model and with implementation of the policy the people would get quality transport./However, he said that the transporters were not ready to cooperate in this regard./Urban Transport Union president Khan Zaman said that transporters would not accept the decision and in case the government did not withdraw it they would park all their vehicles outside the Chief Minister's House in protest. He said that the Ring Road did not suit the transporters, as there were no population and passengers on that route Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Pakistan: Air pollution raising asthma cases in Hyderabad,"HYDERABAD, May 12 -- The increasing air pollution and dust put the number of allergic asthmatic patients high in urban populace of Hyderabad and there is the need of formation of effective strategy to control/air pollution./Eminent Pulmonologist and Head of the Department of Pulmonology,/Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro Dr. Rashid/Ahmed Khan expressed his concern over increasing allergic asthmatic/disease in Hyderabad in an interview with this scribe on Friday./He said that smoke of increasing number of new and unfit vehicles as well as dust, rising because of development work, were the main reasons/for increasing allergic asthmatic among the residents of urban/localities./About symptoms, he informed that an attack may begin gradually; resulting in increasing respiratory distress and it could also begin dramatically with the onset of severe multiple symptoms such as tightness/in the chest, difficulties in breathing and coughing. Feelings of suffocation and difficulty in speaking could also occur, he added./He said that asthma attacks occur when the bronchi and bronchioles become inflamed, reducing the space through which air can travel through/the lungs and this causes the asthmatic to work harder to move air in/and out of the lungs. Dr. Rashid Ahmed said frequency of asthma attacks varies considerably among asthma patients and some people have daily attacks, while others can go months or even years without having an/attack./He said that asthma also occurs among those people who do not have allergies and in these persons, chemical irritants trigger an/inflammatory response that is initiated in a different way than in allergen-triggered asthma and for example, some people are sensitive/to certain common chemical irritants, such as perfume, hairspray,/cosmetics and household cleaners Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Pakistan: Air pollution growing dangerously,"ISLAMABAD, June 1 -- Urban air pollution remained one of the most significant environmental problems facing cities with its level increasing by two to six times, said the Economic Survey 2012./The Survey said that a substantial body of research demonstrated that high concentrations of suspended particulate matter adversely affected human health, prolonged a wide range of respiratory diseases and increased the probability of heart ailments.""When vehicular, industrial and pollution from power plants mixed with dust, the combination was deadly on/human health,"" said DG Pak-EPA Asif Shuja commenting on the findings of the Economic Survey./Several studies of air, water and noise pollution had been carried out by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA). In June 2011, Pak-EPA conducted a study to monitor the vehicular emissions in Islamabad. Vehicles were examined at 13 different locations of the capital./A total of 576 diesel, petrol and CNG driven vehicles were tested in 13 days. Nearly 43.5 per cent of the total vehicles tested were found noncompliant of National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS)./The level of Particulate Matter, which was mainly due to the combustion source, was reported to have reached an alarming level of 2 to 6 times higher than the safe limit. The safe limit of SPM, according to the National Environmental Quality Standards was 25 micron/m3 annual average./While Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in Islamabad was 87/cubicmilimeter, Lahore had the highest SPM at 153.5/cubicmilimeter, Karachi had 52.9/cubicmilimeter, in Peshawar it was 74.5/cubicmiliter whereas in Quetta it was 63.9/cubicmiliter./The DG, however, drew attention to an unusual phenomenon that was also confirmed by the Ministry of Natural Disaster Management was the blanket of dust over Pakistan including Islamabad in February and recently in April that dimmed the sun for couple of days. ""Islamabad like everywhere else in the country was experiencing cross boundary pollution. The dust had risen from desert countries in the Middle East, Iraq particularly and traveled all the way to this region. This increased/the average annual SPM drastically,"" the DG explained./Motorcycles and rickshaws, due to their two-stroke engines, were the most inefficient in burning fuel and contributed most to emissions./Two-stroke vehicles were responsible for emissions of fine inhale-able particles that settled in lungs and caused respiratory diseases. The dangerous 2-stroke vehicle industry was fast growing in Pakistan and had increased by 117 per cent in 2010-11 when compared with the year 2001-02./The DG explained how the Ministry of Petroleum had failed to meet the January 2012 deadline to convince refineries to install desulphurization plants and bring sulphur content in diesel from 0.5 per cent to 0.05 per cent. According to Asif Shuja Parco that provided 40 per cent of diesel supply in the country had a desulphurization plant. ""The country had no Motor Vehicular Examination system. All inspections were done manually and without proper instruments,"" said the DG./However, a senior official in the Ministry lamented that most of the projects under the Clear Air Programme were shelved/or delayed after devolution./""Donor funding suffered, most programmes approved by the Environment Council including banning plastic shopping bags countrywide have been put on hold and environment conservation has almost been shelved,"" the official added requesting anonymity.The Survey said that after devolution of the Ministry of Environment in June, 2011 the Ministry of Disaster Management took over the responsibilities of the environment sector at the federal level. Due to limited resources at its disposal, government efforts alone were insufficient to address challenges from climate change. A much larger participation and support from stakeholders including industry, civil society, and the public at large and donors was needed to effectively respond to climate issues Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Pakistan: Environmental pollution: rapidly growing threat to life,"LAHORE, June 3 -- Environmental pollution is rapidly/growing threat in Pakistan which is damaging to the natural/climate, human and wildlife and also the weather conditions./Highly inefficient energy use, accelerated growth in/vehicle population, increasing industrial activity without/adequate air emission treatment or control, open burning of/solid waste including plastic, use of ozone depleting/substances (ODSs), pressure horns,use of generators in/industries and CNG stations ,traffic noise from vehicles and/auto rickshaws and loud speakers are some of the major causes/of deterioration of ambient air quality as well as overall/climate./An official at District Environment Department stated that/rapidly growing energy demand, fuel substitution such as high/emitting coal and oil, brick Kilns, high-energy intensity were/the key factors contributing to air pollution./The state of air quality has been assessed by examining/the emission levels of air pollutants and ambient air quality./The average increase in sulphur dioxide across major/emitting sectors like industry, transport and power has been/23-fold over the past 25 years. Similarly, nitrogen oxides/increased to 25-fold in the power sector and carbon dioxide/increased an average of 4-fold. Pakistan's per capita/greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are far below the global/average./Ambient air quality data shows that carbon monoxide levels/in Karachi and Lahore considerably exceed WHO's recommended/levels while particulate matter content cross safety levels in/the major industrial cities in the Punjab province,the/official added./The reported lead levels in ambient air sites in Peshawar,/Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi are also quite high compared to/WHO's permissible levels./The health impacts of air, noise, water pollution and/productivity losses from deforestation and soil erosion have/been assessed at billions of rupees per year besides the/losses in terms of health care costs which is being affected/by the environmental pollution./To combat air pollution, the government has formulated/acts and policies, including the National Environment Action/Plan (NEAP). Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997/(PEPA-97) which covers air, water, soil and noise pollution,/including hazardous waste disposal and vehicular pollution./Its section 15, sub-sections 1 to 3, pertain to regulation/of motor vehicles. NEAP reflects a renewed commitment to/environment and focuses on taking immediate measures in four/priority areas of concerns including air, water, solid waste,/and ECO system management to achieve a visible improvement in/the quality of environment, including air./According to the District Environment department,thousands/of two stroke auto rickshaws are continuously damaging the/climate by emitting noise and contaminated smoke. The City/government in December 2005 after the recommendations by/Environment Protection Agency,Transport Department and other/government and private agencies had banned the use of two/stroke auto rickshaw and motorcycle rickshaw at roads due to/its damaging effect on environment and human and animal/health.Unfortunately,the rickshaw owners went on strike and/the then political government allowed them to run rickshaws/till the replacement of their rickshaws with 4 stroke CNG/rickshaw.That policy to give 4 stroke CNG rickshaws could not/be implemented effectively so far due to which thousands of 2/stroke rickshaws causing adding to the pollution are on roads/without any permit and payment of Excise fee to the/government./Another major issue causing the environmental pollution in/big cities is that the governments never implemented a proper/Master Plan for the mega cities like Lahore. The dumping sites/at various city locations could not be allocated to dump 7800/tonns of solid waste. The site allocated in Kahna,can not be/allowed to be used due to populous area which can be effected/severely by the pollution during the dumping of waste,the/environment department said./The management of private housing colonies and factories/are used to throw the waste in various drains and River Ravi/causing severe damages to the human and animal besides water/and environmental pollution./The Punjab capital,have large industrial areas that are/expanding without proper planning and master plan.

The assimilative capacity of the air is somewhat/greater than the public waters but yet air pollution is/becoming a pressing urban problem in Pakistan. This is/particularly so in areas where industrial activity is/concentrated or in our larger cities where the carbon monoxide/discharged by rickshaws and other vehicular traffic is posing/a great danger to human health./Air pollution and dusty atmosphere are the major causes of/increasing diseases like Asthma, various types of allergy like/nasal and skin, bronchitis, flu ,cough and throat infections./According to the health experts,noise pollution has severe/effects on both health and behavioral in human being.Every/unwanted sound mounting to the noise pollution can damage/physiological and psychological health. Noise pollution can/cause annoyance and aggression, hypertension, high stress/levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other/harmful effects.

Pakistan: Living near traffic pollution tied to heart deaths,"ISLAMABAD, June 9 -- Middle-aged and older adults who live near high traffic roads may have a heightened risk of dying from heart/disease but the odds seem to go down if they move to a less-traveled neighborhood, a new study finds./The findings do not prove that traffic pollution is the reason for/the excess heart disease deaths, researchers say. But they do add to evidence tying vehicle-produced pollutants to the risk of dying from/heart problems, Medical Today Reported./In May, the American Heart Association (AHA) released a report/stating that recent studies have ""substantially strengthened"" the/evidence that air pollution from traffic, industry and power generation/is a risk factor for heart attack, stroke and deaths from cardiovascular causes. The evidence most strongly points to particles known as fine particulate matter, which is produced from burning gasoline and other/fossil fuels./The AHA recommends that people with established heart disease and other at-risk individuals including the elderly and people with risk/factors for heart disease, like diabetes and high blood pressure try/to limit their exposure to congested roadways and spend less time outside/on days when air quality is poorer./For this latest study, Wen Qi Gan and colleagues at the University/of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, analyzed data on more than/450,000 Vancouver-area residents between the ages of 45 and 85./They found that over nine years, residents who consistently lived within roughly 500 feet of a highway or within 165 feet of a major road/were more likely to die of heart disease than those who lived farther/from high-traffic roadways./But the researchers also found ""two new twists"" to what's been known about the relationship between traffic and heart disease deaths,/explained senior researcher Dr. Michael Brauer, a professor of/environmental health at the university./That is, the risk of heart disease death declined among residents/who moved away from high-traffic roads during the study period, while/it increased among those who moved closer to congested roads./""It's sort of like what we see with smoking cessation,"" Brauer said/in an interview. ""The associated disease risks are lower in former/smokers,"" compared with persistent smokers./The findings are based on 450,283 middle-aged and older adults/with no known heart disease at the outset. Nearly 53,000 persistently/lived within 500 feet of a highway or 165 feet of a major road over the nine-year study./Of those residents, 607 or just over 1 percent died of heart disease during that period; that compared with 0.7 percent of the more than/328,000 people who persistently lived farther from traffic./The researchers were able to account for a number of other factors that could explain any connection between living near major roads and/having a higher risk of dying from heart disease including residents'/age, neighborhood income levels and any diagnoses of diabetes or major/lung disease./They found that living near a highway or major road was still linked to a 29 percent higher risk of heart disease death, versus living farther away. Among people who either moved away from or closer to a major road,/the risk of heart disease death was also somewhat elevated but lower/when compared with residents who persistently lived near busy roads./In addition, the researchers used air pollution data to show that people living close to highways and major roads would have been exposed/to higher levels of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and other traffic-related pollutants./The findings do not prove that air pollution was the reason for/the higher risks. Brauer said that traffic noise, for example, might/be involved. In addition, the researchers had no information on certain/key factors in heart disease risk, including people's smoking habits/and weight./However, a body of research has now linked air pollution exposure/to the risk of heart disease death, Brauer pointed out.

"Pakistan: Coal, wood burning kills more people than malaria","ISLAMABAD, June 26 -- Burning coal, wood or charcoal for cooking kills two million people worldwide, each year - more than malaria, says a study./Energy poverty, which is about limited access to clean sources of energy, is practically driving half the global population to rely on such smoke producing sources of fuel, probably the biggest source of indoor pollution, says Hisham Zerriffi, who led the study./These findings were presented at the 2012 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Vancouver, Canada./""Energy poverty is one of the biggest human welfare issues of our day. We're talking about more people who die each year from cooking than from malaria,"" says Hisham Zerriffi, assistant professor at the Liu Institute for Global Issues, University of British Columbia./It is often women and children who have to bear the brunt of indoor air pollution, and who carry the burden of collecting fuel to burn, says Zerriffi./Beyond health and gender equity implications, burning biomass is also tied with carbon emissions and climate change, according to a British Columbia statement./Despite the availability of technology that can burn a variety of fuels more efficiently, governments, for-profit businesses and NGOs have made little progress in getting individuals to switch to improved cook stoves and modern fuels, adds Zerriffi./""We need to combine new technologies with smart policies,"" Zerriffi says. ""We need to help create viable markets, encourage households to switch to new stoves, and fix some of the gaps in funding, especially for those at the lowest end of the income scale."" ""It's a complicated problem because governments can't afford to hand out improved cook stoves to a continually growing population, and the private sector needs to recover its costs so they can continue to distribute more stoves,"" he says./When the private sector got into the cook stove business a few years ago, it looked as if this could be a successful solution./Today, these businesses are having trouble.

Pakistan: Car pollution puts child health at risk,"Sydney, July 24 -- Car pollution is creating asthma-like symptoms in otherwise healthy children, and potentially affecting their lung growth, according to a report that suggests Australia's air-quality standards should be upgraded./A study of 2860 primary school children representing most states revealed nitrogen dioxide (NO2), found in motor vehicle exhaust, was present in the lungs of two thirds of the students tested at the 55 sample schools. The schools were chosen near to air quality testing stations, so results could be cross-checked with daily pollutant levels./In the cases where NO2 was detected in children's lungs, the researchers consistently found those children experienced ''asthma-like'' symptoms, including ''wheeze''. Their lung volume was reduced and their airways inflamed. Researchers concluded the NO2 was not producing typical asthma, but a non-specific lung effect, which did not improve with asthma medication. ''Although air pollution levels are relatively low in most regions of Australia, they may not be low enough to prevent adverse health effects,'' the report warned./The study found children inhaled and retained more air pollution per unit of body weight than adults, partly because they played outdoors, and that pollution had a greater impact on children because their lungs were still developing. While the impacts measured were small, long-term exposure to NO2 could affect them into adult life, the report warned./National Environment Protection Council commissioned the Australian Child Health and Air Pollution Study, partly to fill gaps in scientific knowledge on the effect of local pollutants on children. It was designed to contribute to the National Environment Protection Measure standards review which was to be updated by 2008 but has been delayed. The council comprises state and federal environment ministers, and sets the standards./The report called for major reductions in particulate matter (airborne fine particles of soot), carbon dioxide, NO2 and ozone, saying there were many pollutants without a safe ''threshold''. The report suggested this be done by limiting motor vehicle emissions, investing in more public transport and through better urban design./Doctors for the Environment Australia spokeswoman Marion Carey criticised the time taken to review the air standards./''We have enough information now to act,'' Dr Carey said. ''We should be translating this knowledge into practical policy and action to protect everyone's health, especially our children's.''/Among children studied, 270 with asthma were asked to keep a diary of their respiratory health. The diaries showed children with asthma had increased coughing, wheezing and medication use when exposed to NO2. They were also affected by carbon dioxide, and particulate matter./Asthma Foundation figures show that one in nine children and one in 10 adults suffer from asthma./Asthma Foundation NSW chief executive officer Michele Goldman said Australia's air monitoring was 10 years behind the rest of the world despite compelling evidence of harm./""Studies have shown that children constantly exposed to cigarette smoke or traffic fumes are three times more likely to develop asthma,"" she said./Lucas Dew, 10, of Newport, had his first ambulance trip with an asthma attack four years ago and has had three since. His father, Simon Dew, said there was only one mild asthma case in the family before Lucas, and he believes nearby factories, including the Newport power station and Mobil at Altona, which both emit NO2, may be a factor in his son's condition./The study's principal investigator, Professor Gail Williams, and co-investigator Professor Guy Marks refused to discuss the findings until the report's official release next month Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution increases heart risk,"ISLAMABAD, July 27 -- High-pollution days may trigger heart attacks in some people, elderly and people with existing heart or lung disease are most vulnerable./It is recommended that people with heart disease and others at risk-/including the elderly and people with diabetes or high blood pressure-stay/clear of congested roadways and spend less time outside on days when air quality is poor, Health News reported./The evidence of harm is strongest against pollutants known as fine/particulate matter./Fine particulate matter is released into the air when wood or fossil fuels are burned, so car exhaust, home heating and industrial sources/like power plants all contribute./The particles are small enough that they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs./The researchers suspected they may trigger heart attacks in vulnerable/people by causing inflammation in the blood vessels and irritating the nerves of the lungs./For this study, researchers looked at data on 11,450 hospitalisations for heart attack between 2006 and 2009. They used local air-quality monitors to see how those hospitalisations correlated with changes in air pollution levels./Overall, it was found that for each fine-particle increase of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air, heart attack hospitalizations inched up 0.01 percent over the next two days. There was a similar pattern when the researchers looked at two/other traffic pollutants: carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide./The association between pollution spikes and heart attack was strongest among the elderly (people aged 75 years or older), those with the lung diseases (like emphysema or chronic bronchitis), and those with high blood pressure./The findings alone do not prove that air pollution, itself, triggers heart attacks, but they do add to other studies that have found a similar link Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Replacement of water lines PHC warns of freezing govt funds over defiance,"PESHAWAR, Aug. 15 -- The Peshawar High Court on Monday expressed annoyance at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government's failure to act upon its orders for replacement of broken water pipes and installation of incinerators in the province, and warned to freeze its development funds over further non-compliance of the said orders./A bench comprising Chief Justice Dost Mohammad Khan and Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth directed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) director general Dr Mohammad Bashir and additional advocate general Naveed Akhtar to ensure implementation of the said orders by Sept 18./The bench told Dr Bashir that a member of the court's inspection team would accompany him to check all pipes of drinking water in the provincial capital and submit report to the court about progress on its replacement as per order of the court.The chief justice regretted that from time to time they had been issuing orders related to environmental degradation but the relevant authorities had become indifferent towards the court orders./The bench observed that the secretaries of transport, irrigation, public health engineering, planning and development and local bodies departments and the EPA director general should pay heed to the orders of the court otherwise the court would be left with no other option but to freeze their development funds./It observed that if any death occurred due to the non-implementation of the court orders, then the relevant official would be punished for that./Last year, the court had taken suo motu notice of the environmental degradation in the provincial capital and other cities and issued a detailed order on June 16, 2011. It had directed the provincial government to replace all broken drinking water pipes/within six months and to install incinerators at proper places across the province for proper waste disposal. It had also asked traffic police to impound all those vehicles emitting excessive smoke, causing severe air pollution./In Nov 2011, the court had ordered the government to restore the historical significance of Shahi Bagh by removing all the unnecessary structures constructed over it./It had directed the provincial chief secretary to convene a special meeting of the secretaries under his control and a detailed agenda be formulated for the meeting to address the hostile mischief posing threat to human life./Dr Bashir, who appeared on court's notice, had to face difficult time in convincing the court that his department had taken several steps in accordance with the court orders. He stated that so far they had issued notices to medical superintendents of 10 hospitals for improper disposal of hospital wastes./He said a notice had also been issued to an executive engineer of the irrigation department for non-sanitation of canals. He added that fine was imposed on four town councils for improper sanitation facilities in respective towns./The chief justice asked Dr Bashir what step they had taken to check pollution in the Kohat Tunnel as its exhaust system was non-functional. He observed that the court had taken notice of the issue as thousands of vehicles had daily been passing through said tunnel and now the exhaust systems had been installed by the government./The chief justice said it was primarily the responsibility of EPA to take notice of such like issues./The bench also directed the DG that all brick kilns emitting smoke through exhaust pipes, should be checked along with other industries emitting similar smoke and proper safeguards should be adopted, making it compulsory for them to install and cap it with filtration equipments so that the air pollution so caused was prevented to the maximum./The court directed AAG Naveed Akhtar to provide updated position about the historical Shahi Bagh as the court had in clear terms ordered that all the unnecessary structures and encroachments should be positively removed from the park Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Sindh lagging behind in social and health indicators: report,"KARACHI, Oct. 8 -- Sindh is lagging behind the rest of the country in health indicators, revealed an analysis carried out by the health department for the newly launched Sindh Health Sector Strategy (2012-2020)./The health department had carried out an evidence-based situational analysis from September to November 2011 for the eight-year health plan announced on Thursday. The report presents an overview of the current health situation and also points out the weak areas in the operational health system./According to the evidence-based report, detection of tuberculosis has reached 59 per cent in Sindh, while it was 70 per cent in the rest of the country. The prevalence of Hepatitis B and C remained a major concern while around 52 per cent of the total HIV cases have been reported from Sindh, particularly the urban areas./In children's health, Sindh has the highest rate of undernourished children, 40 per cent. The report adds that 62 per cent mothers in the province are also undernourished and 73 per cent children anaemic, while food insecurity is as high as 72 per cent./Giving an overview of the health conditions across the province, the report stats that only 27 per cent childbirths take place in proper health facilities, 70 per cent children below the age of one year are immunised for measles, 11 per cent couples of child-bearing age practice contraception, while 22 per cent people in Sindh use public sector health facilities as compared to 29 per cent in the rest of the country./The report also highlights an alarming trend in illnesses in urban areas. According to it, non-communicable diseases in Sindh are endemic to economically productive adults and account for 56 per cent of the total number of patients./The number of patients in urban areas is higher in Sindh as compared to other provinces since the urban areas are more heavily populated here than the rest of the country. The most prevalent condition is said to be the ischemic heart disease, followed by mental health disorders and trauma, while chronic obstructive lung diseases and various forms of cancers make up the remaining percentage. The analysis also reveals that non-communicable diseases mostly affect the urban poor and also have an earlier age of onset./""Karachi has one of the highest global rates of particulate air pollution and breast cancer,"" says the report. ""Despite high prevalence levels most of the patients are unaware of the onset of diseases which were also inappropriately controlled.""/The report also sheds light on some specific problems which need to be addressed. It called for special focus on nutrition, polio and prevalence of non-communicable diseases and strengthening of district health networks. ""Provision of maternal and child health services, contraception, vaccination and communicable disease control is patchy because of poorly functional basic and emergency services,"" it reads./In the report, the lady health workers programme (LHWP) is referred to as a flagship programme of the Sindh health department for community intervention, while observing that it covers between 20 and 43 per cent areas in certain districts. However, the LHWs neither have proper technical knowledge nor are they properly supervised./The analysis also refers to human resource deployment in the province and stated that the deployment, retention and capacity of staff was sub-optimal in rural areas, especially when it comes to female staff./The report also calls the provision of basic medicines in public sector health facilities 'poor'. This is also endorsed by various stakeholders who also called for concerted action on maternal, newborn and child health programme, nutrition and non-communicable diseases, among other fields./According to Kiran Nauman, the additional secretary of the health department and chief of the Health Reforms Support Unit established by it, introduction of family health cards for free consultation services and drugs, and subsidised charges for diagnostic support for the lower-income groups has also been planned under the newly evolved health strategy./Moreover, primary and secondary control of non-communicable diseases and lifestyle support in urban townships would also be streamlined, she added Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Pollution May Cause 40 Percent of Global Deaths: Survey,"ISLAMABAD, Oct. 20 -- Water, air and soil pollution, along with/other environmental factors, contribute to 40 percent of deaths worldwide each year, a new study concludes./In a review of research into the effects of environmental pollutants/and other sources of environmental degradation, Cornell University ecologist/David Pimentel estimates that 62 million deaths per year (40 percent of all/that occur) can be attributed to environmental factors, particularly organic/and chemical pollutants that accumulate in the air we breathe and the water we drink, LiveScience Reported./Though scientists and organizations such as the United Nations and the/World Health Organization have begun keeping tabs on the role environmental/pollution plays and were aware of the enormous impact that some pollutants/have, ""we were surprised with the number,"" Pimentel said./This ""suggests the importance of the environment as it's related to our deaths,"" he told LiveScience./With an estimated 1.1 billion people in the world lacking access to/clean water (according to WHO estimates), it is little wonder that waterborne infections account for 80 percent of all infectious diseases in the world./""Water is one of the major concerns, without any question,"" Pimentel said, because everyone must use it for drinking, cooking, washing and bathing./Water contaminated with untreated sewage and fecal matter can facilitate the transmission of diarrheal diseases such as cholera (bacteria that live in feces), intestinal infections (which can compound health issues by causing malnutrition) and other diseases-all of which kill millions every year, especially children./A 2004 study by the Population Resource Center found that 2.2 million/infants and children die each year from diarrhea, caused largely by contaminated water and food./According to their estimates, polluted water in Africa and India causes 1.4 million deaths each year as a result of diarrheal diseases such as cholera and dysentery./""Water sanitation and hygiene are, considered globally, one of the big, big causes of disease,"" said WHO scientist Annette Pr ss-?st n./Most of the problems from contaminated water are an issue in developing countries, where there is little infrastructure to deal with sewage and other water sanitation issues-people in developing countries dump 95 percent of their untreated urban sewage into the same lakes and rivers they use for drinking and bathing, according to the United Nations./""While in many countries there is still [a] water supply, proper disposal and treatment of sewage is a little bit less common in developing countries,"" Pr ss-?st n said./In India, for example, only a handful of cities have water treatment/facilities, according to Pimentel./""It's a challenge just to get clean water,"" he said. Air pollution is/another big killer. The WHO ranks it as the eighth most important risk in the burden of disease and deems it responsible for 3 million deaths each year through diseases such as pneumonia, chronic bronchitis and lung cancer./In developing countries, indoor air pollution is a major problem because most people rely on open stoves fueled by dung, wood, crop waste or coal to cook and heat poorly-ventilated homes./A little more than half of the world's households use these solid fuels for cooking, ""which is huge,"" Pr ss-?st n said. The smoke from these stoves accumulates in abodes, exposing those inside-mainly women and children-to the hazardous pollutants released from the fuel./""In some houses you enter into the kitchen, and even though you might even have a permanent opening in the house . you can hardly see . the wall on the other side, so thick is the smoke,"" Pr ss-?st n said./More than 200 different chemicals can be found in the smoke, and 14 of them are known carcinogens, Pimentel said. Every year, this indoor air pollution kills 1.6 million people (or one person every 20 seconds), according to the WHO./Outdoor air pollution, on the other hand, accounts for some 800,000 deaths per year-about half as many as for indoor air-because the pollutants are much less concentrated./""Indoor air pollution can be 100 times more concentrated,"" Pr ss-?st n/said. ""There's really a big difference.""But outdoor air pollution still impacts health-both in developing countries and cities in the developed world-through chronic respiratory problems, acute problems (such as asthma) in children and ""a long list of cardiopulmonary diseases in adults,"" Pr ss-?st n said Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Vaccine alone 'will not be enough',"ISLAMABAD, Nov. 11 -- Despite the great potential of pneumococcal vaccine, pneumonia will remain a major threat to children under 5 years of age, unless a comprehensive approach is taken, according to the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union)./""It is certainly encouraging to see child mortality falling globally,"" says Dr. Steve Graham of The Union's Child Lung Health Division, ""but pneumonia remains the commonest single cause of death in infants and young children. Pneumococcal vaccine is an important intervention that has great potential in high child-mortality settings. However, tackling pneumonia is a complex issue that requires a more comprehensive approach than a single vaccine,"" he states in a press release./The fact that pneumonia is caused by a wide range of pathogens is one of the challenges. The pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the major cause of deaths due to bacterial pneumonia worldwide, so it has the potential to successfully reduce cases of child pneumonia and pneumonia-related deaths. The vaccine will also be an important tool for protecting populations who do not have easy access to effective health care./However, pneumonia-related deaths in infants and children will continue to occur, including those due to non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, other common bacteria and viruses. In low- and middle-income countries, where 99% of the 1.5 million deaths from child pneumonia occur each year, a variety of other factors also contribute to high case fatality rates. These are lack of access to health care; lack of standard case management and rational use of antibiotics; malnutrition; and HIV infection./To more fully address child pneumonia in all settings, The Union therefore recommends a balanced and comprehensive approach that emphasizes other preventive strategies, as well as vaccine: nutrition and breastfeeding, reduction in indoor air pollution, hand washing and improved case management. Curative interventions include addressing the rising rates of bacterial resistance; models of community care; the role of zinc; focus on the needs of high-risk patients, such as those who are malnourished or HIV-infected and infants; as well as wider availability of oxygen therapy and other methods of respiratory support Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Pneumonia number one killer of children,"ISLAMABAD, Nov. 12 -- Pneumonia being the leading cause of death in children kills an estimated 1.4 million children under the age of five every year worldwide. Every year, it accounts for 18 per cent of all deaths of children below five years of age, which is more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. Out of these, 99 per cent of deaths occur in developing countries./In Pakistan, more than 352,000 children die before their fifth birthday every year and almost one third of these deaths are due to pneumonia. If not all, at least 70 per cent of these deaths can be avoided with the help of in time management of the cases. There is a need to create awareness among public that pneumonia can easily be avoided through prevention and it is curable./Professor and Head of Community Medicine at CMH Lahore Medical College Dr. Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry expressed this while talking to 'media' in connection with World Pneumonia Day, which is observed every year on November 12 around the globe. The theme of the day this year is: 'Fight Pneumonia: Save a Child'./He added that the day is observed with an aim to raise awareness of pneumonia as a public health issue and help prevent millions of avoidable deaths from pneumonia that occur each year. ""World Pneumonia Day is an opportunity to remind our leaders that the lives of babies and children are too important to be discounted,"" said Dr. Ashraf./Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. It is caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi (germs). The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a child's nose or throat can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne drops from a cough or sneeze./Studies reveal that children whose immune systems are compromised are at higher risk of developing pneumonia. A child's immune system may be weakened by malnutrition or under nourishment, especially in infants who are not exclusively breastfed, said Dr. Ashraf./He added that HIV infections and measles also increase child's risk of contracting pneumonia. Environmental factors such as indoor air pollution caused by cooking fires and heating with biomass fuels (such as wood or dung), living in crowded homes and parental smoking also increase a child's susceptibility to pneumonia, he said./He believes that ignoring early signs of pneumonia can be death sentence. ""The symptoms of pneumonia include rapid or fast breathing, cough, fever, chills, loss of appetite, wheezing, and lower chest wall in drawing while severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience convulsions.""/To a query, Dr. Ashraf said that the good news is that pneumonia is preventable and treatable with host of proven interventions including exclusive breastfeeding to infants in their six months of life, ensuring an environment free of indoor air pollution and promoting frequent hand washing (protection); immunizing against leading causes (prevention); and ensuring access to medical care and antibiotics when cases do emerge (treatment)./He added that limiting exposure to smoke from cigarettes or indoor cook stoves and fires can help limit the risk of pneumonia. Research has shown that hand washing with soap and water can reduce the number of pneumonia-related infections in children under the age of five by more than 50 per cent, he said./He added that immunizing against Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine), pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia. ""The government of Pakistan has recently included pneumococcal vaccine in Expanded Program on Immunization and all parents having infants below six weeks of age can now get their children immunized against pneumonia free of cost.""/Dr. Ashraf said that pneumonia can be treated with antibiotics but only 30 per cent of the children receive antibiotics when needed. ""Pneumonia-related child deaths can be reduced by 70 per cent by managing cases of pneumonia in children with antibiotics at the community level."" He said that Lady Health Workers can be trained to assess signs of pneumonia, determine appropriate treatment and advice parents, administer antibiotics and provide home care. The LHWs can also refer sick children to a healthcare facility if complications arise./He added that children suffering from pneumonia can be treated promptly and effectively with antibiotics, however, overuse of antibiotics should be avoided in order to curb microbial resistance and children with upper respiratory tract infections (mainly coughs and colds) should not be prescribed unnecessary antibiotics. Similarly indiscriminate use of cough medicines should also be reduced./Prevention and proper treatment of pneumonia could avert one million deaths in children every year while with proper treatment alone, over 600,000 deaths could be avoided, concluded Dr. Ashraf Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: UN and partners call for ending pneumonia -- the biggest killer of children,"UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 14 -- The United Nations and its partners have called for greater efforts to eradicate pneumonia, the number one killer of children under the age of five, as they marked the fourth annual World Pneumonia Day. ""We can't have the reductions in child mortality that we envisage without a concentrated, direct attack on the biggest enemy that children face,"" said the Chief of Health for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), Mickey Chopra. /The Day seeks to raise awareness of pneumonia as a public health issue and help prevent the millions of avoidable child deaths from the disease that occur each year. According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia, which is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs, kills an estimated 1.2 million children under the age of five years every year, more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. A recent report by the UN Commission on Life-Saving Commodities for Women and Children, which is led by UNICEF and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), estimates that 1.56 million lives can be saved in five years by increasing the availability of the antibiotic amoxicillin, which costs about $0.30 per dose. Worldwide, vaccination coverage for pneumonia is at about 85 per cent, yet the poorest often miss out, according to UNICEF, which adds that unsanitary, overcrowded living conditions and lack of knowledge of how to protect themselves increase their vulnerability. Governments have to take the threat of pneumonia seriously and provide adequate vaccines, diagnostic services, treatment and healthcare, especially among the poorest, or this scourge will continue to rob the world of its children at the rate of almost 3,400 per day. This is unacceptable, Dr. Chopra said. The failure to tackle pneumonia is a double failure, he added. ""Not only are we allowing a treatable and preventable disease to wipe out over a million children a year, we are leaving to its mercy the very people who need help the most, the poorest of the poor."" World Pneumonia Day is organized by the Global Coalition against Child Pneumonia, a network of more than 140 non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academic institutions, government agencies and foundations, including UN agencies. According to the Coalition, national leaders and donors must prioritize efforts and investments in proven interventions, including access to vaccines, proper antibiotic treatment, and improved sanitation, as well as the promotion of practices such as exclusive breastfeeding, frequent hand washing, and the use of clean cooking stoves to reduce indoor air pollution. Several of these interventions also help address the second leading killer of children diarrhoea. ""We know what to do, and we have made great progress, but we must do more. We must scale-up proven solutions and ensure they reach every child in need,"" said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who spearheads Every Woman Every Child, an umbrella movement that has leveraged more than $20 billion in new money for women's and children's health and aims to save 16 million lives by 2015 Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Smoking up to four cigarettes daily causes irreversible lung damage: experts,"KARACHI, Nov. 16 -- Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease), which is a disabling disease of the lungs causing severe limitation of day-to-day activities./There is a need to raise awareness about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and proper COPD care throughout the world, said pulmonologists at a seminar on the eve of World COPD Day 2012, observed all over the world on Wednesday, November 14 around the world including Pakistan./This year the theme of World COPD Day is, ""It's Not Too Late"", a theme that was echoed by experts during the seminar organized by Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases of Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS), a tertiary care hospital providing services free of cost to all suffering from lung diseases./Speaking on the occasion, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Masroor, Director, Ojha Institute, said that COPD affected more than 65 million people worldwide and was the fourth leading cause of death, after cerebro-vascular, heart, and infectious diseases./Although the incidence of COPD was increasing, it was widely under-diagnosed and under-treated in Pakistan, he said, adding that smoking was by far the most important risk factor./He suggested strict measures to ban on smoking, the chief cause of COPD./Dr Nisar Rao, Associate Professor, Ojha Institute, said that even smoking one to four cigarettes daily for few years was sufficient to cause irreversible damage to the lungs./Unfortunately most patients in Pakistan came to their doctors when it was too late, when severe damage to lungs had already been done. The best way to prevent this disease was to avoid smoking altogether./Regular smokers should seek help from their doctors who could guide them in quitting smoking by using modern quit-smoking medicines, he said./Dr Faisal Zubairi, Assistant Professor, Ojha Institute, said the use of solid fuel like wood and coal in cooking is another important cause for this disease in women living in our rural areas./He urged the government to take measures for the implementation of clean air laws in the country as COPD could also occur from exposure to second hand smoke./The early symptom of this disease is persistent cough accompanied with sputum followed by shortness of breath.

Pakistan: 'Pneumonia among children should be taken seriously',"KARACHI, Nov. 18 -- Every year millions of children die of pneumonia globally followed by diarrhoea and malaria globally./This was stated by Dr Ayesha Mehnaz, head of the department of paediatrics, Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS), Karachi, at a seminar titled ""Pneumonia and middle ear infection among children"", at a local hotel on Thursday./The seminar was held under the aegis of the Mir Khalil-ur-Rehman memorial Society (MKMS)./She said a major cause of this was malnutrition, and that while a greater number of pneumonia cases among children were reported during winter, more or less it prevailed all year round./Major causes of this were inhalation, especially the pollution-riddled air that was the curse of the big overpopulated cities, and overcrowded places. Besides, she said, kissing and cuddling of children by a whole lot of people also was a major cause./Children, she said, were brought to hospital when it was a hopeless case./""The best way to reduce/prevent pneumonia among children is to ensure against malnutrition,"" Dr Mehnaz said, adding that another very important measure was breast-feeding. She was dead set against breast-feeding substitutes and special milk preparations for children marketed by multinationals, and said that these preparations were no substitute for mother's milk./However, she laid special emphasis on immunisation. In this regard, she mentioned the haemophilis influenza vaccine, and the pneumococcal vaccine and said that the latter could reduce child deaths by 70-80 percent./In this context, Dr Mehnaz cited the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) where these vaccines were to be administered free of cost. She exhorted the people to make use of the facility./She also mentioned the latest development in pharmacy, the six-in-one vaccine that is supposed to give immunisation to the child against six diseases./Talking about other diseases among children, she said that right now there were only three countries where there was incidence polio, namely, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan./Among other things, s Dr Mehnaz recommended balanced diet, vaccination (vaccine should never be interrupted as that could cause the germs or bacteria to become immune to the vaccine, rendering it ineffective), regular administration of zinc supplements, mother's diet should be wholesome and balanced, lots of fluids, and maximum eradication of air pollution./Dr Inkisar Ali of the Liaquat College of Medicine and Dentistry said that 115.8 million children in South Asia suffered from Middle Ear Infection (Otitis Media). Among the many causes, he said, were exposure to cigarette-smoking and various kinds of viruses and allergies./He said that mother's milk was the best remedy against attacks by viruses. He said that menegitis could also lead to hearing problems. He said that the latest development in the field of pharmaceuticals was the six-in one vaccine which also ensured against Otitis Media./Use of antibiotics, Dr Ali said, should be minimum. He said chances of Otitis Media were very high in daycare centres for children. He said that chances of Otitis Media were maximum among children aged up to six months and next came children between six months and three years./Sanober from the pharmaceutical Glaxo-Smith-Kline (GSK) stressed the need for immunisation against pneumonia and Otitis Media./Earlier, Wasif Nagi, said that it was regrettable that the media was just concentrating on political issues and there was nothing about the most vital public health issues like air pollution, lack of potable water, and lack of hygiene.

Pakistan: Pakistan Chest Society marks World COPD Day,"ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19 -- The Federal Chapter of the Pakistan Chest Society (PCS) organised a seminar for specialist doctors, general practitioners and other health professionals to commemorate the World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day here in a local hotel on Saturday./The World COPD Day was celebrated throughout the world on November 14. In this connection, the PCS-Federal is celebrating a week of activities and the seminar was held in the same connection on Saturday./President of the Federal Chapter of PCS Head of Department of Pulmonology at Military Hospital and Advisor to Pakistan Army on Pulmonology, Major General Badshah Zaidi, welcomed the participants of the seminar and introduced the topics to be presented./He informed the participants that the COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. It is predicted that the COPD may become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030 without intervention. The COPD is not one single disease but an umbrella term used to describe chronic lung diseases that cause limitations in lung airflow and difficulty in breathing, said Dr Badshah./It is important that the more familiar terms chronic bronchitis and emphysema are no longer used, but are now included within the COPD diagnosis. The term 'chronic bronchitis' has been used excessively in Pakistan for many lung diseases without clear definition of their cause./The major causes and risk factors of COPD are tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution such as biomass fuel like wood and dung patties used for cooking and heating, outdoor air pollution and occupational dusts and chemicals including vapours, irritants, and fumes./Speaking on the occasion, National Delegate of Pakistan to European Respiratory Society, Dr Naghman Bashir, introduced the history of smoking. He said that tobacco has been used by Mayans in Mexico as early as 5000 BC. Christopher Columbus discovered America and native Indians smoking tobacco in much the same way it is being smoked today. He brought it to Europe from where it spread to the rest of the world./Dr Naghman said that the bad effects of tobacco were identified quite early and death penalty for smokers was imposed in Mongolia, Turkey, and Russia in 1633 and 1634. However organised advertising, starting in 1606, and improved refined forms of tobacco increased its consumption./He added that after World Wars-I & II, the cigarette and cigar consumption jumped exponentially, and so did incidence of lung cancer. In 1950 medical journals published research conclusively linking smoking with lung cancer. Despite strong anti tobacco campaigns, bans on indoor smoking and public education, the menace is increasing, he said./Professor of Medicine and Pulmonology at MH, Brigadier Dr Babar Cheema, presented a detailed overview of the COPD, both globally as well as in Pakistan. He gave the information that Pakistan is the fifth leading country in the world suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He said that in Pakistan it might climb to number three if the risk factors, particularly smoking, were not immediately controlled, fearing that the death toll due to the COPD might be higher due to other diseases within the next two decades./He dispelled the myths that casual smoking is harmless, and people should be aware that even smoking between one to four cigarettes daily could cause lung cancer. It is very unfortunate that Pakistan has one of the highest rates of adolescents taking to smoking. It is estimated that as many as 50 per cent of the Pakistani youth may be addicted to tobacco, while 11 per cent of the females smoke sheesha. Studies have shown that smoking sheesha for one hour is equal to smoking 100 cigarettes./The last presentation was by Consultant Pulmonologist in KRL General Hospital and Shifa International Hospital, Dr Kaleem Ullah Toori who said that the management of the COPD involves pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures. There is fixed obstructive airway defect, which is incurable. All treatment measures are aimed at symptom control and improvement of the long-term patient survival, he said./He added that symptom control is achieved with pharmacological agents that include various types of bronchodilators and steroids. The preferred route of administration of these agents is via inhalation Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Thirdhand smoke, a big health hazard","ISLAMABAD, Dec. 2 -- A new study suggested that ''thirdhand smoke''- the invisible remains of cigarette smoke that deposits on carpeting, clothing, furniture and other surfaces- may be even more of a health hazard than previously thought./The study has extended the known health risks of tobacco among people who do not smoke but encounter the smoke exhaled by smokers or released by smoldering cigarette butts./Yael Dubowski and colleagues noted that thirdhand smoke is a newly recognized contributor to the health risks of tobacco and indoor air pollution./Studies show that that nicotine in thirdhand smoke can react with the ozone in indoor air and surfaces like clothing and furniture, to form other pollutants. Exposure to them can occur to babies crawling on the carpet, people napping on the sofa, or people eating food tainted by thirdhand smoke./In an effort to learn more about thirdhand smoke, the scientists studied interactions between nicotine and indoor air on a variety of different materials, including cellulose (a component of wood furniture), cotton, and paper to simulate typical indoor surfaces./They found that nicotine interacts with ozone, in indoor air, to form potentially toxic pollutants on these surfaces./""Given the toxicity of some of the identified products and that small particles may contribute to adverse health effects, the present study indicates that exposure to (thirdhand smoke) may pose additional health risks,"" noted the article Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Alarm sounded about killer lung disease,"Rawalpindi, Dec. 13 -- Health experts attending a seminar on 'Chronic Diseases of Lungs and Their Preventions' held here on Tuesday sounded alarm about an impending Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) crisis, which they insisted would be the third major cause of human deaths worldwide by the end of the current decade./The seminar was organised by the Mir Khalil-ur-Rehman Memorial Society (MKRMS) of the Jang Group of Newspapers./According to Dr. Shazli Manzoor of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Department at the Quaid-i-Azam International Hospital, Rawalpindi, the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) caused by an abnormal inflammatory response within the lungs to noxious particles or gases was the sixth major reason of human mortality in 1990, but it would become the third biggest killer disease by 2020./Others on the major killer disease list are Ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infection, diarrhoeal disease and prenatal disorder./In the presentation on 'Signs, Symptoms and Curative Factors of COPD', Dr. Shazli Manzoor said that the lung disease was characterised by progressive and not fully reversible chronic airflow limitation, resulting from the occurrence of inflammation of the larger airways (chronic bronchitis) and destruction of the smaller airways (emphysema)./He said that around two-thirds of COPD sufferers reported difficulty in the simplest of every day activities such as being out of breath after walking up stairs, while eight in 10 patients were short of breath at least a few days or a week./The pulmonologist said that 50% of COPD patients awoke at night as a result of coughing, wheezing or breathlessness and that one-third of patients had difficulty in breathing while sitting or lying still or were breathless while talking. He said COPD symptoms in women were mostly misdiagnosed as those of asthma./""Diagnosis of COPD and asthma are different. COPD is caused in midlife, while the onset of asthma is early in life often childhood. COPD symptoms are slowly progressive, while asthma symptoms vary from day to day. There is largely irreversible airflow limitation in COPD, while in asthma, there is largely reversible airflow limitation.""/According to the pulmonologist, COPD is caused by smoking, excessive environmental exposure and genetic factors./""Smoking is the most common cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, one in six of its sufferers are reported to have never smoked. Chemicals, dusts, fumes, second-hand smoke, pollutants and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are also responsible for it.""/Dr. Shazli Manzoor blamed high COPD incidence on increase in exposure to risk factors, especially tobacco and indoor air pollution, including solid fuels and biomass, in developing countries and in women./""Exposure to biomass smoke is perhaps the biggest risk factor for COPD globally. Almost two billion kilograms biomass is burnt everyday worldwide. Also, use of mosquito coil is dangerous. Burning one mosquito coil release the same amount of PM2.5 mass as that of burning around 100-125 cigarettes. The emission of formaldehyde can be as high as that released by the burning of 51 cigarettes.""/He warned that infants of smoking parents had more respiratory illnesses like pneumonia, which might predispose them to develop chronic bronchitis later in life./According to the pulmonologist, coughing, shortness of breath, excess sputum or phlegm, feeling like you can't breathe and can't take deep breath, and wheezing are the most common symptoms of COPD./""When it's hard to breathe, it's hard to do anything. People with COPD avoid activities that they used to do more easily and limit activities to accommodate shortness of breath and other symptoms. Some activities include taking elevator instead of stairs, parking vehicles close to destinations to avoid walking, avoiding shopping or other similar day-to-day tasks, and staying home rather than go out with friends.""/Dr. Shazli Manzoor said that the two major causes of COPD were chronic bronchitis characterised by chronic inflammation and excess mucus production and presence of chronic productive cough, and emphysema characterised by damage to the small, sac-like units of the lung that deliver oxygen into the lung and remove the carbon dioxide and chronic cough./Also among speakers was Dr. Aftab Akhtar of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Department at the Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, who said COPD was a progressive disease that worsened over time and there was a need to manage it./In a presentation on 'Taking Control of Your COPD', he said that there were four major components of COPD management and they included assessment and monitoring of the disease, identification and reduction of exposure to risk factors, management of stable disease, and management of disease exacerbations./""Symptoms and objective measures of airflow should be monitored regularly to determine when to modify therapy and identify any developing complications.""/Dr. Aftab Akhtar said that GlaxoSmithKline, a global healthcare company, had invested in the BREATHE (observational cross sectional epidemiology study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Middle East-Asia region./""This study aims to understand the true burden of the disease both for patients and healthcare systems across the region. It is a very large observational study covering around 60,000 subjects across 11 countries. It presents a unique opportunity for us to highlight the true burden of COPD, both in terms of its cost to society and the impact the disease has on patients and their families,"" he said./According to him, the BREATHE Study findings will improve the awareness, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COPD, and identify any specific trends in disease management, smoking prevalence and healthcare resource consumption to characterise the COPD population throughout the region./There followed a session during which health experts responded to the participants' questions on COPD and asthma Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Clean air a blessing we have neglected,"PESHAWAR, Dec. 25 -- Clean air is a blessing. Every one has right on it and every one has right to breath in clean enviornment. But with each passing day air pollution is increasing./With air pollution the level of of chemicals, particulates, or biological materials that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the natural environment or built environment increased in the air./The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's ecosystems./Major primary pollutants produced by human activity include Sulfur oxides (SOx) Nitrogen oxides (NOx) Carbon monoxide (CO), non-toxic greenhouse gas. Volatile organic compounds - (VOCs)./Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases via their role in creating ozone and in prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere, although the effect varies depending on local air quality Sources of air pollution refer to the various locations, activities or factors which are responsible for the releasing of pollutants into the atmosphere./Anthropogenic sources (human activity) mostly related to burning different kinds of fuel.Stationary Sources"" include smoke stacks of power plants, manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung. Mobile Sources"" include motor vehicles, marine vessels, aircraft and the effect of sound etc./Chemicals, dust and controlled burn practices in agriculture and forestry management. Controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters./Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest. Researches have demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma and from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution./A study conducted in 1960-1961 in the wake of the Great Smog of 1952 compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis./Air pollution is the source of smog, acid rain and possibly global warming. Smog is classified as either photochemical smog or industrial smog./Photochemical smog, often evidenced by the brown cloud hanging over densely populated cities, is created by the interaction of sunlight with molecules of primary pollutants./The resulting chemical reaction is toxic to humans and animals. Industrial smog is characterized by the gray-brown fog that hangs over industrial areas and is attributed to the interaction of sunlight, air molecules and sulfur dioxide./The result is, again, toxic air.we should make consedrations Individuals and businesses alike have taken steps to reduce their contributions to air pollution. Manufacturing and purchasing vehicles that use gas more efficiently and driving less, recycling to reduce landfills that emit toxic gases and patronizing those businesses that reduce their industrial waste all aid in controlling air pollution./These actions, while laudable, act as a preventative only in reducing the amount of toxins spewed into the Earth's atmosphere. Air pollution may be prevented only if individuals and businesses stop using toxic substances that cause air pollution in the first place./This would require the cessation of all fossil fuel-burning processes, from industrial manufacturing to home use of air conditioners. This is an unlikely scenario at this time./However, as of June 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put forth a proposal for a Federal Transport Rule, which sets stringent regulations on industrial and power supply manufacturing and handling.

Pakistan: Something in the air,"ISLAMABAD, Dec. 29 -- The cold winds of winter bring with them the joys of hot coffee, blazing fires, sweet oranges and sizzling soup. One of the best moments of a cold winter night is to sit on a cosy sofa with a bowl of warm soup. There are many forms of soup, clear, vegetable, chicken corn and the list is endless. However, the ingredients swimming in that bowl glisten with their taste like jewels in a pond. But the slightest of dirt, strand of hair or other unpleasant intruder found in that lovely bowl can make that soup so appalling. Why would we put something ""not worthy"" in our mouths?/So have you ever though of what exactly we put in our mouths every second? When we are so concerned about the food and how it is made, have we ever given thought about the thing that we inhale and exhale everyday? The air we breathe. How many unpleasant intruders wander around there?/In Pakistan, poor air quality has become a point of concern not just for environmental enthusiasts or esoteric communities but also for the general public. According to a World Bank Report - ""Pakistan Strategic Environmental Assessment"" - published in September 2007, indoor air pollution alone is the reason for 30,000 child deaths per year, nearly 50 percent of the environmental damage cost is attributed to illness and premature mortality caused by indoor and outdoor air pollution. Using conservative estimates, the report finds that the mean annual cost of environmental degradation is approximately 6 percent of GDP./Every day each person inhales 20,000 litres of air. Every breath, we risk summon dangerous chemicals that have found their way into the air. The biggest causes are the operations of fossil fuel-burning power plants and automobiles that combust fuel. Combined, these two sources are responsible for about 90% of all air pollution./The most serious of air pollution problems in Pakistan is the presence of excessive suspended particulates matter (SPM), particles small enough to get into our lungs and pass through the small membranes. Dust and smoke particles in Pakistan are generally twice the world average and five times higher than the developed world. Mega cities of Punjab have been facing constant fog every winter for quite some years, which may be attributed to trans-boundary pollution from India. Dense fogs often trap air pollutants, causing them to accumulate in great quantities so-called smog resulting in corrosive sulphuric acid droplets that irritate respiratory tracks and cause pervasive environmental damage. Other current sources of pollution include forest, vegetation burning and waste incineration. Air pollution can damage the cells and leaves of trees and plants, lowering growth rates hence food supplies are at risk./Momentous increase in vehicle usage and electricity demand both of which largely require the combustion of fossil fuels, release reactive gases into the atmosphere, spewing carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and small particles called particulate matter into the atmosphere with hazardous health consequences. We need to look at cleaner sources of energy, especially dams. Not building dams which are a clean source of energy (do no cause pollution) and going for fossil fuels and thermal sources of energy cause massive pollution./Burning of garbage is another factor, which releases dangerous gases and dust, which contribute to global warming and pollute lakes, forests, oceans and cities. Recycling needs to be introduced at the national level, making people stakeholders as well./In China the government has set itself an ambitious task of improving Beijing's air quality by 2015. Spending over 6 million USD in air quality monitoring equipment only!/When we get our houses cleaned, we check the food being made and complain on hygiene and think of ourselves as very clean, we forget the most basic fundamental thing, the air we breathe./There is something in the air, and it sure isn't love Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Environment issue stalks capital once again,"ISLAMABAD, Dec. 30 -- It looks as if Islamabad is not getting rid of its air pollution problems./Just when this year steel furnaces installed gadgets to lessen emissions from their chimneys after pressure from the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), there is a new environmental issue rising./As many as 20 re-rolling steel mills have started consuming coal excessively due to gas loadshedding to keep their heating systems burning./According to Pak-Epa, burning coal has dire environment impacts./The problem came to light after residents of sectors I started registering complaints with the environment watchdog about air pollution over the last few months./Only three re-rolling mills - Fazal Steel, Itihad Steel and Karachi Steel - have environment-friendly (coal gasification plants) gadgets installed./The remaining units, according to Pak-Epa, are poisoning the air of Islamabad.Javed Iqbal, the managing director of Karachi Steel, said: ""Coal gasification is an 18th century technology./The cost of this technology can be as high as 50 per cent compared to burning natural gas to heat steel depending on hours of labour put in and the type of coal consumed.""/Steel is made in two stages. First to make billet or blocks of steel, furnaces require enormous amounts of heating (1,650 degrees centigrade) by melting scrap. The melting process produces a black smoke./Once the blocks cooled, the re-rolling mills heat them again at 1,100 degrees, enough to make steel and give it a shape/form in a smoke-free process./""There is no check on the quality of coal being used and the technology adopted to burn the coal for fuel,"" explained Asif Shuja, the director general of Pak-EPA./Some of the re-rolling mills are not just using coal but also furnace oil to produce heating that increased the amount of emissions into the air./""It is a new environmental concern that we are looking into,"" said Mr Shuja who had convinced the owners of the eight steel furnaces to install environment-friendly equipment in June 2011./Out of the eight steel furnaces, six had installed the filters that controlled release of emissions/exhaust/gases by 99 per cent./The remaining two were not in compliance, according to Pak-Epa./These have been tough days for re-rolling mills and steel furnaces due to the gas and electricity shortages./The owners of some of the re-rolling steel mills said their units had been functioning without gas for the last two weeks./""And besides the six-hour-long electricity loadshedding daily, operations also come to a halt due to another three to four hours of unscheduled power outages,"" said Shaban Khalid, the owner of Itihad Steel Mill./""The entire process of making steel is wasted when there is a prolonged gas and electricity breakdown.

Pakistan: Human negligence causes many diseases,"HYDERABAD, Jan. 17 -- Professor Department of Medicines Dr. Muhammad Khalid Shaikh has pointed out that many diseases are caused by human negligence due to smoke and noise pollution including asthma, lung cancer and depression. Dr. Khalid highlighted the different types of pollution experienced by the people like smoke of cigarette,noise, air and waste material while talking here on Wednesday. /He also expressed grave concern over the increase in pollution of different kinds and emphasized the need of implementing the relevant laws in letter and spirit in order to make the country's environment healthy. Dr. Shaikh informed that the preparation of building materials, smoke-emitting and unfit vehicles, industrial effluents and smokes or fumes, improper sewage disposal and uprooting of forested areas are the main causes of pollution and if no attention is paid in this direction,the people can suffer diseases. He said that there is dire need of strict vigilance and effective implementation of environmental rules and regulations so that the hazards of air, noise and water pollutions could be addressed and a healthy environment could be provided to the people. Dr. Khalid Shaikh also expressed the view that the life of the common people becomes miserable due to a polluted atmosphere and there is a need to adopt effective measures to make the country pollution-free. He termed air and noise pollutions as serious problems in urban parts of the country and said that relevant agencies must work in this direction to provide relief to the people. Dr. Shaikh suggested that residential areas should be kept at a distance from the commercial and industrial areas while efforts should be made to ensure that the noise from heavy vehicles remains away from hospitals, schools and offices. The noise pollution is mostly caused by the road, rail, air traffic,industries, construction, public work while indoor noise pollution is caused by faulty or inadequate ventilation system, office machines, catering trade, live or recorded music and domestic animals,he said. Dr. Khalid informed that the air pollution causes of blood cancer among people particularly the children as the statistics indicated that the number of Leukaemia patients, who were 35 percent in 1998 shot to 43 percent in 2006. Pollutions of different kinds also cause health problems including skin and eye infections,he said. Dr. Khalid said that the air pollution creates problem when waste is burnt due to which heavy metals like lead, toxic gases and smoke spread over residential areas. The wind also carries waste, dust and gases caused by decomposition he said. He added that putrefaction of waste in sunlight during daytime results in bad smells and reduced visibility, he added.

Pakistan: Urbanization causing increase in challenges,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 17 -- Capturing the development dividend of growth calls for complementary policies that address environmental issues in the face of accelerated urbanization that is causing an increase in challenges such as toxic air and water pollution and hazardous solid waste./The estimates presented in a set of reports suggested that environmental degradation costs the country at least 6 per cent of GDP, or about Rs365 billion per year, and these costs fall disproportionately upon the poor. The most significant causes of environmental damage identified and estimated include illness and premature mortality caused by air pollution (indoor and outdoor), diarrhoeal diseases and typhoid due to inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene and reduced agricultural productivity due to soil degradation./Pakistan's infant and child mortality rates are the highest in the South Asia Region, with the prevalence of childhood diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, both associated with poor environmental quality, the second highest. With more than one-third of the population living in towns and cities, Pakistan is the most urbanized country in South Asia and exposure to urban and industrial pollution is a rapidly growing concern. Overall, environmental health risks are estimated to contribute more than 20 percent of the total burden o f disease./The experts said Pakistan currently lacks standards for the quality of ambient air and water. Such standards are the foundation upon which emission control strategies are based, and usually specify schedules for attainment as well as monitoring methods. The regulatory framework needs to be updated to incorporate standards in the priority areas such as health-based air quality standards, vehicle emission and fuel quality standards, use-based water quality standards and drinking water quality standards Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution increasing in twin cities,"ISLAMABAD, Jan. 24 -- Air pollution increasing day by day in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi caused by the steel and marble factories set up in the nearby industrial areas I-9. Dozen of marble and steel factories, set up in twin cities are one of the major contributors to air pollution. /The residents frequently complain of diseases like chest congestion and asthma, which are directly linked to air pollution according to doctors. The marble factories caused air and noise pollution also. These factories throw their waste into the nearby natural streams. None of these factories follow any environmental or labour laws, says Aslam Tahir, a worker. He said most of the workers developed chest diseases due to inhaling dust frequently and that the factory owners adopted no safety precautions. ""We are living in worst environmental conditions, but the CDA, despite growing concerns among inhabitants of this area over the air pollution, has remained indifferent"", Mr Naveed Ahsan, a resident of I-9 sector while talking to media said. When contacted, CDA official, he said the authority was pursuing industrialists, with a special focus on steel and marble factories, to use treatment plants to filter hazardous smoke emissions. The official agreed that the residents of the sectors close to the industrial area were suffering from air pollution, and as a result they were more prone to respiratory diseases. He said the authority had devised a plan to check air pollution in the federal capital territory Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Steel industries contributing heavily to air pollution,"ISLAMABAD, Feb. 4 -- Steel melting industries operating in the Industrial Area of I-9 and I-10 sectors are contributing heavily to air pollution as almost all of them are producing metal dusts, slag and gaseous emissions that adversely affect quality of air./According to a report prepared by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), smoke is produced during charging of the furnace and when the temperature rises the paint and other adherent volatile matter in the scrap escapes from the charge./""Twelve kilograms of particulate matter is produced/per ton of product (at the most). The primary hazardous components of furnace dust are zinc, lead, and cadmium, but its composition and contents vary with the scrap quality and furnace additives,"" it said./At the electric induction furnaces used for melting metal scrap where workers are directly exposed to extremely high temperature and highly toxic gases rich in particulate matter of heavy metals, which posses serious health hazards. In addition to these, air emission from the industry includes NO2, So2, CO, particulate matter and thick black smoke./The report said the steel melting furnaces are induction types and are being operated on electricity. Most of the/surveyed units had one to/two induction furnaces producing three tons of billets per batch./The operation of electric arc furnace is a batch process with a cycle time of three hours. Since no fuel is burnt in the furnace, theoretically there may not be any emissions. Practically pollution is generated due to poor quality of scrap bundled. Scrap, which is being used by the melters consists mainly of spent containers of edible oils, paints, lubricants and even rubber. Maximum pollution is generated at the time of light up when in the furnace temperature is low and scrap is contaminated with oil./Pak-EPA and CDA have maintained pressure on steel furnaces advising them to adhere to the National Environmental Quality Standards. As a result, a few units have installed locally designed gadgets, which are inefficient in controlling pollution Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: Heavy trucks causing air, noise pollution in capital","ISLAMABAD, Feb. 5 -- Hundreds of heavy trucks, entering and leaving the industrial area everyday, are causing air and noise pollution in the federal capital and disturbance among the sector's residents. Resident of the industrial areas told media that the number of noise, dust and smoke complaints from the area were steadily increasing with each passing day. /One of them is Shahid Ali, working in an automobile painting shop in the sector for over 10 years, is an asthma patient. He attributes his problem to the heavy presence of smoke and dust in the industrial area. He said hundreds of trucks enter and leave the area, adding, ""My shop is located at Potohar Road and over 200 trucks use this road daily"". Aslam Khan, a resident of Sector I-9, also complained that scores of trucks that use the road daily create a lot of noise and smoke pollution. Muhammad Tahir, another I-10 resident, said one could easily see layers of smoke in the air. He said throat, nasal and lung problems were quite common in the area. Doctor warn that noise and air pollution is injurious to human health. Dr Aftab Ali Malik, who render his services at Polyclinic Hospital, remarked that the smoke emitted by trucks could cause respiratory infections, exacerbations of bronchial asthma, and high blood pressure. He warned that smoke also contained carcinogens that could cause cancer. The doctor said the dust could cause nasal allergy, asthma and noise hearing problems. When contacted, Senior Superintendent of Traffic Police said trucks could only use link roads to enter or leave the city. He said they he would ask his men to keep a vigilant eye on trucks causing noise or air pollution. A CDA official said the civic body had warned factories against polluting environment through notices and would proceed against the smoke emitting or effluent discharging industrial units.

"Pakistan: 50,000 fall prey to deadly disease annually in Pakistan","ISLAMABAD, Feb. 5 -- Cancer is emerging as a major health problem in Pakistan, as according to estimates, the disease claims around 50,000 lives annually while 300,000 new individuals contract the disease every year./The existing pool of cancer patients in the country is on the rise sharply. In Punjab alone, nearly 162,000 new patients of cancer are added to the existing pool each year. The most alarming fact is that in Pakistan, only minority of cancer patients are able to get treatment./Majority of cancer patients in the country are being refused treatment owing to limited capacity of cancer beds. Furthermore, there is a lack of facilities for even palliative care, the treatment to relieve symptoms caused by cancer. Palliative care that is considered as urgent humanitarian need for people with cancer can help people live more comfortably./There are a number of reasons for the increase in cancer patients of which the three main ones being a longer life expectancy, more accurate diagnosis and the rise in cigarette smoking./Professor of Community Medicine, Dr Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry, expressed this while talking to 'media' in connection with the World Cancer Day being observed on Monday across the globe./He said that palliative care is particularly required in places like Pakistan with a high proportion of patients with advanced stages where there is little chance of cure. There is a dire need to establish new cancer facilities in the country./It is important that in Pakistan, a large proportion of cancers present at an advanced age. Health experts believe that lack of awareness about cancers, their signs and symptoms, is one of the major causes of delayed presentation. Experts say that awareness and education of masses is necessary to combat cancer, which is alarmingly increasing in the country./Cancer affects everyone - the young and old, the rich and poor, men, women and children - and represents a tremendous burden on families and societies. Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. It can affect almost any part of body. The growth often invades surrounding tissue and can metastasise to distant sites. Lung, stomach, liver, colon and breast cancer cause the most cancer deaths each year./Dr. Ashraf said that aging is the fundamental factor for the development of cancer. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age. ""Life style and environmental factors like the things we eat, drink, whether we smoke or exercise, how much sun we get and where we live have a powerful effect on cancer risk."" He said that a possible promoter in food is fat, especially saturated fat from animal products like meat. Tobacco use, pan, chalia, alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, exposure to occupational for example asbestos carcinogens, radiation including ultraviolet and ionising radiation, excessive X-Rays, low fruit and vegetable intake, excessive consumption of red and preserved meat, estrogens tablets, high fat diet, genetic factors, having unsafe sex, infections from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, human papiloma viruses, Helicobacter pylori, urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels are major risk factors for cancer development, explained Dr. Ashraf./He said that cancer's seven warning signals are change in bowel or bladder habit, a sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, thickening or lump in breast or elsewhere, indigestion or difficulty in swallowing, obvious change in wart or mole and nagging cough or hoarseness./He said that the theme of World Cancer Day 2013 is ""Dispel damaging Myths and misconceptions about cancer"" under the tagline ""Cancer - Did you know"". ""The world cancer day is a chance to raise our collective voices in the name of improving general knowledge about cancer and dismissing conceptions about the disease.""/To a query, Dr. Ashraf said that four basic components of cancer control are prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, and palliative care. ""Tobacco is the single largest preventable cause of cancer in the world today. It causes 80-90% of all lung cancer deaths, and about 30 per cent of all cancer deaths in developing countries."" He added that a comprehensive strategy including bans on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, tax increases on tobacco products, and cessation programmes can reduce tobacco consumption./He said that dietary modification is another important approach to cancer control. There are many promoters and inhibitors in food so scientists believe that the food we eat is very important in the growth or the prevention of cancer. ""Diets high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pistachios, peanuts, walnuts, soybean, tomatoes, beans, pulses and legumes and avoiding processed foods high in fat, salt and or sugar and sugary drinks, bakery items have a protective effect against many cancers.""/Dr. Ashraf advised to not to remove skin of fruits, potatoes, pears and apples etc. Avoid fried foods and bakery items. Limit your intake of salty foods such as pickles, Nimco, chips etc. Mothers should breastfeed their infants for at least six months. This practice offers cancer protection to both mother and the child. Drink at least eight to 10 glasses of water a day./He added that regular physical activity and maintenance of healthy body weight, along with a healthy diet will considerably reduce cancer risk. ""Vaccination against human papiloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus vaccination (HBV) will prevent cervical and liver cancer respectively."" He said that avoiding excessive exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation, use of sunscreen, wide-brimmed hats, large sunglasses, and protective clothing are effective preventive measures against skin cancer. ""Asbestos can cause lung cancer, aniline dyes have been linked to bladder cancer and benzene can lead to leukaemia. The prevention of certain occupational and environmental exposure to these and other chemicals is another element in preventing cancer.""/He said that if prevention fails, catch it early. Unfortunately in Pakistan, a large number of cancer patients present at an advanced stage due to lack of awareness. About one-third of the cancer burden could be decreased if cases were detected and treated early. Some of the most common cancers - including breast, colorectal and cervical cancer - are curable if detected early. The aim is to detect cancer when it is localised./He said that screening programmes such as mammography for early detection of breast cancer and cytology (Pap smear) for cervical cancer, colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy to help to detect colon cancer, chest X-Ray, CT scan or sputum cytology for lung cancer may help early detection./However, in the scenario of limited resources for implementation of screening programmes in Pakistan, the only practical option for early detection is through mass education about the cancers and their risk factors, concluded Dr. Ashraf Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution fifth leading cause of death in India: Study,"New Delhi, Feb. 16 -- Air pollution is the fifth leading cause of death in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking and poor nutrition, with about 620,000 premature deaths occurring from air pollution-related diseases, Indian media reported on Thursday./Like China, India faces an unprecedented public health crisis due to air pollution, the Centre for Science and Environment's (CSE) analysis of government data and the Global Burden of Disease report's data on India has shown./The green think tank released its own assessment and the global study's India specific data warning that the number of premature deaths due to air pollution had increased six fold over the last 10 years./Air pollution is now the seventh leading cause behind the loss of about 18 million healthy years of life in India due to illness. It comes after indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, childhood underweight, low nutritional status, and alcohol use./CSE's own assessment of the air pollution data generated by the government painted the grim facts that are leading to the public health crisis./""Close to half of cities are reeling under severe particulate pollution while newer pollutants like nitrogen oxides, ozone and- air toxics are worsening the public health challenge,"" CSE estimates say. Half of the urban population breathes air laced with particulate pollution that has exceeded the safety standards. As much as one third of urban population is exposed to critical level of particulate pollution. Smaller cities are among the most polluted in the country./The data is a damning indictment of India's supposed growing urban regions. Out of the 180 cities that are monitored for only two towns - Malapuram and Pathanamthitta - in Kerala meet the low pollution norms (pollution levels remaining at 50% below the standard) for all pollutants./About 78% cities (141 cities) exceed the standard set for particulate matter of size below 10 microns (PM10). As many as 90 cities have critical levels of PM10 and of this, 26 cities have most critical levels of PM10, exceed the standard by more than 3 times. Gwalior, West Singbhum, Ghaziabad, Raipur, and Delhi are top five critically polluted cities./The data analysis shows the situation is only getting worse with time. ""The PM10 monitoring network has doubled between 2005 and 2010 - it has increased from 96 to 180 cities. During this period the cities with low level of pollution has fallen from 10 to 2 and the number of critically polluted cities have increased from 49 to 89 cities. In 2005 about 75% of cities exceeded the standard. In 2010, a total of 78% of cities are exceeding the standard,"" CSE said./Warning that vehicular pollution will continue to be the most important reason for concern in coming years as cities grow and get more densely populated, CSE has advocated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards should be made legally binding. It has criticized the new Auto Fuel Policy Committee that is to set the benchmarks for up to 2025 for fuel quality used by vehicles.

Pakistan: Smoking ban 'cuts premature births',"Brussels, Feb. 19 -- The theory that public smoking bans cut the number of children born prematurely has been strengthened by new research./The study of 600,000 births found three successive drops in babies born before 37 weeks - each occurring after a phase of a public smoking ban was introduced./There was no such trend in the period before the bans were put in place, the British Medical Journal reported./The study, by Hasselt University in Belgium, comes after Scottish research in 2012 found a similar pattern./But experts could not fully state the smoking ban was the cause of the change because pre-term births had started to drop before the ban./It is already well established that smoking leads to reduced birth weight and an increased risk of premature birth./In the latest study researchers were able to look at the rate of premature births after each phase of a smoking ban came into force in Belgium./Public places and most workplaces were first to introduce smoke-free rules in 2006, followed by restaurants in 2007 and bars serving food in 2010./The rate of premature births was found to fall after each phase of the ban with the biggest impact seen after the second two bans with restaurants and bars introducing no smoking rules./After the bans in 2007 and 2010, the premature birth rate dropped by around 3% each time./Overall it corresponds to a fall of six premature babies in every 1,000 births./The changes could not be explained by other factors - such as mother's age and socioeconomic status or population effects such as changes in air pollution and influenza epidemics./There was no link found with birth weight./Study leader Dr Tim Nawrot from Hasselt University said that even a mild reduction in gestational age has been linked in other studies to adverse health outcomes in early and later life./""Because the ban happened at three different moments, we could show there was a consistent pattern of reduction in the risk of preterm delivery.""/He added: ""It supports the notion that smoking bans have public health benefits even from early life.""/Patrick O'Brien, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said: ""It is very gratifying to see further strong evidence that smoking bans have had a beneficial impact on pregnant women and their babies.

"Pakistan: Steel, marble factories in twin cities causing air pollution","ISLAMABAD, March 12 -- A large number of marble and steel factories, set up in twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad especially in industrial sectors, I-9 and I-10 are one of the major contributors to air pollution. The residents frequently complain of diseases like chest congestion and asthma, which are directly linked to air pollution according to doctors. They said that the concerned departments have failed to check increasing air pollution which is mainly caused by the steel and marble factories set up in the nearby industrial areas. /The marble factories are not only cause of air pollution but they also cause noise pollution. These factories throw their waste into the nearby natural streams. None of these factories follow any environmental or labour laws, says Salman Ahmad, a worker. He said most of the workers developed chest diseases due to inhaling dust frequently and that the factory owners adopted no safety precautions. According to environmentalists at the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (PEPA), the steel industry is a big source of pollution because it uses low-quality scrap as raw material and releases a huge number of harmful particulate in the air. A medical physician said that smaller particles, when inhaled, can cause a lot of trouble. ""We are living in worst environmental conditions, but the CDA, despite growing concerns among inhabitants of this area over the air pollution, has remained indifferent"", Mr Akram said, resident of I-9 sector while talking to this agency. When contacted, an official of the concerned department of CDA said the authority was pursuing industrialists, with a special focus on steel and marble factories, to use treatment plants to filter hazardous smoke emissions. The official agreed that the residents of the sectors close to the industrial area were suffering from air pollution, and, as a result, were more prone to respiratory diseases. ""If the industrialists do not follow CDA directives to control air pollution in near future, the authority will file a complaint with the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (PEPA),"" he said. He said the authority had devised a plan to check air pollution in the federal capital territory Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Pollen allergy patients asked to take preventive measures,"ISLAMABAD, March 13 -- Medical experts on Tuesday advised the pollen allergy patients to adopt precautionary measures to avert from any complication. They said allergy patients should avoid going to places having the offending plants and pollen in the air. /They asked pollen allergy patients, especially those working outdoors to wear face masks designed to filter pollen out of the air reaching their nasal passages. Dr Sharif Astori from Federal Government Polyclinic (FGPC) said that during period of high pollen levels, people with pollen allergy should try to avoid unnecessary exposure to irritants such as dust, insect sprays, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and fresh tar or paint as any of these can aggravate the symptoms of pollen allergy, he added, He said when pollen allergy is not treated, complications may occur. He said people with seasonal allergies who cannot avoid pollen, the symptoms can be controlled with medication on advise of physicians. Dr Wasim Khawaja from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said that proper arrangements have been made for care of critical patients of pollen allergy. He said the number of pollen allergy patients are increasing and daily around 50 patients are being treated in the PIMS emergency and Pulmonology department. He said best facilities are being provided to such patients free of cost while these patients are also being provided free life saving medicines in the emergency department besides nebulization, bronchodilaters, steroids, oxygen therapy, nursing care and specialist consultation Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Traffic-related pollution contributing to asthma in kids,"ISLAMABAD, April 3 -- Living near major highways has been linked to childhood asthma, but a new study led by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC) suggests that traffic-related pollution near schools is also contributing to the development of asthma in kids./The researchers found that the risk of developing asthma due to exposure at school was comparable to that of children whose exposure occurred primarily at home, even though time spent at school only accounted for about one third of waking hours./Children in schools located in high-traffic environments had a 45 percent increased risk of developing asthma./Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness in developed countries and has been linked to environmental factors such as traffic-related air pollution./""While residential traffic-related pollution has been associated with asthma, there has been little study of the effects of traffic exposure at school on new onset asthma,"" said lead author Rob McConnell, M.D., professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. ""Exposure to pollution at locations other than home, especially where children spend a large portion of their day and may engage in physical activity, appears to influence asthma risk as well.""/The study drew upon data from the Children's Health Study (CHS), a longitudinal study of children in Southern California communities that was designed to investigate the chronic effects of air pollution on respiratory health. Using a cohort of 2,497 kindergarten and first grade children who were asthma-free when they entered the CHS, researchers examined the relationship of local traffic around schools and homes to diagnosis of new onset asthma that occurred during three years of follow-up./Traffic-related pollution exposure was assessed based on a model that took into account traffic volume, distance to major roadways from home and school and local weather conditions./Regional ambient ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter were measured continuously at one central site in each of the 13 study communities. The design allowed investigators to examine the joint effects of local traffic-related pollution exposure at school and at home and of regional pollution exposure affecting the entire community./Researchers found 120 cases of new asthma. The risk associated with traffic-related pollution exposure at schools was almost as high as for residential exposure, and combined exposure accounting for time spent at home and at school had a slightly larger effect./Although children spend less time at school than at home, physical education and other activities that take place at school may increase ventilation rates and the dose of pollutants getting into the lungs, McConnell noted. Traffic-related pollutant levels may also be higher during the morning hours when children are arriving at school. Despite a state law that prohibits school districts from building campuses within 500 feet of a freeway, many Southern California schools are located near high-traffic areas, including busy surface streets./""It's important to understand how these micro-environments where children spent a lot of their time outside of the home are impacting their health,"" McConnell said.

Pakistan: UN health agency warns against dangers of air pollution,"ISLAMABAD, April 10 -- The dangers posed by air pollution are far larger than previously thought, the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) has announced, as it renewed its call for rapid global action in reducing what it described as one of ""the greatest hazards to human health."" The warning came at the latest meeting of the UN Environment Program's (UNEP) Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), held in Paris, France, over the weekend, where health advocates were told that indoor air pollution had become the leading risk factor for ""burden of disease"" in South Asia while it was ranked second in Eastern, Central and Western Sub-Saharan Africa and third in Southeast Asia, IRNA reported on Tuesday. ""The estimations we have now tell us there are 3.5 million premature deaths every year caused by household air pollution, and 3.3 million death every year caused by outdoor air pollution,"" Dr. Maria Neira, the WHO's Director of Public Health and Environment, told the CCAC meeting. /Ground-level ozone pollution was estimated to cause an additionally 200,000 premature deaths every year, the agency said in a press release, which notes that ""burden of disease"" is a calculation based on years of life lost combined with years lived at less than full health. ""Air pollution is becoming one of the biggest health issues we have in front of us at the moment,"" Dr. Neira said. The CCAC, whose partners include member states and civil society health advocates, targets so-called short- lived climate pollutants, or SLCPs, as major culprits in the damage to health, as well as the cause of crop loss and climate change. SLCPs that are harmful to human health are released through numerous sources ranging from diesel engine exhaust and smoke and soot from inefficient cook stoves to leakage and flaring from oil and natural gas production and emissions from solid waste disposal, a press release issued by the UN Information Center (UNIC) said. Pointing to cook stoves, for example, the UN health agency stated that many of those appliances emit carbon monoxide and other pollutants at levels up to 100 times higher than recommended limits. UNEP noted that fast action on SLCPs could ""dramatically"" reduce the number of annual deaths from air pollution. Efforts to lower black carbon emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and engines were receiving ""particularly strong attention"" from the CCAC. In addition, it added that the CCAC had already launched efforts to reduce black carbon and other pollutants from brick production through the adoption of modern technologies, which can lower the emission of pollutants by 10 to 50 percent Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Increase in rare childhood cancers linked to air pollution exposure,"ISLAMABAD, April 13 -- Scientists from UCLA`s Fielding School of Public Health have found a possible link between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and several childhood cancers./The results of their study, led by Julia Heck, an assistant researcher in the school`s epidemiology department and a member of UCLA`s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center - the first to examine air pollution from traffic and a number of rarer childhood cancers - were presented on April 9 in an abstract at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Washington, D.C./For the study, the UCLA researchers utilized data on 3,950 children who were enrolled in the California Cancer Registry and who were born in the state between 1998 and 2007./They estimated the amount of local traffic the children had been exposed to using California LINE Source Dispersion Modeling, version 4 (CALINE4)./Pollution exposure was estimated for the area around each child`s home for each trimester of their mother`s pregnancy and during their first year of life./The estimates included information on gasoline and diesel vehicles within a 1,500-meter radius buffer, traffic volumes, roadway geometry, vehicle emission rates and weather./Cancer risk was estimated using a statistical analysis known as unconditional logistic regression./The researchers found that heightened exposure to traffic-related air pollution was associated with increases in three rare types of childhood cancer - acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( white blood cell cancer ), germ-cell tumors (cancers of the testicles, ovaries and other organs) and retinoblastoma (eye cancer), particularly bilateral retinoblastoma, in which both eyes are affected./The pollution-exposure estimates were highly correlated across pregnancy trimesters and the first year of life, meaning that even in areas of high exposure, no particular period stood out as a higher-exposure time. This, the scientists said, made it difficult to determine if one period of exposure was more dangerous than any other./""Much less is known about exposure to pollution and childhood cancer than adult cancers,"" Heck said./""Our innovation in this study was looking at other, more rare types of childhood cancer, such as retinoblastoma, and their possible connection to traffic-related air pollution,"" she said./Because these are rare diseases, Heck cautions that the findings need to be replicated in further studies Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Exposure to traffic pollution increases risk of heart disease,"KARACHI, April 21 -- PEOPLE who are exposed to fine particle matter (PM) air pollution from traffic pollution for a prolonged period of time are at an increased risk of developing arteriosclerosis, according to a new study presented at the Euro Prevent 2013 congress in Rome./This isn't the first time that road traffic has been linked with heart disease, a previous study conducted in Denmark in 2012 identified that traffic noise is significantly associated with risk of heart attack./The aim of this study, as described by Dr Hagen Kalsch from the West-German Heart Centre in Essen, Germany, was to see whether the increased heart risks associated with traffic came from either noise, particle pollution, or both. The researchers used data from the German Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, which included a total of 4,814 participants. They used street maps to calculate how near the participants were to roads with lots of traffic, chemistry transport models to estimate their exposure to pollutants, and validated tests to measure traffic noise./Through the use of computed tomography imaging they measured vascular vessel calcification in the thoracic aorta, which revealed the patient's level of arteriosclerosis. Increased proximity to major roads with traffic was associated with an increased level of aortic calcification in the 4,238 participants of the study. The degree of calcification increased by 20.7% as particle volume increased by 2.4 micrometers, and increased by 10% for every 100 meter proximity to heavy traffic. Dr Kalsch confirmed that both exposure to PM air pollution as well as road traffic noise are associated with sub-clinical arteriosclerosis. He said: ""These two major types of traffic emissions help explain the observed associations between living close to high traffic and sub-clinical arteriosclerosis. The considerable size of the associations underscores the importance of long-term exposure to air pollution and road traffic noise as risk factors for arteriosclerosis.""/Traffic noise and fine PM are thought to increase cardiovascular risk by acting through similar biological pathways and causing an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system./TAC is one of the most reliable markers of sub-clinical arteriosclerosis, along with coronary artery calcification (CAC)./All air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (measured as PM10) were associated with an increased risk of heart attack, except for ozone (O3). Traffic air pollution may be particularly harmful for infants - researchers from the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, reported in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, that traffic air pollution exposure during infancy harms the lungs for many years Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

He stressed that air pollution from cars and factories is contributing to the increasing cases of asthma in the country. According to Dr Rashid smoking is currently responsible for over 100,000 deaths annually.If surging trend of smoking is not checked, it is expected that mortality from tobacco use will amount to over 500,000 per year by 2010, he warned while pointing out that smoking is responsible for over 90 percent of lung cancer cases. He regretted that most people in Pakistan are not aware of the serious dangers associated with smoking. ""Smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death in the country,"" he said adding that through will power and use of certain medicines most of the people can give up this powerful addiction. Dr Khan said that almost 20 percent of the country's children and 10 percent of adults in the country suffer asthma, but unfortunately most patients do not receive optimal treatment. ""People need not suffer from this condition because with modern treatment almost all asthma patients can lead a normal life,"" he explained. He said that last year 260,000 people died in the world as a result of this disease. Dr Khan said that the factors that can set off an asthma attack include inhaled allergens such as dust, pollen, tobacco smoke, air pollution strong emotional expressions, chemical irritants and certain drugs.He said such colouring agents and food preservatives could also cause asthma attack. Avoidance of allergenic and irritants are necessary in order to avoid asthma symptoms. Avoidance to allergen may not always be possible because most patients do not know to which agent they are allergic, he said. Regarding inhaler use, Dr Rashid stressed that the best way of delivering asthma medicines to the lungs is through inhalers, which are also much easier than injections, tablets or syrups. He said that the mainstay of the asthma treatment is in form of inhalers (pump). He said that two types of medicines can be delivered through inhaler, the first is quick relief medicines known as bronchodilators and the other group is called presenters and these are anti-inflammatory agents which include steroids.He added that these medicines when taken regularly prevent asthma attacks. Dispelling fears about the use of steroids, he said that steroid taken in the inhaled form is very safe and currently the best available medicines for the prevention of asthma attacks. Dr Rashid said that the proper understanding of the disease and appropriate use of medicines can control asthma symptoms and an asthma patient can live a normal life like any other healthy person. He suggested the asthma patients that they (patients), should eat a balanced diet.He advised that any person suffering from a cough and chest pain for more than three weeks or fever for over two weeks or presenting unexplained weight loss or blood stained sputum, must consult an expert for diagnosis Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"Pakistan: 'Asthma cases rising due to urbanisation, industrialisation'","KARACHI, May 9 -- The number of asthma cases is on the rise most likely because of industrialisation and urbanisation, said health experts of the Aga Khan University on Tuesday./They were speaking at an awareness session held to observe the World Asthma Day, which takes place on the first Tuesday of May./Experts said asthma is a serious health problem that affects around 300 million people of all ages around the world. ""Five percent of adults and 10 percent of children suffer from the disease in Pakistan.""/Breathlessness, coughing, wheezing and chest discomfort are some of the key symptoms of asthma./Genetics and environmental influences appear to play a major role in the disease's development. However, people can contract asthma even in the absence of known risk factors./Generally, the disease first manifests itself in childhood or adolescence, but adult-onset asthma can also occur./Triggers that can set off asthma attacks include air pollution, tobacco smoke, pollen, dust mite, animal dander and chemical irritants in the workplace./Measures to avoid these triggers are an integral part of keeping the symptoms under control./Strategies include removal of carpets and pets from the living environment, avoidance of exposure to smoke and irritants, and regular changes in bedding and drapes./A thorough history and physical examination, supplemented by the use of spirometry (the most common of the pulmonary function tests), is essential in establishing the diagnosis of asthma./Other medical conditions can be mistaken for asthma and it is important for the physician to assess them prior to diagnosing asthma./Dr Javaid Ahmed Khan (Professor, Department of Medicine) said medications - including inhalers, pills, allergy shots and other injectable drugs - and allergen avoidance constitute the foundation of therapy./Khan emphasised the importance of using daily medications in patients with frequent (biweekly or more) or night-time symptoms to establish and maintain control of the disease./""Inhalers continue to remain the most essential mode of asthma treatment, are safe to use and minimise side-effects compared to systemic steroid therapy.""/He said pollution levels in almost all of Pakistan's major cities are nearly 10 times higher than recommended, as published by the World Health Organisation./""Similarly, tobacco smoke pollution in Pakistani hotels and restaurants is 10 times more than the acceptable amount.""/He emphasised the need to enforce government laws that ban cigarette smoking in public places and keep vehicles with excessive exhaust fumes off the road Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Air pollution to insulin resistance risk:Study,"ISLAMABAD, May 23 -- Children who live in areas with air traffic pollution are threatened by higher risk of insulin resistance that can lead to diabetes in adults, a new study suggested. According to the study on 400 participants of 10-year-old conducted by German researchers, air pollutants are oxidizers that can impact on lipids and proteins in the blood. /To measure the participated kids' glucose and insulin, they were asked for blood sampling,Press TV Reported. The findings have demonstrated ""insulin resistance climbed by 17 percent for every 10.6 micrograms per cubic meter increase in ambient nitrogen dioxide and by 19 percent for every 6 micrograms per cubic meter increase in particulate matter."" Birth weight, body mass index (BMI) and exposure to second-hand smoke at home were also taken into account in the research results. ""Exposure to fine pollution particles that invade the breathing system and get into the heart and blood vessels increases inflammation, which may be linked to insulin resistance,"" clarified one of the study authors Joachim Heinrich of the German Research Center for Environmental Health. Some experts believe that a larger study is required to confirm the possible link between air pollution and insulin resistance. In the recent study ""the measurements of blood insulin levels and estimates of pollution were taken at different times, so the findings should be regarded with caution,"" said Jon Ayres, a professor of environmental and respiratory medicine at the University of Birmingham in England Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Adoption of CDM in brick industry urged,"ISLAMABAD, June 19 -- Increasing air pollution needs adoption of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in brick industry that can effectively help cope with this rising challenge./The environmentalists showed dissatisfaction over failure of a plan that was initially prepared by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) to remove 95 brick kilns operating in the capital city and provide alternative business opportunities to owners under CDM mechanism.The plan was aimed at paving the way for a campaign to effectively help reduce carbon emission in the air and give better living conditions for mostly poor labourers./According to official data, the government had offered owners of brick kilns to shun outdated methods and adopt CDM measures to establish their business at alternative locations on modern lines without posing any threat to the natural environment. But, later the devolution of the environment ministry resulted in failure of this ambitious plan./If owners shun old practices and manufacture industry material with low level of carbon emission under CDM mechanism then they would be able to earn carbon credits and sell these out in the international market./The fine particulate matters emitted from brick kilns are amongst the most harmful air pollutants. When inhaled, these particles evade the respiratory system's natural defence and lodge deep in the lungs and cause asthma, aggravate bronchitis and other respiratory diseases as well as reduce the body's ability to fight infections/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

Pakistan: Prenatal exposure to pollution may increase autism risk in kids: study,"ISLAMABAD, June 20 -- Women exposed to high levels of air pollution while pregnant were up to twice as likely to have a child with autism as women who lived in areas with low pollution, according to a U.S. study. Exposure to diesel particulates, lead, manganese, mercury, methylene chloride and other pollutants are known to affect brain function and to affect the developing baby. Two smaller, regional studies in the U.S. have found possible associations between air pollution and autism risk. /The latest research, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, however, is the first large national study to examine the links, according to researchers from the Harvard University. ""Our findings raise concerns since, depending on the pollutant, 20 percent to 60 percent of the women in our study lived in areas where risk of autism was elevated,"" lead author Andrea Roberts, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, said in a statement. The researchers examined data from a long-term study involving 116,430 nurses that began in 1989. Among that group, the authors studied 325 women who had a child with autism and 22,000 women who had a child without the disorder. To estimate women's exposure to pollutants while pregnant, they used air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and adjusted for the influence of factors such as income, education, and smoking during pregnancy. The results showed that women who lived in locations with the highest levels of diesel particulates or mercury in the air were twice as likely to have a child with autism as those who lived in areas with the lowest levels. Other types of air pollution, lead, manganese, methylene chloride, and combined metal exposure, were associated with higher autism risk as well. Women who lived in locations with the highest levels of these pollutants were about 50 percent more likely to have a child with autism than those who lived in areas with the lowest concentrations. Most pollutants were associated with autism more strongly in boys than girls. However, since there were few girls with autism in the study, the authors said this finding should be examined further. ""Our results suggest that new studies should begin the process of measuring metals and other pollutants in the blood of pregnant women or newborn children to provide stronger evidence that specific pollutants increase risk of autism,""said senior author Marc Weisskopf, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.
