Take urgent measures to make the city safe,"Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- DHAKA was ranked fourth worst city in Air Quality Index yesterday as its air was classified as unhealthy as it had a score of 169. India's Delhi and Pakistan's Lahore were the top two cities in the list with scores of 494 and 269 respectively while Kolkata ranked third with 172 points. The dwellers of these cities will have to experience health effects as the AQI value usually remains there between 151 and 200. In this situation, children and adults, and people with respiratory diseases, such as asthma, are advised to avoid prolonged outdoor exertion. The air quality is categorised as good when AQI score remains between 0-50 while the air is moderate when AQI is 51 to 100 but when AQI is in between 101 and 150, it is classified as unhealthy./News media reported, millions of people in New Delhi are now passing their days choking through 'eye-burning' smog, with schools closed, cars taken off the road and construction halted. The poisonous haze has caused by vehicle fumes, industrial emissions and smoke from agricultural burning. There is smoke everywhere and people, including youngsters, kids, elderly are finding it difficult to breathe. Obviously, the situation in Indian capital is more hazardous than Dhaka. But there is nothing to become happy for us. Though Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution, no effective measures were taken to get rid of the situation. The Global Liveability Index 2019 placed Dhaka as the third least livable city in the world, just after war-torn Syrian capital Damascus and Lagos. The same index of the previous year (2018) ranked Dhaka as the world's second least livable city. We fear Dhaka will have to face more problematic situation than that of New Delhi if urgent measures are not taken in this regard./The government needs to take long-term plan-programmes to tackle such a large-scale pollution. We do urge the authorities concerned to impose emissions restrictions on motorbikes, scooters, and old vehicles without fitness which are heavily used in the city. Side by side, other measures also should be taken to keep the situation under control./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Take urgent measures to check Dhaka's air pollution,"Dhaka, Nov. 27 -- BANGLADESH'S capital city ranked the World's worst again in Air Quality Index on Tuesday morning. Dhaka had a score of 242 at 8:00am, which means the air quality was 'very unhealthy'. India's Kolkata, Pakistan's Lahore and Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar occupied the next three slots scoring 211, 198 and 198 respectively. When the AQI value is between 201 and 300, the city dwellers may have experienced its effects on health. In this situation, it's better for children, adults and people with respiratory diseases to avoid outdoor activities. Dhaka, Bangladesh's overcrowded capital, has been grappling with air pollution for a long time. There are many reasons for deteriorating air quality. At least a thousand brick kilns have been step up in and around the city and that is one of the major reasons behind making the air quality bad. Series of construction works - especially public constructions like flyovers and road repairing -- are other major reasons. Vehicles run on fuel with higher level of sulfur which has been identified as another source of air pollution in the city./The solution for all is pretty simple--while public infrastructure projects can't be stopped regular use of water trucks to spray the roads during construction should be implemented at all such junctures. Regarding the brick kilns a more drastic solution must be found--they should relocate to areas with at least a 50 km radius outside of Dhaka. However, country's apex court on Tuesday directed to stop activities of all brick kilns adjacent to Dhaka within next 15 days. Despite the enactment of a law in 2018 to make these kilns environment friendly, a recent report indicated that of the 7,772 brick kilns in the country, 2,123 have not converted to the required modern and environment-friendly technology./It becomes a common habit of us that we don't pay attention to any crisis until it goes out of control. Protective measures are needed to save the people from the adverse effect of air pollution. The sooner the better./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"Hidden Impacts Of Fossil Fuels On Plants, Animals","Dhaka, Nov. 28 -- The term ""fossil fuel"" refers to a natural fuel source that forms from the remains of living organisms. The substances which act as energy sources are known as fuels. The buried organic matters which can be converted to crude oil, coal, natural gas or any heavy oils by applying pressure and heat on earth's crust over hundreds of years are known as fossil fuels. Humans access fossil fuels today by drilling and mining into the earth to extract them from rocks and geologic formations./According to the US Department of Energy, they supply nearly 90 percent of our energy. They are widely-used, easily accessible and even easier to transport. But, this dependency on fossil fuels is one of the major causes of climate change. Burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide, which causes air pollution. Because of that, calls to minimize their use, and transition to using renewable energy instead have increased./The utilization of coal, petroleum, natural gas and uranium are much higher in developed countries than developing. USA, China, Russia, Japan and India use more fossil fuels and emit limitless CO2 (Carbon-di-oxide) which is contributing global warming and altering climatic scenario. Climate change effects will be the cause of suffering of the various sectors of the country including agriculture, industry, infrastructure, livelihoods, marine resources, forestry, biodiversity, human health and utility services./Combustion of fossil fuels generates sulfuric, carbonic, and nitric acids, which fall to Earth as acid rain, impacting both natural areas and the built environment. Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly uranium and thorium, which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 tonnes of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island accident./In 2016, roughly 78% of global warming emissions from the US were energy-related of CO2, made up of the fossil fuels we talked about earlier. According to NASA, the rise in temperature has created an effect with potentially dire consequences, specifically: the rise in sea level, melting of glaciers and polar ice caps, extreme weather conditions, and shifting climate patterns or climate change. Evidence shows that the world is indeed getting hotter every day. Evidence shows that the earth's average temperature has gone up 1.4deg F over the past century. A study shows that the melting of ice in Antarctica has soared by 75% in just ten years, which thereby increases sea level. The melting of polar ice caps, glaciers and rise in sea level point to some of the negative effects of climate change./Carbon fuels such as wood, coal, petroleum release un-burnt carbon particles in the environment. These particles are very dangerous pollutants and cause respiratory diseases for example asthma./When fuels are incompletely burnt, they release carbon monoxide gas into the atmosphere. This gas is very dangerous as it is poisonous in nature. If we burn coal in a closed room, then the person sleeping in that room will be killed by the action of carbon monoxide./The combustion of fossil fuels also releases a large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is responsible for global warming. Global warming is a rise in the overall temperature of earth's surface. This leads to melting of polar caps and rise in the sea level and further results in flooding of coastal regions./Burned coal and diesel releases sulphur dioxide gas. This gas is extremely corrosive and suffocating in nature. Petrol gives off oxides of nitrogen. The oxides of sulfur and nitrogen get dissolved in rainwater and form acids. This is known as acid rain. This water is very harmful to plants, animals, and physical infrastructure./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Hazards to lung health due to air pollution,"Dhaka, Dec. 9 -- Dhaka's air quality worsened alarmingly and the capital ranked No. 1 in the Air Quality Index across the world recently. According to government sources, brick kilns, construction work, road-digging and excess transport are the major causes of the air pollution./There are 7902 brick kilns across the country and most of them are located around the capital, said the sources. Children, adults and people with respiratory diseases have been advised to avoid outdoor activities while others advised to limit their outdoor works in such a situation./As Dhaka ranked worst in the Air Quality Index, the High Court on Tuesday came forward expressing its grave concerns and issued a set of directives to identify the causes of air pollution and formulate a guideline to reduce it in and around the capital./The HC bench also ordered the government to conduct mobile court drives to shut down illegal brick kilns in five districts within 15 days to bring down air pollution level. It also asked the authorities to take steps to remove dust from flyovers and areas undergoing development./The World Bank and the Department of Environment (DoE) reported recently on air pollution in Dhaka city where brick fields were blamed mostly for the air pollution./Health experts said that such pollution create scope to respiratory diseases, which are among the leading causes of significant health burden across the world, including Bangladesh. Air pollution, negative effect of climate change and tobacco smoking pose a serious and increasing threat and responsible for creating lung diseases like COPD, lung cancer and respiratory infections, they said./The information was revealed at a high level health conference, which concluded in the capital recently. In a bid to promote lung health, the 6th International Conference on Lung Health titled 'PULMOCON 2019' ended in the capital./Organized by Bangladesh Lung Foundation (BLF) at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, the conference theme this year has been selected as ""Battle for breaths: Achieving excellence in lung health""./About 1300 physicians from 18 countries, including Bangladesh, attended the three-day event when a good number of workshops and scientific sessions were held. The event aimed at disseminating latest developments in pulmonology to the grassroots level./BLF sources said the conference provided a common platform for doctors from home and abroad to exchange their research findings and clinical experiences with the goal of finding ways to treat the diseases more effectively./Prof. Md. Ali Hossain, president of BLF, BLF general secretary Dr. Asif Mujtaba Mahmud, BLF Founding Member Prof. Md. Ruhul Amin, Congress Chair of PULMOCON Prof. Md. Rashidul Hassan, among others, spoke on the occasion./Addressing at the event, health experts termed respiratory diseases as one of the leading causes of health burden worldwide, including in Bangladesh./Some 68,462 or 8.69% of the total deaths are caused by lung disease in Bangladesh annually. Annually Asthma alone affects 70 lakh people, the incidence of tuberculosis in Bangladesh is 221 per 100,000 population and 70,000 Bangladeshis die from tuberculosis, they observed./Citing a study of BLF, they said in Bangladesh a good number of working-age groups are suffering from different respiratory diseases like asthma, COPD, TB and lung malignancies. Terming air pollution, climate change and tobacco smoking for creating threat to lung health, they called for taking up a pragmatic action plan to face the challenge of rising mortality and morbidity due to respiratory diseases, which will soon strike the third leading cause of death globally by 2020./To combat the threat, it is needed to organize multiple awareness programmes, they observed./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Chattogram needs proper medical waste treatment,"Dhaka, Dec. 18 -- NONE of the 88 hospitals and 182 diagnostic centres operating in Chattogram doesn't dispose clinical waste properly due to lack of incinerator facilities. The two government hospitals -- Chattogram Medical College Hospital and Chattogram General Hospital -- also do not have incinerator machines to burn the medical waste into ashes, a local daily recently reported. Usually, the clinical wastes have to collect separately to dispose with incinerator to avoid possible health hazard. If clinical waste is not disposed separately, it may pose risk of communicable diseases and infections to others, such as Pneumonia, diarrhoea, tetanus, hepatitis B and C and even HIV/AIDS. There is a large possibility of contamination in the surroundings, if the wastes are dumped in waterbody, marshland and other places without proper treatment./What's most dangerous is that one private organisation, Chattogram Seba Sangstha, which works to dispose clinical waste from some hospitals and diagnostic centres also haven't incinerator machine. So, they dispose the waste in a landfill of the Chattogram City Corporation in Halishahar. The organisation uses pit-hole method to burn the wastes that causes air pollution. On the other hand, the rest hospitals and diagnostic centres which do not have contracts with Seba Sangstha dispose of medical waste together with general waste. It's highly surprising how the authorities concerned could be so careless about the evident health hazard. Apart from CMCH, there are a dozen of big-budgeted multi-storied private hospitals and diagnostic centres in Chattogram where treatment is also highly expensive. They can easily afford incinerators, which is an essential part of their business. But they're not interested in public health, rather they're interested is making money cutting pocket of patients./This type of unlawful and unethical practice can't continue for a long time without support of Directorate General of Health Services and Department of Environment. This must end./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Air Pollution,"Dhaka, Dec. 21 -- Air pollution has become a burning issue nowadays. The quality of air we breathe is getting worst day by day and now it reaches at the most hazardous level. According to the real time Air Quality Index (AQI) published by US Consulate ""The Air Quality Index of Dhaka is ranges from 150 to 200 which is categorized as unhealthy"". This means that the air is totally unhealthy for public health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) ""every year around 7million people die as a result of air pollution"" which is a shocking statistics for us. WHO also said that 90% of the world population is exposed to toxic air. It indicates that air pollution is now a silent public health emergency./What are the harmful effects of air pollution on human body?/According to the Guardian report air pollution affects all the organ of human body. Research shows head-to-toe harm, from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. Fertility, foetuses and children are also affected by toxic air. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body and ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. Air pollution can harm acutely, as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body. Ultrafine particles pass through the lungs, are readily picked up by cells, and carried via the bloodstream to expose virtually all cells in the body. Organ that are affected by air pollution is described in the following-/Lungs and heart/The harmful effects of dirty air begin when the pollution is inhaled. This results in breathing problems, from asthma to emphysema to lung cancer. There is now overwhelming evidence that air pollution results in serious harm not only to the lungs, but also to the heart. Here it increases the risk of heart attacks as arteries narrow and muscles weaken. One reason for the wide-ranging damage from air pollution is that very small particles can penetrate the lungs and be carried around the body. They land in the organs directly./Brain and mind/Strokes, dementia and reduced intelligence are all conditions affecting the brain that have been linked to air pollution. There is also evidence that poor sleep can be a consequence of breathing toxic air. The main reason for the far-reaching damage from air pollution is systemic inflammation/Abdominal organs/Among the many other organs affected is the liver. Research also highlighted that air pollution is linked to numerous cancers, including in the bladder and the gut, where an increase in irritable bowel syndrome has also been found. Even skin and bones are affected, with skin ageing, hives and brittle bones associated with toxic air./Reproduction, babies and children/Perhaps the most disturbing impact of toxic air is the damage to reproduction and children. Fertility is reduced and miscarriages increased by exposure to air pollution. The unborn are also affected, with a recent study finding pollutants in the placentas that nourish foetuses. Air pollution is also strongly linked to low birth weights for babies, which has lifelong consequences. Children are especially vulnerable, the review found, as their bodies are still developing. Exposure to dirty air leads to stunted lungs, increases in childhood obesity, leukemia and mental health problems./Air pollution is also linked to depression and suicide said by The Guardian. It crystal clear to us that air pollution must be controlled at any cost as quickly as possible./How can we limit breathing in polluted air?/According to World Health Organization (WHO) there are five ways to limit breathing polluted air -/o Limit walking on busy streets during rush hour - and if you have a young child with you, try and lift them up above the level of vehicle exhausts/o Limit spending time at specific hotspots of traffic such as cars stopped at traffic lights/o When you're doing physical activity outdoors, try exercising in less polluted areas/o Limit the use of cars in highly polluted days/o Don't burn waste as the smoke that results damages our health/How can we reduce air pollution?/Renewable fuel and clean energy production/The most basic solution for air pollution is to move away from fossil fuels, replacing them with alternative energies like solar, wind and geothermal./Energy conservation and efficiency/Producing clean energy is crucial. But equally important is to reduce our consumption of energy by adopting responsible habits and using more efficient devices./Eco-friendly transportation/Shifting to electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles, and promoting shared mobility (i.e carpooling, and public transports) could reduce air pollution./Green building/From planning to demolition, green building aims to create environmentally responsible and resource-efficient structures to reduce their carbon footprint./To ensure SDG3 we must ensure safe and pollution free air for healthy living and to promote wellbeing. It's our right to breathe in clean and safe air. Let's work for ourselves. Save air, save life./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Hidden Killer,"Dhaka, Dec. 26 -- Quite environment is considered to be a basic requirement for human leaving with a good health and well-being. However, Noise pollution continues to pose a significant threat to public mental health worldwide. Our health is strongly influenced by the surrounding environment condition; Noise is one of the major part of environment. Nowadays researcher alarm to us about harmful effect of noise pollution, silent environment improve life span. It has become the predominant causes of several diseases in Bangladesh like child development, Hypertension, hearing loss etc./According to United Nation World Health Organisation (WHO) Noise pollution is generally defined as regular exposure to elevated sound levels that may lead to adverse effects in humans or other living organisms. According to the World Health Organization, sound levels less than 70 dB are not damaging to living organisms, regardless of how long or consistent the exposure is. Exposure for more than 8 hours to constant noise beyond 85 dB may be hazardous. If you work for 8 hours daily in close proximity to a busy road or highway, you are very likely exposed to traffic noise pollution around 85dB./A government survey shows that sound levels, in every divisional city of Bangladesh, have surpassed their permitted limits. In some places, noise levels are double and sometimes thrice the permissible levels./According to the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2006, acceptable sound levels are 55 decibels for daytime - 6am to 9pm -and 45 decibels for night - 9pm to 6am - in residential areas; 50 decibels for daytime and 40 decibels for night in quiet places; 60 decibels for daytime and 50 decibels for night in mixed areas; 70 decibels for daytime and 60 decibels for night in commercial areas; and 75 decibels for daytime and 70 decibels for night in industrial areas./Main causes of Noise pollution/Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include/o Street traffic sounds from cars, buses, pedestrians, ambulances etc./o Construction sounds like drilling or other heavy machinery in operation/o Airports, with constant elevated sounds from air traffic, i.e. planes taking off or landing/o Workplace sounds, often common in open-space offices/o Constant loud music in or near commercial venues/o Industrial sounds like fans, generators, compressor, and mills/o Train stations traffic/o Household sounds, from the television set to music playing on the stereo or computer, vacuum cleaners, fans and coolers, washing machines, dishwashers, lawnmowers etc./o Events involving fireworks, firecrackers, loudspeakers etc./o Conflicts generate noise pollution through explosions, gunfire etc. The dysfunctions, in this case, are likely caused by the conflict and insecurity and less by the noise pollution in itself, although that compounds stress levels too./How Noise Is Pollution A 'Hidden Killer'?/Some experts ironically refer to noise as a 'silent killer, affecting both physical and mental health'. Although noise is recognized as a major environmental stressor, there is a lack of sufficient research on its association to mental health. The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) carried out an investigation on 15,000 people aged 35 to 74 to assess the noise annoyance from traffic, industrials sites, aircrafts, railways and neighbourhoods (during the day and during sleep hours). Results found that depression and anxiety increased with the degree of overall noise annoyance, with aircrafts leading - affecting 60% of the participants. Strong noise annoyance was linked with higher prevalence of depression and anxiety, while severe annoyance has been linked with reduced well-being and health./Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) has also been associated with noise pollution. According to India's Central Pollution Control Board CPCB report (2016) high noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects, while exposure to moderately high levels can cause a rise in blood pressure./New research found that long-term exposure to traffic noise may account for approximately 210,000 deaths in Europe each year. A 2007 issue of Science of the Total Environment found an 80% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for women with a sensitivity to noise - revealing noise sensitivity as a serious factor in cardiovascular mortality in women./Child development is also greatly affected, as expressed by Dr. Eoin King - assistant professor of acoustics and author of the book Environmental Noise Pollution: ""Studies considering the effect that noise may have on children have found that tasks such as reading, attention span, problem-solving and memory appear to be most affected by exposure to noise.""/Dementia isn't necessarily caused by noise pollution, but its onset can be favored or compounded by noise pollution./Psychological dysfunctions and noise annoyance. Noise annoyance is, in fact, a recognized name for an emotional reaction that can have an immediate impact./Hearing loss can be directly caused by noise pollution, whether listening to loud music in your headphones or being exposed to loud drilling noises at work, heavy air or land traffic or separate incidents in which noise levels reach dangerous intervals, such as around140 dB for adult or 120 dB for children./Sleep disturbances are usually caused by constant air or land traffic at night, and they are a serious condition in that they can affect everyday performance and lead to serious diseases./How we can eliminate noise pollution?/""The most effective way to control noise is at the source. If we could make planes, trains and cars quieter we would solve a lot of our problems,"" says Dr. Eoin King...going to the source of the noise will produce longer lasting solutions. Using a multidisciplinary approach to tackling ways to reduce the noise levels of the main sources of noise pollution will largely influence the rates of noise and air pollution, therefore lowering premature deaths - greatly improving urban health and wellbeing./Reduce Car Usage: Banning, Prevention and Alternatives/Mumbai, which is considered the noisiest city in the world due to traffic, has targeted its motorists in an attempt to lower their record 110 decibel noise levels. Since 2016 these levels are reportedly improving due to bans on honking and governmental measures such as fines. In addition, in 2017 the regional transport offices of the Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Department (MMVD) started a 15-day drive as a campaign to raise awareness on the dangers of noise pollution./In 2015 Paris also cracked down on its noise pollution and implemented a car-free day - a car ban applied to 30 percent of the capital city which led to a dramatic drop in both air and noise pollution. This encouraged the mayor's office to plan more vehicle-free days which would improve not only noise levels but air quality./Although these are commendable efforts, limiting car traffic should be also be combined with promoting alternative methods of transportation such as light rail systems, electric cars and buses, which produce less pollutants. Reducing speed limits could also greatly improve the rate of noise in busy city centers./Integrating Trees as Sound Barriers/Planting more trees and greenery in cities has been proven to improve air quality as well as mental health. It is also an efficient way to combat noise pollution in busy cities, as trees absorb sound and can create buffer zones between roads and residential areas./Revisiting Urban Planning & Industrial Policy/In India the urban development authority of every city make efforts to delineate noisy polluted industrial areas from residential areas; however, deviations from the master plan are rampant across the country. This results in industrial facilities being built in residential areas, disturbing the peace of unassuming residents. In order to spark change, community effort will be necessary to encourage policy makers to follow the master plan. Sound insulation in industrial buildings located in residential areas may be an alternative solution./Special Tips for Avoiding Noise Pollution in personal level/o Wear earplugs whenever exposed to elevated noise levels/o Maintain a level of around 35 dB in your bedroom at night, and around 40 dB in your house during the day/o If possible, choose your residential area as far removed from heavy traffic as you can/o Avoid prolonged use of earphones, especially at elevated sound levels/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

In this situation, children and adults, and people with respiratory diseases, such as asthma, are advised to avoid prolonged outdoor exertion. The air quality is categorised as good when AQI score remains between 0-50 while the air is moderate when AQI is 51 to 100 but when AQI is in between 101 and 150, it is classified as unhealthy./According to media report, millions of people in New Delhi have to pass their days choking through 'eye-burning' smog, with schools closed, cars taken off the road and construction halted.

"Air Pollution Causes, Effects And Remedies","Dhaka, Dec. 31 -- Bangladesh has one of the highest exposure levels to air pollution globally. Recently Dhaka ranked worst position in air quality. Air pollution has occurred both due to natural phenomenon such as wind-blown dust particles etc. and human activities. Vehicular emissions and industrial emissions are two main sources of air pollution./The main components of air pollution are ambient particulate matter pollution, household air pollution, and smaller extent ozone in the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere). Coal-burning for thermal power production, industry emissions, brick kilns, construction activity, road dust, transport vehicles, residential and commercial biomass burning, waste burning, and agricultural stubble burning are the major ambient particulate matter pollution sources in Bangladesh./Household air pollution is caused mainly by the residential burning of solid fuels for cooking and to some extent heating, the main types of wood, dung, agricultural residues, coal, and charcoal etc./The other source of air pollution is the dust stirred up by construction activities and vehicles plying the roads, including the transportation of soil and sand./Growing concerns over the poor air quality eventually prompted the judiciary to step in as the court ordered the authorities to spray water in dust-prone areas of the city twice a day in a bid to curb pollution. Spraying water alone will not improve the situation as the amount of dust increases during the dry season when there is also a shortage of water, said Masud Rana, a former adviser to the CASE project. Air pollution contributes substantially to premature mortality and disease burden globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 98 per cent cities of low- and middle-income countries do not meet the WHO air quality guidelines. However, in a study on the air quality standards of 3,000 cities in 103 countries, some major Bangladeshi cities like Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Chattogram, Barishal, Khulna and Sylhet were placed at the top of the list./In general, air quality of these cities has a high impact on public health, increasing chances of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma. Various diseases and the risk is aggravated by the deteriorating air quality during winter, according to experts./Rising pollution levels increase the risk of respiratory diseases, said Prof ABM Abdullah, dean of the Department of Medicine at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University./In our capital and other cities, we face an increasing level of dust pollutants around us, which is gradually becoming a serious health hazard with other pollutants in the air. Brick kilns, solid waste, construction (road and building mainly), and transportation system should even be kept in mind in order that air pollution cannot occur./A lack of coordination between different departments of the government is further hampering efforts to control air pollution, said a Department of Environment official./The government's initiative to reduce air pollution has been labelled 'inadequate' by Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon's General Secretary Abu Naser./However, to get a better response in city air quality management an integrated system has to be developed. We have many constructive policies, rules and regulations for air quality management, but very much unfortunate that we lack implementation of compliance and enforcement./Usually, our policymakers take a conventional regulatory approach to the air control system. In Bangladesh, very few works have been done on air quality measurements. The government should strengthen vehicle emission standards, regulations and enforcement./On a personal level, citizens also can help to reduce air pollution. For example, they can drive less or wisely (e.g. avoiding unnecessary driving, using fuel-efficient vehicles and public transports, walking, cycling, etc.), promote plantation (e.g. growing trees, gardening, etc.), and also ensure sustainable manner waste disposal./We should Cover construction sites, phase out unfit and outdated vehicles, less sulphur-containing diesel usage, phase out burnt brick etc. With proper guidance, knowledge and motivation, the general public is often made a crucial part of air quality management./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"Intolerable sound, air pollution in Port City","Dhaka, Feb. 18 -- Air and sound pollution in the port city has reached an intolerable level, making the city dwellers suffer from different complicated diseases.Air pollution caused by emission of black smokes from unfit vehicles and dust from open space result in the increase of bronchitis, asthma and respiratory related diseases among the city dwellers for years. Physicians fear that if the situation continues, respiratory diseases will increase manifold among the city residents./Besides, people of different strata in the city are passing hard time tolerating sound pollution created by the hydraulic horns of vehicles, power generators and wielding engineering workshops located in and around residential areas. Experts said sound pollutions had reached nearly 200 decibel (dB) against its tolerable level of 60 (dB).Meanwhile, environmentalists said air pollution from thousands of unfit vehicles reached 100 percent against 65 percent, the maximum tolerable level of Hartridge Smoke Unit (HSU).ENT specialist Dr Abdus Sattar said continuous sound pollution might deafen the children as well as the adults./According to government guidelines, wielding engineering and lead machines, iron factories and generators must be set up at least one kilometre away from residences and power generators must be set up underground, which remain unheeded./Over 32,000 unfit light and heavy vehicles have been plying the roads of Chattogram division without fitness certificates, which emit black smokes, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), Chittagong office source said./Mizanur Rahman, Additional Deputy Commissioner (traffic), said the unfit vehicles not only polluted air and sound but also contributed to traffic jams and road accidents. He underscored the need for combined efforts by the traffic department and BRTA to check the vehicles./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Pollution In Environment Needs To Be Stopped,"Dhaka, March 1 -- When natural environment contaminated by the different kinds pollutants is known as environmental pollution. The components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Major forms of pollution include: Air pollution, light pollution, littering, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, water pollution./Air pollution is the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. The over abundance of electromagnetic radiation in their non-ionizing form like radio waves, etc. that people are constantly exposed at, especially in large cities causes electromagnetic pollution./Light pollution includes light trespass, over-illumination and astronomical interference. Plastic pollution involves the accumulation of plastic products and micro plastics in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans. Soil contamination occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage. Among the most significant soil contaminants are hydrocarbons, heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides and chlorinated hydrocarbons./Water pollution occurs by the discharge of wastewater from commercial and industrial waste into surface waters; discharges of untreated domestic sewage, and chemical contaminants, such as chlorine, from treated sewage; release of waste and contaminants into surface runoff flowing to surface waters (including urban runoff and agricultural runoff, which may contain chemical fertilizers and pesticides; also including human feces from open defecation); groundwater pollution from waste disposal and leaching into the ground, including from pit latrines and septic tanks and littering./Air pollution comes from both natural and human-made sources. However, globally human-made pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation. Motor vehicle emissions are one of the leading causes of air pollution. China, United States, Russia, India, Mexico, and Japan are the world leaders in air pollution emissions. Principal stationary pollution sources include chemical plants, coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, petrochemical plants, nuclear waste disposal activity, incinerators, large livestock farms, PVC factories, metals production factories, plastics factories, and other heavy industry./Adverse air quality can kill many organisms, including humans. Ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, throat inflammation, chest pain, and congestion. Water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day, mostly due to contamination of drinking water by untreated sewage in developing countries. Oil spills can cause skin irritations and rashes. Noise pollution induces hearing loss, high blood pressure, stress, and sleep disturbance. Mercury has been linked to developmental deficits in children and neurologic symptoms. Older people are majorly exposed to diseases induced by air pollution. Those with heart or lung disorders are at additional risk. Children and infants are also at serious risk. Lead and other heavy metals have been shown to cause neurological problems. Chemical and radioactive substances can cause cancer and as well as birth defects./An October 2017 study by the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health found that global pollution, specifically toxic air, water, soils and workplaces, kill nine million people annually, which is triple the number of deaths caused by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and 15 times higher than deaths caused by wars and other forms of human violence. The study concluded that ""pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the Anthropocene era. Pollution endangers the stability of the Earth's support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies.""/Carbon dioxide emissions cause ocean acidification. The emission of greenhouse gases leads to global warming which affects ecosystems in many ways. Nitrogen oxides are removed from the air by rain which can change the species composition of ecosystems. Smog and haze can reduce the amount of sunlight received by plants to carry out photosynthesis and leads to the production of tropospheric ozone which damages plants. Soil can become infertile and unsuitable for plants. This will affect other organisms in the food web. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause acid rain which lowers the pH value of soil. Organic pollution of watercourses can deplete oxygen levels and reduce species diversity./The earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence. The attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of natural selection. These would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately, species extinction. Processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations. At the extremes, for any form of life, consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival./In environmental management pollution control is a term that means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil. Without pollution control, the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control. In the field of land development, low impact development is a similar technique for the prevention of urban runoff./""The solution to pollution is dilution"", is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful. It is well-suited to some other modern, locally scoped applications such as laboratory safety procedure and hazardous material release emergency management. Such simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative, human population and densities were lower, technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign./Yet in the absence of a superseding principle, this older approach predominates practices throughout the world. One such superseding principle is contained in modern hazardous waste laws in developed countries, as the process of diluting hazardous waste to make it non-hazardous is usually a regulated treatment process. Migration from pollution dilution to elimination in many cases can be confronted by challenging economical and technological barriers./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Public Health Condition Needs To Be Improved,"Dhaka, March 23 -- In South-East Asia, the main public health issues are infectious diseases and communicable diseases. Public health has improved markedly in Bangladesh over the past three decades. Nevertheless, Bangladesh faces major health challenges. Bangladesh has one of the worst burdens of childhood malnutrition in the world. Communicable diseases are a major cause of death and disability in Bangladesh. Unsafe food remains a major threat to public health each year; citizens suffer from the acute effects of food contaminated by microbial pathogens, chemical substances and toxins. Bangladesh still ranks among the top ten countries in the world with the highest TB burden. Pneumonia and other infections are major causes of death among young children. In Bangladesh, only 1% of the population is reported to be HIV-positive, but rates are much higher among high-risk populations: injecting drug users, sex workers, and men who have sex with men. The toll of non-communicable diseases-chronic diseases, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases - is increasing in Bangladesh as the population becomes more urbanized. The converging pressures of global climate change and urbanization have a devastating effect on Bangladesh's most vulnerable populations. The disease burden Bangladesh is further exacerbated by unsanitary living conditions that underscore the poor economic conditions of both urban and rural home dwellers./There are still several issues that Bangladesh health care system is yet to tackle governance, accessibility, and affordability are key issues that are preventing the implementation of solutions to the public health issues in Bangladesh. ICDDRB, WHO, and several other global organizations are making attempt to aid Bangladesh in resolving its health problems. The converging pressures of global climate change and urbanization have a devastating effect on Bangladesh's most vulnerable populations. At this moment, millions of people in the country are exposed to extremely high food and water-borne disease risks such as bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, Hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever. The disease burden Bangladesh is further exacerbated by unsanitary living conditions that under-score the poor economic conditions of both urban and rural home dwellers. Sadly, these poor health outcomes disproportionately affect children under the age of five years, causing widespread morbidity and mortality; the second leading cause of death in children under five is diarrheal disease./It is now widely accepted that climate change is occurring because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere arising from the combustion of fossil fuels. Climate change may affect health through a range of pathways, for example as a result of increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, reduction in cold related deaths, increased floods and droughts, changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases and effects on the risk of disasters and malnutrition. The overall balance of effects on health is likely to be negative and populations in low-income countries are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects. The experience of the 2003 heat wave in Europe shows that high-income countries may also be adversely affected. Adaptation to climate change requires public health strategies and improved surveillance. Mitigation of climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing a number of uses of the renewable energy technologies should improve health in the near-term by reducing exposure to air pollution./A good system of regulation is fundamental to successful public health outcomes. It reduces exposure to disease through enforcement of sanitary codes, e.g., water quality monitoring, slaughterhouse hygiene and food safety. Wide gaps exist in the enforcement, monitoring and evaluation, resulting in a weak public health system. This is partly due to poor financing for public health, lack of leadership and commitment of public health functionaries and lack of community involvement. Revival of public health regulation through concerted efforts by the government is possible through updation and implementation of public health laws, consulting stakeholders and increasing public awareness of existing laws and their enforcement procedures./There are several shortfalls that-need to be addressed in the development of human resources for public health services. There is a dire need to establish training facilities for public health specialists along with identifying the scope for their contribution in the field. The Public Health Foundation of India is a positive step to redress the limited institutional capacity in India by strengthening training, research and policy development in public health. Pre-service training is essential to train the medical workforce in public health leadership and to impart skills required for the practice of public health. Changes in the undergraduate curriculum are vital for capacity building in emerging issues like geriatric care, adolescent health and mental health. In-service training for medical officers is essential for imparting management skills and leadership qualities. Equally important is the need to increase the number of paramedical workers and training institutes in Bangladesh./Identification of health objectives and targets is one of the more visible strategies to direct the activities of the health sector, e.g. in the United States, the ""Healthy People 2010"" offers a simple but powerful idea by providing health objectives in a format that enables diverse groups to combine their efforts and work as a team. Similarly, in India, we need a road map to ""better health for all"" that can be used by states, communities, professional organizations and all sectors. It will also facilitate changes in resource allocation for public health interventions and a platform for concerted inter-sectoral action, thereby enabling policy coherence./In this changing world, with unique challenges that threaten the health and well-being of the population, it is imperative that the government and community collectively rise to the occasion and face these challenges simultaneously, inclusively and sustainably. Social determinants of health and economic issues must be dealt with a consensus on ethical principles - universalism, justice, dignity, security and human rights. This approach will be of valuable service to humanity in realizing the dream of Right to Health. The ultimate yardstick for success would be if every Indian, from a remote hamlet in Bihar to the city of Mumbai, experiences the change./It is true that a lot has been achieved in the past. The milestones in the history of public health that have had a telling effect on millions of lives- launch of Expanded Program of Immunisation in 1974, Primary Health Care enunciated at Alma Ata in 1978, eradication of Smallpox in 1979, launch of polio eradication in 1988, FCTC ratification in 2004 and COTPA Act of 2005, to name a few. It was a glorious past, but the future of a healthy India lies in mainstreaming the public health agenda in the framework of sustainable development. The ultimate goal of great nation would be one where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line, with adequate access to clean energy and safe water, where the best of health care is available to all. Where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free, where poverty and illiteracy have been eradicated and crimes against women and children are removed - a healthy nation that is one of the best places to live in./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Impacts Of Coronavirus On Environment,"Dhaka, April 30 -- Although Corona has largely affected mankind yet there are some positive aspects of corona virus. If we pay a close eye to all that is happening around us owing to the spread of this virus, we will notice that all the negative effects of coronavirus are restricted to the mankind only. As far as our co-owners of the earth are concerned, the flora and fauna as well as the nature itself, they are enjoying the positives out of this deadly virus. It seems as if the plants and animals are reclaiming the land that we forgot to share with them or instead snatched away from them. Also, it is quite vivid that environment seems to have pressed the hidden reset button that it had, to replenish itself. Focal points can be categorized as the positive side effects of COVID-19./Air Pollution: Due to the coronavirus outbreak's impact on travel and industry, many regions experienced a drop in air pollution Reducing air pollution can reduce both climate change and COVID-19 risks. .. The centre for research on energy and clean air reported that methods to contain the spread of coronavirus, such as quarantines and travel bans, resulted in a 25 percent reduction of carbon emission in China.., the European space agency observed a marked decline in nitrous oxide emissions from cars, power plants, and factories in the Po valley region in northern Italy, coinciding with lockdowns in the region./Green Gas Emission A study by specialist outlet Carbon Brief found that in China, carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by around 25 percent. The impact on the environment is being noticed as various industries and other types of transport vehicles are already closed in Dhaka and other cities of Bangladesh. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions from the country's cities have been greatly reduced. Last year's temperature was two degrees higher this time than this time./Water pollution: The water of rivers and lakes has become crystal clear due to less uses of water vessels. Another unexpected effect on the environment from the corona virus has been seen in Venice, Italy. With tourists numbers culled because of the virus, the waters in Venice's canals are cleaner than they have been, so much so, in fact, that fish can be seen once again in the canals. India going into lockdown, along the coast of the eastern state of Odisha, over 475,000 endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles have come ashore to dig their nests and lay eggs. Leopards are fond on the roads of California which is a wildfire state of the USA./Livable wildlife: Quarantine measures appear to be having effect on wildlife around the world, as humans are increasingly confined to their homes. In Japan, for example, sika deer living in the popular tourist destination Nara Park were spotted wandering into urban areas to look for food after restrictions on visitors from China and South Korea came into place.. Thailand has also found colorful turtles in its coastal areas.. The roaming of dolphins in Cox's Bazar, the longest beach in the world, is particularly noteworthy./Aquatic resources: Experts say the fish biomass will increase due to the sharp decline in fishing, and projected that in European waters, some fish such as herring could double their biomass./Noise pollution: As more and more of us are spending extended time at home during the pandemic we may be more aware of noise from our neighbors who are also home for longer periods and at different times. Coronavirus lockdown gives animal's rare break from noise pollution/Light pollution: Since people stay at home The uses of lights have been reduced and the spoilage of the aesthetic environment of a place, creating disturbances in the ecosystem, as well as also harming the health of living creatures have also been reduced./Miscellaneous:, the consumption of plastic has also reduced as people no longer have tea or coffee in those disposable glasses. Gas prices have fallen because no one is buying gas because everyone is at home. Animals have started invading cities (both good and bad) because people aren't out and throwing their trash out everywhere like with food. The earth as a whole has breathed pretty well since humans isn't traveling around, businesses are closed, and roads are silent. Deforestation has also begun to decline. Many countries in the world are going to decide to stop wildlife trade. According to the World Health Organization, eighty percent of infectious diseases come from wild natural environments, including corona./But not all the environmental consequences of the crisis have been positive volumes of unrecyclable waste have risen. Tourism activity to natural areas has ceased .Local waste problems have been emerged. With the emergence of import restrictions in export markets and sharp declines in the availability of cargo transportation services, the corona virus crisis has led to increased volumes of unshippable agricultural and fishery commodities. Many export oriented producers produce volumes far too large for output to be absorbed in local markets and thus organic waste levels have mounted substantially. Natural ecosystems and protected species are at risk during the corona virus crisis. In many countries environment protection workers at national parks and land and marine conservation zones are required to stay at home in lockdown, leaving these areas unmonitored .Their absence has resulted in a rise of illegal deforestation, fishing and wildlife hunting. The stoppage of ecotourism activity has also left natural ecosystem at the risk of illegal harvesting and encroachment./There is no denying the fact that corona virus has had catastrophic impacts on mankind. However, it has surely given the environment a chance to self-heal and reclaim what belongs to nature. It is a big lesson for humans to mend their ways. Hope mother earth heals itself soon and give its children to take care of it once again by helping world to get rid of this pandemic./(Kbd M Alamgir Hossain, District Election Officer, Moulvibazar)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Take action to make separate bicycle lanes for safe transportation during Covid-19,"Dhaka, June 3 -- After 66 days of lockdown, Bangladesh reopened of all offices, business and transport on a limited scale on 31 May, even though the spread of Covid-19 in the country shows no sign of slowing down. Most employees joined their workplaces with fear and anxiety. The resumption of business also brought back the traffic in Dhaka city. Although public buses were not on the roads, many private cars, rickshaws, bikes and some small motorcars were stuck just like before the lockdown. Transport for government employees, CNGs and rickshaws, does not seem to be maintaining Covid-19 health protocols./In the Covid-19 situation, the bicycle can be a useful means of transportation. It is also possible to maintain social distance easily by cycling. If the government wants, they can build separate bicycle lanes in big cities including Dhaka to avoid crowded mass transits and follow health authorities' advice for social distancing.According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), investing in pedestrians and cyclists - who often make up the majority of citizens in a city - can save lives, help protect the environment and support poverty reduction./On the other hand, traffic jam is on the most important problem for Dhaka city. It is impossible to estimate how long it can take to get from one place to another. According to the research (2018)of Accident Research Institute (ARI) of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), around 5.0 million working hours are being wasted each day due to traffic jams in Dhaka, causing an average financial loss of Taka 370 billion annually.But there is a solution not for everyone but for many, especially for the younger generation, that is bicycling.There are many people here who are now trying to cycle to Dhaka city. Since the city has not been made suitable for cycling, many of them are suffering from various accidents. If cars, buses, trucks, as well as bicycles could travel equally along the main roads in Dhaka city, I think a huge part of the traffic jam could be brought under control overnight. Of course, it is possible to make a separate lane for bicycles.Govt. just have to leave a concrete divider on the side of the road and make a narrow road for bicycles. The only rule is to cycle through that part of the road - nothing else.The younger generation will take it easily. They will ride bicycles from one place to another in the blink of an eye without sitting in traffic for hours.In the same way that people in all other countries of the world have cycled to reduce the pressure on the roads, let it be done in our city of Dhaka as well. This bicycle culture is starting all over the world, so why is our country lagging behind?/Therefore, I would like to request the government to make separate lanes for bicycles on both sides of all the roads in our big cities. It doesn't really require a big budget - but if it does, the financial value of the time that people will save is certainly not to be underestimated at all./Dhaka city is a very suitable city for cycling. One big reason is that the whole city is flat, not hilly like many countries in the world. Anyone can ride around the city on a simple bicycle. Another reason is the age of the population of Dhaka city, a large part is the young and young. If they are given the opportunity to ride a bicycle, they will eagerly and happily seize that opportunity. Cycling will not only reduce traffic jam but also reduce air pollution./If the traffic congestion in Dhaka city can be really reduced by using bicycles, then next year when the uninhabitable city will be listed, the place of Dhaka city will not be in the worst condition - it will be in a much better condition.In Dhaka city, if we want to make a big solution for transportation by bicycle during COVID-19 pandemic, then we have to make a separate lane for bicycles. Separate a small space on the side of the main road where everyone can cycle safely./In April 2018, the United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as International World Bicycle Day.An affordable, reliable and sustainable means of transportation, the bicycle fosters environmental stewardship and good health, providing a cost-effective form of transport while reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, diabetes, and even death, according to the World Health Organization.To spread awareness about its many benefits, the United Nations encourages Member States to develop a culture of cycling and organize initiative like national and local bike rides, while promoting pedestrian safety and cycling mobility. Separate lane for bicycles can be a wonderful gift during COVID-19 pandemic.to maintain social distance in road. Government don't need huge money for this, here is need a decision./Author: Sowmik Das Sowmya/Student of B.Sc.

nCoV-19 Infection What should be care about,"Dhaka, June 11 -- The novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-19) is evident to spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person during sneezing and coughing. A single cough can produce up to 3,000 droplets. These particles can remain in the air, land on other people, clothing and surfaces around them. The nCoV-19 can survive and remain infectious for up to 3 days on hard surfaces like plastic and stainless steel at temperatures of between 21 to 25 ?/C at 40-50% relative humidity. The SARS coronavirus that outbreak in 2003 has also been found to survive best in cooler, drier conditions. However, virus viability loses rapidly at higher temperatures (e.g., 38 degC) and higher relative humidity (e.g., &gt;95%). This virus dies after heating at 56 degC for 15 minutes, however, it may stable for at least 2 days following drying on plastic. It can be inactivated completely by using common fixatives used in laboratory, ultraviolet light, alkaline (pH &gt;12) or acidic (pH &lt;3) conditions. The virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature (20 to 25 degC or 68 to 77 degF) in a liquid environment. It spreads rapidly in cities and regions of the world where average temperatures have been around 5-11 degC (41-52 degF ) and relative humidity has been low. It can can also survive on metal, glass and plastic for as long as 9 days, unless properly disinfected./Air pollution causes weakening our immune system, reduces the ability to fight against infectious agents. Suspended particles may carry the virus particles that remain in the air. A correlation between the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality rates and high levels of air pollution has been seen in Italy and USA. In a study in 2003 found that patients with SARS were 84% more likely to die if they lived in areas with high levels of air pollution. A small increase in fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5) have been found to increase the nCoV-19 transmission. For example, an increase of just 1 microgram per cubic meter corresponded to a 15% increase in COVID-19 deaths./The nCoV-19 can be inactivated within a minute by disinfecting surfaces with 62-71% alcohol, or 0.5% hydrogen peroxide bleach or household bleach containing 0.1% sodium hypochlorite. Higher temperatures and humidity also helpful to kill this virus, for an example, temperatures above 56 degC (132 degF) kills about 10,000 viral particles within 15 minutes./Handling of banknote: Banknotes are the most frequently handling items among the regular used objects. A single note may be handled by hundreds of people in a day. Therefore, nCoV-19 may spread from the infected person to non-infected person easily through banknote. Using hand gloves during handling or a suitable detergent or disinfectant after handling of banknotes might be helpful to prevent nCoV-19 transmission among people./Cell phone cleaning: Unplug the phone and turn off its switch. Avoid using hand gels, abrasive wipes and chemicals as these can damage the screen's protective coating. Dampen a clean microfiber cloth with water and simple household soap or hand wash. Gently rub the surfaces of the phone with it. Take care not to get moisture in any opening as your phone can lose its protection over time. Finally, dry your phone with a clean microfiber cloth./Managing of green vegetables: Sodium chloride (NaCl) also called 'table salt' as coating material on the fiber surface of the filtration unit of surgical mask effectively deactivated a number influenza virus species, suggesting a new strategy in the protective measures to avoid primary/secondary infection and transmission of many viruses, including nCoV-19. On the other hand, the natural adsorbents, including clay, charcoal, and clay minerals showed 99.99% adsorption of coronavirus. Although, the evidence of transmission of coronavirus through green vegetables is yet to be found out. Many consumers have been found to wash their vegetables with detergents, which is harmful for both of the vegetables and for their health. We can dissolve NaCl or suspend natural adsorbents in clean water and keep the green vegetables in the solution or suspension for 20-30 minutes before cooking or preserving in a refrigerator. However, a gentle drying of the surface water from the vegetables might be helpful for the preservation of these items for a long time. Remember, this virus can survive for more than 28 days at 4 ?C. Therefore, frequent cleaning of the refrigerator might be necessary./(Dr. Muhammad Torequl Islam is Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmacy, Life Science Faculty, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University.

Nature,"Dhaka, July 11 -- The history of the pandemic is not new; outbreaks appear to be exacerbated during prehistoric times. Many people have died in it. Scientists at the time blamed environmental disasters for the outbreaks of malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, or influenza. It is difficult to assess or measure the environmental hazards of a place or region in a few days or months; but due to the continuous deforestation, destruction of wildlife habitats, poaching and trafficking of wild animals, the economic, public health and other accounts are now in our hands. How much is going to be compensated or will ever be! But the question is - what is the relationship between the infection and the environment?/The emergence and spread of COVID-19 was not only a perception but also a new virus that would spread from wild animals to the human body, posing a serious threat to public health, researchers predicted long ago. Researchers believe that the main reason for the outbreak is the hunting of wild animals, smuggling and illegal trade in different national animals. This virus is a catastrophe that has resulted in serious and irreparable damage to biodiversity. The incidence of infectious diseases from wild animals and domesticated animals is 75 percent. Outbreaks appear to be exacerbated during domestic animals such as cows, goats, buffaloes, camels, etc./The global COVID-19 outbreak has a temporary positive effect on the environment. Significant reductions in air pollution in developing and developed industrialized countries, especially in nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, biological oxygen demand (BOD) in water, and significant increase in dissolved oxygen. Experts believe that one of the reasons for the pandemic is the failure to implement climate change, including pollution control and wildlife conservation set by the Paris Agreement in 2015. As a result of this outbreak, the environmental pollution has regained some percentage of its balance, but it is certain that it will return to that warmth after the outbreak./If the issue of environmental pollution is noticed, then the downward indicator will also be observed. The heart of the country 'Dhaka' can be an example of this. On July 7, 2020, according to Air Visual, a US-based world-class air verification technology company, the Air Quality Index (AQI) was 70 in Dhaka, where its value is always between 400 to 500. This is definitely good news for us. However, it is feared that if the situation returns to normal, the index will rise again globally./Cox's Bazar, the longest beach in the world, has no noise during this lockdown in COVID-19. In this deserted silence of the beach kingdom, 'Sagarlata' has become intoxicated with making green carpets. Innumerable varieties of unnamed flowers are blooming in this green net. Sagarlata (scientific name: Ipomea pes-caprae) is a creeping and fast-growing plant. Its English name is Railroad, which means 'Railway Lata' in Bengali. It can be more than 100 feet long. According to environmentalists, Sagarlata is very important for the survival of other beach animals such as crabs and birds. Its green leaves protect the soil from the sun's rays in such a way that the heat of the sun does not evaporate excess water from the soil. This enables them to create an ideal environment for other animals, including beneficial bacteria in the soil below./The free movement of turtles has also been added to the seashore. A group of turtles are roaming the vast sandy beach of the sea without any hindrance. They have already started laying eggs. Listed as an endangered species, the sea turtle plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the marine environment, especially in maintaining the food chain. On the other hand, after many years, the team of dolphins came very close to the locality and competed in the somersault. Even at this juncture of the country, this captivating dance of the dolphin is like authentic information about the awakening of the glorious environment and nature./Thousands of people are dying due to global warming, water and air pollution, and adverse effects on biodiversity and soil. If we don't fix it with the right plan, the consequences will be terrible. Natural resources will be destroyed, immigration will increase and conflict will increase. We don't know if the impact of COVID-19 on the overall environment is good news for environmentalists, but it is the responsibility and duty of the world to learn from this changed environment. Those who have disturbed the environment will set a limit to their luxurious life to keep the environment calm-that is desirable./(Md.

Dream Unbeaten,"Dhaka, July 17 -- Fascinating canvas with light paint and dark colors-/How dreamy it was,/Today this horrible scenario overwhelms me with intense poison,/Every day I wake up and sit up in bed in panic,/The emptiness of the limbs sure threw me into prison,/Lord forgive me,/Not darkness, make me face the sun. (Lord forgive me - H B Rita)/On March 8, I was walking like a normal day on one of the paths of the campus. Looking back, I saw the beautiful nature of the campus. How big the grass has become, how many flower petals have shrunk due to lack of water, how fishes were playing in the water of the lake, how many birds have come and gone in the crowd of innumerable line of tress, all in all there was no shortage in the day as passes. Suddenly, on hearing the news from a friend of mine, nature seemed to be plunged into black and white darkness. The widened horizon and the sky gradually narrowed. The blue color of the sky was lost in the crowd of black broken clouds. Although I was able to handle the crowd of black clouds, a terrible word entered my ears - 'Two Corona patients have been identified in Bangladesh today.'/After hearing the news of the corona attack, I stayed at my favorite campus for a few more days. But suddenly one day I saw everyone running to his family to get rid of Corona's panic. Following them, I also came back to my dear parents. Since then I have been spending my days in a small house. I have been under house arrest for more than three months now. I don't know how long I will have to stay at home like this. As the day goes on, the life force seems to be fading. Today, the Corona virus is making people realize how the inmates of the prison spend their years in those small box enclosed in three walls. But we have a special resemblance to them in this captive state. Just as they are imprisoned for their evil deeds, so are the rewards of being imprisoned in our homes today for torturing the nature and the world. It is difficult to say when this long-standing anger, arrogance and resentment of world will end./We have always made the world tired of water pollution, air pollution and various other pollutions. If the world had not been so cruelly oppressed, it might have suppressed his anger for a few more days. But the world today is tired, exhausted, upset by our relentless and uncompromising oppression. With the speed of the excellence of science we have become emotionless; we have wounded the world and made the world infected with a terrible disease. We did not stop in spite of creating the disease; we also increased the world's temperature extensively. With the increased temperature the world today is infected with the corona virus. This terrible corona virus is hitting people's thoughts, minds and ideas today. The eyes are reddened to show that the harmful aspect of today's consciousness, ideas, knowledge, in return for which we have given the gift, the loss is only to the world./While trials to create the corona vaccine are now confined to animals, the virus have wreaked havoc on the world by this time. Everything is gradually changing. Corona's fear can be suppressed in the light of day, but the terrible darkness of night make Corona alive again whose fear hits our brain continuously. It does not calm down from being confined to the brain; it continues to spread from the throat to the heart. And from there it spreads to the whole vein. Whose fear tells me every moment will I be alive tomorrow? Even in the slightest danger, people would rush to save others. Today, the situation is such that their own relatives are leaving the victim helpless./How beautiful the days were a few days ago! As the days progress, times are disappearing like a night dream in the silver rays of the morning sun. The days did not remain in my golden cage; it was my days of various colors. At some point in this day-and-night reunion, the golden times are crashing like the waves of the ocean into a corner of the chest, trying to break the prisoner's chains in the wind, but an unknown fear stops me from physically going out the door. What a precious time in life to be lost in this terrible darkness of the corona virus. In this period of life, the golden times wounded by the virus will never be in our hands again. How much we have tortured this world. It endured all the oppression invisibly. This time it has woken up in the violence of revenge. The fear of who will die in this revenge of the world is constantly haunting. The virus is hurting people, revealing people's helplessness towards nature./The only prayer to the Creator is to end the waiting for the corona virus to be eradicated so that the afflicted body of the earth can be healed again with the vaccine, the fruit of the diligent efforts of the scientists. May the world return to its form, its beauty and develops in its glory. However, even in this terrible situation of the virus, those who are not to be forgot are the people --- poor working class. The dynamics of our society depend on them as they are backbone of the country's development. Their improvement means the improvement of the country. Without them, the nation will never be able to stand tall. In this epidemic they need a little sympathy and love from the government and the rich. The poet says-/'Conquer the world with love,/Enemies become allies in the love of tears,/He is the best friend in the world.' (Poem: The victory of love, Poet: Jotindra Mohan Bagchi)/Therefore, in this pandemic situation, let the government and the rich come forward extending the hand of love and sympathy for the welfare of the poor and needy by sacrificing self-interest and thinking of the betterment of the country and the nation./(Makama Mahmud Chowdhury is a student of Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Some new information about Corona pandemic,"Dhaka, July 20 -- At present there is a terrible epidemic all over the world due to Covit-19 or Novel Coronavirus. The whole country is under house arrest due to corona. The number of corona cases in the world is more than 13323530 people. More than 5 lakh 6 thousand 726 people died. Learn some unknown facts Corona virus also has a good effect on the body of children. Very few symptoms are found in children. In this case, you have to wear a lot of problems. This is because as people get older, their immune system weakens and the virus spreads. However, if a person has a good immune system, he will recover on his own. So always be aware and take care of the children in the house. Corona is a Latin word, which means 'crown'. It is not named because it looks like a crown in a microscopic image. In fact, the coronavirus originated in the 1960's as a contagious disease virus in chickens. However, the presence of coronavirus has been noticed in the common cold cough in humans./The seven coronaviruses found in the human body are Human Coronavirus 229E and Human Coronavirus OC 43, NL83, HQ One, SARS, Mars, and Naval, Coronavirus. The number of deaths is increasing by leaps and bounds every day. There is no end to what people know about this corona. Yet there is a lot of information that is unknown here. Recently, the deadly corona virus has created a huge panic around the world. And I want to take various steps to make life successful. The awakening of success is created in the life of a person through the hand of a dream and through honest deeds a person sees success or success in life. Health is your first step towards success in life. There is a proverb that 'health is the root of all happiness.' This new disease was initially called by various names, such as: 'China virus', 'Coronavirus', '2019 Encav', 'New virus', 'Mystery virus' etc. This week, the World Health Organization officially names the disease Covid-19, an acronym for 'Coronavirus Disease 2019'. Take a single homeopathic medicine. However, if the majority of people living in an area are infected with any other virus, including coronavirus, with the same set of symptoms, the single drug that will be chosen for infected people, but the central government of India has said that they have the appropriate drugs to deal with corona. Corona can be prevented in homeopathy, not vaccines or allopathic medicines./The coronavirus can be prevented with homeopathic treatment, according to a tweet from the Indian Ministry of Ayurveda. Unani medicine has been reported to be extremely effective in treating the symptoms of coronary heart disease. A guideline was also issued for this. A list of do's and don'ts is published. It has also been said what medicine to take./Corona virus is an infectious virus. Its infection causes fever, cough, and respiratory problems. If the condition is severe, pneumonia can occur, and the patient may even die from shortness of breath./However, it is less common in people under the age of 18. Elderly patients who already have diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, etc. have a higher risk of death, while those who die have these diseases. Common symptoms of corona disease are fever, cough and respiratory problems are the main symptoms. Symptoms usually start with a dry cough and fever, followed by respiratory problems. It usually takes an average of five days for the symptoms to manifest. The World Health Organization says the incubation period of the virus lasts up to 14 days. However, according to some researchers, it can last up to 24 days. When people show symptoms of the virus, more people are more likely to be infected. However, it is thought that the virus can infect healthy people even when they are not sick. The initial symptoms are similar to those of the common cold and flu, so it is normal to be hesitant to diagnose the disease. At the beginning of the year, 84 people died, mainly in many Asian countries. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus showed that it was very similar to the SARS virus. Not worse than that, ""said Mark Ulhaus, a professor at the University of Edinburgh./? Revealing complex symptoms: -/Fever begins with a viral infection, followed by a dry cough. About a week later the shortness of breath began. Many patients have to be hospitalized for treatment. So far, the death rate from this disease is low (between 1% and 2%) - but this figure is not entirely credible. Some parts of Europe now have higher mortality rates. According to a World Health Organization survey of infected patients, 8% are severely ill - with a risk of lung failure, septic shock, paralysis and death. 14% have severe symptoms. They have major respiratory problems. Mild symptoms are present in 80% - some people have pneumonia symptoms besides fever and cough. Older people and those who have any kind of illness (asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure) are seriously ill. Men are more likely than women to die from the disease, according to data from China./Suggestions to be safe from coronavirus: -/* Occasionally wash your hands with soap-water or sanitizer * Do not touch your face, eyes and nose without washing your hands./* Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing * Do not mix with cold or flu * Cooking meat and eggs very well * Do not touch wild animals or domestic animals with bare hands * Mask is a great symbolic image for any news that spreads the virus. Or the face of a person wearing a mask, the use of masks is a popular way to prevent infection in many countries around the world. Especially in China, where the spread of the coronavirus has started, people always wear masks to cover their noses and faces to avoid air pollution. There are virus specialists, who are called virologists./Homeopathy treatment of corovirus: -/As we know, coronavirus is a viral infection. Therefore, the conventional medical system is unable to provide a cure. They will try to control the matter by making full use of the methods of management, hygiene, quarantine etc. They have that ability and maybe that sincerity. But in order not to give them a cure, it is inevitable that they will have an underlying weakness. And it is normal for ordinary people to panic - needless to say, and homeopathy is not a disease but a treatment of the patient. Dengue has also been controlled through homeopathy. At present, corona virus can be controlled in the same way in homeopathy, especially at Central Police Hospital and Ramakrishna Temple, many patients with corona have been cured with homeopathic treatment, and in addition, Government Homoeopathic Medical College Hospital and 64 homeopathic colleges across Bangladesh, and all registered doctors. Corona is going through the treatment of the patient's symptoms, similar symptoms can come on the homeopathic medicine, Aconite Nap, Influenzinum, Arsenic Album, Belladonna, Bryonia, Gelsiumium, Drossera, Carbovez, and many more. So take the advice of an experienced doctor without using the medicine yourself./(Dr. Muhammad Mahtab Hossain Majed, Co-Chairman Homeopathy Research and Training Center.

Dhaka's Air,"Dhaka, Sept. 4 -- One of the worst cases of air pollution is Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. India's Delhi is the worst. The Dhaka dwellers are experiencing many health effects of worst air. People, especially children, adults and women suffering from respiratory diseases are advised to avoid outdoor activities while everyone else is suggested to limit outdoor exertion in this situation./We know, one of the veritable manifestations of environment degradation is air pollution. Environmental degradation means degradation 'through depletion of resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution. There are mainly three different types of environmental degradation. They are land degradation, water degradation, and air degradation. The degradation of these three environments impacts the global climate and living conditions to a great extent'/According to environment scientists, 'the air quality is categorized as good when the AQI score remains below 50. The air is classified as moderate when the score is 51 to 100. But when the number is between 101 and 150, the air is classified as unhealthy for sensitive groups. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, tells people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. Bangladesh's overcrowded capital has been grappling with air pollution for a long time. The quality usually improves during monsoon.'/Air pollution in Dhaka has gone a dizzying height 'killing thousands prematurely each year.' According to the Department of Environment (DoE), 'the density of airborne particulate matter (PM) reaches 463 micrograms per cubic meter (mcm) in the city during December-March period - the highest level in the world. Mexico City and Mumbai follow Dhaka with 383 and 360mcm respectively. An estimated 15,000 premature deaths, as well as several million cases of pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illness are attributed to poor air quality in Dhaka, according to the Air Quality Management Project (AQMP), funded by the government and the World Bank.'/As per reports published recently, 'vehicular air pollution is a major cause of respiratory distress in urban Bangladesh. If pregnant mothers come across excessive pollution, it may cause premature death of their children. According to the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH), nearly seven million people in Bangladesh suffer from asthma; more than half of them are children. Cases of children suffering from bronchitis and chronic cough have also shot up in recent years. Children breathe more air relative to their lung size than adults. They spend more time outdoors, often during midday and afternoons when pollution levels are generally highest. WHO air quality guidelines (2005) recommend a maximum acceptable PM level of 20mcm; cities with 70mcm are considered highly polluted. Airborne lead is the worst of the harmful PMs. By penetrating the lungs and entering the blood stream, lead may cause irreversible neurological damage as well as renal disease, cardiovascular effects, and reproductive toxicity. The phasing out of petrol-driven two-stroke auto-rickshaws in 2003 and their replacement with four-stroke versions, which use a much cleaner burning fuel (compressed natural gas), significantly decreased the volume of air contaminants. But, according to DoE sources, a sharp increase in the number of vehicles and construction sites in 2004-2008 led to a deterioration of Dhaka's air quality. Old, poorly serviced vehicles, 1,000 brick kilns, dust from roads and construction sites, and toxic fumes from industrial sites are major sources of air pollution. So, the authorities should take the initiative to reduce air pollution in Dhaka city.'/Air pollution is caused by 'solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols.'/According to the website, 'poisonous carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, suspended particulate matter (PM-10) and particulate matter (PM-2.5) exist in Dhaka's air beyond permissible level for human body. Due to increase of PM-10 and PM-2.5, people lose lung function and suffer from chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases while nitrogen dioxide increase risks of bronchitis and pneumonia. Nitrogen dioxide causes respiratory infection. Carbon monoxide tends to reduce 'delivery of oxygen into the human body, creates severe headache and decreases visual perception and manual dexterity'./Faulty vehicles contribute to air pollution. 'Only the diesel-run vehicles contribute about 60 per cent of such particles in the air'./Air pollution is caused by the diesel-run vehicles, mainly buses and trucks, brick kilns 'There are 4,000 brick kilns around the city, which use tyres, wood and low-quality coal, emitting poisonous particles into the air. But no initiative has been taken yet to measure quantity of poisonous particles emitting from brick kilns. The height of brick kiln chimneys has been increased to reduce air pollution but the initiative failed as the government failed to ensure quality of fuel used in the kilns.'/Carbon di-oxide (CO2) is a major absorber of infrared radiation emitted towards thespace from the earth surface. Thus, it has crucial role in planetary temperature structure. Carbon monoxide (CO), if inhaled, is absorbed from the lung alveoli 300 times faster than oxygen. High concentration of CO in blood makes it difficult for heart to pump blood through arteries. Unburnt hydrocarbon may form ozone with oxides of nitrogen which is a central nervous system depressant. Other hydrocarbons cause convulsion of CNS./Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) cause dilatation of air spaces in lungs. NO2 causes damages to bronchioles and alveolar ducts. NO2 is also suspected to impair the defense mechanism of respiratory system. Infants and children are more susceptible./Diesel emits suspended particulate matter (SPM) which contains shoot. Shoot is responsible for reduction of atmospheric visibility and absorb and carry organic compound to lungs./Around 75% of the ingested lead is deposited in bones and tissues causing irreversible brain and kidney damage. Growing nervous system of young children is particularly vulnerable.""/(Dr. Mozumder is Pro-VC, BUP and Dr. Mashreque is a retired professor, Chittagong University)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

World Cleanup Day,"Dhaka, Sept. 19 -- World Cleanup Day is observed on the third Saturday of September every year in an effort to keep the country clean. This year it is being celebrated on 19 September 2020. It is an annual global social program and the main goal of celebrating this day is to make people aware of the need to dump garbage in certain places, to make people aware of the problems caused by garbage./The population of Dhaka city is increasing day by day as many people coming in search of jobs, education and treatments. Along with population growth, the amount of waste is increasing and it is causing various kinds of environmental pollution. Currently, a visible problem in Dhaka city is waste management. Due to the rapid population growth in Dhaka, a huge amount of waste is constantly being generated, which is making the issue increasingly complex./One of the sources of waste in the city is hotel and restaurant waste, industrial waste, medical waste, kitchen waste, perishable vegetables in the market, butcher's blood, printing paint, etc. Among these wastes, hazardous wastes are medical wastes.Waste from various hospitals includes saline bags, syringes, blood, stool, urine, sputum, saliva etc., collection tubes, amputated parts of diseased organs of the human body; all these wastes are highly contagious and dangerous. These wastes carry deadly disease germs, including hepatitis and HIV. When a small amount of medical waste is not properly managed, it can mix with normal waste and make the whole waste contagious./According to a World Bank study, Dhaka city produces about 6,000 metric tons of waste per day, of which about 1,000 metric tons is generated from medical and commercial establishments, of which 50-60 percent is dumped and the remaining 40 percent is illegally dumped next to houses. It is dumped in ditches, drains, roadsides, open spaces, canals, wetlands, rivers. Every day the city produces 560 grams of waste per capita. Produced waste includes plastics, paper, glass, metals and organic waste./According to a survey conducted by the Department of Environmental Sciences, Stamford University, Bangladesh, the Dhaka Medical College Hospital alone generates 1.80 to 2 tons of medical waste per day, of which 75% is hazardous waste. Almost all those involved in the disposal of these wastes work without the use of any safety equipment such as gloves, gumboots, masks etc./Due to the coronavirus situation, the amount of one time plastic waste used in Bangladesh has increased at an alarming rate. According to the Environment and Social Development Organization (ESDO), between March 26 and April 25, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 14,500 tons of hazardous plastic waste has been generated in Dhaka. Most of these products are surgical masks, polythene hand gloves, surgical hand gloves, polythene bags and hand sanitizer bottles. If these wastes are not brought under proper management, there are more health risks alongside the corona pandemic. So there is no other way except proper waste management option to protect the environment and people./There are two separate landfill sites for waste dumping in Dhaka city. Matuail landfill is being used for South City Corporation's waste dumping and North City Corporation's waste is being dumped in the Aminbazar landfill. Under these two city corporations, there are 8,500 cleaners who collect garbage from house to house every day including road cleaning and deposit it in the van at the secondary transfer station. The waste was later taken to the Aminbazar and the Matuail landfills in covered vans and open trucks. About 11,000 waste bins were set up on the sidewalks of the capital in the 2016-17 financial years by the two city corporations to collect waste lying on the roads and build a clean city. At present, almost all of these waste bins are almost extinct./The unplanned accumulation of waste in landfills is causing various problems. An excessive infestation of mosquitoes, flies and insects can be seen in the vicinity of the landfill site along with the stench. Besides, air pollution and water pollution are increasing as a result of this mismanagement of waste. Especially in the rainy season, the condition of the wastes is direr. If the waste is not removed in time during the rainy season, the waste begins to decompose rapidly, resulting in a liquid, black, foul-smelling leachate. This leachate is contaminating groundwater by mixing with rainwater in river drains and groundwater through gaps in soil texture. As a result, water-borne diseases and various health risks are increasing./COVID-19 showed us the results of not considering the environment. We should learn from the pandemic and correct us and stop polluting the environment and make a plan for sustainable development now. A clean and tidy city will not only be an initiative of the city corporation, but it also needs awareness. To ensure a safe, healthy and beautiful environment, the practice of dumping waste should be stopped. Proper use of waste can be ensured by converting this huge amount of waste for recycling. It is possible to produce biogas and electricity from waste. In particular, everyone should be aware that waste should not be dumped in rivers, canals and open water bodies. This will greatly reduce environmental pollution and health risks. We will get the clean safe city of our dreams./(Professor Kamruzzaman Majumder, Dean, Faculty of Science, Chairman, Department of Environmental Science, Stamford University Bangladesh.

We fail to ensure quality air to breathe due to apathy to clean energy,"Dhaka, Oct. 22 -- THE country's air is becoming increasingly poisonous in the absence of effective measures to control the released pollutants. State of Global Air 2020 report revealed that in 2019 air pollution caused 173,500 people's death in Bangladesh and 6.7 million across the globe. Experts said life expectancy in Bangladesh would have seen the highest expected gain of nearly 1.3 years if the air pollution level met the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. Unfortunately, Bangladesh in the top 10 countries with the highest outdoor PM2.5 level refers to tiny pollutant particles, in 2019. The government's stubbornness to the coal-fired power plants and other development projects is responsible for air pollution./Dangerously, outdoor and household pollutant particles contributed to the deaths of nearly 500,000 infants in their first month of life. In Bangladesh, 20 per cent of all neonatal deaths are linked to air pollution which accounted for the deaths of 10,500 infants. Among the neonatal deaths, 62 per cent is attributable to household air pollution. The major sources of pollution are household solid fuels, dust from construction, coal power plants, brick production, transportation, and diesel-powered equipment, among others./We see air pollution is increasing in the country and no effective step is visible to reduce it. The coal industry is expanding further and construction works are being done without appropriate controlling measures. If we check the statistics of patients with cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the number eventually rises. If we fail to improve air quality, sufferings will increase. Though links between air pollution and Covid-19 are not yet known, there is clear evidence connecting air pollution and increased heart and lung diseases. Air pollution exposure could significantly worsen the effects of Covid-19./In the winter season, people in Bangladesh live with the worst air quality as construction works in both domestic and the public sphere, resumption of the brick kiln, garbage burning, etc. remain full swing. The government has taken some measures like stopping operations of brick kilns and promoting concrete blocks. But it will take a few more years to get the benefits./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

City Mayors have no time to go around the capital city to see how shameful is the condition,"Dhaka, Nov. 11 -- THE experts at a webinar on 'Town Planning for Public Health' while observing World Town Planning Day 2020 on Sunday blamed various factors including air, water and noise pollution, poor waste management, grabbing of natural water-bodies and rising temperature of the cities for the increase in incidence of various communicable and non-communicable diseases in the urban areas./Other factors including overcrowded cities and fall in greeneries along with pressure of daily life in the cities have been contributing in the declining mental and physical health of people, they observed. The experts suggested controlling population density immediately, ensuring facilities and utility services for the citizens, creating parks, playgrounds, open spaces and water-bodies and planning future cities by giving priority to public health./Various actions including fast urbanisation, pollution, garbage, rising temperature and loss in the natural water-bodies combined with stress of urban life have been contributing in health risk in the cities. Yet the remedies are easy to fix. Both our city corporations have failed abysmally to correct Dhaka's perennial problems. The Global Liveability Index 2019 has placed Bangladesh capital Dhaka as the third least livable city in the world, just after war-torn Syrian capital Damascus and Lagos--its no surprise, as it ranks consistently in the top three, a dubious distinction./While millions of people around the world in cities like Dhaka have been battling life threatening air pollution to survive, people in the city of Rajshahi breathe clean air and revel in their pollution free, green environment. People of the city regularly walk, jog, and run along the Padma River to keep fit, and use clean roads without needing any masks. Pedestrians use grassy footpaths lined with flowers and residents soak up the serene beauty of the greenery around them./However, this pronounced change did not come about overnight. A number of initiatives taken by the city corporation, have contributed to reducing the harmful particulate matter in the air and making the city more green and liveable. An army of city corporation sweepers work day and night to keep the city roads free of dust and dirt. Garbage is collected daily and dumped only in designated places. A well planned park was established on the abandoned bank of the Padma river and tiles were used on the pathways. Now there is much less dust in the air and people who come to the area for recreation can enjoy themselves./The efforts of the authorities have been lauded by many. The city was recognized as the most successful city in the world in reducing harmful particles PM10 and PM2.5 in the air in 2014-16, according to World Health Organization (WHO) report. The city was also awarded the National Environmental Award in 2013 and bagged several awards for tree planting.

Dhaka's worst air along with Covid attack makes city dwellers frightened,"Dhaka, Nov. 24 -- DHAKA'S air ranked fifth-worst in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Sunday morning amid rising fears that a second-wave of coronavirus could hit the country. Deteriorating air quality can pose a big challenge to the country's fight to keep its people safe from Covid-19. Dhaka had an AQI score of 171 classified as unhealthy. Last year, Dhaka's air remained very unhealthy and extremely unhealthy for 197 days, leading to 173,500 deaths across the country. Breathing in polluted air can damage the lungs and could potentially push up the odds of dying from coronavirus./Globally, nine out of every ten people breathe unclean air, and air pollution causes an estimated seven million premature deaths every year, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries, according to UN. Bangladesh has been named the world's most polluted country for PM 2.5 exposure while Dhaka has emerged as the second most polluted city in the 2019 World Air Quality Report. The smokes emitted from the brick kilns, which have been set up in many areas illegally, are blamed as one of the leading causes of air pollution./Meanwhile, the government has repeatedly warned of a second wave of the virus and urging people to follow proper health guidelines. Bangladesh's coronavirus caseload stands at 445,281 with 6,350 fatalities - a death rate of 1.43 percent. Amidst the surge of coronavirus and subsequent lockdown across the continents, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the world ""to pay far greater attention to air pollution which also increases the risks associated with Covid-19"". Children are particularly at risk of developing asthma, especially if they live near busy roads. Containing air pollution is not possible by a department or Ministry alone. It requires a coordinated effort and every stakeholder has to step forward. The government must put sustainable, eco-friendly development model forward to sustain the human being. All we are responsible for plantation and ensuring low-carbon emission as shouldering the government's responsibilities cannot protect are in the end./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Cross-border Air Pollution Natural & Anthropogenic Causes,"Dhaka, Dec. 18 -- For the last three or four days, the sun has not been shining brightly in the sky of Dhaka. The combination of dust, fog and smoke is creating haze. And the light of the sun cannot reach the ground through this hazysmoke. Somewhere in Dhaka city, due to smoke and dust, it was getting dark and even during the day, the headlights were on and the vehicles were moving. Various sources of air pollution including brick kilns, mega projects, black smoke from vehicles and incineration of waste are burning our foreheads along with local sources of inland air pollution. Likewise last few years, this year also Bangladesh is in the grip of cross-border Air Pollution. Some of them are due to natural causes and some are man-made or anthropogenic./In addition to neighboring India, dust from Mongolia and Afghanistan, straw or hay burning smoke from China and India, smoke from coal and power plants, wood from rural areas of Nepal and Pakistan, hay burning smoke and dust are coming to Bangladesh. Even from far away Iran, smoke and dust can be seen floating in the air for thousands of kilometers. In neighboring India, farmers in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are constantly burning straw or hay openly. According to official estimates, there were more than 40,000 straw burning incidents in the Punjab province alone in the first week of December, 2020. Last year, there were 21,000 straw burning incidents in Punjab. That means twice as much straw has already been burned this year as last year. As a result, this air pollution is spreading in the sky of Bangladesh, 1400 km away from Delhi. It takes around 6-7days to cross Bangladesh border as air flow at the speed of 8-10km/hours at that time. The level of air pollution in Delhi on 1stDecemberwas much higher and it was reflected on 6th December in Dhaka. Air in most areas was very harmful to health./About 40 per cent of Delhi's air pollution comes from burning haystacks in Punjab and Haryana. More than 60 per cent farmers in Punjab and Haryana own limited and limited land. They do not have the economic means to rent a machine and waste straw. But they are also very angry with the central government's agricultural laws. So many people are burning hay a lot. There is no government assistance for hay management. There is no adequate surveillance and no effective initiative to stop hay burning. The Indian Supreme Court has taken a stern stance on air pollution in Delhi. The apex court had constituted a one-member monitoring committee comprising former Justice MadanLokur. He reported to the Supreme Court about burning straw in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. But many Indian pollution experts believe the authorities have failed to implement the ruling, despite the Supreme Court ruling more than once to stop burning straw. Many feel that the government does not take effective management measures because politicians do not realize the need for it./Efforts to stop burning fruit straw have repeatedly failed. None of the parties in power at the center and in the concerned states and those in the opposition want to stop burning straw and hurt the farmers. As a result, it does not stop polluting the air in and around Delhi every year, but travels about 1400 km south-east, constantly polluting the skies of Bangladesh in winter or dry season. A study by the Government of Bangladesh's Atomic Energy Center, Clarkson University and the University of Rochester in the United States found that one of the causes of air pollution in Bangladesh is cross-border airflow. Dust from the arid deserts of Iran, Mongolia and Afghanistan is mixed into the air. This dust enters India through the west. This polluted air started entering Bangladesh from November. About 60 to 70 per cent of the electricity generated in India and China comes from coal power plants. Alongside that the smoke and dust from the power plant is also playing a big role in the air pollution of Bangladesh./The Indian subcontinent is already known as a polluted air zone. Nine of the top ten cities having the worst air quality are from this region. Fumes are usually found in the area due to burning of straw after harvesting rice in winter alongside of the vehicle fumes, cooking fumes, construction fumes and smoke from industrial. At the same time, due to the increase in the amount of water vapor in the weather, the combination of smoke and dust turns into polluted haze and covers the whole area like a sheet. For the last few years, such catastrophic conditions have occurred four to five times a year in winter. And each time it stays for about five-six days on average. Such a situation has arisen in the skies of Dhaka and other areas since December 5, 2020./According to meteorologists, this year the clouds floating from the Mediterranean Sea came closer to the land of Bangladesh and became a bit drier. If there is more water vapor in this fair, it turns into rain. But after traveling about three and a half thousand kilometers, it has become low and stable. This stable or sheets of fog has spread from Delhi in India to Bihar in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal and in Bangladesh. But after traveling about three and a half thousand kilometers, it became low and stable, as a result of which the air quality in most of the cities in this area, which is about three thousand kilometers wide, has deteriorated rapidly./However, South Asian countries have taken many initiatives to control air pollution. But no country in the region will be free of air pollution if it does not stop cross-border air pollution. Therefore, the countries of South and Central Asia must take concerted efforts to prevent air pollution. For that joint and collaborative research as well as bilateral and multilateral agreement is desirable./(Dr. Majumder is Founder and Director, Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS).

"Air pollution causes 3.5 lakh pregnancy lossed per year in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh","Dhaka, Jan. 9 -- Breathing polluted air has been scientifically proven to have an immense negative impact on the human body, including severe respiratory diseases, cardiovascular complications, stroke, and cognitive disorders. Now, an alarming new study has outlined the extent of another dreaded impact of the menace of air pollution in South Asia./The new comprehensive study has suggested that consistent exposure to poor air quality is likely to increase the risk of pregnancy loss by several magnitudes. The research indicates that women living in South Asian countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are particularly at a higher risk of stillbirths and miscarriages due to the increasing pollution levels./The research revealed that between 2000 to 2016, a whopping 349,681 pregnancy loss cases per year in South Asia were attributable to the ambient air pollution levels exceeding India's air quality standard of 40 units. The startling number accounts for around 7.1% of total annual pregnancy loss burden in the region./The first-of-a-kind study specifically dwells into the link between air pollution and pregnancy loss in South Asia, one of the most populated, highly polluted regions in the world which also accounts for high pregnancy loss rate. The authors of the study evaluated data from 1998 to 2016, which mainly consisted of information from various household surveys on health where women reported at least one pregnancy loss and one or more live births./The study is led by Dr Tao Xue from Peking University in China. ""South Asia has the highest burden of pregnancy loss globally and is one of the most PM2.5 polluted regions in the world. Our findings suggest that poor air quality could be responsible for a considerable burden of pregnancy loss in the region, providing further justification for urgent action to tackle dangerous levels of pollution,"" explains Dr Xue in a statement./For the study, the researchers assessed data for 34,197 women with pregnancy losses, while out of these 27,480 had miscarriages and 6,717 were stillbirths cases. Out of these, the highest number of pregnancy loss cases originated from India at 77%, while Pakistan and Bangladesh accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively./Earlier, studies have shown that air pollution is linked to more than 16 lakh premature deaths in India in a year./The team estimated exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy by combining satellite-derived information with atmospheric modelling outputs. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter whose width is around 20-30 times smaller than that of a human hair. Using the data from 18 years span, a model was designed to calculate how exposure to PM2.5 increased pregnancy loss./The study also highlighted that high exposure to PM2.5 during the gestational period increased the chances of pregnancy loss significantly, compared to any other environmental factors like maternal age, temperature and humidity, seasonal variation, and long-term trends in pregnancy loss. In particular, researchers analysed the impact of exposure to an increase in PM2.5 by every 10 units. The results show that each exposure to the rise of 10 units led to an increase in the chances of pregnancy loss by 3%./This risk was found to be more for mothers living in rural parts and those who became pregnant at an older age when compared to younger mothers from urban areas. The results concluded that the total burden of pregnancy loss was predominantly borne by rural women aged under 30 years old in recent years, reveals the study. In rural areas, high indoor pollution due to the use of biofuels for cooking has been a cause of concern across South Asia for several decades./While the 7% of pregnancy losses were attributable to air pollution by considering Indian standards of 40 units, nearly 30% of them were linked to pollution if the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards of 10 units are considered. Therefore, this figure could go up to nearly 15 lakh pregnancy losses per year in South Asia if exposure to PM2.5 above 10 units is taken into account./The study indicated that the pregnancy loss associated with air pollution was high in the Northern plains region in India and Pakistan. The main objective of the study published in the journal The Lancet Planetary Health was to understand several risk factors associated with pregnancy loss in south Asia, in order to improve maternal health at levels both regionally and globally./Dr Tianjia Guan, a co-author of the study from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing China, said: ""We know losing a pregnancy can have knock-on mental, physical and economic effects on women, including increased risk of postnatal depressive disorders, infant mortality during a subsequent pregnancy and increase the costs related to pregnancy, such as loss of labour. Therefore, reducing pregnancy loss may also lead to knock-on improvements in gender equality.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dhaka air pollution 5 times above normal,"Staff Reporter, March 22 -- Air pollution in the capital city increased by 10.2 percent in 2020 as compared 2019. It is 5.2 times higher than the tolerable level, according to a study of the Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS) at Stamford University./This information was given by Dr Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumdar at a press conference on the occasion of publishing the scientific results of the Stamford Atmospheric Pollution Study Center (CAPS) with the collaboration of Bangladesh Environmental Movement-(Bapa) titled 'Measurement of Air Pollution Levels at 70 Places in the capital City' at Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) on Saturday./At that time, city planners have demanded the implementation of the Clean Air Act to prevent pollution./According to the study, Bangladesh topped the world in terms of air pollution in 2019 and 2020. Dhaka is the second most megacity city in terms of pollution./In such a context, in 2020, two organizations conducted a survey in 70 significant points of capital to find out the level and cause of air pollution./At the release of the study, it was also claimed that unplanned and uncontrolled road digging caused the 30 per cent air pollution alone./After that about 29 percent occurred due to brick kilns and factories./And about 15 percent of air pollution comes from black smoke from vehicles./Besides, smoke from household and cooking stoves pollutes 9 percent of the air./According to the report, the amount of dust per cubic meter in Dhaka was 335.4 milligrams which is more than five times of the normal level. Research institutes have made several recommendations to prevent/air pollution, including spraying water for two to three hours in a row./The causes of air pollution are mentioned; among the natural causes are meteorological and geographical causes. Among the man-made factors, lack of urban planning, weakness of law, limitation of law enforcement is one of the reasons./The city planners demanded to strengthen all the concerned institutions including the environment department to prevent air pollution as to well as find out the reasons for non-implementation of the plan./According to the report, the most polluted area of capital city is Old Dhaka and Low pollution in Mohammadpur, Pallabi and Cantonment areas./And air pollution is increasing at an alarming rate in city's Dhanmondi, Gulshan, Banani and Badda./Air monitoring devices of some organisations were used to assess the quality of air./The quality of air is mainly determined by assessing Particulate Matter PM-1, PM-2 and PM-10 in the air./The study has been done based on the level of air pollution determined by World Health Organisation (WHO)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dhaka's air quality still unhealthy,", March 25 -- Dhaka's air quality continues to be 'unhealthy'./On Wednesday, Dhaka occupied the third position in the list of world cities with the worst air quality. The capital's air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 198 around 11.35 am./India's Delhi and Nepal's Kathmandu occupied the first two positions in the list, with AQI scores of 266 and 213, respectively./An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered 'unhealthy', particularly for sensitive groups. Similarly, an AQI between 201 and 300 is said to be 'poor', while a reading of 301 to 400 is considered 'hazardous', posing serious health risks to residents./AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, is used by government agencies to inform people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them./In Bangladesh, the overall AQI is based on five criteria pollutants - Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants./The densely populated capital of Bangladesh has long been grappling with air pollution issues. The air quality usually improves during monsoon./A report by the Department of Environment (DoE) and the World Bank in March 2019 pointed out that the three main sources of air pollution in Dhaka ""are brick kilns, fumes from vehicles and dust from construction sites""./Air pollution consistently ranks among the top risk factors for death and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been recognised as increasing a person's chances of developing heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections and cancer, according to several studies./As per the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections./Over 80 percent living in urban areas which monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle-income countries most at risk./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Air pollution shortening life expectancy of people in Bangladesh,"Dhaka, Sept. 2 -- The Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago in Chicago's Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) stated that air pollution shortens an average Bangladeshi's life expectancy by 5.4 years. At present, the average life expectancy of Bangladeshis is 72.6 years. In 1998, life expectancy was cut short by 2.8 years due to air pollution. The levels of particulate matter - which are solid and liquid particles like soot, smoke, dust that remain suspended in the air - were found to be at least three times higher than the World Health Organisation recommended level./Most of the particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5, comes from fossil fuels such as from motor vehicle engines and power plants, said a study by the University of Chicago institute. Microscopic particles that are just 3 percent the diameter of a human hair are deadly when they enter the respiratory system along with oxygen. The average annual PM 2.5 concentration in Bangladesh was 77.1 micrograms per cubic metre (mcg/m3) of air, which is seven times the WHO exposure recommendation./In 2020, Bangladesh's air quality was the worst in the world, while capital Dhaka was the second second worst air polluted city. The most polluted areas of the country are the divisions of Khulna and Rajshahi, where the average resident is exposed to pollution that is more than seven times the WHO guideline - reducing life expectancy by more than six years. The PM 2.5 concentration is high in Narayanganj, Jessore, Rajshahi, Khulna, Pabna, Dhaka and Gazipur./Experts said that air pollution causes lots of diseases like ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute lower respiratory infections in children. Brickfields are most dangerous, but those are decreasing. But the use of fossil fuels is increasing day by day. If we develop our public transportation only then would private transportation come down along with the use of fossil fuel. The impact of particulate pollution is greater than the effect of devastating communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, behavioural killers like cigarette smoking and even war. Strong clean air policies can reduce fossil fuel emissions and help reign in climate change, which can also increase life expectancy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"2,000 tons of dust fly in Dhaka's air every day","Dhaka, Sept. 7 -- About 2,000 tons of dust fly in Dhaka's air every day, increasing the number of respiratory diseases in the city./Experts believe that the situation is getting worse since the development work does not follow the rules and regulations. The city corporation says all contractors have been instructed to control dust pollution./The construction work is going on from the Mohammadpur bus stand to Basila Road in the capital. As a result, the presence of excess dust has appeared in the air here./The same situation is on Abdullapur Road from Uttara House Building as the development work is going on. As a result, pedestrians are suffering due to dust./Research from the Stamford University's Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies says at least 2,000 tons of dusts are blowing into the capital's air in 24 hours. Pollution has increased due to road excavation and development work./Dhaka North City Corporation Mayor Atiqul Islam said instructions have been given to the concerned contractors to prevent pollution./According to a study released by the Institute for Energy Policy (EPIC), the University of Chicago, controlling air pollution in line with WHO guidelines will increase the average life expectancy by five and a half years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Seeking clean air and blue skies remains a distant cry,"Dhaka, Sept. 8 -- Access to clean air is a human right. The second International Day of Clean Air for blue skies was observed across the world on Tuesday. Facilitated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the day was observed emphasising the health effects of air pollution with a global call to hold the governments and industries accountable for their actions. In 2019, the United Nations General Assembly designated this day as the International Clean Air Day for a Blue Sky. This year's theme of the day is ""Healthy Air, Healthy Planet""./The importance of oxygen for our survival need not be emphasised. As a matter of fact oxygen is available in the air free of costs. Recently, we have witnessed the sufferings of Covid-19 patients with breathing difficulties moving from one hospital to another in search of medical oxygen. At one stage, oxygen became so scarce that many patients had to pay tens of thousands of taka each as hospital bills only for its supply. It may be noted that Bangladesh ranked 179th out of 180 countries for bad air quality in the world in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. In the same year, Swiss air quality technology company IQAir ranked Bangladesh at the top with ""worst air quality"". According to available studies and research, air pollution has given rise to acute and chronic illnesses like asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and damage of lung tissues, particularly among children, women, and the elderly./According to the office of the UNEP Regional Director, poor air quality deepens the health risks brought about by climate change which is already threatening lives of millions of children in Bangladesh. The concentrated factories, brick kilns and tanneries on the outskirts of the city release greenhouse gases increasing the atmospheric temperature. Pollutant gas emissions, smoke and dust particles from heavy traffic poison the air in the city that is already overpopulated, catalyse the adverse impacts of air pollution. Experts attribute this to unplanned development and construction works, lack of coordination among government agencies and lax monitoring./We must remember that the air quality of Bangladesh has reached a stage that it will be suicidal for us not to take the necessary steps urgently, to reduce air pollution to an acceptable level, as recommended by WHO. In major cities authorities must introduce mass transit transport facilities which will help reduce emission of motor vehicle exhausts./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Ozone Hole,"Dhaka, Sept. 17 -- In 1994, the UN General Assembly proclaimed 16 September the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, commemorating the date of the signing, in 1987, of the Montreal Protocol in the Vienna Convention on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Bangladesh has been observing the day since 1990 following signing of the protocol in the same year. In 1930, two French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson first discovered the ozone layer. The ozone layer is a layer of earth's atmosphere that has relatively high levels of ozone gas. This layer is mainly located in the lower part of the stratosphere./The closure of the hole in the ozone layer was observed 30 years after the Montreal Protocol was signed. Due to the nature and characteristics of the gases responsible for ozone depletion their chemical effects are expected to continue for between 50 and 100 years. The Ozone Layer which surrounds the earth at a height of about 25km protects life on earth by absorbing some of the radiation from the sun thus preventing harmful ultra-violet (UV) rays from reaching the earth's surface. Decreases in ozone amounts lead to increases in UV radiation./Exposure to UV irradiance reaching the Earth's surface is also affected by the amount of cloud cover and by the altitude above sea level. The increase in UV rays has been linked to an increase in some types of skin cancers, cataracts, lower plant productivity, and deterioration in certain forms of marine life./Stratospheric ozone is ""good"" because it protects living things from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Ground-level ozone, the topic of this website, is ""bad"" because it can trigger a variety of health problems, particularly for children, the elderly, and people of all ages who have lung diseases such as asthma. Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are certain man-made chemicals containing Chlorine and Bromine, which have a high potential to deplete the Ozone Layer through chemical interactions in the earth's stratosphere. Examples of ODS include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in refrigerators, air-conditioning units foam products, and aerosol sprays and halons used in fire extinguishers./The Montreal Protocol started life as a global agreement to protect the ozone layer, a job it has done well, making it one of the most successful environmental agreements to date. A united global effort to phase out ozone-depleting substances means that today, the hole in the ozone layer is healing, in turn protecting human health, economies and ecosystems. But, as this year's World Ozone Day seeks to highlight, the Montreal Protocol does so much more - such as slowing climate change and helping to boost energy efficiency in the cooling sector, which contributes to food security. The theme for this year is Montreal Protocol - keeping us, our food and vaccines cool./By developing cold chain solutions that are more efficient, more climate friendly, and cheaper to buy and operate, cold chains will become more effective and widely available. This will provide producers such as farmers and pharmaceutical providers with access to pre-cooling, refrigerated storage and refrigerated transport - ensuring products such as food and vaccines reach people in safe and good condition./Not only is ozone crucial for life on Earth but that we must continue to protect the ozone layer for future generations. Earth's ozone layer is healing, after COVID-19 decreases pollutions rate and that really contribute to healing ozone layer. Some expert says that the coronavirus outbreak fastens the recovery of the Ozone layer by decreasing the pollution./An ""unprecedented"" ozone depletion in the northern hemisphere has healed, but unlikely due to the impacts of worldwide coronavirus lockdowns, scientists say. The hole had been about three times the size of Greenland. A ""record-level"" ozone hole over the Arctic - the biggest since 2011, has now closed, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said. Despite coronavirus lockdowns resulting in a significant reduction in air pollution, some scientists said, the occurrence of the hole healing ""was completely unrelated to Covid./In Bangladesh Ozone depleting substances, all imported gases, were used in pharmaceutical, refrigeration, air-conditioning, readymade garments and aerosol manufacturing industries. As a signatory of Montreal Protocol, a global deal to phase out ODS, Bangladesh along with other developing countries cannot import and use of any kind of ODS gases of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) group, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform after December 2009 except for essential uses./Bangladesh was the first among the developing countries that had completely phased out hydrochlorofluorocarbon-141b gas from the foam sector of the refrigerator assembling industries. With almost 8.2% GDP growth, Bangladesh is experiencing increasing demand for appliances having ODS in air conditioners and refrigerators. Despite the challenges of this increasing demand, Bangladesh did and doing well in the phase out activities of ozone depleting substances and one of the most successful countries./The phase-out of controlled uses of ozone depleting substances and the related reductions have not only helped protect the ozone layer for this and future generations, but have also contributed significantly to global efforts to address climate change; furthermore, it has protected human health and ecosystems by limiting the harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth. Let this International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer is an inspiration towards greater ambition on cooling, at the Climate Action.On this World Ozone Day, we celebrate and acknowledge the Montreal Protocol and its Kigali Amendment in its wider efforts to keep us, our food, and vaccines cool!/(Dr. Majumder is Dean, Faculty of Science, Chairman, Department of Environmental Science, Stamford University Bangladesh)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Unfit vehicles 15pc responsible for air pollution in Dhaka,"Dhaka, Sept. 25 -- A recent study shows that unfit vehicles are 15 percent responsible for air pollution in the capital city. It says also that unplanned and uncontrolled road digging and construction work adds 30pc to the air pollution in Dhaka./Centre for Atmospheric Pollution Study (CAPS) conducted the research work./Harmful substances like chromium, mercury, lead, copper, nickel and silver are regularly found in the air and if these are inhaled in high amounts, these metals can make people serious ill like heart diseases, the study suggested./The study findings shows that brick kilns and factories contribute 29pc air pollution, vehicle exhaust fumes 15pc, trans-boundary air pollution 10pc, household and cooking stove nine pc, and waste burning seven pc in the capital./Experts said that smoke from unfit vehicles have been l increasing air pollution for the last two years. They said there was no crackdown against the black smoke emissions from unfit vehicles since 2003./""Unfit vehicles are increasing emission of black smoke/that is polluting the air hazardously,"" said Dr Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder, Chairman, Department of Environmental Science of Stamford University./Dr Kamruzzaman said, ""It is more dangerous that not only are unfit vehicles are behind emission of black smoke, even a large number of fitness certificate bearer vehicles also are generating black smoke.""/Chemical substances emitted by vehicles burning liquefied petroleum while stuck in traffic, is also harmful to the healthy environment and health, the expert said./According to the latest government data, there are 1.6 million registered vehicles in the capital. About 500,000 of those vehicles are running with expired fitness, meanwhile, the number is increasing by 20pc to 30pc annually. Sources said, in case of checking the fitness of vehicles, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority uses manual methods in 90pc of the time./The BRTA usually takes one to five minutes for every vehicle testing. Besides, the Vehicle Inspection Center (VIC) has not adequate capacity to test the black smoke of the vehicles in digital system./BRTA officials said preferring anonymity that there are only two machines eligible to use testing black smoke. ""Diesel-powered vehicles usually emit black smoke,"" BRTA Assistant Director (Fitness selection) Morshedul Alam said to journalists./He says that the problem occurs when the engine is not properly maintained.The expert said that only 32 vehicles can be tested every day as it takes about 15 minutes to check each of that fitness./During a visit to the BRTA offices earlier this week, it was found that the authorities inspected only one vehicle for fitness between 11am and 2pm. Another car was in the queue but the server crashed./Meanwhile, Md Ziaul Haque, Director for Dhaka region of the Department of Environment said, they regularly conduct mobile court operations to check vehicles emitting black smoke. ""We need a big project to reduce emissions from vehicles and other sources,"" the director said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

No respite from unhealthy air in capital as pollution is rampant,"Dhaka, Dec. 31 -- 01am, which is considered 'unhealthy'. Poland's Krakow, Pakistan's Lahore, India's Delhi and Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar occupied the top four spots with AQI scores of 292, 280, 208 and 189, respectively./Many of us know, the air around us is made up of many gases and fine particles. Those are so small that they're invisible to the bare eye. These gases cause enormous health problems when they enter our lungs. Air pollution is solely responsible for the death of over 70 lakh people each year across the world. Though unbelievable, approximately 90 per cent of the world's population is exposed to air pollution to some extent. In Bangladesh's context, it is hard to know the exact figure of death. However, a global report said Bangladesh saw a total of 173,500 deaths in 2019 due to air pollution, the figure was 123,000 in 2017. In our country, one of the big reasons behind the air pollution is unscientific brick kilns situated in the outskirts of Dhaka./The Department of Environment (DoE), the sole regulatory body to oversee the issues of pollution, has apparently failed to stop activities that are harmful to the environment. There are widespread allegations that a section of dishonest DoE officials unethically shelter polluting industries, unfit motor vehicles which emit harmful gases and smoke plus haphazard construction of roads and buildings that contribute dust into the air and owners of illegal brick kilns. Besides, dilapidated roads create dust and make the air of cities more polluted. In Covid lockdown time, the air quality was better. The people of developed countries are more concerned about the air quality which helps keep the air clean. In Bangladesh, the situation is totally different. Here, corruption forces DoE and officials of other relevant departments to compromise with pollution. They do not care though it ultimately costs their life too./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Causes and remedies for asthma increase in winter,"Dhaka, Jan. 4 -- Shortness of breath like fever is not a disease in itself. It appears as a symptom of other diseases. Symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy and watery eyes, chest tightness, cough, sneezing, are usually accompanied by shortness of breath. Maybe. Each year in winter, 80 per cent of children and 40 per cent of adults experience an increase in the severity of asthma or shortness of breath. /The main reasons for this are: cold, fever or flu outbreak at this time, cold-dry air which constricts respiratory system, increased amount of dust and smoke in winter, fog and closed humid environment etc. All of these increase the sensitivity of the respiratory system, which in turn increases the suffering of the asthma patient. Asthma is an incurable disease. Therefore, asthma patients must be more careful at this time. Many people suffer from asthma problemsAsthma is a chronic problem that causes difficulty breathing. This is a problem that can be fatal. Asthma can be a problem for one person at a time. Sneezing, coughing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing etc. are some of the symptoms of asthma People suffering from chronic diseases like asthma, chronic bronchitis, ILD, etc., have fragile respiratory system. Coronavirus infections therefore increase their risk of complications. Such patients may develop not only acute pneumonia but also acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In ARDS, lung tissue does not receive enough oxygen./There are some foods that increase the health risks of asthma patients. Today, coronary asthma patients are at risk. Dr. Mahtab Hossain Mazed, a prominent researcher and founder of Bangladesh Patient Welfare Society, writes in his column ...Outbreaks appear to be exacerbated during this period of time. Today, about 6.3 per cent of those who have died from Coronavirus infection worldwide in two years had respiratory problems. Lung diseases that carry a higher risk of corona complications include asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD includes both chronic bronchitis and lymphoma. The main cause of COPD is smoking. So those who have been smoking for years have an increased risk of complications from Coronavirus infection. Asthma is a chronic and life-threatening lung disease, known in our country as asthma, which is usually accompanied by coughing and shortness of breath. It is a very ancient disease in the Pak-Indian subcontinent. The first ideas about the disease were found in the early nineteenth century in the history of medical science. At the turn of the 21st century, with adequate research and experimentation and no permanent cure for asthma in allopathy has yet been discovered, the disease can be controlled only by treatment but it can be completely cured by homeopathy. And although we don't know the exact number of asthma attacks in our country, about 20 million people in America suffer from asthma. Only 10 million of them (including 3 million children) suffer from allergic asthma. Therefore, it can be said that the incidence of asthma is not less in our country./Studies have shown that with proper and regular treatment and a planned lifestyle, these patients can be saved from the onset of asthma Outbreaks appear to be exacerbated in some islands around the world, such as Esta-de-Cune, where about 47% and more people live, and an island called Koriliski, where 20 to 60% are infected. People suffer from this disease. Similarly, there are many countries in the world where the rate of this disease is very low, such as Zambia, Nigeria, Kenya, etc. Asthma is such an incurable disease that once afflicted, the patient has to spend a lifetime in agony, the person suffering from asthma can never join in social or family fun, can not take part in any hard work, he has to spend many days under house arrest. Cold weather is extremely dangerous in most patients' fields. In the cold of monsoon, the disease increases in cold of winter. Bronchial asthma especially increases in winter. Winter cold is unbearable for the patient. In winter, if a little cold air or fog enters the nose, sneezing first causes runny nose and then shortness of breath. When it rains a couple of drops of rain water, sleeping at night by an open window, traveling in wet air, the symptoms increase./2 types of asthma: -Acute Asthma: - Severe Asthma - Acute asthma in which the airways in the lungs suddenly constrict and cause difficulty in breathing. Chronic Asthma: - Chronic asthma causes frequent asthma attacks and requires treatment to control and prevent the disease./Cause - Allergic asthma usually builds up resistance against our immune system when an allergen or antigen enters the lungs through inhalation. Such as- flower pollen, hair of different animals, mite and dust etc. As a result, normal breathing is disrupted and hapani occurs. It is also called atopic asthma or allergic asthma./Non-Allergic Asthma This type of asthma is not caused by allergies but by smoking, chemicals, bacterial infections, stress, laughter, excessive exercise, aspirin, food preservatives, perfumes, excessive cold, hot, humid and dry./Different types of asthma: -/Mixed asthma: - In this case the patient suffers from the aforesaid allergic and non-allergic asthma. In some cases the incidence increases. Nocturnal asthma: This type of asthma attacks at night, especially between 2 and 4 at night. The patient falls asleep early at night due to physical weakness. Even short-term sleep during the day. Nocturnal asthma should be taken seriously as in this case the patient dies due to respiratory arrest. Bronchial asthma: - It is basically a kind of allergic reaction that causes shortness of breath and wheezing in the chest. Contraction of the muscles and mucous membranes around the trachea occurs. The main causes of respiratory infections, airborne allergens, food allergens and excessive stress Cardiac Asthma: -When the heart loses its normal blood circulation, pulmonary edema or constriction of airways in the lungs constricts the airways and causes asthma. This is extremely deadly. It attacks after a few hours of sleep because water accumulates in the lungs while lying down. Shortness of breath causes the patient to lose sleep and gradually return to normal after sitting for a while. This type of problem is more common especially in winter Occupational asthma: Occupational or industrial asthma usually occurs within a few months to a few months of taking the job. Symptoms usually subside as soon as you leave the workplace or while on vacation. 'S' Mill Powder, Chemical Smoke, Always Dusty Environment, Cement Factory, Garment Factory, Flour & Spice Mill, Rice Mill, Jute Mill, Spinning Mill, Dyeing Factory, Chemical Fertilizer Factory, Photocopy Machine, Driving, Poultry Farm, Bed Workers working in etc. are more affected by this type of hapani Seasonal asthma: -Seasonal asthma usually occurs in special seasons. For example, some people get asthma in hot weather, some people get asthma in certain flower gardens. Asthma also develops in trees, grasses, flower pollen, etc. Silent asthma: This type of asthma attack is extremely frightening and life threatening. Attacks without any previous symptoms or with a light sound in the chest./Cough variant asthma: This type of asthma is prolonged and annoying cough. Early symptoms of asthma patient: Suffering from chronic cough, Increased shortness of breath when exercising, Common symptoms: Increased shortness of breath in winter Frequent breathing, Coughing with phlegm, Ringing in throat and feeling dry, Coughing at night Going pulse rate fast, having trouble speaking, always weakness Feeling, Body blue. Asthma patient should follow some advice: -1- Bed and pillow should be covered with plastic seat or special kind of cover should be put on the pillow. 2- Dust should not be scrubbed. - There needs to be an open environment with light and air, pollution free. This is because fungal spores in damp places often cause asthma. So you should understand the condition of your body and take the risk of hard work - Light food should be eaten so that there is no difficulty in digestion. Because, indigestion and heartburn can also cause asthma. Foods that have allergies should be avoided. - If necessary, change the place and occupation. Fifty percent of such patients are well just by following the rules. Diet and diet of asthma patients. Asthma patient food: -1-Kusum hot food. 2- Seasonal fruits. 3- Goat's milk (including bay leaves, mint and black cumin). 4- Iodized salt and sea salt. 5- Honey, soup, juice./6-Black cumin oil: -Ginger mint tea. Foods that are forbidden for Hapani patients: -Eggs: - Egg allergy is very common for asthma patients. The white part of the egg contains protein. This protein stimulates allergies and exacerbates asthma./Milk: - Milk contains a lot of calcium which makes bones and teeth strong. However, the protein in it multiplies the problem of asthma. Almonds: - Experts claim that eating almonds also increases the risk of asthma. So refrain from eating nuts. Wheat: - A protein called gluten in wheat increases asthma. As a result, it is difficult to breathe properly Patients with shortness of breath have occasional shortness of breath. Concerns have been added to the problem at this time of the Corona epidemic. Because, in case of sudden onset of shortness of breath, it is difficult to understand at the initial stage what caused the onset of shortness of breath, corona infection, or chronic respiratory disease Refrigerated soft drinks 3-Ice cream, refrigerated food 4-Isubgul and gravy national food 5-Kachur Lati, Tita national food 6-Spinach and pui vegetables, masakalai, ground vegetables 6-Iron-rich tubewell water./Asthma patient should also wear all kinds of clothes - 1-Cotton national loose-fitting clothes should be worn./2- It is better not to wear silk, synthetic, woolen cloth. 3. You should sleep on thin pillow and soft bed./Asthma Causes: -/Extremely dry, hot or polluted, and water vapor is considered to be the cause. Hereditary AE disorder is one of the major causes of this disease. The disease can be caused by dust, body odor of the equine or the polluted air of the flower or by contact with the food. Inflammation of the lining of the nasal passages, enlargement of the nasal tumor tonsils, adenoids, increases the propensity to attack the disease. Homeopathy: According to homeopathy, three diseases are the cause of all kinds of diseases. Sora, psychosis, syphilis, sora-psychosis or sora-psychosis-syphilis are jointly responsible for asthma. This mixed disease-seed of the present age is called by many as Tubercular Mayajam, for which an experienced physician Dr. K. According to Hahnemann's Homoeopathic guidelines, if the treatment can be done by proper prescription, then the treatment of any complex difficult disease including asthma can be given by the grace of Allah if the person relies on a combination of individual vivic symptoms and metallic treatment. There is no such thing as eternal truth in medical science. Because once we heard that there is no cure for tuberculosis, now we hear that tuberculosis is good. All this is the result of the progress and development of science. According to the 2016 data of BBC News, about 40% of the patients in the country get cured by taking homeopathic treatment, again lately many reputed homeopaths have come out, they are treating asthma patients with patent tonic, mixed pathology Hahnemann Sankar, a homeopath, says that patients need to keep in mind that asthma is not a common ailment, so patients with asthma must be careful and alert at this time./(Author, Dr. Muhammad Mahtab Hossain Mazed is Editor and publisher, Daily Health Information Founder, Bangladesh Patient Welfare Society.

The Air of Dhaka,"Dhaka, Jan. 22 -- Dhaka is now at the top of air pollution in the world. According to a report by IQ Air, a Swiss-based organization that monitors global air quality, Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, is at the top of the pollution list along with Dhaka./Researchers and research institutes working on air pollution say that dust is one of the sources of air pollution in Dhaka. When these dust particles are in the mouth, people spit and spit everywhere. It can again mix with the dust and enter the human body through various means. Another source is the burning of coal and biofuels as well as smoke and dust from various sources, including urban mechanics. These scatter tiny particles in the air, which is harmful to human health./According to researchers, other causes of air pollution include brick kilns, industrial fumes, vehicle fumes and dust from road and building materials./As a result, the general population is becoming increasingly ill with respiratory diseases. The people along with the government have to take appropriate measures to avoid this situation. Awareness needs to be created./Ramisa Bilkis Jarin/Student, Islamic Studies, JnU/Prevent Child Labour/Most children of poorer families have become a source of income as the pandemic has greatly impacted the economic condition of those families.

Contaminated Air An Ominous Sign For Humankind,"Dhaka, Jan. 26 -- As a father, I always had this effusive wish to frolic in an open meadow in Dhaka, accompanied by my 8-year-old daughter; in the same gleeful manner that my father did, a few decades ago. I still can vividly remember that after a long run with my father, the exertion would always be soothed, when we used to sit on the grass, under a tree perhaps, and would be invigorated in a matter of minutes. Alas! It is an impossibility nowadays to find such a green meadow in Dhaka, which is befitting to accommodate a father and his 8-year-old daughter, especially when our daughters are beginning to grow multifarious respiratory diseases due to inhaling the dreadfully hazardous air of this crowded city./According to ""Air Visual""- an international atmosphere observatory organisation, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh is the worst air polluted city in the world. A report from ""the state of global air-2019"" - related to global hazardous air pollution has ranked Bangladesh as the top five countries in terms of hazardous air polluted nations. Collectively, we are exhibiting a self-deprecating oblivion towards the destruction of our posterity, as well as being apocalyptical to our future generations. This might well be the most preposterously concerted infanticide, which we so blithely are inflicting upon our future generation due to environmental degradation./World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported that 90% of our population is affected by hazardous air pollution. Air Pollution impacts everyone's health, but children bear the maximum brunt of it. The University of California, the UC DAVIS, Environmental Health Science Center have conducted a study on the bio specimen and fire effects, which revealed that air pollution alters the size of a child's developing brain which may ultimately increase the risk for cognitive and emotional problems. Unfortunately, children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, especially during their age of development. Higher air pollution increases respiratory infections and develops asthma. Children exposed to hazardous air pollution are more likely to develop bronchitis, lung damage and irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. Urban children are also facing the issue of neuron behavioural disorders. Needless to say, that the Air Pollution is gradually incapacitating the generation to come, both mentally and physically./The drastic effects of air pollution are not only confined to the children, the adults are also encountering the ghastly after-effect of breathing in this perilous air of Dhaka. It presents a threat to respiratory health and cardiovascular disease, obesity, reproductive, neurological and immune system disorders comes as an inevitable corollary. Air Pollution also affects memory and Alzheimer's-like brain declines. A person, exposed to longtime air pollution, invariably is posed with the threat of cancer, pneumonia, allergy, skin disease, headache, dizziness etc. Various researches suggest that our average lifetime can be reduced up to almost 3 years for indoor and outdoor air pollution. It has also been suggested that air pollution reduces our lifespan much more gravely than the active and passive smoking combined. According to the standard of WHO, Bangladesh is the top-ranking environmental health-hazardous country along with India, Pakistan, China. Besides, Dhaka has been listed as the second-worst air polluted city, with Kolkata and Lahore securing the first and third position./Our environmental degradation has increased manifold over the last several decades. Vehicular emissions, unplanned rapid industrialization and urbanisation are the main catalysts of air pollution. It creates the excessive presence of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide in the air, which adversely affects the ozone layer, livestock, and agricultural products. Acid rain, climate changes are directly attributable to air pollution. In Bangladesh, there are four main reasons behind the air pollution-emissions from old-fashioned brick kilns and unfit vehicles, corruption in the Department of Environment and dust from construction sites./Researchers have recently unveiled that 15% of the death of Covid-19 patients is caused by air pollution globally. A report from 'State of Global Air-2019' stated that air pollution is the 4th leading cause behind human death globally. More than 6 million lives were lost globally due to air pollution in 2019. Among those, Bangladesh has lost 173 thousand; the number is as dreadful as it sounds. According to research by UNICEF, a total of 300 million children are living in hazardous air polluted-prone areas. Unfortunately, this research also found that 220 million affected children are from South Asia. Every year, 6 hundred thousand infants, below 5, are losing their lives due to air pollution around the world./My heart was bleeding while writing this article, and I was almost on the verge of a breakdown, when I was delving into the reports of all those Air Pollution related researches. WHO's chief, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called air pollution a ""silent public health emergency"". As a father, I desperately urge all policymakers, as well as the fathers of this city, to process the design of a powerful tool of environmental and health protection. Here I have to utter from our national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, 'Rokto jhorate parina to eka, tai likhey jai ei rokto lekha (I can't shed blood alone, so I write these bloody writings)""./(M A Hossain, a political and defence analyst, writes on diversified topics in Bangladeshi and foreign newspapers.

High Court directives largely ignored,"Dhaka, Feb. 5 -- Keeping balance in the environment, especially to reduce the air pollution the High Court division of the Supreme Court has issued many directives from time to time. But all the directives appeared to have been largely ignored, leaving the air quality of Dhaka and its adjacent districts to worsen./The court has also recently reacted angrily to the inaction of the administration officials in complying with its directives.

To demolish illegal brick kilns HC has to order as if there is no govt authority,"Dhaka, March 3 -- THE High Court recently blasted the government for not taking sufficient measures to control the air pollution in Dhaka and its surrounding areas even after repeated directives. The situation has become awful because of air pollution. The court observed that no statement is effective rather than coherent steps to bring the air pollution under control./To prevent pollution, the court directed the authorities to demolish all illegal brick kilns in Dhaka and its surrounding districts -- Gazipur, Manikganj, Narayanganj and Munshiganj -- in 15 days as the brick kilns are considered to be one of the three main sources of air pollution. The court ordered the DoE and the districts' deputy commissioners to implement the directive without any failure and submit separate reports before the bench after demolishing the illegal structures./We know the air quality in Dhaka rated the worst in the world at different times in recent years. On February 9 this year, Dhaka's air was rated as the world's second-most polluted. Due to long exposure to dust and polluted air, people develop diseases like Asthma, COPD, Bronchitis, and Bronchiectasis. Currently, the country has 85 lakh patients suffering from Asthma, and almost 75 lakh patients suffering from Bronchitis and COPD./We can control pollution to a huge extent by using good quality lubricant and fuel for our vehicles, examining their fitness regularly, keeping construction materials covered, planting more and more trees around our homes, checking the continuous digging of roads on both personal and government level, and using environmentally-friendly ways in mills and factories. The brick estate owners should introduce environment-friendly brick production, while DoE should enforce the regulations./We urge the government, realtors, developers and brick kiln owners to introduce modern brick manufacturing systems. The DoE should be harsh enough to enforce environmental laws against all perpetrators.

Air pollution choking Dhaka,"Dhaka, March 22 -- The most of the Dhaka city dwellers are dying prematurely because of air pollution (dust in the air).

The roadside plants covered in thick layer of dust show the extent of the pollution./""Not only the construction works but also industrial process, brick kilns, waste burning, dilapidated road and unplanned road digging are producing dust in the city,"" he said./""If pregnant mothers come across excessive pollution, it may cause premature death of their children,"" said infertility expert Dr Rashida Begum./According to the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH), nearly seven million/people in Bangladesh suffer from asthma; more than half of them children. Cases of children suffering from bronchitis and chronic coughs have also shot up in recent years, it said./According to the DoE, old, poorly serviced vehicles, brick kilns (there are currently about 1,000 in and around Dhaka), dust from roads and construction sites, and toxic fumes from industrial sites are major sources of air pollution./The dust from construction works of government and private development projects, including metro rail project, and the black smoke emitted from brickfields and unfit vehicles are responsible for increasing air pollution in the city, said Dr Lenin Chowdhury, joint general secretary of Poribesh Bachao Andolon (POBA)./In the last 10 years, the air quality of Bangladesh, especially in Dhaka city, has degraded quite sharply. For the last two decades, Bangladesh has experienced rapid urban population growth, most of which is in and around Dhaka, he added./According to a study report of Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS) released on 3rd February this year, Dhaka's air has become heavily polluted with dust due to constant construction work without following any environment safety guidelines./The death toll of dust pollution is alarming. Contamination in the atmosphere caused by the discharge, accidental or deliberate disposal of a wide range of toxic substances. Often the volume of released substance is relatively high in a certain locality, so the harmful effects are more noticeable./According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 37,000 people die every year due to air pollution. We sincerely believe that the problem of air pollution is not insurmountable and if the government takes appropriate steps it can be brought down to tolerable limits./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dhaka The Noisiest City,"Dhaka, April 4 -- Our favorite capital city Dhaka has also occupied the top position in the world in terms of noise pollution after getting the status of a city of polluted air. This information was recently revealed in a report released by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). The report, entitled ""Frontiers 2022: Noise, Blazes and Mismatches"" on noise pollution, provides detailed information on how noise pollution is affecting people's physical and mental health. According to the report, three of the top five cities in the world in terms of noise pollution are located in South Asia. Muradabad in Uttar Pradesh, India and Islamabad in Pakistan are ranked second and third respectively after Dhaka in terms of noise pollution. Rajshahi, another city in Bangladesh, is in the fourth place in terms of noise pollution. In fifth place is the city of Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam. The capital Dhaka has been ranked No. 1 in the list of the world's top cities for air pollution more than once before and most recently in mid-March, Dhaka rose to the list of the world's second most air polluted city. This is really a very painful and worrying./According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the acceptable level of indoor noise for humans is 55 decibels and 70 decibels for outdoor commercial area. But in Dhaka this level is 119 decibels and in Rajshahi it is 103 decibels. Major sources of noise pollution include noise emitted from vehicles during traffic jams, noise from airplanes, trains, factories and recreational activities. If these words exceed the standard, it endangers the physical and mental health of the people, the report said./In fact, high levels of silent killing horns or similar levels of noise pollution are not new in many cities, including the capital, the long-standing accumulated problem has now taken an explosive shape. Noise from city vehicles, vehicle horns, microphones, loudspeakers, brick and stone crushing machines, generators, etc. has reached unbearable levels, causing serious harm to human physical and mental health. Every day thousands of children are losing their hearing due to noise pollution. Although there are various rules and regulations to control noise pollution, they are not being implemented at all. From the highways of Dhaka city to the residential areas - everywhere people are being affected by complex diseases due to noise pollution. Although hydraulic horns are prohibited to prevent physical and mental damage caused by noise pollution, vehicle owners and drivers do not comply. Even if it is forbidden to sound the horn in front of school or hospital, who cares! Continued traffic congestion has increased the level of noise pollution several times. The Department of the Environment is conducting campaigns to prevent noise pollution, imposing fines, but has not been able to stop noise pollution. Associated with the misery of the vehicle is the loud noise of the generator, which is being considered as one of the causes of environmental pollution./Dhaka is one of the most populous and unplanned metropolis in the world. While medical treatment is going on in the hospital, teaching is going on in the educational institution, then a group of people are seen on the street giving lectures with microphones, bus and truck drivers are playing hydraulic horns and making noise inside the hospital from outside. The skyrocketing voice in political rallies is constantly embarrassing people. These images are very embarrassing and disturbing and need to be avoided. It seems that there is no one to watch and supervise these!/According to Bangladesh Environmental Movement (BAPA) sources, 12 types of environmental pollution are the cause of 30 serious diseases and noise pollution is one of them. The main source of noise pollution is car horns. In addition, brick breaking machines, generators, mic sound, factory noise, listening to loud music, etc. cause noise pollution in various ways. For some time, now it has become fashionable to sound the horn in a loud voice./In order to bring the level of noise pollution to a tolerable level, it is essential for everyone to be aware, just as it is necessary for the concerned departments of the government to take necessary supervision and steps. However, any way it is required to get rid of noise pollution like air pollution and live safely./(Zillur Rahaman is a banker and columnist)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Developed nation's pollution will badly affect Bangladesh,"Dhaka, April 8 -- Bangladesh will not badly be affected by its own pollution, rather it will be the victims of the excessive contamination of the developed and other developing countries like USA, China and India./At least 20 percent of Bangladesh's land will go under water caused by this excessive pollution./Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque said it while addressing at the inaugural programme on the observance of World Health Day in the city's Osmani Memorial Auditorium in the capital on Thursday./Dhaka is badly affected by the pollution, he said, adding that ""Bangladesh will be affected by the excessive pollution caused by USA, Brazil, China and India. Our pollution level is low. This excessive contamination will leave around 20 percent of our land submerged,"" he added./Emphasising on restoring the soil, water and air, the minister said, ""Development is taking place everywhere in the world at the cost of destroying everything.""/Regarding the pollution in the capital, the Health Minister said, ""The pollution level is very high in Dhaka compared with the other areas of the country. We are destroying the environment by felling trees.""/The contagious diseases are increasing continuously due to noise pollution, air pollution, dusts which are affecting the 1.5 crore people living in the capital, he said./The minister also said the climate change is also responsible for increasing mental stress. Besides, drugs and smoking are responsible for health problems./Regarding the use of pesticides, Zahid Malik said that the farmers have to pay attention to reduce the volume of pesticides using in the lands./""The overused pesticides are causing health problems for consuming the food items,"" he warned./The minister said, no ministries can control the river pollution, air pollution and environment pollution. ""We are trying to make people conscious about these issues,"" he added./About the corona vaccination, the minister said, ""Bangladesh is in better position compared with other counties in corona vaccination programme. Bangladesh is holding the eighth position in corona vaccination application among 200 countries.""/Many African countries have not yet vaccinated 20 percent of the population, but Bangladesh, which is in the forefront of corona control, has been able to vaccinate 95 pc of the people, the health minister said./It has been possible due to the service mentality of doctors, nurses and health workers, he added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Solution to pollution: Sprinkling water on Dhaka's roads & construction sites?,"Dhaka, April 30 -- Summer or winter, air pollution trends across the seasons in Dhaka. And this year-round air pollution is largely attributed to the same emissions -- construction and road dust./Construction dust is basically silica dust prevalent at construction sites and is often held responsible for health conditions like asthma. Leftover construction waste also adds dust to air, reports UNB./Road dust, on the other hand, is loose soil on broken or unpaved roads, and includes vehicular emissions to an extent./Experts, however, claim to have a quick fix solution for Dhaka's air pollution that peaks during winter and prevails in summer too -- sprinkling water on all construction sites, public or private, and roads to settle dust./MA Matin, former general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA), told UNB that air pollution is increasing day by day in Dhaka due to the absence of an effective control mechanism./""Dust and sand particles cause air pollution but the city's two civic bodies have to take concrete steps to control the same. The pollution has hazardous health implications that can cause death directly or indirectly.""/Professor Dr Najmul Islam, director of the Disease Control Department of the Health Directorate, echoed similar voice./""Pollutants are getting mixed with foods and triggering serious health issues -- from asthma to lung disease and kidney failure. It's high time that the pollution was curbed,"" he said./Bangladesh Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin urged all agencies concerned to act in a coordinated manner to control pollution./""Time and again, we have set up several camps in Dhaka and other big cities to determine the air quality level. However, it did not work and we now need coordinated steps to curb pollution,"" he said./According to the Minister, it's the responsibility of the two city corporations to keep its roads clean every day. ""They must also sprinkle water on the roads to bring down the dust,"" he said./""Several decisions were taken at the inter-ministerial meetings to curb air pollution. Implementation of the measures can give effective results but there is no alternative to coordinated efforts of all agencies.""/The Minister pointed out that construction sites across the city produce dust, one of the major reasons for air pollution in Dhaka./""In other countries, we have observed that protective measures are taken around the construction sites. Open air construction of buildings, infrastructure development works have risen in the city. RAJUK has to play a more effective role in this regard,"" he said./He said to curb the city's pollution, government and private organisations have to comply with effective environmental measures, transporting soil, sand and other construction materials following proper protocols, and spraying water in big infrastructure and development projects. Shahab Uddin said that the Metro Rail construction work in the capital, going on since 2016, is also worsening Dhaka's air./""We have warned the Meto Rail Authority several times by sending them letters from the Department of Environment,"" said the Minister. Closed construction is the best way for curbing pollution, he added./Unplanned brick kilns on the outskirts of the metropolis also contribute to pollution./""Already 80% of the country's brick kilns have been modernised using technologies that are environment friendly. Soon all of them will have to produce concrete block bricks which are made by casting rather than burning mud bricks,"" the Minister said./The Environment Minister also blamed unplanned digging of roads in the name of maintenance and drainage works by Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA) for the city's pollution problem./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dhaka experienced much improved air quality during Eid holidays,"Dhaka, May 8 -- Dhaka saw a marked improvement in air quality during the Eid holidays when a huge number of people left the capital city to celebrate the occasion at their village homes with their near and dear ones. Dhaka's AQI was categorised as ""moderate"" during the Eid vacation. AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, is used by government agencies to inform people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them./According to weather analysts, Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. Brick kilns, fumes from vehicles and dust from construction sites are the main sources of air pollution in Dhaka. With the advent of winter, Dhaka city's air quality starts deteriorating sharply due to the massive discharge of pollutant particles from construction work, rundown roads, brick kilns and other sources./The World Health Organization (WHO) says air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. International media reports say, Russia's Krasnoyarsk, India's Delhi and China's Chengdu occupied the first three spots in the list, with AQI scores of 182, 168 and 160, respectively./Experts are of the opinion that the main cause of pollution in Dhaka is due to poor maintenance of polluted items. It faces pollution problems from all sides, as being a highly populated city. It becomes subject to the air contaminating effects of the massive use of cars, motorbikes, buses and trucks. Many of these vehicles travel the roads emitting far more pollution, releasing higher levels of contaminants into the air./In view of the existing situation, we want that the relevant government functionaries, private organizations, and even individuals across the country have to be more serious in taking appropriate action marked by suitable working package to keep the city as well as the country clean in the best interest of the citizenry./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Unfit vehicles continue without much action,"Dhaka, May 29 -- The silent killer black smoke emitting from the unfit vehicles in Dhaka and elsewhere is causing massive air pollution and posing serious threat to the health of the city dwellers every day./Apathy of the concerned departments, lack of regular drive and strict enforcement of laws, absence of digital systems to check vehicles and shortage of manpower are the major reasons responsible for the billowing of the black smoke from the unfit vehicles./Green activists said, when the laws are not strictly enforced, the owners of the unfit vehicles hardly care about people's health and environment and they bring their unfit vehicles on the streets to make money./They said, if the government is serious about the prevention of the pollution of black smoke, it is not difficult to curb it but such actions are hardly seen./Expressing helplessness, traffic sergeants said that most of the time they cannot take legal action against the unfit vehicles emitting black smoke in the streets because they don't have modern equipments to prove the violation of the law./Despite various national and international reports on black smoke in different times to make the concerned authorities aware of what steps should be taken, the regular drives against such pollution is hardly seen./The city's vehicles are not the only transports to emit for the air pollution but other vehicles especially trucks and big buses which move at night are also the major contributors of black smoke both by day and at night./According to a recent study conducted by the Centre for Atmospheric Pollution Study, unfit vehicles are responsible for 15 of the air pollution in Dhaka, which is alarming./According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections./The Bangladesh Road Transport Association (BRTA) is responsible for conducting fitness test and the Department of Environment monitors the emission of black smoke./There are over five lakh vehicles with expired fitness and this number is increasing by 25-30 percent each year, BRTA said. At present the total number of registered vehicles in Dhaka is over 1.6 million./Sources said, it is a punishable offence, according to the Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1983, to emit any smoke hazardous to the human health and environment./The traffic police have the authority to take actions against the unfit vehicles and to fine for the emission of black smoke responsible for air pollution./But Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) does not have any facility to measure the pollution by black smoke either./""Black smoke from the unfit vehicles is really a threat for all. We have rules and regulations but most of the time we overlook such matter because we don't have digital devices to check and to prove it for filing a case,"" Traffic Sergeant Abdullah Bin Hossain told the New Nation on Friday./He said that the pollution by the black smoke is increasing day by day./""We can fine the vehicle for it, but it will ultimately not bring a lasting solution because drivers and owners have become habituated to cases. The concerned department including BRTA has to be strict in issuing fitness licence,"" he added./""Once upon a time, the two-stroke vehicles were banned for emitting excessive black smoke. Now so many unfit vehicles are plying on in the streets. How do these vehicles get permission?"" he posed a question./The owners of the vehicles have their responsibilities and should think of the national health instead of making bucks, he added./""We are witnessing economic development in the country by industrialisation and urbanisation. But such development is going on at the cost of environmental pollution. It's becoming alarming,"" Executive Vice-President of the Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon MA Matin told the New Nation./""Industries, brick kilns and vehicles are major contributor to carbon emission, which is a silent killer. The government has to be sincere if they really want to curb pollution. Otherwise, nothing is possible but still we don't see significant initiatives here,"" he observed./As per ""State of Global Air-2020"" report, Air pollution impacts on life expectancy especially in less-developed countries./The report said, the life expectancy loss in Bangladesh is 2.91 years due to air pollution while the average life expectancy as per Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics is 72.8 years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Eco-friendly bricks being made in Nilphamari,"Dhaka, July 6 -- Air pollution is affecting the environment and the ecosystem all over the world, including Bangladesh. One of the reasons for this change in climate is the black smoke of brick kilns. The main cause of air pollution in Bangladesh is the production of burnt bricks with coal and wood. After the first Shariatpur and Barguna district in Bangladesh, eco-friendly bricks are being made in Hajiganj of Sadar upazila of Nilphamari through automatic machines./An inaugural and informative meeting was held in the Hall Room of the office of Eco Home Solutions Limited (Eco Block) Brick Making Company at Dalpatti-Nilphamari on Tuesday/At the meeting, Gerald Holtvaluer (Belgium), CEO of Eco Home Solutions Ltd., said that the brick, a mixture of clay, bricks and cement, was made using a modern machine (imported from Europe) at a higher pressure block.

Impacts of population explosion on air pollution,"Dhaka, Sept. 13 -- Air is essential for the survival of all living creatures. The quality of the air we breathe greatly affects the quality of our lives; whereas we can survive for days without food or drink, but we cannot survive without air for more than a few minutes. However, air pollution has emerged as one of the greatest risks to human and environmental health, making access to clean air a global concern./Pollution of the environment is often related with population increase. Population explosion is the primary cause of global environmental pollution problem that exists today. It is becoming impossible for the environment to meet the demands of billions of people by filling the gaps created by a growing population and diverse human activities that have exceeded the nature's capacity. Our ecosystem, especially the biosphere, is negatively impacted by population increase excessively. Approximately half of the planet's surface was covered in vegetation at the dawn of human civilization, but now only a very small fraction survives./In the 20th century alone, 9 million hectares of forest area were cleared for development. An estimated 17 million hectares of forest are lost every year due to human activities. Deforestation exacerbates the greenhouse gas problem by reducing the ability of plants to collect CO2. Extinction and habitat loss are also highly linked to deforestation. Agriculture is to blame for roughly 80 per cent of world deforestation, as previously stated. Another 14 per cent is due to logging, 5 per cent to firewood gathering, and the rest is due to other factors. All of these deforestation pressures are linked to increasing human population./All of these deforestation pressures are linked to increasing human population. We require more food, wood products, and firewood as the population grows. As the usage of fossil fuels has skyrocketed to maintain industrialized nations, human population increase and climate change have gone hand in hand. Higher people mean more demand for oil, coal, gas, and other underground energy sources that emit carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere when burned, trapping warm air inside like a greenhouse./Many components emitted by human activity contaminate the environment by combining with it. The elements present in the environment are in balance, but the elements emitted by humans combine with the air and disrupt the equilibrium. Again, there are some elements that are not naturally present in the environment but have been introduced by humans. Industry plays a significant influence in the emission of several forms of air pollution among human activities. Industrialization, thermal power generation, carbon dioxide from cars, and other greenhouse gases are forcing global warming to keep pace with the development of the human population. The city's air quality is degrading due to its growing population. Air pollution in the environment is a health issue./The main causes of air pollution include unplanned industrial expansion, brick kilns around big cities like Dhaka, and the establishment of numerous factories in the metropolis. At the same time, construction work is causing a lot of dust and pollution in the city. Due to traffic delays, cars spend more time on the road and consume more fuel, all of which contribute to increased air pollution. The climate is becoming hotter as a result of air pollution, and people are using more air conditioning to cool down. As a result, air pollution is increasing and these all are growing due to overpopulation. Apart from that, a competition of extreme irresponsibility is taking place in the name of rubbish and waste management in several cities, including the capital. There is no place in and around Dhaka city without a waste heap. It always stinks horribly; the environment is severely contaminated. The fact that 90-95 percent of government and commercial hospitals and clinics in Bangladesh lack a strategy to prevent patient infection from air pollution is sad but real. As a result, hospitals and clinics have become one of the most polluting places on the planet./Every year, more than 10,000 children die in the country as a result of air pollution. Human respiratory disorders are a major source of air pollution in Dhaka. Asthma, allergy issues, pneumonia, and respiratory infections are all increased by nitrogen, oxides, and sulphur dioxide. Bronchitis, high blood pressure, headaches, and lung cancer are all possible side effects. Sand particles induce pulmonary silicosis, which causes the lungs to become hard. When carbon monoxide is mixed with blood, the ability to deliver oxygen is reduced. Heart disease risk is increased. After all, many individuals die prematurely as a result of air pollution. According to experts, if one generation spends a long time in air pollution, the next generation would suffer greatly. Inhaling heavy metals and tiny particles raises the risk of neurological problems and cancer./The air quality in Bangladeshi cities is not good, according to a study done by the Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS). The most polluted air has been found in areas with higher population density. If the population continues to grow at this rate, the environment's resource will run out day by day, and pollution will continue to rise at an alarming rate. In order to prevent air pollution in city area, more trees must be planted. Large trees must be removed. Each year, an adult consumes 650 kg of oxygen./For this amount of oxygen, 6/7 large trees are required. Trees can be planted along city streets, in parks, after trees have been cut down, on islands in the middle of the road, and in open spaces in front of houses. Finally, Overpopulation is responsible for everything. With the increase in population, the need for human beings is increasing and so is the modern equipment. So,It is impossible to improve the situation without control population./(The writer is Dean, Faculty of Science and Chairman, Department of Environmental Science/Stamford University Bangladesh)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Trees in countering adverse effects of climate change,"Dhaka, Sept. 23 -- Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and this is due to our geographical location, overpopulation, floodplains, high poverty rate and over-dependence on natural resources./It is now continuously visible that global warming is increasing at an abnormal rate due to climate change. Also, food production and the availability of fresh water is declining. There is also an increase in environmental disasters, conflicts and mass migration worldwide./Various infectious diseases are increasing. We are already dealing with dangerous infectious diseases like the Coronavirus and dengue. Diseases like malaria, diarrhoea and cholera are also on the rise. We regularly observe floods, droughts, fires etc., in different parts of the world./Climate change affects human development and biodiversity conservation and threatens human security. No country knows its impact better than Bangladesh, where millions of people suffer each year. Rainfall in the monsoons has decreased, and untimely rain and flash flood damage crops, livelihood and shelter. Severe disasters like cyclones are also happening, and rising high temperatures and weather abnormalities hamperour usual activities./Along with sea level rise, Bangladesh is facing severe impacts such as coastal inundation and erosion, cyclones, salinity increase, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, shrinking agricultural land and local migration. Scientists predict that, due to tropical storms and salinity intrusion into agricultural land in coastal areas, climate refugees will be increased in the future./So in the face of this environmental disaster, we should try our best to plant more trees in rural and urban areas to adapt to the adverse conditions of our future ecological climate change./It is said that every living being depends on trees in one way or another. A lack of trees and forests can threaten our existence. Given the increasingly crowded concrete jungle, we live in, planting more trees has become imperative, and it can also save us a lot of unnecessary expenses./Scientists say a tree that lives for 50 years can produce $31,500 worth of oxygen, save $62,000 in air pollution control, recycle $37,500 worth of water and prevent $31,500 worth of soil erosion. . Moreover, forest land contributes about 1.74% of the total GDP of Bangladesh./Trees protect irrigation and aqueducts and keep rivers and harbour navigable. It also plays an essential role in protecting coastal areas from natural calamities. Forests protect the environment from pollution, and their contribution to biodiversity is immense. Forestry is a long-term production system, and multiple uses of forest resources have been recognized since the dawn of civilization./Trees act as a natural habitat, helping various plants and animals survive. They provide food, nutrition, and a sense of privacy and security to wildlife seeking shelter in the forest./Trees remove excess atmospheric carbon dioxide and air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. In return, they give us the oxygen we need to live. Even biodiversity is enriched in turn./Trees regulate climate by moderating the effects of sun, wind and rain. Trees moderate summer temperatures by providing shade and acting as insulation for homes in winter. Trees reduce soil erosion and help increase soil fertility, and rich soil builds nutrients in food, contributing to human health./The greenery of trees adds colour to the landscape and enhances its beauty. Trees and shrubs planted around the house provide evaporative cooling and are excellent sound absorbers. Fruit trees fill our food and nutrition with different types of fruits./Noise pollution can be reduced to a great extent by planting more trees. Planting trees facilitate flood water management and reduce flooding risk by allowing rainwater to seep into the ground rather than overflowing./Thus, we should do our best to plant more trees in rural and urban areas to ensure our future environmental, ecological, and climate security. The demand for clean drinking water can also be met by planting new trees. Forests and vegetation naturally slow down the flow of rainwater, allowing it to filter. By storing rainwater in underground storage tanks or reservoirs, we can increase the use of safe water./Also, trees prevent freshwater from mixing with saltwater in the ocean. In Bangladesh, tree planting programmes need to be strengthened at the grassroots level to meet the forest product needs of the local population and prevent environmental and climatic degradation./Through such programmes, we can increase our capacity to conserve soil and water resources and improve the socioeconomic conditions of our population. In particular, it can provide much-needed employment opportunities to the rural population./Apart from that, we must increase our plantation efforts to meet the demand for fuel wood, small timber, bamboo, fodder and other minor forest products. We should plant more trees to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, and maximum importance should be given to these efforts./(The writer is a researcher and/development worker)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Passengers on Dhaka-Gazipur road face untold sufferings,"Dhaka, Oct. 11 -- The untold sufferings of the passengers on Dhaka-Gazipur road started some ten years ago when the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project was undertaken in order to ease the smooth journey for the commuters./A number of times the project deadline was extended because of various mismanagements including suspension of work by the contractors halfway without any accountability, and slow progress to complete the work before time./Even lack of proper safety measures caused various minor and major fatal accidents during the ongoing project work at different times./The recent girder accident on August 15 killed five people in a car when a girder fell on the running vehicle in Uttara. The girders were being handled without maintaining proper safety measures./After the incident, the travellers always feel the tension of falling objects from the under construction project./The sufferings of the commuters have not ended here; rather their pains have been continuing while they travel along the road of the project area due to the rundown streets./The road from Gazipur intersection to Uttara House Building especially from Ershadnagar to Abdullahpur is in the worst condition for plying vehicles smoothly./The big ditches are found on the road here and there as the bitumen has washed away or removed due to the haphazard digging in the project area./The vehicles cannot play smoothly rather the passengers suffer the worst due to heavy traffic congestion both day and night./The intense air pollution due to heavy dust caused by the project work is another diabolical element for health hazards./Passengers especially the old people, children, patients said that they want a respite from the sufferings during their travel./""Our life has become hellish when the project has started. Every day I travel the road from Gazipur to Dhaka by bus.
