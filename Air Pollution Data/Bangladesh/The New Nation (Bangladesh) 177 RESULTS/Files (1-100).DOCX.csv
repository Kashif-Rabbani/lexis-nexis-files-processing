Automobile exhausts major cause of air pollution,"Bangladesh, Jan. 22 -- The number of motor vehicles has been increasing in Dhaka city day by day contributing to air pollution on the one hand and traffic congestion on the other./The gridlocked motor vehicles on the roads also contribute significantly to emission ingredients in the capital city Dhaka, specially emissions of carbon a persistent air quality problem./It is learnt that the ambient atmospheric conditions in the capital have deteriorated due to the unprecedented growth in numbers of motor vehicles, and levels of motor-vehicle related pollutants frequently exceed internationally agreed air quality guidelines./The main pollutants from internal combustion engines are carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide particulates of lead compound and unburned carbon particles./Moreover, the emissions from diesel engines are smoke, carbon monoxide, unburned carbon, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide./A recent study indicates that motor vehicles are also a major source of other toxic air pollutants including 1.3-butadiene, benzene and a number of carcinogens associated with particulate matter. As the vehicles continues to grow, motor vehicle emissions and the products of their transformation in the atmosphere, random acceleration-deceleration due to non-motorized vehicles in the city, are becoming increasingly important contributors to the major air pollution problem, the study adds./According to an investigation, the daily total emissions of NOx, HC, CO, PM, and SOx are estimated and burdened to city's air and equivalent to: 42, 39, 314, 14, and 42 tons/day, respectively./Besides, daily average concentration of NOx (NO2, NO) was measured at 28 street locations in Dhaka city. The results showed extremely high concentrations of NO2 and NO in each location./The pollutant species most often of concern with respect to transportation facilities are carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), photochemical oxidants e.g., ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), the investigation revealed./Experts say, ""A substantial part of total traffic is non-motorised vehicles which enhance specially in road intersections.""/Sources of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) have said pollution severity occur in Dhaka due to large number of high polluting vehicles, impure fuel, inefficient road use, and overall poor traffic management./The pollutants of concern for Dhaka are particulate matter, dust, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide, sources have added./Professor of Environmental Science Discipline at Khulna University Muhammad Mehedi Hassan said, ""Air pollution seriously affects the respiratory tract and causes irritation, headache, asthma, high blood pressure, heart ailments and even cancer.""

"10,000 die in city air pollution yearly","Dhaka, April 3 -- Over 10,000 people are killed in the capital per year because of diseases caused by air pollution from suspended particulate matters./A recent study on risk assessment of particulate matter and other causes of air pollution was conducted to find out the economic losses due to the adverse health effects of the pollution./Prof AK Azad and Prof S Jahan of Environmental Science Discipline of Khulna University and Prof J Sultana of Khulna University of Engineering and Technology conducted the study recently./Among the pollutants, SPM, whose levels are 5 to 6 times higher than Bangladesh Standard in the heavily polluted areas in Dhaka,is the most harmful one./The SPM composed of fully dispersed liquids and solids, including soot, dust and organic and inorganic substances./The study found that pollution is causing 74,000 cases of chronic bronchitis, about 70 million cases of restricted activity days, about 14,000 cases of respiratory hospital diseases, over 286,000 emergency room visits, about 2.8 million cases of asthma attacks and over 220 million respiratory symptom days each year in the capital alone.The study observed that air pollution entails economic losses to 3-4 per cent of the country's national GDP. After evaluating economic impacts, the study estimated loses in billions of taka accumulated from the cost of death, chronic bronchitis and restrictive activity days./It also estimated Taka one billion as cost for treatment of respiratory diseases, Taka five billion cost of asthma attacks and Taka six billion as cost of respiratory related diseases./""Three pollutants - suspended particulate matter (SPM), Sulphur dioxide and air-borne lead-pose a significant air pollution problem, having major public health impacts,"" says the study./Air pollution also reduces food production and timber harvests, because high levels of pollution impair photosynthesis. In Germany, for example, about 4.7 billion US dollar a year in agricultural production is lost to high levels of sulphur, nitrogen oxides, and ozone./Automobile and industrial emissions, bad civic practices and poor government services are some of the major factors causing air pollution./A World Bank report recently said air pollution kills 15,000 Bangladeshis each year. The report says the country could save between 200 million and 800 million US dollars a year - about 0.7 to 3.0 per cent of its gross national product - if air pollution in its four major cities was reduced./The report adds that 6.5 million people in these cities suffer each year. And the major disease is not diarrhoea, as is the popular perception, but acute respiratory infections caused mainly by polluted air. Published by HT Syndication with permission from The New Nation.

Stress worsen lung function in kids,"India, July 1 -- HealthDay News : Children who live in stress-filled homes experience more air pollution-related lung damage than kids in less stressful environments, a new study finds. Researchers looked at the effects of traffic-related pollution and parental stress on 1,400 children, aged 10 to 12, in California. There were no significant associations noted between parental stress alone and lung function levels in the children. /But as exposure to traffic pollution increased, lung function decreased among children in high-stress homes. This did not occur among children in low-stress homes, said the researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Certain factors associated with low socioeconomic levels were also linked with high stress, such as an annual income below $30,000, low education levels among parents, no air conditioning in the home and a lack of health insurance. The study appears online ahead of print in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. ""One possible explanation for the stress-related pattern of [traffic-related pollution] respiratory effects is the biological pathways common to effects of traffic-related pollution and stress,"" lead researcher Talat Islam, an assistant professor in the environmental health division at Keck, said in a news release from the American Thoracic Society. ""Like air pollution, stress has been linked to both inflammation and oxidative damage at the cellular level, so this may explain the association,"" he added. The public health implications of this finding are clear, he noted. ""The magnitude of the traffic-related pollution-associated deficits in [lung function] levels in children growing up in high-stress households was larger than deficits reported for children exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy and secondhand tobacco smoke,"" Islam said. ""Our findings suggest that by regulating traffic-related pollution levels around residential areas and schools, we could reduce the adverse effect of traffic-related pollution on lung function among vulnerable children,"" he concluded./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Poisonous smog hovers over city,"Bangladesh, Oct. 17 -- Suspended particles released intothe air from different sources, smoke and carbon monoxide emitted by motorvehicles and industrial units in and around the city remained trapped under ablanket of cloud that remained stationary over the metropolitan city of Dhakayesterday./The Bangladesh MeteorologicalDepartment said that the conjugation of westerly and southerly winds createdthe cloud over the city. As the cloud was mostly dry it produced fog instead ofcausing rainfall. The fog mixed with the smoke from the city and itssurroundings created the poisonous smog that hovered over the city for almostthe whole day./Dhaka's air is dangerouslypolluted with the concentration of suspended particles being more than doublethe permissible limits in many areas. Some areas are again affected byexcessive concentration of carbon monoxide and some others by sulphur dioxideor nitrous oxide, according to surveys conducted by the Department ofEnvironment./Experts say, smog is caused bymany factors. The smog that enters theatmosphere consists of over 100 chemicals, many coming from different sources.Particulates present in smog include carbon monoxide, dirt, soot, dust, andozone. To really create the smog effect,sunlight, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides have to mix together./Major producers of smog includeautomobiles, fires, waste treatment, oil production, industrial solvents,paints, and coatings. Car engines, especially diesel engines, as well as gasstations that allow gas to be leaked out are huge contributors to the smogproblem. Gas vapor that gets away fromgas pumps contributes to the hydrocarbons needed to form smog. Diesel engines emit particles of soot thatenter the atmosphere./When an area becomes covered insmog, the people feel the effects immediately. Unlike other problems, which may be harder to understand and visualize,smog creates immediate problems that everyone will experience./Smog creates many harmful healtheffects. It can cause anything fromminor pain to deadly diseases such as lung cancer. Smog slowly ruins people's lungs to an extentas great as that of cigarettes./The human body has difficultydefending itself against the harms of smog. Smog can irritate and inflame pulmonary membranes, causing chest pains,coughing, and throat irritation. Otherillnesses such as colds and pneumonia can also be brought on by exposure tosmog./People with asthma problems areunder an even greater threat. Even minorexposure to smog may cause these people to get asthma attacks./Mexico City has the world's worstlevels of smog. As a result, childrenand the elderly are advised not to live in the city. The heavy smog levels have had serious healtheffects in the city, though many poorer people who need city jobs have to livethere and suffer from the smog. According to a 2009 survey the concentration ofsuspended particles in Dhaka's air was 463 micrograms per cubic meter, whichwas higher then even Mexico. About 15,000 premature deaths and several millioncases of pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illness in Bangladesh is attributedto air pollution./The Met office has forecastnearly similar weather for today with light rain here and there over thecountry./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Lifestyles and diseases,"Dhaka, Aug. 31 -- A WORLD Health Organization (WHO) report has estimated that 44 percent of all deaths annually in Bangladesh are linked to chronic diseases. The increasing trend of chronic diseases have been explained as one result of changing lifestyles related to food intake, less physical activity, growing tobacco use and air pollution. The forces of globalisation over the last few decades have not only made our markets and economies more interdependent but also virtually linked the population with people all over the world through easy modes of cultural exchange, such as: internet, movies, tourism, education and the electronic media./All these processes change people's perception, attitude and behaviour while the open markets cater to our new type of needs in the form of importing and selling a variety of western products like Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), pizza, burger, sugary and fizzy drinks. Besides, local brands of fast-foods are also being popularised through rigorous marketing, promotion and advertising. The growth and popularisation of fast-foods are causing abundant intake of risky foods with little nutrition value. In this respect people's perception regarding being 'smart' plays a critical role. Junk foods like burgers cause people not to eat a proper balanced diet./The proliferation of computer, television, video games and various other forms of electronic entertainment which is helping people to avoid physical activity. Children, adolescents and even adults to spend more of their time in front of the TV, computers or playing video games rather than involving in activities demanding more physical engagement. Consequently, more and more children, adolescents and adults are suffering obesity and other forms of chronic diseases. Further, not sleeping in the night has become a regular feature for the young generation. The consequences of this tendency are taking a grave toll in health causing different types of sicknesses related to lack of sleep./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"Call to learn danger signs of pneumonia to prevent 19,000 deaths annually","Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- A preventable and treatable disease, pneumonia kills more children than any other disease in Bangladesh. Save the Children says that families and communities need to be aware of the danger signs of pneumonia, in order to prevent this needless deaths. The group added that increased coverage of pneumonia prevention and treatment interventions is also required./According to a 2011 national survey, only 35 per cent of children with pneumonia-like symptoms were taken to a health facility or qualified provider for treatment. Pneumonia is the world's leading killer disease of children under-five, accounting for more than deaths in 2010 caused by[m1] malaria, measles and AIDS combined./To highlight this issue, Save the Children in Bangladesh along with WHO, UNICEF, Smiling Sun, Bangladesh Paediatric Association, Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Child Health Research Foundation and ICDDR'B is organising ""Stakeholder Dialogue - Gaps in Prevention & Treatment"" for pneumonia on 11th of November, a day ahead of World Pneumonia Day./""The danger of pneumonia is the similarity of its symptoms to a common cold. This means that it often goes unrecognised, and hence untreated, killing thousands of children in Bangladesh needlessly each year,"" said chief guest National Professor M R Khan. Symptoms of pneumonia include rapid or difficult breathing, coughing, fever, chills, and wheezing./""It's the biggest killer of children each year, but the truth is, it can be prevented with simple interventions and treated with appropriate antibiotics. If only families and communities could learn to identify it and timely seek help from trained health care providers.""/Even for those seeking help, care may not be available. According to a 2011 report by Save the Children, 'The Status of Community Based Health Workers in Rural Bangladesh', none of the divisions in Bangladesh meet the minimum threshold of 23 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10,000 population that was established by WHO as necessary to deliver essential maternal and child health services./""The government of Bangladesh is training health workers to identify and manage pneumonia. However, without a health worker within the reach of every child, pneumonia will continue to go untreated, especially in the poorest and most remote areas. Every child has a right to healthcare access,"" said Professor Dr Shahidullah, general secretary of Bangladesh Paediatric Association./To reduce the number of child pneumonia deaths in Bangladesh, Save the Children recommends:/1. Increase coverage of interventions, with emphasis on reaching remote and poor communities, ensuring quality of care at all levels. 2. Strengthen community capacity (e.g. families, teachers, etc) to recognize danger signs of pneumonia and to seek appropriate care. 3 Increase access to case management at community and facility levels. 4. Orient informal providers (such as village doctors) on standard case management, timely referral and avoidance of harmful practices. 5. Increase coverage of immunisation and introduce pneumococcal vaccine into routine immunisation program as per plan. 6. Increase promotion of exclusive breastfeeding. 7. Systematically address the issue of indoor air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Help protect people from smog,"Dhaka, Dec. 30 -- SUSPENDED particles released in the air from different sources have remained trapped and stationary under a blanket of cloud over Dhaka city in the last few days. Prolonged cold weather has created fog to a suffocating environment for city dwellers. The fog added with suspended particles, harmful gases, dust, smoke has created smog that hovers all over the city and affects health of the city dwellers. The air of Dhaka city where almost ten percent of the total population of the country lives is dangerously polluted. The densely populated city is burdened with old and faulty vehicles, thousands of brickfields around it./Huge dust in the dry winter contributes to air pollution at an alarming rate. The smog effect is the worst situation created due to air pollution over a long period during dry season. A huge number of vehicles (60 % of the total vehicles in the country.) ply in the city and emit suspended particulate matter (SPM) that contains soot, responsible for absorbing and carrying harmful organic compound to lungs. Carbon monoxide when inhaled makes it difficult for heart to pump blood through arteries./The smog effect is dangerous threat to city dwellers especially to women and children. It can cause anything from minor pain to deadly diseases like cancer. Smog can irritate and inflame pulmonary membranes, causing chest pains, colds, pneumonia, coughing, and throat irritation. People with asthma problems have higher risks to face respiratory attack because of smog effect. A minor exposure to smog cause a healthy person to get asthma attacks. There is a little scope to deal with things that is concentrated on atmosphere naturally. Steps are needed to stop emission of poisonous particles and also to make people aware the harmful effects of smog./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Stop wood burning in brickfields,"Dhaka, Jan. 5 -- ACCORDING to a report in this paper on Friday, hundreds of brickfields at Savar, Keraniganj and Munshiganj near Dhaka city are defying regulations most uncaringly and continuing with brick burning by using firewood. Many such brickfields across the country continue to do so caring little for the regulations. The law needs to be vigorously applied in this area. The higher authorities ought to see to it that the directive regarding not using firewood in brick kilns is properly observed. Coal from Barapukuria coal mine is abundant and there is no reason why brickfield operators cannot use such coal feasibly./There are other regulations which the managers of the kiln ought to heed such as building chimneys at a certain height and positions that their exhausts can be discharged towards relatively less inhabited places. There are strict rules to prevent the establishment of brickfields in densely populated areas or too near places having considerable trees and vegetation. The brickfield operators should be obliged by the authorities to adhere to rules. As it is, many populated places are facing environmental degradation from the freestyle operation of the brickfields. People living in these areas are suffering from asthma and skin diseases./The dying of trees and vegetation in these places due to radiation of heat from brickfields, are contributing to the serious environmental decline there. The demand for firewood in the brick kilns leads to the cutting down of trees creating both deforestation and reverses to afforestation activities. All of these things dictate the need for more enforcement of regulations in relation to the brickfields. Smoke and shoot emitted from brickfields around the capital city add to the burden of air pollution that creates serious health hazards. The earlier the use of firewood in the brick kilns is stopped the better./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

How humans affect ecosystems,"Dhaka, Jan. 7 -- We all watch the news on the TV almost every day. Every day we hear about murders, robberies, frauds and other crimes. They show us this information because the news is meant to give us this kind of information. /They give us the right information and we think that's all we need to know but, there is something they miss every day. Something that is very important and should be the top story on the news every day. That something is how today's humans are affecting ecosystems by living modern lives. An ecosystem is basically a food chain or a food web. It is living and non-living things interacting with each other for survival. This cycle also includes us. Humans today are unexpectedly and horribly affecting ecosystems. An example of an affected ecosystem would be Africa. Africa is a continent where millions of people die every year because of diseases. This happens because they have already affected their communities, their natural habitat. In other words, they have affected their ecosystem. Canada, known as the most developed countries in the world is also heading towards this problem. We are also polluting our natural resources and ecosystem through several ways. I feel that we are letting this matter just slip away. My opinion on this is that we should take immediate action against this or else we might end up having a massive natural disaster./The main reason why I am taking this matter so seriously is because of the air pollution that is occurring. Air is the most important basic need for humans and other living things. We are polluting this part of our basic need horribly. Air pollution is mainly caused because of burning fuels. Burning fuels is a common consequence in most parts of the world. This releases a type of gas called the greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are very harmful to the ecosystem because they trap heat in the environment and do not let it escape into space. This causes the temperature to go up more than average in the summer which actually causes heat stroke deaths in some parts of the world. This is happening because of technology. People today are too dependent on technology. We are using the internet too much for chatting; we are using cars for short distance travels when we have public transport and feet. Cars are one of the most important reasons for burning fuels. Cars need petrol and that comes from burning crude oil. Crude oil is found in the Earth. Huge amounts of that oil are picked up from the Earth and are being burned. This causes a chemical reaction that turns the crude oil into petrol that the cars need. This is very harmful to the environment and releases huge amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The way to solve this problem is to lower the amount of car usage and take the public transport sometimes./The second most important reason is pollution of water. This has already happened to some parts of the world. The main reason for water pollution is garbage. In Canada, people produce about 16,000 tons of garbage every year. It is too much for a population like ours. The garbage that we produce goes to landfills that cover thousands of miles. However, some Canadian governors think that the place where the amount of land that the garbage is covering can be used for other reasons such as build a shopping mall. They thought that the solution for this is to throw the garbage into rivers and oceans and it will float away. The thing that they didn't know that this will pollute the water. The chemicals from the garbage will mix with the water and make the water dirty. This causes diseases in some countries. Countries like Bangladesh have already polluted their water sources. They blocked their underground sewage tunnels with garbage and caused floods that lead to massive health hazards and even death. Canada is actually halfway to water crisis. The Pacific Ocean which is a huge natural water source already has a garbage patch in the middle of it. I think this is a great example of how humans are polluting their water source./The last reason for my topic is the extinction of plants and animals. The number of plants and animals has rapidly went down since 2001. We are killing our nature by using plants for modern reasons. Even if plants and animals can't talk, they are living things and need the five basic needs to survive as we do./We are not letting animals have suitable habitat by cutting down and clearing forests for new constructions and other reasons. We are killing plants by cutting them down and using their logs for other purposes. Plants actually play a vital role by providing us the oxygen. Plants breathe in carbon dioxide that we breathe out and breathe out oxygen that we breathe in. This process is called photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants provide us the oxygen. So my point is that if plants do this huge favor to us, then why we kill them? I also feel that nature is beautiful and should be protected./My opinion on this topic is that even though Canada is one of the most developed countries in the world, it still has problems with its ecosystem. Other countries which have suffered from results of pollution are now trying to improve. They are living in poverty for their mistake. Canada is also beginning to face some serious issues with its environment and if we still want to improve and move on as a developed country, we have to start by improving our ecosystem. This is my opinion on ""how humans affect ecosystems""./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Air quality and citizens' health,"Dhaka, March 4 -- WITH the onset of warmer weather last year, the US Environmental Protection Agency had urged citizens to be aware of the increased risk of ground-level ozone air pollution and fine particle air pollution (when combined, often referred to as smog), and take health precautions when poor air quality is predicted. Good or low corresponds to acceptable or low risk situations. High values present an unhealthy high risk for respiratory ailments. To protect one's health, citizens should limit their strenuous outdoor activity on air quality alert days, and help take steps to reduce emissions when air quality is unhealthy./The new ozone standard in the US has been set at 0.075 parts per million on an 8-hour average basis. Air quality alerts are issued when ozone concentrations exceed, or are predicted to exceed, this level. Poor air quality affects everyone, but some people are particularly sensitive to air pollutants, including children and adults who are active outdoors, and people with respiratory diseases, such as asthma. When air quality is predicted to be unhealthy, EPA and the states will announce an air quality alerts for the affected areas./People in areas experiencing high air pollution have been advised limit strenuous outdoor activity, and reduce certain usages. The recommendations include: use public transportation or walk whenever possible; reduce driving time and mileage; use less electricity by turning air conditioning to a higher temperature setting, and turning off lights, TVs and computers when they are not being used; avoid using small gasoline-powered engines on unhealthy air days. These are very relevant to the city of Dhaka where air pollution is many times above permissible limits and the environmental watchdogs have a responsibility to take the cue and help protect health of Dhaka dwellers./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The programme includes a three-day Green Energy Expo-2013 which will showcase the best practices of renewable and energy efficiency technologies in Bangladesh./Officials said that after the success in installing SHS, the IDCOL has now taken up the improved cooking stoves programme as part of the government policy to promote eco-friendly cooking system./Bangladesh's tremendous success in SHS has come only in just one decade since the programme started in 2002./""We've taken up a programme to set up another four million SHSs by 2015. The programme may even achieve the target ahead of the time,"" Mahmud Malik, executive director and CEO of the IDCOL told UNB./Different donor agencies including World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), JICA of Japan and KfW of Germany have been supporting the IDCOL programme, he said./With the IDCOL's technical and financial support, different private business firms and NGOs are now installing 70,000 solar home systems per month on average./In a recent evaluation about the SHS project, the World Bank said that this has been possible due to the successful partnership between the government-owned IDCOL and the non-government organisations (NGOS) like the Grameen Shakti, Rural Services Foundation and many others./Solar home systems are an economically viable solution for providing electricity in villages where grid electricity would be too expensive to build, it said./The solar home systems consist of a solar panel, a battery, and a charge controller. The battery is charged by solar energy, which in turn provides electricity to the households. Solar home systems meet the basic electricity needs of rural people,/The World Bank said the electricity provided from the systems has helped children spend more time studying, and new opportunities are emerging for village enterprises. Rural markets can now remain open longer hours after dark and conduct brisk businesses, thanks to the solar lights./The World Bank has provided about US$ 492 million for the Project that ended in December 2012. Recognising the success of this programme in providing electricity in the rural areas of Bangladesh, the World Bank approved, in September 2012, US$ 155 million for the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project II to further scale up the solar home systems and other renewable energy options./Beside the solar home system, the IDCOL has taken an initiative to replace one million (10 lakh) rural unhealthy conventional stoves with eco-friendly improved cooking stove across the country./Officials said the conventional stoves, now randomly being used by the rural people, are blamed for a huge exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP) which causes acute respiratory infection. Because, these ovens burn huge biomass like woods, straw and also emit huge black smokes, but generate less heat./""But the improved cooking stoves will be efficient having 50-70 percent less fuel cost, but generate more heat. Women will be protected from indoor air pollution as it will have no black smoke and no heat misuse,"" said IDCOL General Manager Monirul Islam./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Smoking-free environment at MMCH hampered,"Dhaka, June 4 -- Lack of of consciousness, application of rules regarding smoking , availability of cigarettes have been hampering the smoking free environment of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH)./At the time of investigation by the journalists on May 20 found that patients are deprived of pollution free environment./It is seen there are two canteens at the hospital compound but the smokers are smoking out side and inside of the canteen areas. Journalists tried to talk to the Manager of doctors' and students' canteens but he was busy with customer care at that time./Alomgir (52) said it is very difficult to get law enforcer in time. For want of law enforcer, smoking free environment is being hampered. In spite of meeting symposium and writing in various newspapers again and again there is no change to this situation./The sufferer urges the authority concern to take necessary measures for preventing the air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Asia in greens - Bangladesh perspective,"Dhaka, June 7 -- I had the privilege to attend Expo 74 in Spoken, USA in 1974 where a discussion took place in a seminar about air pollution. Having got the time to speak for Bangladesh I emphasised of land and water pollution as a core issue in point rather than that of air pollution as in those days air pollution in Bangladesh was almost irrelevant. The delegates raised eyebrows having heard what I had said. After a spell of about 4 decades Bangladesh today is most concerned about air pollution, mostly not emitted by itself but due to global and regional input./Land pollution : It is a case of mostly own creation by the country as if self-inflicted, e.g. lack of recycling processes for garbage and effluent treatment plants amongst others./Water pollution : It is a case of both internal and external causes, though the latter is more pronounceable as Bangladesh is a lower riparian country of many common rivers. Commonalities of common rivers become sources of boon, if tapped co-ordinately and harmoniously but remain as a curse otherwise./China has planned to build a dam upon Yarlung - Tsangpo point on the Brahmaputra river in Tibet, when completed, It will divert water to the Yellow river a quantum of 200 bn cu m per annum equivalent to that of the entire lean season 6 months flow of Brahmaputra river./It is easy to comprehend as to how much India can get out of Brahmaputra's flow, once Chinese dam is put in operation, and how much can India afford to release to Bangladesh. This apprehension India has got to foresee as much as Bangladesh would, in view of the riparian state of both in the respective cases in point./Should India out bargain Bangladesh on the issue of Tipaimukh Dam and Fulertal Barrage, on the same analogy China is likely to do that at the upstream./In the process of desertification Bangladesh will become unlivable for Bangladeshis and soon this basin will become a no-man's land after having been inflicted by four-front attack i.e. from N-E-W river flow attack due to either shortage creating desertification or excess inundating with floods and of course from the South i.e. Bay of Bengal wherefrom will come the upsurge of water with all its might having concentrated salinity on account of global warming due to ozone layer thinning by the discharge of CFC contributed in bulk by the most industrialised nations, though Bangladesh contributes practically nothing or little in the ozone thinning process./The basic issue here is that flow pattern will change due to man-made dam disrupting God-made natural flow./In a nutshell, to obtain our legitimate share of water flow we shall have to depend upon the mercy of the upper riparian countries who will control and regulate flow through the Dams. What we need is a well concerted water harnessing amongst the common riparian countries./Regulated flow entailing change in the pattern of flow will do a lot of harm due to:-/Reduction in agri-crops, loss in navigability, less water availability, siltation of river beds, off-season floods, dwindlement of fisheries./Air pollution: Causes emanate from global, regional as well as local actions. Thinning of ozone layer is being caused due to major contribution of CFC up in the air by the most industrialised countries. Non-industrialised countries bear the brunt as if one is a nonsmoker but inhales also poisonous smokes as a co-traveler./Global warming : Due to ozone layer thinning, global warming plays havoc and more adverse diversity effect as :/Sea level rise is having a great adversity on a sea level Bangladesh land and eventually will lead to submergence of low lying coastal areas and saline water intrusion up into the coastal rivers and into groundwater aquifers, reducing freshwater availability; damage to the Sundarbans mangrove forest with rich biodiversity; and drainage congestion inside coastal polders, which will affect agriculture. Increased river bank erosion and saline water intrusion in coastal areas are likely to displace hundreds of thousands of people who will be forced to migrate, often to slums in Dhaka and other big cities./If sea level rise is higher than currently expected and coastal polders are not strengthened and/ or new ones built, six to eight million people could be displaced by 2050 and would have to be resettled./A global climate change model shows that the overall global crop productivity will reduce by 20-30% because of climate change and South Asia is particularly vulnerable./Bangladesh will loose about 8% of its rice and 32% wheat production by the year 2050./Protocols:- Conventions and/or protocols of Kyoto, Cancun and Copenhagen have resulted into a case of raising an Adaptation Fund. The developed countries should commit to provide 1.5% of GDP for climate fund in addition with 0.7% of GNI according to Monterrey Consensus./Little progress has so far been achieved, rather the richer, bigger and greater as CFC contributors the nations are, the lesser is their interest to raising of the fund./Green House effect : This is basically an internal issue of a country to emit minimum quantum of CO2 in order to reduce its green house effect to the minimum../Inventions of technologies have made advancement in the development of global economy but have also made adverse effect so much on some that they are likely to vanish from our mother earth./'If we do not look after earth, soon our mother earth will kill us all', wrote in a paper my grand daughter, only 8 year old. I could not agree with her more./Time has come, for us, Asia's most densely populated people, the sprit of our mindset is to talk green, drink green, eat green, act green, think green, go green, dream green and do nothing but green./Development of new technologies/inventions and innovations : The global scenario must change its attitude, specially that of the most developed industrialised nations towards use of more bio-friendly fuels, change of the existing technologies, if necessary and binding agreement for each of those countries not to emit carbon gases beyond the limited quota./The area of mistrust has now spread to encompass apprehension of dominance by the bigger and powerful member states to the smaller member-states on account of security as well as trade and economic domination, lack of exercise in equity towards sharing of common natural resources, (e.g. Berlin Rules on International Water Resources, 2004, assert the right of access of every individual to the water to sustain life without harming the ecology, even in times of war regardless of location of the water and whether or not the water source is shared)./While fear of domination by the bigger states appears to be the major apprehension of the smaller states, those smaller states, in turn, should also show depth of mutual co-operation towards forging ahead greater interest./What is needed is a synchronisation of ""big needs a big heart"" as small needs to look beautiful"" to effectively benefit member states of Asian region./To strengthen and cement the co-operation in the arena, let the mistrust, misgivings, misunderstandings and misconceptions be done away with./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Make the air fit to inhale,"Dhaka, July 13 -- According to the findings of the Air Quality Management Project funded by the government and the World Bank, some 15,000 deaths per year are attributed to poor quality air in the capital city. The air of Dhaka city where almost ten percent of the country's population (16 million) lives is dangerously polluted. The densely populated metropolis is burdened with old and faulty vehicles as well as hundreds of brickfields around it which both contribute to increase in the level of air pollution. The suspended particulate matters (SPMs), harmful gases, dust, smoke are present in the air in insalubrious proportions leading to an unhealthy environment for city dwellers./A huge number of vehicles (60 per cent of the total vehicles in the country) ply in the city. Of these a sizable portion is run by diesel and emit suspended particulate matter (SPM) that contains soot, responsible for absorbing and carrying harmful organic compounds to lungs. Hundreds of brickfields around the city emit sulphur dioxide that becomes corrosive after coming into contact with raindrops. Direct intake of these poisonous chemicals is injurious to lungs. Unfit old vehicles emit carbon monoxide that makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood through arteries./According to the Department of Environment, the density of airborne particulate matter is around 250 micrograms per cubic metre in Dhaka city, which is five times the acceptable level of 50 mcgm set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of Bangladesh. As research revealed, traffic congestion is one of the major causes of air pollution. Vehicles on roads in Dhaka city move at 14 kmph on an average due to traffic congestion that cause them to burn more fuel and concomitantly lead to an increase in air pollution. If pollution can be reduced by 20 per cent, at least 1,200 to 3,500 lives can be saved and 23 million cases of respiratory diseases can be averted. As a result, it would also save $170 to $500 million in healthcare costs and increase the productivity of city dwellers, the research also found./Air pollution is a dangerous threat to city dwellers especially to older citizens, women and children. It can cause anything from minor pain to deadly diseases like cancer. It also cause irritation and inflammation in pulmonary membranes and lead to chest pains, colds, pneumonia, coughing, and throat irritation. People with asthma problems have higher chances of succumbing to respiratory attacks because of the exposure to polluted air. Exposure to severe air pollution like that in Dhaka is highly likely to causes a healthy person to get asthma attacks. The authorities must ensure reduction of emission of harmful particles by stopping the operation of unfit vehicles, and making industries to conform to environmental standards. Safety of human life must come first by any standard - by keeping the air fit to inhale./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Curb brickfield induced air pollution,"Dhaka, Nov. 17 -- HUGE number of brickfields is operating in the country flouting relevant laws and polluting the environment. It is causing the biggest threat to the public health and we urge the government to stop the running of faulty brickfields to save the people. Estimates suggest that the number of brickfields may run over 11,000 and many of them are burning the air and producing bricks without the formal approval of the authorities concerned including the Department of Environment (DoE). The law stipulates that no brickfield can be set up within three kilometres of a residential area '- that is hardly followed now. It is one of the largest sources of emission of greenhouse gases, mainly CO2, responsible for global warming. Air pollution due to numerous brickfields around capital Dhaka and such other big cities is causing health hazards to large numbers of people. According to a study, an estimated 15,000 premature deaths, as well as several million cases of pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illness are attributed to poor air quality in and around the capital city and brickfields is a major cause of such deaths./There are more than 500 brickfields around capital city Dhaka. A World Bank study released last year found that brickfields in the Northern edge of the city is the main source of fine particulate pollution, accounting for nearly 40 percent of total emissions during the 5-month operating period. Suspended particles released in the air from different kilns remains the biggest cause of harmful gases, dust, smoke and smogs in the dry season causing health problems to city dwellers. The smog effect is a dangerous threat to city dwellers especially to women and children. People with asthma problems have higher risks of facing respiratory attack because of the smog effect. A minor exposure to smog causes a healthy person to get asthma attacks./The Department of Environment (DoE) has decided not to allow the operating or renewal of brickfield licenses using conventional equipment and methods that pollute air the most. Most of the brickfields are still using conventional methods because of low installation costs and because of their usability in low-lying areas. The DoE has hardly any control on most of the owners who are close to the government. It has inadequate manpower to detect violators. It is one of the major weaknesses in curbing the number of illegal brick kilns and conducting drives against the defaulters./Most of the brickfield owners with profit-making tendencies are taking advantage of the lack of adequate manpower of the DoE and are running faulty kilns across the country. But the health of a huge number of people cannot be left at the whim of these brickfield owners./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Air pollution in city five times higher,"Dhaka, Feb. 8 -- Country's environmental organizations have blamed the government for its indifference while the air pollution in Dhaka city is now five times higher than the normal absorbing capacity of human body.Although three wheelers or two-stroke engine driven vehicles have been banned plying for emitting poisonous gases, the unplanned mills and factories along with 2 lakh unfit automobiles are adding pollution to the air of Dhaka city, they said.""Of the three main objects - air, soil and water, the rate of pollution in the air is now at highest level in Dhaka city. The situation is dangerous,"" Shahidul Islam, Professor of Geology and Mineral Science, Dhaka University, said on Friday. Meanwhile, a recent study jointly conducted by Ministry of Environment [MoE] and World Bank [WB] have found the air of Dhaka contains at least 250 micrograms per cubic meter [mcm] of airborne particulate, which is five times higher than normal rate./In this backdrop, thirteen organizations including Bangladesh Paribesh Andolan [BAPA] organized a citizens' gathering in front of National Press Club yesterday and placed 11-point demand including imposing ban on old-type brick kilns and unfit vehicles.Other organizations are: Citizens' Right Movement, Green Voice, CIDAS, Unnayan Dhara Trust, SEBA, PEACE, Sundar Jibon, Nirapod Development Foundation, United Peoples Trust, WBD Trust, Blur Planet Initiative and Adi Dhakabashi Forum.The joint study of MoE and WB said: ""There are two major sources of air pollution -- industrial emissions and vehicular emissions. The smoke emitted by brick kilns travels to the main city, especially during the manufacturing season from October to March. This time, the density of airborne particulate matter reaches 463 mcm in the city -- the highest level in the world. At peak hours, the air at Motijheel Commercial Area has been found to contain 100 ppm of Carbon Monoxide,"" it said.""The industrial sources include fertilizer factories, sugar, paper, jute and textile mills, spinning mills, tanneries, garment, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, cement production and processing factories, metal workshops and other mills. The costs associated with air pollution in Dhaka are approximately US$800 million every year,"" the study added.UNDP in a research article also said that about half of Bangladesh's brick kilns are operating illegally, as investors fail to obtain licenses and flout existing environmental laws. Prof AK Azad and Prof S Jahan of Environmental Science Discipline of Khulna University and Prof J Sultana of Khulna University of Engineering & Technology in a study said air pollution entails a massive cost amounting to Tk 134 billion a year in the capital alone in terms of lost human health and life-3 to 4 percent of the national GDP.""The people like street hawkers, rickshaw pullers, regular bus and taxi drivers, street children etc carry a double burden -breathing the polluted air while working on the streets... There are no magic bullets and technological quick fix, but some draconian measures can save the city, otherwise Dhaka city will lose its battle against air pollution,"" said UK-based environmentalist Yousuf Jamil./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dangerous level of dust pollution in city,"Dhaka, March 28 -- Dust pollution in the city has reached an alarming level to poise serious health hazard to the people living in the metropolis. News reports published in a national daily on Friday highlighted the matter and blamed various construction projects, emission of vehicular smoke and road digging at various city points as some reasons for the spread of dusts and dirty air. On going earth works in the dry season is turning the dust to the level of poisoning of public life causing respiratory hazards and other diseases and even making clothes dirty quickly./The biggest source of dust at some city areas is some under-construction fly-overs. Moreover, digging of roads is in progress as carried out by Dhaka WASA, T&T, LGED, TITAS and BTCL to renovate or add new lines to their utility services in an ever growing mega city. It can't be ignored for a city that is home to an estimated12 million people and working on rapid expansion. But it also appears a cruel routine which is generating dusts every day for city residents during the peak working hours. The service providers are not only destroying environment and clean air, they are also making the city life unlivable. Air in Dhaka is mostly polluted with smoke, gases and toxic chemicals and the density of airborne particles recently reached to 463 micrograms per cubic meter. It is very high to make the city as one of the top few dirty cities of the world. Dust pollution here remains round the year, but it turns acute and above the danger level during the late winter to early summer./During the dry winter seasons, presence of dust particles in the air comes down to 200 micrograms per cubic meter but nonetheless it is higher than 150 micrograms which is the admissible limit suggested by environment conservation rules (amended in 2005). Given the situation, when the density hits over 400 micrograms and above, it speaks itself of the level of health hazards arising out of dusts and polluted air.Needless to say, the city dwellers are becoming increasingly sick from diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and the sort having their origin to dusts and dirty air making children and elderly people their worst victims in the first place. We share our environmentalists' concerns and that of other concerned citizens who are now questioning the failing role of Dhaka City Corporations and the Department of Environments to save the city from such attacks. They are allowing unplanned urbanization and not requiring some discipline in running construction work in the open air. We strongly want to say a modern city can't grow like this without disciplinary actions on spread of dusts and air and water pollution. World Bank data shows, the cost to health from dusts and air pollution alone in Dhaka city is about $ 800 million annually while 15,000 human beings die from it. It reminds us of the need to administer a strict anti-air, dust and water pollution regime to save the city. We ask the policy makers to take the matter into serious consideration./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Air quality deteriorating in most cities worldwide,"Dhaka , May 8 -- Air quality in most cities worldwide that monitor outdoor (ambient) air pollution fails to meet World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for safe levels, putting people at additional risk of respiratory disease and other health problems.WHO's Urban Air Quality database covers 1600 cities across 91 countries - 500 more cities than the previous database (2011), revealing that more cities worldwide are monitoring outdoor air quality, reflecting growing recognition of air pollution's health risks, according a WHO press release.Only 12 percent of the people living in cities reporting on air quality reside in cities where this complies with WHO Air Quality Guideline levels. About half of the urban population being monitored is exposed to air pollution that is at least 2.5 times higher than the levels WHO recommends - putting those people at additional risk of serious, long-term health problems.In most cities where there is enough data to compare the situation today with previous years, air pollution is getting worse. Many factors contribute to this increase, including reliance on fossil fuels such as coal fired power plants, dependence on private transport motor vehicles, inefficient use of energy in buildings, and the use of biomass for cooking and heating. /But some cities are making notable improvements - demonstrating that air quality can be improved by implementing policy measures such as banning the use of coal for ""space heating"" in buildings, using renewable or ""clean"" fuels for electricity production, and improving efficiency of motor vehicle engines.The latest available data have prompted WHO to call for greater awareness of health risks caused by air pollution, implementation of effective air pollution mitigation policies; and close monitoring of the situation in cities worldwide./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Enforcing anti-tobacco measures through higher taxation,"Dhaka, May 31 -- The member states of the World Health Organization created World No Tobacco Day in 1987 to draw global attention to the tobacco epidemic and the preventable death and disease it causes. In 1988, Resolution WHA42.19 was passed, calling for the celebration of World No Tobacco Day every year on 31 May. Since then, every year the day is observed by the member states with a specific theme for the day. The Day provides an opportunity for governments, non-government organizations and individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to a tobacco-free environment and thus ensure better health. The theme of the World No Tobacco Day for 2014 is raise taxes on tobacco.Smoking is a health problem, the costs of which include sickness, pain, grief and misery. /But tobacco use also imposes a significant economic burden on society. In addition to the direct medical costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses, there are other indirect costs including lost of productivity, fire damage and environmental harm from cigarette litter and destructive farming practices. The total burden caused by tobacco products outweighs the economic benefit from their manufacture and sale.Facts reveal that tobacco kills nearly 6 million people each year. More than five million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while more than 6,00,000 are the result of non-smokers being exposes to second-hand smoking. Unless urgent action is taken, the annual death toll could rise to more than eight million by 2030. Nearly 80 percent of the world's one billion smokers live in low and middle-income countires. The fact further shows that consumption of tobacco products is increasing globally, though it is decreasing in some high-income and upper middle-income countires. Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care and hinder economic development. In some countires, children from poor households are frequently employed in tobacco farming to provide family income. These children are especially vulnerable to ""green tobacco sickness"", which is caused by the nicotine that is absorbed through the skin from the handling of wet tobacco leaves. There are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, of which at least 250 are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer.It is now well accepted globally that you cannot be safe so long there are smokers around. For whatever reason if you inhale the air polluted by tobacco smoker you run the same risk as the smoker for having the adverse effect of smoking on your health. This is called second-hand smoking. In adults, second-hand smoking causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places.It is the poorer and the poorest who tend to smoke the most. Globally, 84% of smokers live in developing and traditional economy countries. At the country level, tobacco counsumption varies by socio-economic group. In many countries, at all levels of development and income, it is the poor who smoke the most and who bear most the economic and disease burden of tobacco use. A study of smoking prevalence among men in Chennai (India) in 1997 shows that the highest rate is found among the illiterate population (64%). This prevalence decreases by number of years of schooling, and it decreases to about one fifty (21%) among those with more than 12 years of schooling. A study in the United Kingdom shows that only 10% of women and 12% of men in the highest socio-economic group are smokers while 35% of women and 40% of men in the lowest socio-economic group smoke.WHO facts reveal that tobacco and poverty create a vicious circle. In most countries, tobacco use tends to be higher among the poor. Poor familires, in turn spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco. Money spent on tobacco cannot be spent on basic human needs such as food, shelter, education and health care. Tobacco can also worsen poverty among users and their families since tobacco users are at much higher risk of falling ill and dying prematurerly of cancers, heart attacks, respiratory diseases or other tobacco-induced diseases, depriving families of much needed income and imposing additional costs for health care.As mentioned above a specific theme for the day which provides an opportunity for governments, non-government organizations and individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to a tobacco-free environment and thus ensure better health, this year's theme focuses governments should increases taxes on tobacco to such levels that help reduce tobacco consumptions and individuals and civil society organizations work together to encourage their governments to increase taxes on tobacco to such levels that reduce consumption. Because tax on tobacco is an effective strategy to reduce consumption and thus save lives of million.WHO fact on tobacco shows that tobacco texes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among young and poor people. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10 percent decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 percent in high-income countries and upto 8 percent in low-and middle-income countries. Comprehensive tobacco control measures especially those demand-reduction measures such as higher taxes, advertising and promotion bans, smoking bans in public places and helping those who wish to quit are effective in reducing tobacco usage and consequently tobacco attributable deaths and diseases. From the income perspective, higher taxes will likely increase the share of income spent on tobacco, creating big opportunity costs on families' immediate needs such as education and health expenditures. When evaluated from a broader perspective, tobacco control is not only effective but also has positive impacts on the poor, society and the economy. That is because a substantial portion of the world's tobacco consumers are poor, and the poor suffer more from the burden of tobacco-attributable diseases and deaths. Given the higher price sensitivity among the poor, as taxes increases, it is more likely that the poor will quit or reduce the quantity of tobacco consumption. Consequently, a tax increase can be blessing as it becomes an incentive for poorer populations to stop using tobacco. Moreover, reducing tobacco consumption will help to create a long term benefit. In the mid to long run, as smokers gain their health, better health will improve the social and economic development of countries. Aa a member state of the WHO and for the health and welfare of the people, Government of Bangladesh is cordial towards control of tobacco and smoking. It passed smoking and tobacco products usage control law in 2005 and made it effective in the same year. Subsequently an amendment was made in 2013 to make the law more effective. The amended law banned smoking in public places including transport and kept provision of a fine of tk.300 which was tk. 50 earlier. According to new law leaves, roots, branches and other parts of tobacco or such plants would be treated as intoxicants. Moreover, cigarettes and bidi, tobacco power (gul), aromatic tobacco (jorda) processed tobacco (khoyni) and white leaves of tobacco will be considered as tobacco products. Amended law bans sales to minors and use of ""light"", ""mild"", ""slim"" and use of misconceptions on the pack is banned.We urge upon our Members of the Parliament to work together for tobacco taxation on various categories of tobacco products in such a higher and proportionate rate so that tobacco users, particularly young and poorer section of the society are compelled to quit or atleast reduce tobacco consumption which in turn can help creating big opportunity costs on families' immediate needs such as education and health expenditures. As we know the industry is powerful giant, only individuals efforts will not work. We must work together for a tobacco-free society. We have strength of law. Alongwith Governemnt and WHO efforts; health personnel, public representatives, social workers, NGOs, health workers, religious leaders, school teachers and individuals may work to raise awareness about the dangers of tobacco and smoking. The theme of World No Tobacco Day this year is very timely and appropriate and be utilized in a befitting manner. Working together we shall certainly win over the tobacco industry and thus keep our environment free from tobacco hazards for the health and welfare of the people.(M.A.Jabbar writes on health and environment issues and is Executive Secretary of ADHUNIK, national anti-tobacco organization of Bangladesh.)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Faulty charcoal factories posing health hazards,"Dhaka, Dec. 29 -- The factories usually produce rice husk briquettes, commonly known as charcoal, which are widely used as alternative cooking fuel in the rural areas of Sylhet. Small retailers and poor household use these briquettes mostly due to the unavailability of gas. /Comparatively cheap and easily available, briquettes are also smokeless and heat more quickly than coal or wood.The main ingredient of producing this fuel is the rice husk, the hard cover that protects the rice grain, found as a by-product after the milling process. Because of the existence of a number of rice mills in the Sheikhghat area, many entrepreneurs have set up a number of charcoal factories without any supervision of the government.Although the briquettes are considered a great source of bio-fuel, they have now become a great concern in the area because the poor quality of the end product and the factory.More than 40 charcoal factories, which have sprouted recently in the Sheikhghat area of Sylhet town defying environmental regulations are posing a health risk to the residents of the area. Doctors have opined that the inhabitants, especially the children and elderly, are at risk of asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and other such diseases. The heavy smoke produced by the low-rising chimneys of the factories are blamed for this situation.Residents of the area alleged that the whole neighbourhood suffers from the smoke created by these factories. All throughout the day, the factories continue to emit heavy smoke making life difficult.Babul Mia, a restaurant owner said he had been suffering from respiratory problems because of the smoke. 'The city mayor, deputy commissioner and other concerned authorities have been notified about the matter. But no action has been taken as yet,"" he said.According to the environment regulation, the chimneys of the factories should be 40 feet high. But in reality, chimneys of most of the factories are between 10 to 20 feet high.Some residents, on anonymity, said because of the low-rise chimneys heavy black smoke lingered in the air like fog all day. Many workers of these factories were suffering from chronic diseases, they alleged.Even the owners of the factories expressed the same sentiment. Haji Md Yasin of Ms Faiyyan Charcoal Mill said: 'If the chimneys were built according to the prescribed height, the smoke would not have been a problem. I am also a sufferer because of this.'Dr Tonmoy Bhattacharya, recently retired deputy director of Osmani Medical College Hospital said many people from Sheikhghat area had come to him with respiratory problems. 'The smoke from the factories can cause bronchitis, asthma and other critical diseases. Moreover, many important establishments like hospitals and schools situated in the area are also facing air pollution. The health risk posed by these factories cannot be overlooked.'Director of the Department of Environment, Salah Uddin Chowdhury told that the factories in the area were very old and they had been operating without licences. 'We often get complaints about these factories. It is true that the chimneys of the factories should be higher than 40 feet according to the regulation. We will see what steps can be taken in this regard.'/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Divesting from fossil fuels use in health sector,"Dhaka, Feb. 19 -- James Ayre :Is the healthcare industry morally obligated to divest from fossil fuels? Does an industry that purports to aim to do away with or limit human disease really have any business investing in disease-causing fossil fuels?/Those might sound like questions with simple answers, but you might be surprised at how many people are willing to defend investments in fossil fuels. On that note, though, a new report was recently published by a coalition of UK-based health care organizations calling on hospitals, health-oriented nonprofits, and others in the healthcare sector to divest from fossil fuels. The primary reason being, unsurprisingly, that fossil fuels cause human disease - though the report stated it more diplomatically, referring to the ""risk they pose to human health.""The report specifically called on the healthcare sector to cut investments with regard to the world's top 200 fossil fuel companies over the next 5 years. In what stands as a good comparison, the report notes that this decision is similar to the one faced by healthcare providers and hospitals in the 1990s with regard to divesting from tobacco companies.The report put it thusly: ""It is arguably both immoral and inconsistent for the health sector to continue to invest in industries known to harm health, given its clear responsibility to protect health. Continued investment in these companies runs directly counter to the health sector's repeated calls for action on climate change.""Climate Progress provides some more: The report outlines the impacts continued reliance on fossil fuels have on human health. Changes in temperature and rainfall are already contributing to the spread of some vector-borne diseases, especially those spread by mosquitos, since the insect lays its eggs in standing water, and standing water can increase as humidity and rainfall increases. In the Southwestern US, an increase of incidence of valley fever - a disease that's found in desert soil - has been blamed by some experts on climate change. And climate change's impact on crops around the world will also likely worsen hunger, which can take a toll on a person's health.Then there are the more direct health impacts of fossil fuels. Exposure to air pollution has been tied to myriad health effects, including ADHD, kidney disease, heart attack, stroke, and death. Fossil fuel extraction and production can cause major health problems too: coal miners are at risk of developing deadly black lung disease, and oil and gas wells have been found to emit toxic, cancer-causing chemicals, making living near these wells risky.This new report follows on the release last year of a statement from a UK doctors association calling on the World Health Organization to declare climate change a public health emergency - correctly noting that it was very likely a far greater threat than ebola, but didn't have anywhere near the hype.Reportedly, the British Medical Association - the publisher behind the British Medical Journal - did divest from fossil fuels last year. But other prominent divestments have so far been sparse in that sector./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The danger of air-pollution,"Dhaka, March 8 -- During the winter months especially, the anti-pollution face mask in China is as essential as the mobile phone. For all of the last decade, grim statistics of coal emissions and readings of airborne particulate concentrations have become commonplace in China, as much inside the country as outside.The appalling levels of air pollution in the People's Republic - together with widespread environmental degradation and the exposure of human and animal populations to chemicals and pesticides - are said to cause 1.2 million premature deaths per year, caused by cardiovascular disease, respiratory ailments and virulent cancers of the liver, bone, lung, breast and blood.These are the casualties of China's rapid economic 'growth', and the legion of multinational corporations which have outsourced manufacturing jobs to China on such a vast scale must be considered complicit. That has been the depressing tale so far, but China's middle class now demands a better quality of life and that includes - at the top or near the top of the agenda - better air to breathe.Solutions will certainly not come easily. The central government in Beijing recently announced a ban on all coal use in the capital by 2020, but China's existing coal plants will spew out carbon pollution elsewhere for decades to come.What looks like alternatives carry environmental costs of their own - coal gasification plants have been encouraged in order to transform abundant Chinese coal into cleaner-burning synthetic gas or liquid fuels, but 'syngas' (as it is now popularly called) has nearly double the carbon footprint of coal and the process is water-intensive.The problem, despite its mind-boggling size, scale and effects, is seen as an emergency by the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and that is why the elevation of the president of China's most prestigious university to the job of government minister was significant.Given the tarnished reputation of a ministry that is widely viewed within China as having failed, the move is now being welcomed - the former president of the Tsinghua University, Chen Jining, is China's new Minister of Environmental Protection and Chen now has one of the toughest jobs in the country, with high-profile environmental disasters that have became an increasing source of public discontent, and of discomfort to the party leadership.So central to life has pollution in China become that a work of fiction, written by Li Chunyuan, the deputy head of the environmental protection bureau in the Hebei city of Langfang, has become extremely popular.Working experience informed Li that the public will in China will loudly and frequently complain of pollution - his city is only 40 kilometres away from Beijing - and when that happens, environmental officials are in the firing line.In his book, Li has described the problem through fictional characters who are based on his own working scene - such as local party bureau chiefs replaced every two or three years, some positions lying vacant for a long time because candidates prefer to take fewer prominent roles (or even accept a demotion) than work in environmental protection.Li's fictional work owes it popularity to how accurately it describes the real world of pollution in China and the official responses to it - all too often diversionary and clumsy. /Air pollution levels in and around Beijing remained dire all through 2014.The area surrounding Beijing accounted for the worst air pollution in China, with Hebei province containing six cities judged as having the country's worst air quality, according to figures released by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. It has been a year since premier Li Keqiang said that tackling chronic poor air quality would be a national priority, but the new and entirely official figures show that heavily-industrialised areas surrounding the capital are still churning out harmful particulates on a massive scale despite the announcement of policies last year aimed at curbing coal use.Average levels of PM2.5, tiny particles in air pollution regarded as the most harmful, did drop from 106 micrograms per cubic metre to 93 micrograms in the Beijing, Hebei and Tianjin region in 2014, the MEP said, but this reduction placed air quality far below the 35 microgram level deemed as safe by Chinese authorities.Adding to the political pressure has been Beijing's mayor, Wang Anshun, who in a report in January, published by the widely read China Youth Daily newspaper, said his administration wants ""to establish a first-tier, international, liveable and harmonious city"" and is working hard at the task, but that ""at the present time, Beijing is not a liveable city"" because of its atrocious air quality.Yet change has come at last to China in the official recognition that to breathe the very air in the People's Republic is hazardous to health. It is now time for China to translate that recognition into a concerted programme away from polluting industry, power generation, and chemicals and pesticides use.(Rahul Goswami is an expert on intangible cultural heritage with UNESCO and studies agricultural transformation in South Asia)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The shocking health hazard,"Dhaka, March 12 -- For Nepal, a country roiled by political instability, Mount Everest is a source of national identity and pride. At this moment in time, that pride is at an all-time low. From pristine to down-right scummy, Everest's landscape has changed a great deal over the last half-century, and climbing the peak is now a greater health hazard than ever before. Media poop-scoops and indignant tweets offer an explanation as to why: While rescuing stranded mountaineers was once the main concern in Nepal's high-altitude tourism sector, rescuing the mountain has now become the main focus. /According to the BBC, advances in climbing technology and improvements in Nepal's mountain tourism have made it possible for more than 200 people to ascend to peak everest in a day with good weather, over five times the number able to do that thirty years ago. Suddenly, the roof of the world is getting crowded out. In April 2014, an avalanche led to the tragic deaths of 16 Sherpa guides - a name taken from the ethnic group living in the area around the mountain, many of whom are employed by it - and the abandonment of climbing for that year, highlighting precarious safety conditions in Nepal.This year, with mismanagement that has led to open defecation in snow, combined with the waste left behind by more than 5,000 ascents, there is a real danger of disease-spreading and contamination, which has seen Everest branded a fecal time bomb. This is not only a problem for climbers but also for sherpas and their families whose main waterways are at risk. According to the United Nations World Health Organisation (WHO), the improper disposal of fecal material is responsible for 4 percent of all deaths and 5.7 percent of all disability or ill-health in the world. The situation on the mountain is also likely to cause a big dip in the number of future expeditions, threatening the sustainability of Nepal's tourist industry and the incomes of hundreds of Sherpa families.In light of projected losses, the Nepali government has sought to attract foreigners back with a mixture of the carrot and stick, by slashing the price of climbing in the first part of 2015 but also targeting tourists with fines if they do not return with their rubbish.This latter mechanism has been in place since 2010 but not everyone agrees that it is effective:Leo Schilts, a commentator on an article written by the Guardian commented: Anyone who has been to Nepal will know that the piles of filth and excrement everywhere are not caused by tourists. [...] Fining tourists for the Nepali government's own failure is typical shameless profiteering from one of the most corrupt regimes in the world, 126 out of 175 in decending order on Transparency International's corruption perception index. Don't be fooled into imagining that money actually goes to remedying the problem. In the 60 years since development programs began in Nepal precisely nothing has been achieved except to enrich the corrupt and venal elite and devestate the cultural and natural environment.[...]The failure of governments in the region to provide even basic levels of sanitation, the unchecked pollution and wholesale destruction of natural and built environments which results in the preventable deaths of hundreds of thousands every year from water born diseases, air pollution and food contamination. I find it frustrating that the attention getting the headline here is the only one which finds the angle on the story of how this region wide emergency might slightly inconvenience the leisure activities of a few millionaires with enough money to afford the $70,000 plus cost for an Everest assent. It just seems massively self absorbed to me.Moreover, many argue these rules are not implemented: despite cleaning expeditions carried out by teams including that of Apa Sherpa, a local man who climbed Mount Everest for the 21st time in May 2011, it is estimated that at least 10 tons of waste remain on the mountain. Yet, not all hope is lost.Many, including climbers, have suggested ways to fix the situation, including fewer permits, smaller expeditions and restrictions based on experience. Moreover, the Head of the Nepal Mountaineering Association has confirmed that from here onwards officials stationed at base camp will be monitoring the garbage on the mountain more strictly than they have in previous years. The Everest climbing season begins this week and will continue through May. With around 700 climbers expected, the famous mountain's guardians will be under pressure to make good on their promise./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

85 lakh Asthma patients in BD,"Dhaka, May 6 -- Experts at a conference have suggested creating awareness among the people to reduce the growing number of patients with respiratory problems as Asthma Association of Bangladesh (AAB) reported that there are around 85 lakh people suffering from Asthma in the country. ""There are around 85 lakh people suffering from asthma in Bangladesh. It is also one of the most common non-communicable diseases among children in Bangladesh and remains highly un-diagnosed and un-treated,"" AAB revealed this on Tuesday in the second international conference on Asthma and Chest diseases- 2015. Organized jointly by the Chest and Heart Association of Bangladesh and the Asthma Association of Bangladesh at Bangabandhu International Conference Center at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the capital, the conference was chaired by Professor Mirza Mohammad Hiron.World Asthma Day is observed in Bangladesh as elsewhere across the country on the first Tuesday of May every year.Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Biswas Akhter Hossain, Vice Chairman of the AAB said that people should be made aware in redressing the growing complaints of respiratory problems in the country. /By the time, he said, the number asthma might have increased due to population growth, weather changes and industrial developments.Dr. Biswas said infants below two years of age, infected with respiratory infections, are more prone to asthma attacks. He reported that a nationwide survey on asthma prevalence in Bangladesh shows that in urban areas and villages the prevalence of asthma is the same but the cause of this disorder is reported to be different in these two vicinities. ""Air pollution is the prime cause of asthma in the busy city life .On the other hand, close proximity to animals in villages as well as pesticides used in agriculture and other biodegradable chemical proximity is causing asthma among villagers,"" he added. Dr. Biswas commented that it is not possible to avoid contact with the asthma triggers but if we practice the habit of wearing safety masks regularly, we can diminish our chances of developing this disease.Previously, experts opined that genetics was mostly responsible for this life threatening disease. However, recent research shows that air pollution and other triggers like allergens, climatic changes such as global warming effects, variations in temperatures, some medicines, respiratory infections, etc also play a key role in triggering asthma in people.Asthma is a chronic long-term lung disease that causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. The exact cause of asthma is still undiscovered. However, in most cases it is linked to hereditary as well as environmental factors./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Quit tobacco for a healthy life,"Dhaka, May 31 -- Every year on 31 May, World No Tobacco Day reminds us that tobacco causes health problems that include sickness, pain, grief, and misery due to various diseases and involves many medical costs for the treatment. In addition to medical costs, there are other indirect costs including lost of productivity, fire damage, and environmental harm etc. The day is observed every year in the member countries with a theme selected by the WHO. The theme of the World No Tobacco Day for 2015 is Stop illicit trade of tobacco. World No Tobacco Day provides an opportunity to create attention and action for all the partner countries, non-government organizations, and individuals in every community to work together for a tobacco-free environment that can ensure better health. The global tobacco epidemic kills nearly 6 million poeple each year of which more than 600000 are non-smokers dying from breathing second-hand smoke. Unless proper steps taken, the empdemic will kill, more than 8 million people every year by 2030 and more than 80% of these preventable deaths will be among people living in low and middle-income countries. /In Bangladesh, 43% of adults use some form of tobacco. Smokeless tobacco is used by 28% of women and 26% of men, whereas 45% of men and 1.5% of women smoke cigarettes. 57,000 people die every year from tobacco related diseases and 3,82,000 people were suffering from diseases and disabilities due to use of tobacco. At this scenerio, as a member country, Bangladesh will also observe the day in a befittig manner to materialze the WHO strategies and policies for the health benefit of the people. Why innocent non-smokers will be vulnerbale to the deadly habit of smoking: This is a question why at no fault of the non-smokers they will be vulnerable to the deadly habit of smoking. It is fact that non-smokers cannot be safe so long, there are smokers around. In anyway if non-smokers happen to inhale the air polluted by tobacco smokers they run the same risk as the smokers for having the adverse effect of smoking. This is called second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is the smoke that fills restaurants, offices or other compact spaces when people burn tobacco products such as cigarettes, bidis and water pipes. WHO facts reveal that there are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke of which at least 250 are know to be hrmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory disease, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places. Over 40 percent of children have at least one smoking parent. Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care, and hinder economic development. As such, steps have been taken by various governments to protect the rights of the non-smokers. In our country non-smokers' rights have been protected in the tobacco control law.Tobacco accelerates poverty: Tobacco and poverty create a vicious circle. Tobacco use is higher among the poor. Poor familires, in turn spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco. Money spent on tobacco deprives the family of basic human needs such as food, shelter, education, and health care. Tobacco accelerates poverty among users and their families since tobacco users are at much higher risk of falling ill and dying prematurerly of cancers, heart attacks, respiratory diseases or other tobacco-induced diseases. Specific goals of the World No Tobacco Day 2015: Raise awareness on the harm to people's health caused by the illicit trade of tobacco products, show how health care gains and progrmmes, tobcco control policies like increased tax and prices, pictorial health warnings and other measures are undermined by the illicit trade in tobacco products, demonstrate how the tobacco industry is involved in the illicit trade of tobacco products, highlight how the illicit trade of tobacco products is a means of accumulating wealth for cirminal groups to finance other organizxed crime activities including drugts, human and arms trafficking, as well as terrorism and hinder promote WHO framework convention on tobacco control.Taxes help reduce tobacco use: WHO studies shows that tobacco taxes are the most effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among young people and poor people. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10 percent decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 percent in high-income countries and by upto 8 percent in low-and middle-income countries. Tax structure on cigarettes in Bangladesh is based on 4 stages, the lowest being 40% and the highest 60%. The supplementary duty/tax on bidis ranges between 20% and 25% depending on whether it has filter or not. In the last budget, it was sought to impose 1 percent health development surcharge on all imported and domestically produced tobacco products for utilizing the fund collected from this source on the treatment of the victims of tobacco related diseases. This was a praiseworthy step, but it has to be higher and effectively introdued for the health and welfare of the people.Revolutionary steps by the Government: Bangladesh Government is working seriously towards implementation of the tobacco control law, which resulted in passing of the Tobacco Control Amendment Bill by the Parliament in April 2013 over the many loopholes of previous law. This was an important step in the history of tobacco control movement in Bangladesh. The features of the law are: the scope of tobacco control measures have been extended to include smokeless tobacco products, Graphic/Pictorial health warnings, covering 50% of the surface, on both tobacco packet sides (also chewing tobacco and bidis) are included. The fine for smoking at public places or transports has been increased from 50 taka to 300 taka. Establishment of the National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) at the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is a milestone, which works for the proper implementation of the law, monitor tobacco control activities, research on tobacco control and do related activities/actions on tobacco control for the health and welfare of the people.Tobacco users need help to quit: WHO fact reveals that smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most of them want to quit the deadly habit. As nicotine exists in tobacco, it becomes difficult on the part of the smokers to quit. Nevertheless, counselling, cooperation from the near and dear ones, medication and various awareness measures can help a smoker to quit the habit. The history of tobaco control movement in Bangladesh is glorious. With the establishment of National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the movement got strong footing. WHO theme, ""Stop illicit trade of Tobacco"" on the day is an opportunity for all involved in tobacco control programme. Different NGOs, health personnel, policy makers, social workers, academic institutions, and individuals are working towards a tobacco-free environment. We have many achievements in this regard. Nevertheless, we have to work against tobacco until the last victory. Working together, we shall be able to quit tobacco for a safe and healthy life for all.(M.A.Jabbar writes on health and environment issues and is executive secretary of ADHUNIK, national anti-tobacco organization of Bangladesh.)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Providing holistic treatment for diabetes,"Dhaka, Nov. 15 -- The World Diabetes Day wais observed around the world, including in Bangladesh, on November 14 every year to increase awareness about diabetes. The global diabetes awareness campaign was introduced amidst concern over an escalating diabetes epidemic. Jointly introduced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the day is internationally recognised and now an official United Nations Day. It was first introduced in 1991. The theme of the day, from 2014 to 2016 will be 'healthy living and diabetes' and this year, there's a focus on starting each day right by having a healthy breakfast.The number of people with diabetes reached over 40 crore across the world. /In Bangladesh, the number is 90 lakh and every year 1 lakh patients is being added to this number. At present, Bangladesh is in 10th position in the world in terms of number of diabetes patient.If effective measures are not taken to prevent diabetes, the number of diabetes affected people will cross 55 crore by the year 2030, apprehended experts. If a patient leads a disciplined life, he/she will be able to control diabetes, they said. Symptoms of Diabetes: Feeling urge of taking more food as if your digestion capability has increased suddenly several times more than before. But instead of gaining you are losing weight. This is the common symptom of diabetes.Treatment and Prevention: For the treatment of diabetes controlling sugar is not enough. Controlling the problems created by raised sugar level can make one free from future complexities. Changing food habit, regular physical labour and use of medicine is necessary. We must not forget that it's not possible to cure this disease only by medicine. Exercise is more important. We must concentrate on taking physical exercise.Stress and diabetes: From the children of nursery to the residents of old homes- every man of this era is to face stress and anxiety. This excessive stress plays a direct role in creating diabetes. It has been known from research that one of the major risk factor of diabetes is stress. Some other accompanying cause of stress can help in creating diabetes such as many people smoke to get free from stress. One of many harmful effect of nicotine is to increase insulin resistance. As a result the possibility of diabetes increases. Again many people drink too much to get free from the pressure of work load. As a result, pancreas sustains a damage and level of sugar increases. So, to get free from stress get yourself involved in gossiping, listen songs, meditate or go to neurobic gym or go on a trip. Don't do any harm to yourself by smoking or drinking. Listening music is good for stress and diabetes: May be you are not a good singer but certainly you have no problem to be a good listener. To reduce mental pressure music plays a major role- it is now universally acknowledged by almost all the doctors and researchers. To reduce the tendency of stress, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, recently some of the doctors are chanting the slogan- ""Stop drug, start music."" Yes, it has been proved that in preventing and controlling heart diseases the role of music is very much important.Walk as much as you can: It has been found in a research that those people who took exercise much more (4 hours in a week or daily 35 minutes) they have reduced the risk of diabetes 80% without losing weight only by walking. Why taking exercise is so good? Why walking is so healthy? It has been found in research that physical exercise increases the number of insulin receptor in body cell.Habit of taking coffee is good: It has been found in Harvard Public Health research that taking 3-4 cup of coffee daily reduce the risk of diabetes by 29-54%.Consume spicy food: Cinnamon, methi and clove make a remarkable impact on blood sugar. German researchers found that a one gram tablet made from cinnamon powder can reduce 10% blood sugar. An ingredient that is present in cinnamon activates those enzymes which stimulate insulin receptor. This sweet spice also reduces cholesterol and fat of blood.Feel relaxed everyday: If mind feels stress then body becomes active. It becomes excited. Heart-beat becomes faster. Breathing becomes faster and the sugar level in blood reaches its highest level. During stress body reaches in 'fight of retreat' condition. It's good news that a little bit relaxation exercise and other tricks to face stress can control sugar level of blood.Sound sleep at night: From a research in Yell University it has been found that who sleep regularly less than six hours at night are in the risk of diabetes 2 times more than those who sleep 8 hours. For sound sleep you should stop tea, coffee and chocolate after afternoon. Leave your work at office. Don't bring office work at home. Don't watch TV at late night. Keep your mobile off when you sleep. Stay with companion, stay with friends: Those women who live lonely are in the risk of diabetes 2.5 times more than those who live with family. Researchers have revealed such opinion. This is equally applicable for men. So, stay with good company.Emphasis is being given on leading healthy life in controlling diabetes all over the world. Leading healthy life means healthy food habit, taking physical exercise and keeping sound mind. To keep mind sound it should be kept stress free. Stress on both body and mind is harmful. Most of the people think that pressure of job and family is the main pressure. These are stress or pressure of course. But the main stress is surrounding environment, air pollution, what we eat, electromagnetic wave that come from TV set, computer or other electronic devices. Without these there is economical pressure, lack of inspiration of doing good work in work places. To reduce stress yoga, meditation and neurobic gym are useful method. To thank everyone silently for living one day more is also considered as the process of reducing stress. To prevent and control diabetes all over the world holistic method is becoming popular. Holistic method is the wonderful combination of modern technology and ancient natural method. The basic key of this treatment is: changing in lifestyle, habit of taking healthy food, yoga, pranayam, meditation, neurobic gym and acupressure. Patient's regular food habit depends on his/her age, the type of disease and his present condition. Taking balanced diet keep one fit. And the matter of exercise is miscellaneous. Before this, meditation in a proper way is needed to control mind. Mental stress is the main cause of man's illness and unhappiness. To reduce mental stress is very much important. By playing a leading role for the past one decade in holistic treatment, Holistic Health Care Center has brought good news for thousands of patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease. As a result, the risk of diabetes is reducing. And those who are suffering over a long time with diabetes are now leading a happy life. Many patients have reduced the level of taking insulin and many others have completely stopped taking insulin. In Bangladesh, Holistic treatment is working as a helpful friend for the patients of diabetes and coronary blockage./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Cancer patients doubled within a decade,"Dhaka, Jan. 1 -- A NATIONAL daily reported on Wednesday that in the last decade, the number of cancer patients has doubled in Bangladesh, quoting sources in the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICRH). The report was based on the admission of the patients in different hospitals across the country. Most of the patients (2436) were diagnosed with cancers of the respiratory tract, including 1,983 lung cancer patients. /Smoking causes most of the cancers.Cancer is a generic term for a group of more than 100 diseases that can affect any part of the human body. Cancer has appeared as an important public health problem in Bangladesh. Due to lack of an appropriate reporting system and under-diagnosis of cancer cases, the real situation is often unknown.A recent WHO study estimated that there are 49,000 oral, 71,000 laryngeal and 196,000 lung cancer cases in Bangladesh among those aged 30 years or above in the country. More than 70 percent of cancer related deaths occur in low-and middle-income families. Another study reported that rate of deaths from respiratory tract (trachea, lung and bronchus) cancers is comparatively higher in Bangladesh compared to other SAARC countries Sri Lanka, India, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal, and Pakistan. Experts say that about 30 percent of cancer deaths can be prevented.In Bangladesh, common risk factors causing cancer include tobacco use, being overweight or obese, low fruit and vegetable intake, formalin intake with food, physical inactivity, alcohol use, sexually transmitted Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection, urban air pollution, indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels and etc.Bangladesh has a health care system that is poorly prepared to grapple with the double burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases like cancer. Currently, majority of our people do not have access to curative therapies due to our poor economy. They cannot simply afford state-of-the-art medical facilities, or expensive cancer drugs. Experts suggest that about one-third of the cancer burden could be decreased if cases were detected and treated early by educating people about the early signs and countrywide screening program. Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer have high cure rates when detected early and treated according to best practice. Therefore, scaling up prevention and early diagnosis are the most cost-effective ways of dealing with cancer. Relief from pain and other problems can be achieved in over 90 percent of cancer patients through palliative care. As health care is a right, so the government should provide sophisticated diagnosis system and drugs at affordable costs so that poor people can take the opportunity of public health care benefits.

Pollution in the city is no concern of anybody,"Dhaka, Jan. 5 -- AS it appears dusts and other pollutants are increasingly destroying air quality in Dhaka city making Bangladesh the fourth country with worst urban air quality in the world. Industrial discharge from factories located around the city is also destroying the air quality affecting the lives of the city dwellers during dry season. /Dust is mainly coming from building construction, earth digging for flyovers and metro-rail projects and such other activities. What is more worrying is that the air quality is far more unhealthy and even worse in Gazipur and Narayangonj and as per experts' view about 90 percent of people in these cities are at risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases including lung cancer. What is alarming is the rise in industrial smog strengthened by smoke from transport vehicles in city streets and brick kilns around the city. In absence of any strong regulatory measures and coordination among law enforcers, service sectors and utility providers, the air quality is at its worst now in the city making people's life vulnerable to diseases such emphysema, bronchitis and asthma, common cold and coughs. Environmental activists say when the air pollution is at its highest level there is hardly any initiative visible to address it. The City managers have accepted the problem as a daily matter and as if has no remedy but to continue to suffer. Surprisingly the serious health issue is missing from public debate. Meanwhile, as per data from the Department of Environment (DoE), the air pollution level (PM) from dusts runs up to 463 micrograms per cubic meter (mcm) in Dhaka city in dry season making it the highest at global standard which is congenial at 20mcm. The air pollution problem is taking its toll silently as some figure suggest over fifteen thousand people die every year due to poor air quality and 50 percent of it is children. Moreover several millions more suffer from associated diseases. Even long-term exposure to dust during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or physical and/or mental anomalies of newborn. Houses on roadside even can't open doors and windows while dusts spill up everywhere outside rendering people helpless and live with it. . World Bank data the medical cost for treating airborne diseases runs up to $800 million annually for Dhaka city residents alone and the situation demands far-reaching goal setting to avoid creating unnecessary dusts and air pollution and manage it where it stands unavoidable. We believe that the government must take the issue seriously and put in place corrective measures to contain the spread of dusts and smokes to preserve the air quality in the city and around at permissible level. The two City Corporations have their own responsibility, in addition to playing the role of coordination to keep the air clean. The authorities feel no accountability and that is the problem of mismanagement everywhere./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Managing waste of Dhaka city,"Dhaka, Jan. 30 -- Wastes are not new. Waste generation is rooted to the origin of mankind. We, human beings, are responsible for generating and managing waste. History shows that early humans simply dug hole and buried their refuse and trash. /This was an effective technique in that time as their generation of waste was relatively small. Even a few decades ago waste management was not a major concern in a developing country like Bangladesh. Population growth has become one of the severe problems in our time. Due to uncontrolled population growth there emerges unplanned urbanisation, industrialisation which generates a huge amount of waste. People are migrating to cities rapidly and the projected urban population growth rate from 2010-2015 is 3%. This growing urban population particularly in larger cities like Dhaka is creating problem of waste management. There are various kinds of wastages - municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, wastewater which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine), radioactive waste etc. Municipal solid waste includes household trash, garbage, refuse, sludge and discarded material and the wastes are produced by industry, hospital etc. When waste is not properly collected and dispose, of illegally and causes serious environmental degradation and health hazards. In Dhaka city, waste collection rate is very low and most often wastes are thrown to open air. This results in uncollected waste on roads, drains, rivers and other public places which makes people's life unhealthy vulnerable, and pollutes the environment. According to UNFPA, Dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world and one of the prime issues of concern is the management of municipal waste. Two City Corporations of Dhaka hold the official responsibility of waste management. City Corporations divided their area into 10 zones for management of solid waste generated in the domestic, commercial, industrial and medical sectors. The total solid waste management involves 3 departments for smooth and easy operations namely - Conservancy, Transport and Mechanical Engineering. The aims and functions of these departments are removal of refuse from the public streets/drains; collection, transportation and disposal of refuse and providing dustbins and other receptacles for accumulation of solid waste. The total amount of solid waste generated every day in Dhaka city area is about 4500 to 5000 tons. The total waste collection rate is only 37%. A large proportion of population has zero access to proper waste disposal services which leads to the problem of waste management. Along with City Corporations, a number of NGOs are working to attain proper disposal of solid waste management in Dhaka City. But there is a lack of coordination between the City Corporations and other NGOs. As a result, expected outcome is far away to achieve. People's participation in this regard is very much needed. City Corporations have no waste treatment and recycling plant. Some informal sectors are working for recycling solid waste. Economically and socially disadvantaged people work in these sectors. In the open dump, waste pickers are seen working for their livelihood around the dumping bulldozers - a practice that damages their health and pollutes the environment. People are suffering from a number of diseases. Water pollution and air pollution in dumping area are the main causes of their illness. The main reason of such pollution is the improper solid waste management in the landfill. These poor people have little access to education, healthcare and other social services. Waste collection rate is very low as well as methods of waste management didn't change over time. We are still using age old practices of waste management. It is seen that wastes are burned to reduce bad odour and to prevent dogs, birds and rats from scavenging of wastes. But this burning process doesn't follow environment-friendly way. Thus the air is being polluted to a large extent. At the same time, such practice emits Methane (CH4) and Carbon-dioxide (CO2) which contribute to global warming. Landfills and collection bins, containers and vehicles emit methane also, one of the Green house gases (GHGs). Uncollected wastes provide breeding areas and food to potentially disease carrying vectors such as insects and rodents. Improper management of solid waste is causing massive degradation of environment and creating threats to human's survival. Dhaka city is becoming uninhabitable day by day. For increasing economic growth, consumption rate is significantly high. Actually ours is an age of high consumption which generates huge amount of wastes than earlier era. High mass consumption is a threat to sustainable development. Waste management problem becomes more severe because most of the households of the Dhaka city do not know how to recycle, reuse and compost wastes. People are not aware of bad impact of waste mismanagement. Almost all of the household wastes are taken to the local landfill for disposal. It increases the total cost of solid waste management. People's participation in all aspects regarding waste management is crucial. To minimise the burden on public sector and to improve the solid waste management, City Corporations should encourage increasing stakeholder's participation in all socio-economic activities. Recent initiative taken by our government with the slogan of 'Poricchonnno Dhaka' (Clean Dhaka) should be appreciated. Public education, campaign need to be expanded to inform citizens about their options and role in waste management. New methods of waste management need to be introduced. We generate waste and definitely we are the ultimate victim of waste mismanagement. It's high time to become aware of environmental pollution and to take proper measures to protect our city./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

25 pc city dwellers victim of air pollution,"Dhaka, April 1 -- About 25 percent people of Dhaka city have been suffering from lung disease owing to the extreme level of air pollution, says a study.Bangladesh University (BU) carried out the study titled ""Impact of Air Pollution on Public Health"" and disclosed the findings at a programme in Krishibid Institution Bangladesh in the capital on Thursday organized by Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC).In this program, Mayor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Annisul Huq as the chief guest emphasized the measures taken by the government and city corporation to improve the environment. He said, government alone cannot clean the city. The citizens of Dhaka should also come forward and work together in civic activities. /'We will sow 3,25,000 plants within next three years'. We have already formed a committee headed by Bishwa Sahitya Kendra Chairman Abdullah Abu Sayeed to do so, he added. 'Within next three years, the citizens of Dhaka will be able to see a more sustainable city, said the mayor.He also said, The DNCC is also going to take a project to introduce rooftop gardening on the buildings of the city.The keynote speaker, Ruhul Amin, Professor of Paleontology, Dhaka Shishu Hospital, identified pollution as the main cause of increasing lung diseases and number of patients suffering from Bronchitis, Pneumonia, COPD, and Asthma. He said, air pollution has made body's pulmonary function of one-fourth of the city dwellers abnormal and they are infected with any sort of lung diseases. For that, 25 percent of the people living in Dhaka have abnormal lung function.National Professor Brigadier (Retd) Abdul Malik, Founder of National Heart Foundation, spoke the negative impact of air pollution on the entire human body, including lungs, heart, and liver. He also described the health damage sustained by pregnant women.Jamil Azher, Chairman, Board of Trustees of BU highlighted the activities of BU Urban Lab in the area of Transportation, Pollution, and Smart City. Urban expert and environmentalist Iqbal Habib described the state of air pollution in Dhaka as well as possible remedial measures./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Threat to public health from air pollution in city,"Dhaka, April 2 -- NEARLY one fourth of the dwellers in the capital suffer from abnormal pulmonary function, for which high levels of air pollution is an overarching reason, leading medical experts told a seminar jointly organized by Bangladesh University (BU) and Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC). A news reports on Friday said that adolescent children, elderly people and pregnant women are much more susceptible to this menace. So, experts call for minimizing air pollution's dire impact on city dwellers' health which makes them susceptible to pulmonary diseases .Air pollution in the capital has taken an alarming turn, posing serious health problems for citizens. Things get worse in dry season as air, thick with particles becomes a growing cause of chest and respiratory diseases. /Although there is no definite study, doctors suggest exposure to thick air pollution may cause premature deaths and also various diseases including pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illnesses.The presence of pollutant particles in air of the city even on a normal day is more than six times the healthy limit. Experts say 0-50 index is considered good or healthy, 51-100 moderate, 101-200 unhealthy, 201-300 very unhealthy and above 300 extremely unhealthy. Shockingly, 300 index is the minimum AQI value found in Dhaka for most part of the year, especially in the winter. Presence of small particles in air rises up to 500 mcg as against the tolerable level of 150 mcg. The pollution of the city has become so high that the World Health Organization has placed it among the 25 cities with the most polluted air in the world. Industrial smog, smoke from vehicles and brick kilns, and dust from construction sites are the main source of pollution. Someone with chronic exposure to air polluting particles stand the risks of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and even cancer in the lung and the urinary tract or bladder, according to the WHO. In spite of such severe health risks, the government has not taken up any major step so far even to check pollution. The implementation of World Bank funded Clean Air and Sustainable Environment Project (CASE) at a cost of US$ 62.2 million which was supposed to finish in December 2014, seems to have no impact so far to reduce the level of air pollution.Initiatives like modernization of brick kilns and phasing out of old vehicles may reduce the level of air pollution level in the city; but such moves are going slow. The danger remains high to public health if the high pollution level continues. The government must act now without delay./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

80 pc of world's city people breathing bad air: UN,"Geneva , May 13 -- Over 80 per cent of the world's city dwellers breathe poor quality air, increasing their risk of lung cancer and other life-threatening diseases, a new World Health Organization (WHO) report warned Thursday.Urban residents in poor countries are by far the worst affected, WHO said, noting that nearly every city (98 per cent) in low-and-middle-income countries has air that fails to meet the UN body's standards.That number falls to 56 per cent of cities in wealthier countries.""Urban air pollution continues to rise at an alarming rate, wreaking havoc on human health,"" Maria Neira, the head of WHO's department of public health and environment, said in a statement.The UN agency's latest air pollution database reveals an overall deterioration of air in the planet's cities, and highlights the growing risk of serious health conditions also including stroke and asthma.The report, which focused on outdoor rather than household air, compared data collected from 795 cities in 67 countries between 2008 and 2013.Tracking the prevalence of harmful pollutants like sulfate and black carbon, WHO found that air quality was generally improving in richer regions like Europe and North America, but worsening in developing regions, notably the Middle East and southeast Asia.Overall, contaminants in outdoor air caused more than 3 million premature deaths a year, the UN body said.The quality of air pollution data provided by individual countries varies considerably, and WHO does not compile a ranking of the world's most polluted cities.But, in a sample of selected mega-cities with a population above 14 million, New Delhi was the most polluted, followed by Cairo and Bangladesh's capital Dhaka.Crucially, key African centres like Nigeria's mega-city Lagos were excluded from the list because of the sparse availability of air quality data in many parts of the continent, WHO said.A sample of European data showed that Rome had slightly worse air than Berlin, followed by London and Madrid./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Air pollution may raise blood pressure,"Dhaka, June 4 -- Exposure to air pollutants associated with burning of coal, vehicular exhaust and dust can significantly increase your risk of developing high blood pressure, warns a new study published in the journal Hypertension.""In our analysis of 17 previously-published studies we discovered a significant risk of developing high blood pressure due to exposure to air pollution,"" said Tao Liu, lead study author and deputy director and epidemiologist of the environmental health division at Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health in China.'Air pollution may lead to the development of high blood pressure through inflammation and oxidative stress, which may further cause changes in the arteries.' ""People should limit their exposure on days with higher air pollution levels, especially for those with high blood pressure, even very short-term exposure can aggravate their conditions.""Researchers performed a meta-analysis of available published studies in the world assessing the health effects of all air pollution on hypertension risk. Meta-analyses combine results from previous studies to estimate the overall effect of a particular variable on a result. In the first study to simultaneously estimate the effects of short-term and long-term exposure to air pollutants on hypertension by meta-analysis, researchers focused on these air pollutants:sulfur dioxide (SO2), which mainly comes from the burning of fossil fuel;nitrogen oxide (NOx), which comes from fossil fuels burned at power plants and vehicle exhaust;nitrogen oxide (NOx), which comes from fossil fuels burned at power plants and vehicle exhaust;Particulate matter (PM) are particles found in the air, including dust, dirt, smoke and liquid droplets. /(PM 2.5 is smaller than a speck of dust, and the most common and hazardous type of air pollution. PM10 includes both PM2.5 and PM2.5-10).The meta-analysis found high blood pressure was significantly associated with:short-term exposure to SO2, PM2.5 and PM10; and long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is produced from combustion, and PM10.For the portion of the study that assessed short-term effects of ozone and carbon monoxide exposure, no significant associations were found. Researchers said ozone and carbon monoxide's links to high blood pressure requires further study.Of the 5,687 air pollution studies initially identified, 17 were the focus of this - which involves more than 108,000 hypertension patients and 220,000 non-hypertensive controls. High blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure more than 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure over 90 mm Hg or by antihypertensive drug use. Air pollution exposure was assessed by averaging data from nearest air pollution monitoring stations, or using complex dispersion models or land use regression models.High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke.Previous studies have indicated that air pollution might be a risk factor for hypertension but the results were controversial, Liu said. The mechanism by which air pollution could contribute to the development of high blood pressure includes inflammation and oxidative stress, which may lead to changes in the arteries.""Next we plan to further delve into the effects of particulate matter and their sources on hypertension risk, which we hope will inform air-pollution control policy-makers,"" Liu said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dangerous air pollution in most cities,"Dhaka, June 8 -- China and India are not the only countries with an air pollution problem, 98 percent of cities in developing countries don't meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards according to research published by the UN body last week.Yet, although almost all cities that measure air pollution don't meet the standards, many other cities don't even collect air quality data.""We know that there are many cities around the world where air pollution is very bad which are not monitoring air quality,"" Maria Neira, the director of the WHO Department of Public Health and Environment told IPS.The WHO Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database currently includes information from 3000 cities, more than double the amount previously reported. According to the latest results released from the database last week, 98% of cities in low- and middle income countries with more than 100,000 inhabitants do not meet WHO air quality guidelines.Yet, for a problem which the WHO says causes seven million premature deaths per year, there remain big gaps in data, particularly for cities in Africa.""Lack of data (is) a real hindrance for understanding air quality (in Africa),"" Eloise Marais, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University who studies air pollution in Africa told IPS.""(Air pollution) is one of the areas of environmental health where the number of people getting sick and dying is actually increasing rather than decreasing globally,""-Deborah Seligsohn""The WHO results certainly highlight the dire need for sustained air quality monitoring,"" said Marais. /Particular attention should be given to African cities experiencing rapid urbanisation such as Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Luanda in Angola, Lagos and Ibadan in Nigeria, Nairobi in Kenya and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, she added.By contrast to African cities, much more is known about the severity of air pollution in China and India.Deborah Seligsohn, a researcher specializing in air pollution in China and India at the University of California at San Diego told IPS says that the world's two most populous countries measure air pollution in a large number of their cities.""The magnitude is going to be bigger than anywhere else on earth because they both have over a billion people,"" she said.Both China, with 1.3 billion people, and India, with 1.2 billion, have a higher population than the 1.1 billion people living in all of the countries in Africa combined.Their high energy demands and densely populated cities also contribute to higher pollution rates, says Seligsohn.Seligsohn says that this has an upside for other developing countries, because particularly China's experiences addressing climate change can provide useful lessons for other coutnries.""There are a lot of things China has been doing to reduce air pollution that are going to be useful for other developing countries,"" she said.For example, says Seligsohn, China has found ways to considerably reduce the cost of monitoring emissions from power plants.In the United States, power stations build elevators so that workers can reach monitors which measure the emissions coming from the smoke stacks. The elevators cost a quarter of a million dollars to build, so in China they decided to build staircases instead. The staircases have proved almost as effective and cost considerably less, said Seligsohn.China has also increased its monitoring of smaller particles of air pollutions, says Seligsohn.Measuring smaller particles is important because it is the best indicator of the health impacts of air pollution, she said.""The tiny stuff goes straight through your lungs and into your blood stream and the very big stuff that is annoying and dirty you are going to sneeze and cough out.""In some cities the particles are bigger due to sand or dust in the air, just one of many differences in the types of air pollution found in different countries, which also makes it hard to rank the cities from worst to best.The causes of air pollution in cities in Africa can ""include fuelwood, backup generators, kerosene, charcoal - use and production - and very inefficient cars and motorcycles,"" says Marais.By comparison in China the problems are largely related to coal and the sulphur in vehicle fuel, says Seligsohn while in India, another problem is the burning of trash and the poor quality fuels that people use for home cooking.Neira said that the indoor air pollution is responsible for 4 million of the 7 million premature deaths caused by air pollution every year.In developing countries, this indoor pollution caused by fossil fuels used inside the house for cooking, heating and lighting, also contributes to outdoor air pollution, she added.As more of and more people move to cities, air pollution will increasingly become one of the world's biggest development challenges.""It's one of the areas of environmental health where the number of people getting sick and dying is actually increasing rather than decreasing globally,"" said Seligsohn.""The number of people getting sick from dirty water has actually gone down as we've become better at getting people a clean water supply. But that isn't true with air pollution, as we become an increasingly urbanised world, as there's more industry, (more power plants, more cars),"" she said.

Leafy neighbourhood adds years to a woman's life,"Dhaka, June 9 -- Ladies, if you want to live longer, you may want to think of living in the leafy suburbs as a new study suggests so. The study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) found that women live longer in areas with more green vegetation.It showed that women with the highest levels of vegetation or greenness near their homes had a 12% lower death rate compared to women with the lowest levels of vegetation near their homes. The researchers found the biggest differences in death rates from kidney disease, respiratory disease, and cancer. The researchers also explored how an environment with trees, shrubs, and plants might lower mortality rates. They showed that improved mental health and social engagement are the strongest factors, while increased physical activity and reduced air pollution also contribute.NIEHS director Linda Birnbaum noted that it is important to know that trees and plants provide health benefits in our communities as well as beauty. The finding of reduced mortality suggests that vegetation may be important to health in a broad range of ways. The scientists also looked at characteristics that can otherwise contribute to mortality risk, such as age, race, ethnicity, smoking, and socio-economic status. This enabled them to be more confident that vegetation plays a role in reduced mortality, rather than these factors. The study appears in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.- TNN/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Coming out of the negative image,"Dhaka, June 9 -- Bangladesh is a victim of a rather negative reputation. The country is seen as being extremely poor, under-developed, subject to devastating natural disasters and socio-political instability.However, the country has the advantage of being located in a strategic geographical position between South and South-East Asia. In addition, its domestic consumption potential and the wealth of its natural (young population ages 15-35, which is 53 million of the total population) resources make the country a good candidate for investment manufacturing hub. Despite these advantages, the country ranks 173rd out of 189th according to the World Bank's 2015 Doing Business ranking. /Environmental degradation in Bangladesh is pervasive. Air pollution in the urban areas are a constant reminder of the prevailing health catastrophe. Young children are mostly exposed to cadmium through inhalation of smoke and contaminated soils and dust from industrial emissions and sewage sludge. In fact, environmental scientists believe that the high lead in the environment from gasoline, paints, ceramics, batteries, etc. are factors in the increased risk of polluted air. The UN revealed that blood lead levels were very high and at toxic levels in children presenting with psycho motor delay and behavioral problems, indicating lead poisoning. An estimated 15,000 premature deaths, as well as several million cases of pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illness are attributed to poor air quality in Dhaka, according to the Air Quality Management Project (AQMP), funded by the government and the World Bank.The rivers of Bangladesh are the worst hit of pollution, especially the rivers which stands in the neighborhood of the Dhaka city is being polluted tremendously. It is clear that rapid and unplanned urbanization and industrialization, brick field development, dyeing factories, tanneries are grabbing up the river. The slum dwellers use unhygienic latrines, wash clothes, take bath, even cows and goats bathe in the river. Untreated wastes are thrown into the river as most of the manufacturing industries have no Effluent Treatment Plan(ETP). It is imperative to compel these industries and government to enact and execute laws that encourage the protection of the environment at all times. BDTDC is at the forefront of ensuring the preservation, prevention and mitigation of the environment and strongly believes that the world will be a better place for all inhabitants if we all become vigilant.The BDTDC serves as a platform to creating a One-Stop-Shop for investors (Bangladesh manufacturers and suppliers) to participate fully in the production, manufacturing and transaction process and ensure compliance with strict environmental standards in the factors of production; thereby protecting the earth as well as eliminating the greed and cumbersome activities of those who exploit the common citizens of Bangladesh.BDTDC is geared towards achieving higher living standards, full employment and sustainable development in Bangladesh through the Investment of about $300 million into the economy as well as immediate employment of 200 workers who will be mostly stationed in Dhaka. Open economies tend to grow faster and more steadily than closed economies and economic growth is an important factor in job creation. Profitable companies tend to hire more workers than those posting a loss. Trade can also be a catalyst for greater efficiency and productivity. We have access to a wider range of high-quality, affordable inputs, technology and know-how that could not be obtained in a closed economy. Access to technology and quality inputs can boost innovation and creativity in the Bangladeshi workplace. Moreover, competition in the marketplace can be a powerful stimulus to companies seeking new ways of making things better and more cheaply. The people (factory owners and manufacturers) are hereby offered a leeway to attaining real wealth creators and owners by direct involvement with the exportation and sale of their goods as well as guaranteed access to Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) by sticking to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) agenda which applies to all countries, promotes peaceful and inclusive societies, creates better jobs and tackles the environmental challenges of our time-particularly climate change.The BDTDC is committed to propelling, promoting and pursuing an environmentally friendly situation through education and empowerment of all to entrench the dictates of the UN goals for sustainable development and in the production of goods for international consumption. That indeed is the point of departure from old endangering habits to new and enduring sustainability for Bangladesh. It is hoped that with these intervention policies, Bangladesh will become more competitive, and perhaps gain comparative advantages in the production of garments, shoes, frozen shrimps, software, leather, tea and jute products.The future of the Bangladeshi people will ultimately be dependent on the Made-in-Bangladesh factory owners and suppliers who will be in tandem with the production and exportation of their goods in total compliance and adherence to the new Green Environmental Sustainability (GES) initiative; thereby ensuring the survival of sea life, smog-free atmosphere and indeed a glorious and expanding future for this and the unborn generation.The onerous task of making Bangladesh a better place than we met it is the greatest gift to posterity. Prosperity will only beckon to all those who realize and believe in their individual and collective abilities as one indivisible nation to thrive , survive and provide for their families, now and in the future./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Pollution affects city dwellers,"Dhaka, June 12 -- Dhaka city is now regarded as the most hazardous city. Apart from air pollution, the city dwellers have also been facing multifaceted problems like noise and water pollutions which have a negative impact on the human health. Due to a large number of people living in Dhaka city, high rise buildings, unplanned roads and a large number of vehicles, sound pollution has increased day by day. People have also become restless on the road because of long tailbacks, according to environmentalists. /They said some vehicles spread leads and other harmful matters in the air. The dust also causes heavy air pollutions in the city. And the dust makes the air thicker. Especially on streets, pedestrians, particularly old and children, suffer most to take breath for the thick air with dust and sands. While visiting different city areas this reporter found full of bad smells of un-moved garbage that also caused air pollution. The huge smokers of the city also produce smokes, which are also caused air pollutions. Though the smoking in public place is banned by law, the smokers violate the rule and frequently smoke on streets, bus stands and other places of public gatherings. It also harms children's health seriously. On the other hand, sound pollution also makes the citizens life hampered. Un-controlled use of hydraulic horn in different vehicles makes serious noise pollution. Though the hydraulic horn is banned, various transports use the hydraulic horns.""Various types of vehicle like buses, trucks, CNG-driven taxies, motorbikes and other vehicles are now seen emitting serious black smokes. They are responsible for polluting air seriously in the capital,"" said Zinan Binte Zaman, a teacher of Dhaka College.""The sound of hydraulic horn is really unbearable. It causes fatal harms for human health. Especially, it harms children physical and mental health. But the drivers recklessly using the hydraulic horns,"" said Sadia Sharmeen, a rickshaw passenger and mother of a minor boy in Motijheel area. The drivers of different vehicles use horn unconsciously in high volume. ""Non-stop use of horn from morning to night is a known matter nowadays in Dhaka which has a negative impact on human health. It seemed that no one to check it or no one to stop it. It is unbearable for our children, elderly and sick people, said Abdul Gafur, a retired government official and now a shop owner in Jatrabari area. He also said, the drivers can easily change their habit. The government, non-government organisations and conscious people should take initiative to stop it. Various types of roadside factories and workshops cause pollutions in residential areas and nearby schools. The health experts and environment activists said the noise pollution causes high blood pressure, heart, kidney, brain, ear problems and other harms on human body and mind.Besides, the textile, garments, dying and other factories are emitters of various chemicals, which cause severe water pollutions of the rivers and other water bodies. The city dwellers are using these polluted waters in deferent ways. Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (BAPA) General Secretary Dr. M. A. Matin told The New Nation, ""Old vehicles are emitting black smokes. After a long time movement of BAPA and other environment activists the black smokes vehicles were withdrawn from roads by the law enforcers. He added for a long time we have not seen the black smokes in the roads, but nowadays they come back on the roads. We have seen every day various vehicles are emitting dark and black smokes in the city air, he said. ""The government should have to take the pollution issues seriously to protect our environment. Mills and factories must need to set up Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) to protect waters from pollutions,"" Additional Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (Traffic), Mosleh Uddin Ahmed, told The New Nation. He said police are regularly driving operations against hydraulic horns of vehicles. We are also taking actions against black smokes and lead emitting from vehicles./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Though the smoking in public place is banned by law, the smokers violate the rule and frequently smoke on streets, bus stands and other places of public gatherings. It also harms children's health seriously. On the other hand, sound pollution also makes the citizens life hampered. Un-controlled use of hydraulic horn in different vehicles makes serious noise pollution. Though the hydraulic horn is banned, various transports use the hydraulic horns.""Various types of vehicle like buses, trucks, CNG-driven taxies, motorbikes and other vehicles are now seen emitting serious black smokes. They are responsible for polluting air seriously in the Sylhet,"" said Zeni, a teacher of a primary school. ""The sound of hydraulic horn is really unbearable. It causes fatal harms for human health. Especially, it harms children physical and mental health. But the drivers recklessly using the hydraulic horns,"" said Parvin Sultana, a rickshaw passenger and mother of a minor boy in Mirabazar area.The drivers of different vehicles use horn unconsciously in high volume. Various types of roadside factories and workshops cause pollutions in residential areas and nearby schools. The health experts and environment activists said the noise pollution causes high blood pressure, heart, kidney, brain, ear problems and other harms on human body and mind.Besides, the textile, garments, dying and other factories are emitters of various chemicals, which cause severe water pollutions of the rivers and other water bodies. The city dwellers are using these polluted waters in deferent ways. Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (BAPA) Sylhet Abdul Karim kim told that, We have seen every day various vehicles are emitting dark and black smokes in the city air, he said. "" Additional Commissioner of Sylhet Metropolitan Police Rahmatullah, told that ""The government should have to take the pollution issues seriously to protect our environment. Mills and factories must need to set up Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) to protect waters from pollutions, He said police are regularly driving operations against hydraulic horns of vehicles. We are also taking actions against black smokes and lead emitting from vehicles./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Sunlight: An important source of Vitamin D,"Dhaka, June 17 -- Vitamin D is an essential vitamin necessary for the development of bones. Sunlight helps the body to produce vitamin D. Deficiency of vitamin D results in rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.We often hear our elders telling us to go out in the sun to get more vitamin D. Sometimes, we may wonder if this is a fact or a myth. The article below will describe the relationship between sunlight and vitamin D, and why vitamin D deficiency could occur.Yes, sunlight does increase vitamin D levels in the body. But it isn't as if sunlight directly transmits vitamin D to your body. /Sunlight acts as a catalyst and helps the skin to synthesize vitamin D, which can be utilized by the body.Vitamin D Chemical StructureThe ultraviolet B rays of the sun penetrate uncovered skin and bring about conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3, which ultimately becomes vitamin D3. This effect varies in the following situations-A complete cloud cover reduces the ultraviolet energy by 50% and thereby reduces vitamin D synthesis.Shade including that due to air pollution and smog could reduce the radiation by 60%.Sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 8 or more could block the ultraviolet radiation. Sunscreen with SPF of 30 reduces vitamin D synthesis in the skin by more than 95%.Closed windows block the ultraviolet radiation; therefore a person cannot get vitamin D by sitting by a window or traveling in a closed car.People with dark skin have a reduced ability to produce vitamin D on exposure to sunlight. These individuals may require at least three to five times longer exposure to make the same amount of vitamin D as a person with a white skin tone.The exact amount of exposure to sun necessary to fulfill the daily requirement of vitamin D has not been established. Vitamin D is also synthesized by the skin when people use commercial tanning beds that emit 2%-6% UVB radiation. However, it is important to remember that excessive exposure to sunlight and tanning beds is associated with skin cancer, and should therefore be avoided.Besides being synthesized by the skin, vitamin D is also obtained from the diet and supplements. Foods rich in vitamin D include fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel as well as fish liver oils. Foods like milk, cereals, orange juice and cooking oil are often fortified with vitamin D. These forms of vitamin D are usually inert, and have to pass through the liver as well as the kidneys to reach their active form, also called calcitriol. Supplements can be taken when a person does not have adequate exposure to sunlight or lacks the necessary dietary intake to meet the daily requirement of vitamin D.Role of Vitamin DVitamin D is an essential vitamin for normal bone growth. It helps in the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines, thereby maintaining their normal levels in the blood. It also helps to prevent osteoporosis in older individuals.Vitamin D is also involved in other functions in the body, like cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and controlling inflammation. It may help to prevent some cancers like breast, prostate and colon cancer.Vitamin D deficiencyDeficiency of vitamin D occurs due to- limited exposure to sunlight: This includes people who are home-bound, women who wear long robes and cover their heads for religious and other purposes, or who use sunscreen extensively.Inadequate intake of vitamin D through diet: Vegetarian people may suffer from vitamin D deficiency if they do not eat adequate foods fortified with vitamin D.Inadequate absorption of vitamin D from the intestines: Vitamin D requires the presence of fat from the diet to be absorbed in the intestines. Thus, in people with problems with fat absorption like those with liver disease, cystic fibrosis and Crohn's disease may suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery for obesity may also suffer from vitamin D deficiency. In addition, medications taken along with vitamin D may interfere with its absorption.Increased requirement of vitamin D: Periods of growth like infancy and adolescence require additional vitamin D, which if not available, can result in deficiency.Kidney disease: In kidney disease, the kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form, or excessive vitamin D is lost in the urine.Deficiency of vitamin D results in a condition called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Rickets results in soft bones and bony deformities. Adults with osteomalacia are prone to fractures.Excessive vitamin D is detrimental to health. It can raise blood levels of calcium, and damage the heart and result in kidney stones. High vitamin D levels are usually due to intake of supplements of vitamin D. Too much exposure to sunlight does not result in excessively high vitamin D levels./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Tackle air quality for public health,"Dhaka, July 13 -- When we talk about the impacts of climate change, we often do so in terms of the health of the global environment: melting ice caps, rising sea levels, threatened species, bleached coral reefs. But the impacts on human health will also be profound - while the benefits to our health of reducing the pollution that causes climate change also promise to be considerable.The threat is real, and the figures are stark. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that global warming will result in some 250,000 additional deaths each year between 2030 and 2050 from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.The costs to health systems in responding to climate change will also be substantial - estimated at between $2 billion and $4 billion a year by 2030, excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture, water, and sanitation. It will be those parts of the world with weak health infrastructure, mostly in developing countries, that will be least able to bear these additional costs.The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, which reported last year, warned that ""climate change has the potential to undermine the last 50 years of progress in public health and development"".But it is not only the effects of climate change that impact on human health. /So too do its causes. As Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) noted at the launch of the IEA's recent report on energy and air pollution, the majority of such pollution comes from the energy sector, mainly from fossil fuel combustion. Currently only 8% of global energy production is combustion-free and more than half of the rest has no effective technology in place to control emissions.This air pollution is an order of magnitude more deleterious to human health than the ultimate effects of climate change. The WHO estimates that indoor and outdoor air pollution causes around 7 million deaths each year.Developing countries, again, are particularly vulnerable. Many of them rely heavily on coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, for their electricity supply. Few of these power plants are fitted with the advanced pollution controls that can dramatically reduce their emissions. As the cities of the developing world grow rapidly, choking vehicle emissions exacerbate these health problems. And more than 2.7 billion people still rely on polluting stoves and fuels for cooking, leading to dreadful indoor air quality.But the rich world also suffers. According to another recent report, this time from the Health and Environment Alliance, Climate Action Network, WWF and Sandbag, emissions from Europe's coal-fired power stations led in 2013 alone to 22,900 premature deaths, tens of thousands of cases of ill health ranging from heart disease to bronchitis, and up to E62.3 billion in health costs.The good news is that, in many parts of the world, coal use is in decline. The bad news is that that decline is not happening fast enough - and in developing Asia, it is not happening at all. As a result, the global number of premature deaths attributable to outdoor air pollution is poised to continue to grow, from 3 million today to an estimated 4.5 millions in 2040.But solutions exist. In its report, the IEA has set out what governments need to do to address air quality issues, at the same time as tackling climate change. Tailored to local conditions, its pragmatic strategy would rely on existing technologies and use proven policy tools, including setting long-term air quality goals, more rapid uptake of energy efficiency and renewables, more widespread use of advanced pollution controls, strictly enforced standards for road vehicles and access to clean cooking facilities for an additional 1.8 billion people by 2040.If these policies and measures are implemented, the IEA's 'Clean Air Scenario' estimates that premature deaths from indoor pollution could be cut by 1.7 million in 2040 compared with its central scenario, and those from household pollution would fall by 1.6 million. Implementing these measures would only cost an additional 7% of total energy investment, the IEA underlines.As delegates gather for the Second Global Conference on Health and Climate organised by the WHO in Paris, the Conference will showcase how the public health community will support the implementation of the Paris agreement, in order to build healthier and more sustainable societies. The message they send governments should be loud and clear: climate change poses profound risks to human health, but reducing the emissions that cause it can have substantial benefits on public health and on the quality of life of people around the world./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Economic consequences of outdoor air pollution,"Dhaka, Aug. 21 -- Air pollution takes years off people's lives. It causes substantial pain and suffering, among adults and children alike. And it damages food production, at a time when we need to feed more people than ever. /This is not just an economic issue; it is a moral one.Air pollution can be produced both outdoors and indoors. For the poorest families, indoor smog from coal- or dung-fired cooking stoves is typically the more serious problem. As economies develop and start to electrify, motorize, and urbanize, outdoor air pollution becomes the bigger issue.Cleaner technologies are available, with the potential to improve air quality considerably. But policymakers tend to focus myopically on the costs of action, rather than the costs of inaction. With economic growth and rising energy demand set to fuel a steady rise in emissions of air pollutants and rapidly rising concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and ozone in the coming decades, this approach is untenable.A new OECD report, The Economic Consequences of Outdoor Air Pollution, estimates that outdoor air pollution will cause 6-9 million premature deaths annually by 2060, compared to three million in 2010. That is equivalent to a person dying every 4-5 seconds. Cumulatively, more than 200 million people will die prematurely in the next 45 years as a result of air pollution.There will also be more pollution-related illness. New cases of bronchitis in children aged 6-12 are forecast to soar to 36 million per year by 2060, from 12 million today. For adults, we predict ten million new cases per year by 2060, up from 3.5 million today. Children are also being increasingly affected by asthma. All of this will translate into more pollution-related hospital admissions, projected to rise to 11 million in 2060, from 3.6 million in 2010.These health problems will be concentrated in densely populated areas with high PM concentrations, especially cities in China and India. In per capita terms, mortality is also set to reach high levels in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region, and other parts of Asia, such as South Korea, where aging populations are highly vulnerable to air pollution.The impact of air pollution is often discussed in dollar terms. By 2060, 3.75 billion working days per year could be lost due to the adverse health effects of dirty air - what economists call the ""disutility of illness."" The direct market impact of this pollution in terms of lower worker productivity, higher health spending, and lower crop yields, could exceed 1% of GDP, or $2.6 trillion, annually by 2060.Massive as they are, however, the dollar figures do not reflect the true costs of air pollution. Premature deaths from breathing in small particles and toxic gases, and the pain and suffering from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, do not have a market price. Nor does the experience of constantly inhaling foul-smelling air, or forcing your child to wear a face mask just to play outside. These burdens weigh far more heavily on people than any price tag can represent.Nonetheless, the truth remains that policymakers tend to respond more to hard figures than to abstract experiences. So the OECD examined myriad economic studies on air pollution to quantify what people's health is worth to them.On average, individuals would be prepared to pay around $30 to reduce their annual risk of dying prematurely by one in 100,000. Using well-established techniques, these ""willingness-to-pay"" figures were converted into an overall value of premature deaths caused by outdoor air pollution, as illustrated, for example, in the OECD's Mortality Risk Valuation in Environment, Health and Transport Policies.By that measure, the global cost of premature deaths caused by outdoor air pollution would reach a staggering $18-25 trillion a year by 2060. Arguably, this is not ""real"" money, as the costs are not related to any market transactions. But it does reflect the value people put on their very real lives - and the value they would put on policies that would help to delay their very real deaths.It is time for governments to stop fussing about the costs of efforts to limit air pollution and start worrying about the much larger costs of allowing it to continue unchecked. Their citizens' lives are in their hands.(Simon Upton is Environment Director at the OECD)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

'Air pollution 4th leading factor for premature death',"Dhaka, Sept. 20 -- Air pollution has emerged as the fourth leading risk factor for premature deaths worldwide. The deaths cost the global economy about $225 billion in lost labour income in 2013, a new study finds, pointing toward the economic burden of air pollution./Strengthening the Economic Case for Action"", a joint study of the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimates that around 5.5 million lives were lost in 2013 to diseases associated with outdoor and household air pollution, causing human suffering and reducing economic development./The study, released early this month, discovers that while pollution-related deaths strike mainly young children and the elderly, premature deaths also result in lost labour income for working-age men and women./It also finds that annual labour income losses cost the equivalent of almost 1 percent - 0.83 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in South Asia. In East Asia and the Pacific, where the population is ageing, labour income losses represent 0.25 percent of GDP, while in Sub-Saharan Africa, where air pollution impairs the earning potential of younger populations, annual labour income losses represent the equivalent of 0.61 percent of GDP./When looking at fatalities across all age groups through the lens of ""welfare losses"", an approach commonly used to evaluate the costs and benefits of environmental regulations in a given country context, the aggregate cost of premature deaths was more than US$5 trillion worldwide in 2013./It said that deaths related to ambient air pollution have risen in heavily populated, fast-urbanizing regions, while deaths related to cooking and heating homes with solid fuels have remained constant despite development gains and improvements in health services./According to the study, about 90 percent of the population in low and middle income countries is exposed to dangerous levels of ambient air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Air pollution poses severe health hazard,"Dhaka, Nov. 26 -- Air pollution has already been increased in the capital city at the advent of winter season posing a potential threat to public health, especially for the children./Experts say, the situation will get worse in the coming months of December and January when the cold weather will dominate the country with its full force./Usually, the quantity of different particles, including dust, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen oxide, increase in the air of Dhaka during the winter./In this context, the situation goes beyond control each and every year as the two city corporations of Dhaka did not take any pragmatic steps to tackle it./According to experts, the children mainly become affected due to air-dust when the weather is changing./Particularly, unplanned urbanization, frequent digging of roads, piling of drain-wastes beside the roads, taking no initiatives to keep construction materials in safe-side, delaying of flyover construction, etcetera are polluting the air of Dhaka rapidly; for which the health risk has also increased three to four times than the normal period. ""The dust-related diseases have been increasing in the city in an abnormal way. The dust enters in the human body through breathing. As a result, the people suffer from lungs cancer, respiratory problem, asthma, tuberculosis and others,"" Dr Md Motiur Rahman, Medicine Department, Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, said./He said: ""The people -- children and elderly men -- who have less resistance power mainly face problem at the advent of winter. If the air pollution cannot be checked, the capital city will become unfit for residing in the near future."" A total of 11 Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations [CAMS] is now in operation across the country under ""sustainable environment and clean air project"" to measure the air quality, officials of Department of Environment [DoE] said. Of them, three have been installed in Dhaka, two in Chittagong, one each in Rajshahi, Sylhet, Khulna, Barisal, Gazipur and Narayanganj. With these instruments, the air- pollution particles are being measured round-the-clock in those cities, they added./According to the measurement of DoE, the level of air quality index [AQI] from zero to 50 PPM is green or healthy, if the AQI level is 51 to 100 PPM than it is medium air. And if the AQI crosses the level of 100 to 150 PPM, the air is considered as mild harmful. The air becomes 'unhygienic', if the AQI level crosses 150 to 200 PPM and it will be 'very unhygienic' after it crosses 201 to 300 PPM. Besides, the air is treated as 'severe unhygienic' if it crosses the level of 301 to 500PPM./As per the AQI report received on Thursday, the air level was 309PPM in Dhaka, 236PPM in Barisal, 205PPM in Gazipur, 195PPM in Chittagong, 159PPM in Rajshahi and109PPM in Sylhet./""The infrastructural works are usually done in the winter season in Dhaka. But the contractors do not finish the works properly maintaining the rules and regulations. To ensure safe health, the contractors must keep sand, soil and other materials in the safe side,"" said chairman of Paribesh Bachao Andolon Abu Naser Khan./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

People's suffering around Barapukuria Coalmine,"Dhaka, Nov. 29 -- MEDIA report on Sunday said people living around Barapukuria Coalmine in Dinajpur often feel panic from big sounds of mine blast and also from cracks in their home walls due to impact of mining. Moreover, lakes and ponds in the surrounding areas are drying up while water level is sinking and air pollution is causing hazards to public health causing respiratory diseases and other incurable ailments./It appears the coalmine in the area, operating over the past two decades, is bringing growing challenge to local environment as its activities are expanding. We must say the concerned authorities must take the threat seriously and take up corrective measures to save the people and also the coalfield to continue functioning. Coalmining is highly hazardous and now opposed in almost all countries on environmental grounds. We want it no doubt for power generation but not at the cost of our people's life./As per news report in a national daily on Sunday the situation is causing alarm to local people but the concerned government authorities appear quite indifferent to people's growing anxieties. Expert opinion suggests such deterioration of environment around coalmines is a natural corollary and it can be partly overcome by appropriate engineering while resettlement of the people from the mine's closer proximity is also essential before it becomes a big environmental issue. The government has a fund of over Tk 1.9 billion for resettlement but it remains unutilized while people's suffering remains unattended./It is natural that people can't live in peace and safety when cracks develop in their homes and buildings and underground water level dips to create shortage of water to continue farming. Many have to abandon farming in their land in the area as the situation is not helpful. Harm to crops in the fields from ashes is also a serious threat to the villagers. Fisheries in ponds and other water bodies are also facing severe degradation as side affect of the mining. We must say the government should put in place more safety measures using latest technology to protect the environment and crops in the surrounding areas. Meanwhile bigger issues like resettlement of the people to a reasonable distance should also be taken up without delay. It is already evident from the degradation of quality of water and air in the areas as it stands far beyond WHO's set standard to suggest we can't wait much. The impacts are spreading. We must say the government can't avoid responsibility when the safety of people is under growing challenge./We know that the compensation package for resettlement of affected people from the area was approved in 2010 but left unutilized. It is no secret that corruption and misuse of government funds are the biggest impediment to helping people such as the affected ones around the coalmines when an incompetent self-seeking bureaucracy and poor political leadership are looking at their own fortune. But people around the coalmine must be protected at any cost./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Risk to public health at noisy traffic areas,"Dhaka, Jan. 7 -- NEWS reports on Friday said that people living in closer proximity of heavy traffic zones or on highways are exposed to higher risk of dementia; which lead to memory loss and other neurological troubles. A media reports on Friday said quoting new Canadian study findings that heavy noise is likely to cause many form of brain disorder. The people living far away from noisy traffic zones with more fresh air face less risk of infections affecting brains and memories./We know that traffic noise and air pollutants create many killers' diseases. This is why environmentalist groups in developed countries seriously oppose construction of new roads and airports in and around the city on health ground. Governments puts sound resistant walls on the side of busy roads and highways at many places to protect people from noise and air pollutants. But most people living on roadside in Bangladesh are exposed to such noise and pollution without remedial steps to save them. Even we don't have the necessary public awareness, which should have come from concerned government authorities; The NGOs can also play a role about it./Alzheimer's disease, which causes damage to brain cells and human memory, their thinking behaviour, navigational and spatial abilities to perform everyday activities are some other serious problems that can possibly more affect a man or woman living in noisy areas. It also increases the risk of heart disease, cardio-vascular and diabetic problems. Since growing noise from construction of roads, buildings and other infrastructure is staggering over greater areas in Bangladesh, risk to life and public health is also exponentially growing with it./The new findings linking growing noise with such diseases have come as eye opener to many researchers who believe much of the findings are still speculative, but they don't disclaim it either. Infections to brain from air pollutants are a highly alarming finding for public health. The people of Bangladesh are equally becoming vulnerable to such infections as density of people living in busy city areas and around roads and highways are growing./Lancet medical journal report said that people who live within 50 meters (55 yards) of high-traffic roads had a 7.0 percent higher chance of developing dementia compared to those who lived more than 300 meters away from busy roadways. WHO estimates the number of people with dementia all over the world in 2015 at 47.5 million, and their number is growing./We must say, with rapid urbanization and growing density of people the risk to public health is only growing from factors like traffic noise and air pollution that never captured our thinking in the past. But we can't avoid it any more./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The New Nation.

Proper use of inhaler to control asthma stressed,"Dhaka, Jan. 29 -- Asthma patients must learn the proper way of using inhaler as the device has been proved to be the most effective means to control the disease, a leading chest disease expert opined./""Inhaler is an effective way of treatment for asthma patients. Unfortunately, majority of asthma patients don't know the right use of it,"" said Dr Shamim Ahmed, an associate professor of Pulmonology Department, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) on Saturday./He said asthma is a chronic disease that causes recurring wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The asthma medicine inside an inhaler goes straight into the airways of a sufferer's breathing system giving him or her relief./""The obvious reason of coughing is coolness at night or early in the morning.but the exact cause for asthma is yet to be known,"" he noted, adding in most cases the disease is mostly linked to hereditary and environmental factors including air pollution./Dr Shamim said the disease has genetic factors too and it travels from parents to children and thereafter. But there are some other causes, including respiratory infections, childhood viral infections in particular, that may affect the lining of the airways making them more exposed to triggers causing asthma./""Air pollution is the prime cause of asthma in cities. But close proximity to animals as well as use of pesticides in agriculture and other biodegradable chemicals are also held responsible for asthma among the people,"" he added./Dr Shamim explained that existence of atopic diseases like allergic rhinitis, eczema and allergic conjunctivitis were found to be significant risk factors responsible for development of asthma in both rural and urban areas./""But, the prevalence of asthma is more in urban areas than the rural sites,"" he added./Dr Shamim said generally it is not a curable disease, but carefulness in everyday life can effectively control it in larger cases./""However, the best treatment still remains the inhaled steroids, while long-term oral steroids could create serious side-effects like malfunctioning of adrenal glands,"" he added./He said it is not possible to avoid the contact of asthma triggers, but wearing safety masks regularly can diminish the chances of developing this disease. Since asthma is a chronic disease, he added, it should be managed at home, except the severe cases. If home management is done intelligently and skillfully, most asthmatic patients can lead a normal life./Dr Shamim also said avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing asthma infection./He mentioned that around 70-80 lakh people are suffering from asthma in the country and the number of patients are gradually increasing due to lack of knowledge about the disease and its management./In this context, he underscored the need for creating mass awareness to check the growing number of asthma patients./Dr Shamim said the government and BSMMU together have been working relentlessly to control the disease through awareness programmes for asthma patients. Like other countries, he said, Bangladesh also observes the World Asthma Day on the first Tuesday of May every year to keep people aware about Asthma./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The New Nation.

"Air, noise pollutions endanger Sylhet city life","Dhaka, Feb. 5 -- Air and sound pollution have aggravated in the Sylhet city life causing different diseases to the city dwellers, environmentalists and locals said./Air pollution caused by black smoke emission from unfit vehicles and dusts from open space has increased bronchitis, asthma and other respiratory diseases among the city dwellers, physicians said./Besides, people of different strata in Sylhet are also experiencing sound pollution caused by the hydraulic horns, power generators and welding workshops located in and around residential areas./They said noise affects children physically and psychologically while normal life is being hampered by round-the-clock operations of the power generators in different area residences in the city and welding engineering workshops./Physicians feared that if such environmental degradation continues, respiratory deceases would increase manifold among city residents./Department of Environment, Sylhet office sources said the pollution is very high in a few jam-packed places of the city including Railgate, Kodomtoly Bus Terminal, Bondor bazar, Ambor kahan, Mirabazar, Subhanighat and Court area./Residents of Railgate areas alleged that the situation worsens at night as welding operators start their generators which create noise higher than the tolerable levels./""If my mother calls me loudly from the next room, I do not hear her because of the sound created by generator of a nearby welding factory,"" alleged Sumi Akter, a student of Women's College living in Lawai area of the Sylhet city./""I usually study at night but I find it very difficult to continue for the noise,"" Poet living at Subid Bazar area, said. ""It is very hard to sleep, my kids often get up being frightened and start crying to hear the sound of heavy vehicles,"" he added./Continuous sound pollution may totally deafen the children as well as the adults, ENT specialists feared. ""A noisy environment can affect children physically and psychologically,"" said ENT specialist Nurul Huda Nayem./According to government guidelines, wielding engineering and lathe machines, iron factories and generators must be set up at least one kilometer away from residences and power generators must be set up underground./Experts said sound pollutions have reached nearly 200 decibel against its tolerable level of 60 decibel. They said air pollution from thousands of unfit vehicles reached 100 per cent against its maximum tolerable level of hard ridge smoke unit of 65 per cent./Besides, pollution from dusts has also reached 500 plus microgram though its tolerable level is considered 200 microgram, suspended particulates matter. Environmentalists blamed smoked air caused by unfit vehicles, coupled with dusts from open space, for such environmental degradation in the city./It is alleged that factory and welding shop owners and developers of the residential flats pay no heed to the complaints regarding the situation. Over 10,212 light and heavy vehicles have been plying the roads of Sylhe city and its adjacent areas without fitness certificates and emitting black smokes, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, Sylhet office source said./BRTA sources said that they send data of unfit vehicles every six months to the traffic department in the city and district for checking the vehicles and controlling the black smoke./Officials of BRTA said, they issued notice regularly to the defaulting vehicle owners for renovating their respective vehicles, renewing the certificates and paying road taxes./The government officials emphasized on combined efforts by the traffic department and BRTA to check the vehicles./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The New Nation.

Scientific data to better assess public health risks,"Dhaka, Feb. 11 -- A new National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report recommends approaches for using 21st century science to evaluate the many factors that lead to health risks and disease, laying the groundwork for a new direction in risk assessment that acknowledges the complexity of disease causation./This report builds on the findings from two earlier Academies reports - Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy, which recommended a path in which testing of chemicals relies primarily on high-throughput in vitro tests and computational models based on human biology to evaluate potential adverse effects of chemical exposures rather than on animal testing, and Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy, which urged a transformational change in the breadth and depth of exposure assessment that would improve its integration with and responsiveness to toxicology and epidemiology./'Recent scientific and technological advances have the potential to improve assessment of public health risks posed by chemicals, yet questions remain how best to integrate the findings from the new tools and methods into risk assessment.'/The committee that conducted the study and wrote the report considered the benefits of many new tools in exposure science, toxicology, and epidemiology. For example, personal sensors and other sampling techniques now offer unparalleled opportunities to characterize individual exposures, particularly in vulnerable populations, and computational tools have the potential to provide exposure estimates where exposure-measurement data are not available. Other advances include the further development of cell-based assays that can be used to evaluate various cellular processes and responses and the creation of transgenic animals using gene-editing techniques that can be used to investigate specific questions, such as those related to susceptibility or gene-environment interactions. And -omics technologies have substantially transformed epidemiology and advanced molecular epidemiology fields that address underlying biology and complement empirical observation. To ensure these tools and methods are being used to their full potential, the report calls for a collaborative approach among scientists in the relevant fields./""This report builds on the conceptual foundation established by the two earlier reports and indicates ways that findings from these new reports can be used in practice,"" said Jonathan Samet, Distinguished Professor and Flora L. Thornton Chair at the department of preventive medicine, University of Southern California. ""It also identifies critical challenges to be addressed in using 21st century science to better characterize the risks of chemicals for human health.""/The advances in exposure science, toxicology, and epidemiology described in the report support a new direction for risk assessment-one based on biological pathways rather than on observations from lab experiments of effects in animals, and one incorporating the more comprehensive exposure information emerging from new tools and approaches. The new direction emphasizes that most diseases that are the focus of risk assessment are caused by multiple factors; that is, stressors from multiple sources can contribute to a single disease, and a single stressor can lead to multiple adverse outcomes. Conditions intrinsic to an individual, such as genetic make-up or life-stage, or conditions acquired from one's environment, such as psychosocial stressors and nutritional status, can contribute to a disease. The new direction in risk assessment acknowledges this complexity./The four agencies that requested the study - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences - are all involved with application of these 21st century scientific approaches, including their use in various components of risk assessment, particularly hazard identification and exposure assessment. Assessment of risks from chemicals and other agents provides needed information to decision-makers who must find solutions to protect public health. The scientific growth highlighted in this report will lead to better information for answering pertinent questions about the complex health problems that society faces./The report discusses a number of risk assessment applications that could be improved by newer tools, such as chemical assessment, assessing risks at facilities like hazardous waste sites, and the evaluation of new chemical molecules for which there are no close comparisons. The report includes several case studies based on realistic scenarios that illustrate ways to incorporate new tools from different fields in assessing the risks associated with known or possibly hazardous agents. For example, investigations show a strong and causal link between air pollution and lung cancer./However, there are unanswered questions about what components in air pollution are carcinogenic, if the various components interact with each other, what effects might occur at low exposures, and which groups of people might be at a higher risk for cancer because of certain characteristics, like smoking tobacco. This case study further explains how advances in toxicology and exposure science, specifically -omics technology, can be used to characterize adverse effects, further refine measurement of exposures to various components, and identify population groups at risk. It also explores the possibility of unestablished health outcomes caused by air pollution, such as neurodevelopmental issues in children./The committee emphasized that technological growth is outpacing the development of approaches to analyze, interpret, and integrate the diverse, complex, and large datasets in these fields. The report also proposes an agenda for enhancing use of the findings from these emerging technologies that includes developing case studies reflecting various situations of decision-making and data availability, testing case studies with multidisciplinary panels, and cataloguing evidence evaluations and decisions that have been made on various agents so that expert judgments can be tracked and evaluated./Although there are several challenges to achieving the visions laid out in the earlier reports, 21st century science holds great promise for advancing risk assessment and ultimately for improving public health and the environment, the report says. The committee emphasizes, however, that communicating the strengths and limitations of the approaches in a transparent and understandable way will be necessary if the results are to be applied appropriately and will be critical for the ultimate acceptance of the approaches./Source: Eurekalert/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The New Nation.

The stem cells reach bone marrow via the blood and take the place of the cells destroyed by treatment. The stem cells are obtained from the bone marrow or umbilical cord./Many of the complications of childhood cancers are related to treatment effects such as radiotherapy (organs in the site of radiation can be affected) and chemotherapy on various organs and tissues. The severity depends on the dose and duration of treatment. They include/Development of secondary malignant tumor. The incidence for developing a second malignant tumor after 5 years or more is 20.5 %. This might be due to a genetic predisposition./Endocrine complications are most common, affecting between 20 and 50 % of individuals who survive into adulthood.

Rampal plant a source of massive air pollution,"Dhaka, May 6 -- Rampal coal-fired power plant will be the largest source of air pollution in Bangladesh, causing premature deaths to as many as 150 people every year, said Lauri Myllyvirta Greenpeace through a video conference from Myanmar on Friday./Greenpeace is a non-governmental global environmental organisation. This coal and air pollution expert conducted a study on the environmental impact of the Rampal coal-fired power plant at the request from Bangladesh's National Committee to Protect the Sundarbans (NCPS). The study was conducted using the CALPUFF air pollution modelling system recommended by the United States' Environment Protection Agency for assessing long-range transport of pollutants and their impacts. At a press conference in the capital, Convener of the NCPS Sultana Kamal said, ""We're opposed to building coal power plant in any where in the country as developed countries has been shutting down coal power plant considering its higher pollution.""/NCPS, Doctors for Health and Environment and Bangladesh Poribesh Andolan jointly organised the conference at Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium on Friday to reveal the international study conducted by Lauri./Bangladesh's Forest and Environment Ministry allowed the Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) for building Rampal coal power plant by complying 59 conditions./Sultana Kamal also said the coal-fired power plant is being diagnosed as a most harmful one to the ecosystem. ""Most of the countries are avoiding setting up of coal-fired plant anew,"" she added./The study by the Greenpeace expert also feared that some 600 babies would be born underweight every year, thanks to the adverse impact of the air-pollution caused by the plant./Joining the event in Dhaka through video conference, Lauri Myllyvirta said the plant would emit high levels of mercury, a potent neurotoxin that damages children's brains and nervous systems./The expert said the mercury pollution could affect fish production./""Over its operational lifetime, the plant's emissions will increase the risk of stroke, lung cancer, heart and respiratory diseases in adults, as well as respiratory symptoms in children,"" stated the study report./Dr Abdul Motin, Sharif Zamil and physician and child specialist Nazmun Nahar and Abu Sayeed also spoke at the function./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Common health problem: Vitamin D deficiency,"Dhaka, May 26 -- Vitamin D deficiency is a common health problem now days in Bangladesh. Over a billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient or insufficient./Yet no organization or governmental body has declared a health emergency to warn the public about the urgent need of achieving sufficient vitamin D blood levels./This pandemic of hypovitaminosis D can mainly be attributed to lifestyle (for example, reduced outdoor activities) and environmental (for example, air pollution) factors that reduce exposure to sunlight, which is required for ultraviolet-B (UVB)-induced vitamin D production in the skin/This major public health problem affects individuals across all life stages, especially pregnant women, neonates, infants, children and the elderly. Vitamin D, also described as 'the Sun Vitamin' is a steroid with hormone like activity./It regulates the functions of over 200 genes and is essential for growth and development. Usually 50 to 90 per cent of vitamin D is produced by sunshine exposure of skin and the remainder comes from the diet./In Breastfed infants Vitamin D requirements cannot ordinarily be met by human milk alone which provides &lt;25 IU/L to 78 IU/L. Vitamin D content of human milk is related to the mother's vitamin D status; therefore mothers who supplement with high doses of vitamin D may have high levels of vitamin D in their milk. Older adults are at high risk of developing vitamin D insufficiency because of aging. Their skin cannot synthesize vitamin D as efficiently, they are likely to spend more time indoors, and they may have inadequate intakes of the vitamin. Homebound individuals, women who wear long robes and head coverings for religious reasons, and people with occupations that limit sun exposure are unlikely to obtain adequate vitamin D from sunlight. People with dark skin, People with fat malabsorption and People who are obese or who have undergone gastric bypass surgery are suffer from VDD./Vitamin D3 is believed to play a role in controlling the immune system, increasing neuromuscular function and improving mood, protecting the brain against toxic chemicals, and potentially reducing pain. Vitamin D3 deficiency can result in obesity, diabetes, hypertension, depression, cognitive impairment, chronic fatigue syndrome, osteoporosis and neuro-degenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Vitamin D deficiency may even contribute to the development of cancers, especially breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Exposure to sunshine each day helps human body to manufacture the required amount of vitamin D./Vitamin D deficiency results in abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, and bone metabolism. VDD causes a decrease in the absorption of dietary calcium and phosphorus, resulting in an increase in PTH levels. The PTH-mediated increase in osteoclastic activity creates local foci of bone weakness and causes a generalized decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), resulting in osteopenia and osteoporosis. An inadequate calcium-phosphorus product causes a mineralization defect in the skeleton. In young children who have little mineral in their skeleton, this defect results in a variety of skeletal deformities classically known as rickets. VDD also causes muscle weakness; affected children have difficulty in standing and walking, whereas the elderly have increasing sway and more frequent falls, thereby increasing their risk of fracture./To prevent vitamin D deficiency, one should spend 15 to 20 minutes daily in the sunshine with 40 per cent of the skin surface exposed. High concentration of melanin in the skin slows the production of vitamin D; similarly aging greatly reduces skin production of vitamin D. Also you should eat vitamin D rich food like- cod liver oil, mushroom, oily fish, fish eggs, fortified cereals, tofu, egg & soya./Numbers of people with VDD are continuously increasing; the importance of this hormone in overall health and the prevention of chronic diseases are at the forefront of research. VDD is very common in all age groups. Very few foods contain vitamin D therefore guidelines recommended supplementation of vitamin D at tolerable UL levels./It is also suggested to measure the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 is recommended for the deficient patients. Along this long term strategies to address this deficiency problem should include public education, national health policies for screening and prevention through food fortification, and treatment with vitamin D supplementation./Vitamin D deficiency is growing problem in Bangladesh. Most of the people don't aware of this. So this is necessary for us to build up some awareness like government and private campaign, advertising in radio-television, press add e.tc. Health professionals like doctor, nutritionists should encourage the general people to fulfill the requirement of vitamin D. n/(Fahmida Hashem, Consulting nutritionist & CEO, Miss Nutritionist-Weight Loss Center)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Quit tobacco for sustainable development,"Dhaka, May 31 -- Bangladesh, as a member-country of the WHO will observe World No Tobacco Day on 31 May like all the previous years. WHO member-states will observe the day to draw attention of policy-makers, health personnel, NGOs, civil society and in fact, every individual and take action from their respective places to tackle the threats of tobacco and achieving health and socio-economic targets of their respective countries./Every year a theme is selected by WHO for the day. The theme of the World No Tobacco Day for 2017 is Tobacco - A threat to Development. The theme highlights that tobacco industry is an obstacle towards the substantial development of all countries, including health and economic well-being of the people of the countries./Facts about tobacco: WHO facts reveals that tobacco use is responsible for 6 million death every year globally which is predicted to grow 8 million by 2030. Tobacco is responsible for loss of national economies enormously through increased health-care costs and decreased productivity. It also worsens health inequalities and creates poverty as the poor people spend less on essentials like food, education and health care. It is found that some 80 percent premature deaths from tobacco use occur in low or middle income countries. Beside this, tobacco growing requires large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers which can be toxic and pollute water supplies. As per WHO data tobacco growing each year require 4.3 million hectares of land, as a result of which global deforestation occurs between 2% to 4%. It is estimated that tobacco manufacturing produces over 2 million tonnes of solid waste./Not only the smokers, but also tobacco causes harms to non-smokers: A non-smoker cannot be safe so long, there are smokers around. Non-smokers are vulnerable to the deadly habit of the smokers' smoking, which is called second-hand smoke without any fault of the non-smokers. They happen to inhale the air polluted by tobacco smokers and they run the same risk as the smokers. WHO facts reveal that there are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke of which at least 250 are know to be hrmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory disease, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places. Over 40 percent of children have at least one smoking parent.Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care, and hinder economic development./According to WHO in addition to saving lives and reducing health inequalities, comprehensive tobacco control is a tool to deter tobacco growing, manufacturing, trade and development and thus tobacco control can break the cycle of poverty, contribute to ending hunger, promote sustainbale agriculture and economic growth and combat climate change. As such, WHO is calling on all the member states to inclue tobacco control in their national response to 2030 Agenda./According to WHO tobacco control helps achieve health and development of the citizens of the countries in a way of protecting their citizens from the harms of tobacco use and reducing its economic losses on national economies. According to WHO the aim of the Sustainable Development Agenda and its seventeen goals is to ensure that no one is left behind. As per WHO data tobacco control has been enshrined in the Substantial Agenda which is seen as one of the most effective means of achieving SDG target 3.4 of one-third reduction globally by 2030 of premature deaths from non communicable diseases(NCDs) including cardiovascular disease, cancer and chronic obstructed pulmonary diseases. As such WHO is calling its member-states to prioritize and accelerate tobacco control efforts as a signatory of of the 2030 Agenda for Substantial Development./The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) which is an international treaty with 180 parties (179 countries and the European Union) acts as guide towards global fights against the tobacco epidemic. Today more than half of the world countries representing about 40% of the world population (2.8 billion) have implemented WHO FCTC's policies and strategies in the tobacco control programme. Member-countries are using tax approach as per FCTC guidelines as high taxes contribute to revenue generation for governments and reduce demand for tobacco. It is estimate that through increasing cigarette taxes worldwide by US$1, an extra US$190 billion could be raised for development./As per Article 11 and 13 of WHO FCTC, Plain packaging is a key method to reduce the attractiveness of tobacco products, restricts use of tobacco packaging as a form of tobacco advertising and promotion, limits misleading packaging and labelling by the tobacco companies and increases the effectiveness of health warnings./According to Article 11 of the FCTC, the use of Graphic Health Warning (GHW) on tobacco packs is obligatory by the WHO member countries./The use GHW on tobacco packs remind the tobacco users every time about the harmful effects of tobacco when they use it and help them to refrain from this deadly habit. Example shows that the GHW has played significant role in reducing tobacco use in many countries of the globe. This was introduced first in Canada in 2001 and so far, over 77 countries have introduced GHW on tobacco packets. Data reveals that 90% GHW is used in Nepal, being the largest space, India 85%, Thailand has alloted 85%, Sri Lanka uses 80% and in Indonesia 40% of all forms tobacco packs contains graphical health warnings./In Bangladesh, 43% of adults use some form of tobacco. Smokeless tobacco is used by 28% of women and 26% of men, whereas 45% of men and 1.5% of women smoke cigarettes. Nearly one lac people die every year from tobacco related diseases and 3,82,000 people were suffering from diseases and disabilities due to use of tobacco. Economic losses of tobacco is also alarming, as data reveals that every year 1 percent of GDP is spent for cigarette and 0.4 percent of the same is spent on purchase of bidi. It is estimated that the country produces 8000 crore-stick cigarette and 5000 crore-stick bidi every year and cultivable land for crop production is diminising due to tobacco production and for longer period of tobacco cultivation, land fertility is at stake./The situation becomes aggravated when tobacco cultivation on the both side of bank of rivers and thereby mixing of tobacco chemicals with water during rainy season causes water pollution and seriously effect the water resources. Tobacco preparing cost is also alarming as for burning one ton of tobacco leaf, it is estimated that 5 ton of energy wood is burnt which is certainly a great loss to the economy./Bangladesh anti-tobacco law 2005 more is more effective with its amendment in the year 2013 which is a milestone in the history of tobacco control programme in the country. Section 10 of the amended law directed the tobacco companies for printing the graphical health warnings on top of both sides of tobacco packets, cover, and box covering at least 50 percent of the total area of each. It also says that if the section of the law is violated, the punishment contains rigorous imprisonment less than six months or monetary fine less than taka two lac./Multiple approaches are essential to eradicate tobacco. There should be extensive application of taxation on all forms of tobacco alongwith graphic health warnings. Tobacco taxes are the most effective way to reduce its use, especially among young and poor people. WHO facts reveal that a tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10 percent helps decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 percent in high-income countries and by upto 8 percent in low-and middle-income countries. Therefore, taxation on tobacco should be encouraged and applied extensively on all forms of tobacco and tobacco products./It is worth to mention that tax structure on cigarettes in Bangladesh is based on 4 stages, the lowest being 40% and the highest 60%. The supplementary duty/tax on bidis ranges between 20% and 25% depending on whether it has filter or not. There should be a tax increase upto 200 percent on low-grade cigarettes and bidis, which will help increase government revenue and decrease demand particularly among the poor people. iii. Adequate steps should be taken to stop tobacco cultivation and supply chain be stopped. This should be materialized with priority basis and by providing loan to farmers on easy terms. iv. Smoking be prohibitted at all workplaces, factories, and industries and support center for the non-smokers including smokers who desire to quit smoking may be established in factores and industries./Study among the tobacco users indicates that most of them are aware of the dangers of tobacco and want to quit the deadly habit. As nicotine exists in tobacco, it becomes difficult on the part of the smokers to quit. In this regard counselling, cooperation from the near and dear ones, medication and various awareness measures can help a smoker to quit the habit./National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) under the Ministry of Health and Family Planning is playing important role in the tobacco control programme. We have the support and strength of the head of the government. This has been reflected when the hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said at the South Asian Speakers' Summit that tobacco use would be eradicated by 2040, which refers that tobacco use will be brought below 5 percent and ultimately could be eliminated totally from the country./The World No Tobacco Day theme this year has created opportunites for achieving sustainable development goals for all. Alongwith government's efforts, everybody on an individual level can contribute to make tobacco-free world for sustainable development./(M.A.Jabbar is executive secretary of ADHUNIK, national anti-tobacco organization of Bangladesh.)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Sound and air pollution rampant in Sylhet,"Sylhet, June 10 -- The dust and sounds of vehicles are polluting the air in Sylhet city. The air and sound pollution have aggravated in Sylhet, causing different diseases to the city dwellers, environmentalists and locals said./Air pollution caused by black smoke emission by unfit vehicles and dusts from open space has increased bronchitis, asthma and other respiratory-related diseases among the city dwellers, physicians said./Besides, people of different strata in Sylhet are also facing sound pollution caused by the hydraulic horns, power generators and wielding engineering workshops located in and around residential areas./They said noise affects children physically and psychologically while normal life is being hampered by round-the-clock operations of the power generators in different posh residence in the city and wielding engineering workshops./Experts said sound pollutions have reached nearly 200 decibel against its tolerable level of 60 decibel. They said air pollution from thousands of unfit vehicles reached 100 per cent against its maximum tolerable level of hard ridge smoke unit of 65 per cent./Besides, pollution from dusts has also reached 500 plus microgram though its tolerable level is considered 200 microgram suspended particulates matter. Environmentalists blamed smoked air caused by unfit vehicles, coupled with dusts from open space, for such environmental degradation in the city./Physicians feared that if such environmental degradation continues, respiratory deceases would increase manifold among city residents. Department of Environment (DoE), Sylhet office sources said the pollution is very high in a few jam-packed places of the city including Bandorbazar, Cout point, Zindabazar, Surma point, Dargagait, Ambhorkhana, Mirabazar and Sylhet Railway Station./Residents of Bandorbazar areas alleged that the situation worsens at night as wielding operators start their generators which create noise higher than the tolerable levels of sound./A poet Shirul said, ""It is very difficult to do work of writing for noise.""/Writer Abu Maliha said, ""We can not come out for dust. In the dry season, the dust used to mix in the air which causes disease.""/D. Hasmot Ullah a Principal of Jalalabad Teachers Training College in Sylhet living at Upashahor area said, ""I usually study at night but I find it very difficult to continue my study for the noise. It is unfortunate that some young people use high power sound system on their roof top almost every day.""/""It is very hard to sleep, my kids often get up being frightened and start crying to hear the sound of heavy vehicles,"" he added./Continuous sound pollution may totally deafen the children as well as the adults,/ENT specialists feared. ENT specialist Dr. Nurul Huda Naim said, ""A noisy environment can affect children physically and psychologically.""/According to government guidelines, wielding engineering and lead machines, iron factories and generators must be set up at least one kilometre away from residences and power generators must be set up underground./It is alleged that factory and wielding engineering owners and developers of the residential flats pay no heed to the complaints regarding the situation./BRTA sources said they send data about unfit vehicles every six months to the traffic department in the city and district for checking the vehicles and controlling the black smoke./Assistant director of BRTA, said they issued notice regularly to the defaulting vehicle owners for renovating their respective vehicles, renewing the certificates and paying road taxes./Jedan Al Musa, Additional Commissioner of SMP said, the unfit vehicles not only pollute air and cause sound pollution but also contribute to traffic jams and road accidents./He emphasised combined efforts by the traffic department and BRTA to check the vehicles./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Common-sense to ensure longevity,"Dhaka, June 15 -- Most of us would all like to live longer and have a better quality of life. To have the gift of good health in your later years, it makes sense to take care of yourself in your youth. Here are some common-sense lifestyle tips and natural remedies to help grow old youthfully./Drink More Water/Water makes up approximately 60% of the human body, and there is water in every cell of the body. We cannot survive without water for longer than a few days. With age our sense of thirst gradually diminishes, and the water content of body decreases so many elderly people are somewhat dehydrated. Dehydration is linked to allergies, hypertension, general aches and pains and of course bad digestion./Eat Healthily/Easier said than done for some, but a healthy diet is essential to your well-being. The old saying ""You are what you eat"" rings true when we see the rise in dietary related diseases. Don't be caught digging your grave with your teeth. A balanced diet of fresh, whole (non-processed), organic and preferably raw food should be a large part of your diet./Basic guidelines for a simplified balanced diet/Avoid white flour products/Eat whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, millet etc./Avoid sugar - rather use honey, agave, xylitol or stevia./Eat a variety of legumes (beans, lentils etc.)/Avoid all hydrogenated fats (margarine etc.)/Avoid fried foods/Include low-starch vegetables preferably eaten raw./Include foods rich in omega-3 fats./Include low-fat, organic protein sources (fish, spirulina, organic whey protein, quinoa)/Include fresh organic fruit (especially from the super food range) and raw nuts./Avoid colourants, flavourants, preservatives and artificial sweeteners./Whole foods are better than processed. Refined foods result in both a measurable loss of nutrients and an unbalanced food, which creates imbalance in the body when eaten. Living food (such as fresh fruit and vegetables) are more nutritious and better than ""dead food"" (such as canned foods). Foods grown in ""live soil"" (organic food) is better than food grown in ""sterile soil"". This has largely depleted trace minerals in foods./How does eating sugar make you old?/Eating sugar causes your body to secrete high levels of insulin. Insulin and the stress hormone, cortisol, are two hormones that can dramatically speed up the ageing process. Sugar depresses the immune system; it contributes to atherosclerosis, and it causes oxidative stress by creating AGEs (advanced glycosylated end-products). These accumulate in body tissues such as the skin (causing age spots), arteries, kidneys and brain. In other words, eating sugar makes you old./Do exercise/Exercise is one of your key weapons in the fight against premature aging. Medical studies prove time and time again that physical exercise is a key factor in the prevention of chronic disease as well as beneficial for mental function. The main benefit of exercise is the increased oxygen to the brain, heart and other organs which in turn increases their well-being and functioning. Bouncing on a mini-trampoline is a well recommended form of exercise that can be done in the comfort of your own home and at a time that suits your schedule./Detox/The body detoxifies itself naturally through the skin and other organs of elimination. Assist your body with its cleansing ability by making some lifestyle changes. You need to minimize your exposure to external toxins: changes like drinking pure water, eating organic food, avoiding sources of air pollution and exposure to tobacco, and limiting consumption of alcohol, preservatives, caffeine, sugar and processed foods. Simple measures like bathing daily, dry brushing, exercising, keeping hydrated, supplementing with herbal remedies that support the organs (like milk thistle for the liver), deep breathing and eating healthily are good routines to follow./Get Some sunshine/Natural Vitamin D is another key weapon in the pursuit of good health and longevity. Sunlight is the best form of Vitamin D and its levels in the body affects the entire body. Modern science is now realizing that vitamin D does more than just aid the absorption of calcium and bone formation. It is also involved in multiple repair and maintenance functions, touches hundreds of different genes, and helps to fight infection by regulating the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency is a growing epidemic across the world and contributes to many chronic debilitating diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and depression, as well as cognitive impairment in older people. Avoid synthetic Vitamin D2 in supplements like fortified foods as high doses have been found to be toxic./Get more sleep/Good quality sleep is essential, in fact some say that it's the best anti-aging tool. While we sleep,the body ""recharges"" and repairs. The 24-hour circadian rhythm is our internal clock and governs the body's functions.. This clock helps the body to adapt to the time of day and to environmental changes. Studies have shown a co-dependency between the circadian clock and the body's metabolism and cellular performance. Disrupted sleep patterns can adversely affect health especially mental health. Some effects include short-term memory loss and impaired creativity as well as weight gain or loss and an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. Lack of sleep weakens the immune system and may cause decreased production of melatonin, which is produced by the brain during sleep./Take pleasure in living healthily and make good choices in nutrition, exercise, weight management, mental attitude, work and relationships. This will stand you in good stead for your later years./-From Web/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Unhealthy isolated neighbourhood links childhood asthma,"Dhaka, Aug. 14 -- Low birth weight was thought to be a major risk factor of childhood asthma in blacks. A recent study finds that there is another trigger which might increase the risk of asthma in black children./Persistent residential segregation exposed to air pollution and older buildings which harbor mold spores and fecal matter from rodent and insect might be the actual reason. Black children in the US are twice as likely as other children to develop asthma. But why black children are much more likely than other children to suffer from asthma?/Persistent residential segregation, which traps minority children in unhealthy, polluted neighborhoods might be the reason, suggests a new study by Princeton University./'Highly segregated neighborhoods near the highway exposed to air pollution may be a major factor behind the risk of childhood asthma in black children.'/Past research has attributed that low birth weight defined as less than 2,500 grams, or about 5.5 pounds could be a risk for asthma. But birth weight alone might not be the reason./Janet M. Currie, who is the Henry Putnam Professor of Economics and Public Affairs, explains that the racial disparity in asthma rates is so strong that some researchers have even concluded that ""being black"" is a risk factor for asthma./Low birth weight may predispose children to asthma, but by itself it doesn't cause the disease. A physical trigger is required. Thus it appears that something about the neighborhoods where the low-birth-weight children live, regardless of their race, is causing them to develop asthma./""This distinction is important,"" Currie said, ""because unlike race, it is possible to change neighborhoods, either by finding and remediating the hazards that are causing higher asthma prevalence or by helping vulnerable children to move.""/Not only can indoor and outdoor air pollution trigger asthma in susceptible children, Currie and Alexander noted they could also cause women to have low-birth-weight babies in the first place./To conduct their study, Currie and Alexander combined two sets of data records of all children born to mothers who lived in New Jersey from 2006 to 2010, and records of all New Jersey hospital emergency room visits from 2006 to 2012. The records help in determining whether or how many times each low-birth-weight child was treated in an emergency room for asthma during the study period./""The United States continues to be highly racially segregated,"" Currie said, ""with African-American neighborhoods suffering higher poverty, lower average educational attainments, higher unemployment, higher exposure to pollution, and other ills.""/Currie and Alexander's study suggests that the characteristics of highly segregated neighborhoods may be a major factor behind such persistent racial health disparities./But when Currie and her co-author, Princeton Ph.D. Diane Alexander of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, compared low-birth-weight children of all races and ethnicities who lived in ""black"" ZIP codes in New Jersey-in which half or more of the residents are African American-the racial disparity in the association between low birth weight and asthma disappeared completely./In other words, all low-birth-weight children in these ZIP codes, whatever their race, had the same elevated risk of asthma, compared to children born at a normal weight./The researchers found that New Jersey neighborhoods with a majority of black residents are on average twice as close as other neighborhoods to major industrial sources of air pollution. They are more likely to be near busy highways that produce high concentrations of harmful particulate matter./Currie and Alexander's study couldn't say definitively what exactly about the link between the Zip codes and the risk of the disease. But indoor and outdoor pollution might be the triggering factor for asthma in low birth weight children./Source: Medindia/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Why technology will power SDG success,"John Sargent, Oct. 10 -- Humanity simply can't afford to wait another 15 years for partial progress. World leaders launched the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 to address inequities in human rights, but after 15 years and only partial progress achieved, an even larger group of global leaders launched an even more ambitious set of objectives to reach by 2030 - the Sustainable Development Goals./Setting the scene for the SDGs/As the United Nations acknowledges, ""to meet the SDG health targets by 2030, progress must be accelerated, in particular in regions with the highest burden of disease."" A few statistics from SDG 3 - ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being - make that point perfectly clear:/* Maternal deaths: Achieving the target of fewer than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 requires a 7.5 percent annual reduction, more than double the annual rate of progress achieved from 2000 to 2015./* Indoor air pollution - the greatest environmental health risk: In 2012, household air pollution from cooking with unclean fuels or inefficient technologies led to an estimated 4.3 million deaths, while ambient air pollution accounts for an estimated 3 million deaths./* Premature deaths due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, or diabetes: 13 million in 2015, accounting for 43 percent of all premature deaths globally. From 2000 to 2015, the risk of dying between 30 and 70 years of age from one of those four causes decreased from 23 percent to 19 percent, falling short of the rate required to meet the 2030 target of a one-third reduction./However, more of the same for the next 13 years is not going to miraculously end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure all humans have access to quality health care, education, and decent work./Digital technology: The missing factor/If we are to collectively solve the world's most complex issues, then we need to augment the development industry's earnest intentions and efforts with the transformative power of technology. Digital transformation's impact has been proven over and over again in the developed world, but is only slowly gaining traction in the emerging markets./Digital technology and digital connectivity are fundamental to the future of every industry, from transportation to banking to retail and health care, in developed and developing economies alike./Harvard Business School professors Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhan interviewed hundreds of leaders to understand how traditional approaches to innovation and operations are changing. They shared their findings in a November 2014 Harvard Business Review article, writing: ""The new paradigm is not displacement and replacement but connectivity and recombination. Transactions are being digitized, data is being generated and analyzed in new ways, and previously discrete objects, people, and activities are being connected.""/Mobile devices: A force for equality/Two technologies are fundamental for partners working in developing markets to harness: mobile technology and artificial intelligence./""If we are to collectively solve the world's most complex issues, then we need to augment the development industry's earnest intentions and efforts with the transformative power of technology.""/With the ubiquity of cell phone usage in emerging economies, mobile devices have the power to democratize health care through the collection and use of data from the multitudes. They have the power to unlock inclusive health care for the heretofore-invisible poor. In Kenya, for example, the ""health wallet,"" accessible from cell phones, removes barriers to universal access to care by transferring government funds directly into citizen accounts, even to those living in slums and remote villages. Mobile technology enables the poor to receive treatment in clinics and hospitals through electronic payment and monitoring of treatment adherence. As Dr. Kharma Rogo, lead health specialist at the World Bank and head of the bank's Health in Africa Initiative, explains in the documentary, The Great Escape, ""Mobile technology is disrupting every layer of society at an unprecedented pace. The biggest social equalizer now in this part of the world [Africa], I believe, is a cell phone.""/The BroadReach Vantage digital platform, developed to streamline our work with partners to transform public health delivery, leverages mobile technology for data collection, integration, and dissemination, as well as for collaboration./Field workers fighting the HIV epidemic in five provinces across South Africa now rely on mobile device access to Vantage to capture daily activities and facility-level information, view trends, and retrieve analysis and recommendations to improve performance. Vantage toolkits are also accessible via mobile device so that health workers in all locations can implement best practice workflows that address identified issues, such as appointment scheduling and community-based testing campaigns./Artificial intelligence: Making sense of exploding data/Vantage is also a foundational component of the U.S. Agency for International Development-led innovation project called Regional Action Through Data operating in 23 countries across West and East Africa. Regional economic communities will have access to data aggregated across multiple sources to enhance resource allocation, policies, and program development decisions related to tuberculosis, maternal and child health, malaria and more./Artificial intelligence is another powerful disruptor, also having the power to boost the impact of development initiatives. AI harnesses huge volumes of data and turns it into actionable information - a process virtually impossible for humans to handle at scale, consequently drastically cutting the time, cost, and relevancy of information provided by consultants. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella explains his reverence for AI, explaining how democratizing AI - making it available to any person or company - will radically improve the way computers interact with and work on behalf of humans./The Vantage platform uses artificial intelligence to generate predictive models, such as disease prevalence by area, patient populations in need of prophylactic treatment, and staffing plans for greatest impact. And it will continue to add value to our platform as AI technology becomes more powerful and pervasive - in the cloud as well as at the device level./Configuring Vantage for the team's needs, we are closing in on the 90-90-90 HIV Challenge goals:/* 30 percent more citizens know their HIV status/* 17 percent more are enrolled in HIV treatment and care/* 43 percent more are receiving effective therapy/Now is the time to accelerate technology adoption/To reach the 2030 SDGs finish line having achieved the goals, the development industry - NGOs, donors, governments, and the private sector - must fully embrace the transformative power of technology: the missing factor./When leaders have data-driven insights into performance in real-time, they can move forward expeditiously. When they have AI-driven prognostic models of potential risks and opportunities, they can focus resources for optimal impact. When they have mobile access to best practice operational solutions, they can replicate reliable service delivery across multiple layers of program activity in multiple geographies. When they have consolidated data in one place, they can fulfill reporting requirements efficiently. And, when they share a platform for instantaneous communications, they can collaborate for the common good./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Keep the city dust free,"Dhaka, Oct. 30 -- WE are at the onset of winter. The government should take monitoring initiatives to check dust pollution in Dhaka city as the quality of air falls drastically in winter and people suffer lung infections. Quoting green activists, The New Nation reported that due to unplanned construction work-related processes like concrete crushing, cement batching and road stone plants, city dwellers are deprived of breathing in fresh air in winter. Presence of particles in the air becomes several times more in Dhaka than the acceptable level. The government or the city corporations can't control the dust; individuals and private firms should come up with ideas to curb the menace./Dust particles small enough to be inhaled not only cause irritation of the eyes, coughing and sneezing, but also asthma and bronchitis. Every 10 out of 100 children exposed to dust develop asthma while seven to eight percent of adults suffer from chronic bronchitis. According to the World Health Organisation, over 37,000 Bangladeshis die annually from diseases related to air pollution. That the number of people who suffer from various forms of diseases caused by dust and air pollution is much higher can easily be estimated./Dhaka, of course, being an underdeveloped city, requires rapid development in its infrastructure. There is no way of logically arguing against that. But what one can easily argue is the lack of effort on part of the authorities to mitigate and, in fact, even reduce in any way the fallout effects of such development and construction works. A household in the city, on average, has to incur a loss of additional Tk 4,000-Tk 5,000 per month due to dust pollution as the city households have to spend money on cleaning their clothes, utensils, furniture and other materials. The major sources of dust pollution are brick kilns (58 percent) located in surrounding areas of the city, construction materials (18 percent) and vehicles (10 percent). As quality is not ensured in road repairs, city roads get damaged fast and generate unusual dust making the lives of city dwellers miserable./The government must come up with a detailed plan on how to check dust pollution in Dhaka and other cities. The City Corporations must water their construction sites while realtors and developers should take steps to stop dust spreading. The brick kilns on the outskirts of Dhaka city are also responsible for air pollution, so the government should ask the kiln owners to use environment-friendly technology. The city fathers must not play with the public health. It is their core duty to let the city dwellers a healthy life./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

'Take-Make-Dispose' model not working well,"Dhaka, Nov. 1 -- The prevailing ""Take-Make-Dispose"" linear economic model consisting of voracious depletion of natural resources in both production and consumption patterns has proved to be one of the world's main killers due to the huge pollution it causes for air, land and soil, marine and freshwater./Just to have an idea, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly a quarter of all deaths worldwide, amounting to 12.6 million people in 2012, are due to pollution, with at least 8.2 million attributable to non-communicable environmental causes, and more than three quarters occurring in just three regions./As in most other pollution-related impacts, low- and middle-income countries -those who are among the least industrialised nations on Earth- bear the brunt of pollution-related illnesses, with a disproportionate impact on children./The latest global and regional environmental assessments give an indication of the magnitude of current threats: air pollution; land and soil pollution; freshwater pollution, and marine and coastal pollution. All this in addition to crosscutting causes such as chemicals and waste, reports the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)./As if the death of millions of humans every year due to human-made pollution were not enough, it also impacts the global economy. The UN estimates that outdoor air pollution costs about 3 trillion dollars, while the cost of indoor pollution reaches 2 trillion dollars a year./Climate change is also modifying weather patterns, affecting the levels and occurrence of pollutants and airborne allergens, such as ozone and pollen, and in some cases exposing people to higher concentrations over longer periods than in previous decades, according to UNEP's report Towards a Pollution-Free Planet. The report provides some key examples: air quality is a problem in nearly all regions; water pollution is a major cause of death of children under five years of age; nutrient over-enrichment of land and water is causing shifts in ecosystems and loss of biodiversity; plastics in the ocean is on the rise and there is still no acceptable ""storage or disposal option"" for processing of older-generation nuclear fuel. See: World Campaign to Clean Torrents of Plastic Dumped in the Oceans/Here are some key details regarding the major threats caused by the prevailing linear economic model as summarised by UNEP's Towards a Pollution Free Planet report:/Air: Air pollution is the world's single greatest environmental risk to health. Some 6.5 million people across the world die prematurely every year from exposure to out-door and indoor air, and nine out of ten people breathe outdoor air polluted beyond acceptable World Health Organization guidelines levels. WHO also reports that air pollution disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, including those with mental disabilities and young children./On this, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that approximately 2 billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds the guidelines, and 300 million in areas where outdoor air pollution is at least six times higher./In addition to the impact on human health, other air pollutants cause climate change and affect ecosystems, such as short-lived climate pollutants including black carbon and ground-level ozone, warns WHO./The main sources of outdoor air pollution are fossil fuel emissions from coal burning for power and heat, transport, industrial furnaces, brick kilns, agriculture, domestic solid fuel heating, and the unregulated burning of waste materials such as plastics and batteries in open pits and incinerators, according to UNEP's report./Other important sources include the burning of peat-lands, both of which generate haze, sand and dust storms, as well as desertification, which often results from land degradation, including deforestation and wetland drainage./The report says indoor air pollution accounts for 4.3 million deaths, 18 per cent of ischaemic heart disease and 33 per cent of all lower respiratory infections. It in particular affects women, children, the sick and elderly, and those in low-income groups, as they are often exposed to high levels of pollutants from cooking and heating./Land and Soil: ""Towards a Pollution-Fee Planet"" also informs that land and soil pollution is largely the product of poor agricultural practices, inefficient irrigation, improper solid waste management - including unsafe storage of obsolete stockpiles of hazardous chemicals and nuclear waste - and a range of industrial, military and extractive activities./""Leachates from mismanaged landfills and uncontrolled dumping of waste from households, industrial plants and mine tailings can contain heavy metals, such as mercury and arsenic, as well as organic compounds and pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and microorganisms.""/UNEP explains that pollutants easily degrade land, soils and the underlying aquifers and are hard to remove, thus humans and wildlife living near former industrial sites and some reclaimed lands are at potential risk of continued exposure to pollution if sites are not decontaminated properly./The primary pollutants of concern in land and soil include heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium and chromium, persistent organic pollutants and other pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics used for livestock management, the report adds./Globally, estimates indicate that at least 1 million people are unintentionally poisoned every year by excessive exposure and inappropriate use of pesticides, with health effects on all, according to UNEP./The main driver for the use of synthetic chemical pesticides is the reduction of the negative impacts of pests, such as insects, diseases and weeds, on crop yields, estimated in the 1990s to account for 40 per cent of the world's losses, it informs./The number of women working as pesticide applicators varies, but in some countries, women make up 85 per cent or more of the pesticide applicators on commercial farms and plantations, often working while pregnant or breastfeeding, says the report. Women are also uniquely exposed to pesticides even when they do not directly apply them./Just a couple of examples: in Pakistan, where cotton is picked by women, a survey found that 100 per cent of the women picking cotton 3-15 days after pesticides had been sprayed suffered acute pesticide poisoning symptoms. And in Chile, in 1997, of the 120 reported pesticide poisonings, 110 were women, nearly all employed in the lower industry./Pesticide exposure can cause lifelong harm and increase the risk of preterm births, birth defects, childhood mortality, reduced sperm function and a range of adult diseases, warns the report./Otherwise, the rise of antimicrobial resistance as a result of overuse and improper use of antimicrobials, including antibiotics used in food production, is now a globally significant issue. A major concern is that this may cause rapid changes to the microbial composition of soil, freshwater and biota, and drive the development of multi-strain microbial resistance worldwide, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)./Freshwater: As if all tis were not sufficient, the Towards a Pollution-Free Planet says that freshwater bodies are heavily affected by pollution, particularly by a range of nutrients, agro-chemicals and pathogens from untreated wastewater, and heavy metals from mining and industrial effluents/Moreover, polluted water is also more likely to host disease vectors, such as cholera-causing Vibrio and parasitic worm-transmitted bilharzia./Another scary fact in the report is that over 80 per cent of the world's wastewater is released into the environment without treatment. Globally, 58 per cent of diarrhoeal disease -a major driver of child mortality- is due to a lack of access to clean water and sanitation. These are just some of the major consequences of the current so-called linear economic model, which perhaps should be rather known as the relentless destruction of both nature. and humans./(Baher Kamal is Senior Advisor to IPS Director General on Africa & the Middle East.

Alarming rise in city air pollution,"Dhaka, Nov. 25 -- THE presence of pollutant particles in Dhaka's air has become quite high with alarm signals to public health. It was even higher than Delhi and Beijing on last Wednesday, as per a report in a national daily. We know Delhi had closed schools and put other emergency measures only last week as smog heavily hit the city forcing the city administration to ask people to stay indoor to avoid respiratory troubles and accident from poor visibility in city streets. Beijing and many other Chinese cities very often take such precautionary measures to protect city dwellers./The State of Global Air Report 2017 said, Dhaka has ranked second on a global list of cities with worst air pollution, which claims 122,400 lives in Bangladesh a year. Air pollution is the leading environmental cause of death worldwide when 92 percent of the world's population lives in areas with unhealthy air. India and Bangladesh experienced the steepest increase in air pollution levels between 1990 and 2015./We must say the new development is taking place as carbon emission in the air is fast rising from industrial pollution. Nations across the world are taking the issue seriously in the recent past committing to keep the carbon in the air under tight control. But the damage that has already been done to the environment is irreparable and industrialized and developing nations are facing serious consequences from it. Moreover, their slow move to switch to clean energy is further aggravating the situation./Dhaka was not however hit by heavy fog on Wednesday but presence of injurious pollutant particles were so high in the air that it deteriorated air quality very much to harm public health. Needless to say Dhaka is heavily suffering from pollution of brick kiln, digging city roads, renovation of city pavements and repair in city streets. Dust is spreading in the air to add to industrial pollution now heavily growing from city suburbs./The Directorate of Environment (DoE) found air quality at dangerously low level at least at three city points. Usually air quality falls drastically during the dry season and the time is quite critical for public health. It no doubt requires close attention of the city corporation authorities to keep the city clean while the Health Authorities and the DoE in particular must have binding rules to keep the air less polluted./Air pollution contributed to 4.2 million premature deaths and to a loss of 103 million healthy years of life in 2015 according to the report. It said pollution is the fifth biggest cause of death. Bangladesh and India now have the highest exposures to air pollution related diseases. It is causing slow death to people unnoticed but it is time to take note of the danger and take measures accordingly./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dust pollution takes toll in cities' air,"Dhaka, Dec. 10 -- PRESENCE of dust and pollution in the air of our cities has reached alarming levels. It's happening mainly due to chaotic construction works, poor management and protracted traffic jams. According to Air Quality Index Report of the Department of Environment's (DoE) ""Clean Air and Sustainable Project"" earlier this month, air quality of Dhaka, Gazipur, Narayanganj and Rajshahi has been measured 'extremely unhealthy'. Yet there is no big-scale initiative taken from the government's end to address the dilemma./In fact the degree of pollutants have increased at such length, number of patients suffering from respiratory problems, Bronchiolitis, Asthma and Chronic Pulmonary diseases have dangerously shot up, according to the physicians of many public and private hospitals./Although the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) claimed that it has already taken a 'water-spraying programme' to combat dust and bring it to a tolerable level, but Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) is doing almost nothing to combat the mounting dust in the city's air. The ecologists and the physicians expressed anxiety over the situation. They have repeatedly warned of dire consequences if dust from the city's air is not controlled./However, be it protracted traffic jams or increasing air pollution, the government's authorities concerned seems not interested enough. There is no sign of campaigning for creating mass awareness, preventing air pollution and the situation is worsening. Instead of focusing on massive infrastructure mega-projects it's time the party in power pays more attention to the very basic health predicaments that's taking Dhaka and other cities near the brink of collapse. The question relating to succeeding or failing in addressing the quandary only arises when sincere efforts are taken and applied, but if there are no visible efforts at all , the hope for a change any time soon is little./The dwellers of Dhaka and other cities are paying heavy social, physical and economic cost for the numerable development projects - still they are deprived from being the beneficiaries of the so-called rampant 'developments' here and there. The unending public sufferings due to air pollution must be handled efficiently and quick. Our cities must not become unlivable./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Revisiting the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture,"Dhaka, Jan. 1 -- The application of pesticide becomes an invincible part to crop cultivation. It remains unclear whether the use of chemical pesticides should be stopped or not. Environmentalists, soil scientists, hydrologists, physicians, and experts of other line departments opined to phase off chemical pesticides gradually and introduce bio-pesticides; whereas, a majority of agriculturists, food experts and agro companies argued not to stop the use of chemical pesticides, rather to train up agricultural workers on the application (how and when) of pesticides. They argued that if chemical pesticides are not used, it will reduce 30-40% crops per year, which will eventually create food scarcity. /Chemical pesticides may not harmful for human health if farmers know the residual time of a pesticide after they use. According to Bangladesh Crop Protection Association (BCPA), less than 1% farmers have the skills of pesticides application and crop harvest. In Japan, agricultural workers use seven times more chemical pesticides compared to Bangladesh. However, Japanese people take safe food. This is because Japaneese farmers know when to harvest crops after using pesticides. But in developing countries like Bangladesh, educating farmers is a troublesome task. Farmers have to wait 30-50 days for harvesting a crop if they spray pesticides of organochlorin group whereas, the waiting time of crop harvest is 4-7 days if they use pesticides of synthetic pyrethroid group. Bangladeshi farmers spray at morning and harvest at afternoon which is extremely risky for consumers, due to lack of knowledge of pesticide's residual period. Chemical pesticides have proven evidence that it creates environmental hazards such as soil and air pollution and water contamination followed by death of aquatic animals and many other negative externalities. Therefore, introducing bio-pesticides, other natural means of pest control, and the methods of organic agriculture would be attention grabbing in future to avoid environmental deterioration and reduce human health risks./It is commonly agreed that chemical pesticides in agriculture has created serious health and environmental effects, however, the information remains largely anecdotal. It is estimated that one to five million agricultural workers are affected by pesticide poisoning per year and the World Health Organization reports that at least 20,000 workers die from exposure of pesticides every year. The uses of toxic chemical pesticides in agriculture not only create different diseases in human health (over 200 diseases reported by WHO) such as, cancer, hypertension, kidney diseases, skin diseases, affect nervous system, irritate eye, etc. but also pollute soil and air, contaminate water through surface run off and jeopardize food chains./According to BCPA, an organization of pesticide companies, 200 companies are the registered market players as members of the BCPA, however, there are other 200 companies who are not member of BCPA or even not registered with the Department of Agriculture Extension's Plant Protection Wing (regulates the pesticides business). These 400 companies import and market about 40000 tons of pesticides annually. The annual import cost stands nearly at 200 million USD. Among these 400 companies only 11 companies are supplying bio-pesticides./Government has pesticide testing advisory committee who conduct laboratory and field tests prior to approve import and marketing of any pesticides. Every month the Plant Protection Wing randomly tests pesticide to make sure that pesticides are not adulterated, however, if found to be tampered, pesticides of the batch are cancelled. For instance, in 2013-14, twelve types of pesticides were banned for their adulteration./A study of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) revealed that one-third of the pesticides used in producing vegetables and fruits in Bangladesh are substandard. These substandard pesticides are strengthening the resistance power of the pests. That's why, farmers have to apply excessive doses of pesticides (10-15 times the prescribed amount for producing fruits and 8-10 times for growing vegetables) which increases the farmers' production cost, deteriorates the environment manifold, and the crop may retain toxicity even after harvest and poses high risk to human health in long run. Exposure to or consumption of these crops may even lead to death. A decade ago, crop cultivators used to apply pesticides maximum two times a month, but now they are applying at least twice a week. Apart from vegetables and crops, pesticides are also being used in fruits. A study (in 2015) of Poribesh Bachao Andolon found that 40% of the tested fruits contain 3-20 times greater toxic substances (i.e. pesticides) than the tolerable limit of human body prescribed by WHO./Application of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), bio-pesticides/herbal pesticides, and vermi-compost, etc. is environment friendly and has proven evidence to reduce pest infestation and control the outbreak of diseases in crops. IPM is a kind of cultivation techniques which includes intercropping, multiple cropping, planting repellent crop in the periphery of the bed, placing biological pest control agent (e.g. pheromone trap) etc. Bio-pesticides/herbal pesticides are derived from plants, animals, bacteria etc., have similar qualities and effectiveness compared to chemical pesticides. Pheromone traps is a kind of device from where insect sex pheromone emits and allures the opposite sex to mate. Insects eventually trapped into the device where no reproduction of the pest occurs. Knowing its positive impacts and proven scientific evidence, IPM in agriculture had been introduced by the government of Bangladesh 3 decades ago. However, the Pesticide Act, 1985 did not mention the wording ""bio/herbal"", and that's why, agro companies did not produce IPM or bio pesticides. During last couple of years, IPM, bio-pesticides, etc. got a momentum (though in small scale). That's why, the use of chemical pesticides has declined which means the use of IPM and bio-pesticides increased. The use of chemical pesticides increased dramatically from 1997 to 2008 and then falls gradually. For instance, the use of chemical pesticides in 1997 was nearly 8000 tons, the use was 16000 tons in 2000, 20,000 tons in 2005-06, 48000 tons in 2008, which declined to 41600 tons in 2013 followed by 39250 tons in 2014. As government has formulated safe food act 2013, more and more pesticides companies are investing for switching from chemical pesticides to biological pesticides, which is a good move to implement the safe food act. For instance, Future Agro, Ispahani Agro Ltd, GME Agro, ACI Agrochemicals, Russell IPM and SNS Agro Tech have already invested in bio-pesticides and supplying to the farmers end./Fig. 1: Trends of chemical pesticides use in agriculture in Bangladesh/While visiting a crop field of Rezia Begum, a farmer of Beer Narayanpur village under Lebutala Union of Jessore sadar upazila, we have observed that she is using vermicompost and herbal pesticides namely; extract (oil and oil cake) of mehagoni seed, extract of neem, and several other Balainasok (herbal pesticides) to produce bean, brinjal, cauliflower, cabbage, tomato and other traditional vegetables. ""After receiving training from a local NGO (Ulashi Sreejony Sangha), we the 120 farmers in our village are now cultivating safe vegetables using bio-pesticides, IPM and vermicompost"", Rezia added. Many advanced farmers of Beer Narayanpur, Kodalia, Khajura villages of Lebutala union of Jessore districts are using seed extract of mahogany & neem, vermicompost, smoking by burning tyre and piercing as substitute of chemical pesticides. Abdul Matin, Managing Director of Future Agro, who poses patent of mahagoni oil (herbal pesticide), said herbal pesticide has no side effects on human health and on our environment, whereas, chemical pesticides can affect the nervous system and cause cancer as well as kills crops friendly insects and deteriorate our environment. Ulashi Sreejony Sangha's Executive Director Khondoker Azizul Haque Moni raised that government should provide subsidy to the producers of bio-pesticides and organic fertilizer (vermicompost) so that farmers can purchase these agro inputs with an affordable price./While pesticides affect everyone, it is the poor people that are disproportionately affected. As a part of a strategy to build the nation providing quality education to student and equip the communities with the knowledge and means to protect themselves against harmful effects of pesticides, German University Bangladesh has been educating the students through its several BSc programmes namely, Food Science & Engineering, Environment Protection Technology, and Biotechnology etc. that help the students to do research in such fields. Education and research in these fields are now a priority within the government's plans to promote safe food production and protect the environment and reduce the health hazards. German University Bangladesh is implementing a research project titled ""Response of Organic Fertilizer and Herbal Pesticides to Yield of Vegetables"" at the experimental field of it's permanent campus in Guptabrindaban, Sagordighi, Ghatail, Tangail. This university has well equipped laboratory and scientists namely; Prof. Dr. Saifullah Khandker, who has over 37 years of experience in the field of bio-pesticides, residue analysis, chororganic micro-contaminants with several departments, universities and organizations in Germany. So, the university is willing to conduct any physical, chemical and biological analysis related to pesticides and environmental forensics. Whatever, university is doing is just a beginning (going to establish analytic method). Once the method is established, university will go for field application./The government has endorsed the Balai Nashak (Pesticide) Act, 2017 suggesting tougher punitive actions against marketing, sale, packaging, storage and advertisement of adulterated pesticides. Under this Act, the company could be fined as high as Tk one lac and one year jail for first time offence and two lac and two years jail for repeating the identical offence. As per current Pesticide Act (Amendment) 2010, if a company found adulteration of pesticides, there will be two year imprisonment and cancellation of company's licence. In addition, Bangladesh has already passed national Food Safety Act 2013 and National Food Safety Policy is in the pipeline. If all these acts and policies implement properly, there will be a paradigm shift towards safe food production, marketing and consumption. Since its set up in 2015, Bangladesh Food Safety Authority has been working to establish a modern and technological food safety system in Bangladesh./Food safety and pesticides have become serious human health concern and synthetic pesticides are an environmental contaminant. Despite the harmful effects of synthetic pesticides to human health, environment and other living beings, we cannot replace the chemical pesticides by bio-pesticides, IPM and organic agriculture over night. Farmer's skill development training on the judicious use of pesticides and crop harvest time after spray of pesticides are one option to reduce health risks from harmful pesticides. Another option could be to introduce inter cropping and multiple cropping with pest repellent crop in the periphery of the crop field. Application of vermi-compost, bio-pesticides, herbal pesticides and indigenous techniques could be a good move from chemical pesticides. IPM is getting popularity among the farmers as they observed that IPM has a significant impact in controlling pest attack. Further research is required to explore the pest resistant crop varieties. Awareness raising activities need to be strengthened among the farmers, vendors and consumers./(Writers: Prof. Dr.-Ing.

Widespread pollution in the capital continues,"Dhaka, Jan. 9 -- UNABATED air, water, sound and other environmental pollution in and around the capital continues to shoot up at an alarming level. We have repeatedly penned to deter the rate of environmental and noise pollution of Dhaka. However, now more than the pollution --- the government's appalling indifference to address the issue worries us all --- particularly the city dwellers and the environmentalists./Development activities of government agencies without conservation measures have been quickening the pace of environmental degradation. Smoke and dust released by brick kilns made the capital one of the world's most polluted metropolis in 2017. Unrestrained vehicular smoke also contributed to this situation. To cut a long story short, in 2017 air pollution caused huge sufferings to the capital's inhabitants as all other pollutions rose phenomenally. We all know about the causes of pollution, yet government's authorities concerned appear evidently helpless. We are somewhat forced to ask, is the government waiting for an environmental disaster to struck and then respond to it?/Also the government's lack of commitment to address the issue is mainly responsible for the unabated degradation of the capital's environment. It becomes more obvious since a number of the tannery factories are still clandestinely operating at Hazaribagh. Department of Environment's Air Quality Index reports certified about the dangerous air quality more than a year ago. Yet little action was taken despite a number of laws being in place./According to more than 50 renowned physicians in the capital, numbers of Bronchitis, Asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients are fast increasing because of unimpeded extreme air pollution. Mostly six-month old children and countless old people have been identified as asthma patients while adults above 40 are becoming victims of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in short COPD. This has mainly happened due to inhaling smoky and polluted air. And now given this winter's cold, dry and foggy weather - the situation has worsened./As far as water pollution is concerned, dumping untreated sewer by DWASA is still polluting all the four rivers inside and surrounding Dhaka. And on the topic of noise pollution : Blaring sound from electronic horns, indiscriminate usage of mikes at public meetings, noise from construction activities, as well as factories are increasing sound pollution. Since August, there has been no compliance of the ban imposed by the High Court Division on the use of hydraulic horns and its directive on enforcement agencies to remove these horns within 48 hours./The point, however, we believe it is time the government sincerely admits its failure and includes the public and other national and international organisations to collectively combat the pollution menace. The city dwellers have been made sufferers and victims of all sorts of pollution for too long. Now it should end./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Greening economic growth,"Dhaka, Jan. 24 -- When I hear people talk of how we really need to focus on economic growth now and on cleaning up later, I cannot help thinking about the Mexican finance secretary's reaction in 2000 when he heard that environmental degradation was costing his country about nine per cent of gross domestic product per annum. I still remember him holding up one hand and pointing the other hand downwards and summing it up as (to paraphrase): you mean we are pushing the country up through our policies to promote growth with one hand, and pulling it down, through environmental degradation, with the other hand?/We talk a lot about sustainable development these days, but to their great credit, the Mexicans went into action in 2000. They initiated an internal discussion on what they needed to do to modernise their environmental sector and to integrate environment into economy-wide policies. They realised that the physical environment was principally affected by actions in other sectors, and so, among other steps, they developed a new programme focused on sustainable development, which placed accountability for environmental sustainability on (initially) 13 different federal sectoral entities, as well as state and local governments. The programme also emphasised the citizen's right to information that would allow one to know the state of the environment in which one lived and how one's welfare was affected. Mexico also established an environmental unit in the finance ministry with the particular mandate of designing and proposing fiscal instruments to support environmental policy implementation and promote behaviour change. The programme resulted in the Mexican government becoming much more agile at using a forum of multiple sectors to generate comprehensive solutions to environmental problems, gathering environmental data and sharing it with the public, as well as creating the right fiscal incentives to facilitate behavior change./Most finance ministers don't think that environment is their business at all, but increasingly we are discovering that it is. Why do I say this? Economic growth is defined in most textbooks as ""an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services, compared from one period of time to another"". The value (rather than the quantity) of the goods and services is calculated based on current market value, adjusted for inflation and compared across time periods. The unit of measurement is either gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP). So, in effect, economic growth is viewed as a proxy for an increase in aggregate productivity./Most economists will tell you that there are five main ways to generate long-term economic growth. The first is a discovery of new or better economic resources. The second is to create more jobs and to grow the labour force (Side note: women coming into the labour force, together with men, in many countries after the Second World War had a major positive effect on their economic growth. The Quaid clearly had this figured out. In a speech at Aligarh in 1944, he said ""Another very important matter which I want to impress upon you, is that no nation can rise to the height of glory, unless women are side by side with you.""). A third is to increase investment in infrastructure and physical capital. Fourth is to create superior technology or products. And fifth is through increasing skills of labourers, and so increasing their productivity./Most finance ministers don't think that environment is their business, but we are discovering that it is. What does all this have to do with environmental degradation? The latter affects citizens' health, causing early deaths in some cases./Indeed, according to the recent Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health's report, almost one in four premature deaths in Pakistan is attributed to pollution. In other cases, it causes illnesses that prevent people from reporting to work. Finally, in Pakistan, repeated bouts of malnutrition and environmental diseases (such as diarrhoea) in children under the age of two years results in reducing children's IQ levels and their educational and cognitive performance. All this taken together means that the country's productivity is lowered rather significantly./A case study on Pakistan in a World Bank book, Environmental Health and Child Survival, tried to estimate the cost of disease, using 2005 data, in terms of loss of productivity, early mortality and health costs associated with environmental factors, such as lack of clean water, inadequate sanitation, poor waste disposal, indoor and outdoor air pollution, vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, and problems arising from industrial chemicals and wastes. It also included malnutrition-mediated indirect effects of environmental risk factors. The estimated annual cost of direct and indirect impact of environmental risk factors for Pakistan came to almost 9pc of GDP per annum. In comparison, our annual GDP growth in 2005 was a high 7.7pc, according to World Bank data. Just think how much higher it could have been./It seems to me that a major input to achieving greater economic growth, that we can directly affect, are our people. Clearly, a healthy and educated people lead to both a better workforce and budding entrepreneurs, so that old businesses can be more productive but also new businesses can generate jobs and superior technologies and products. So many countries focus on improving the pillars of health and education as they move up the development ladder from low- to middle- to high-income economies. In Pakistan, as in most other developing countries, environmental degradation is the third pillar of that stool, as it directly affects both health and education outcomes. In addition, pollution results in unnecessary healthcare expenditures, an expensive option for a country with insufficient budget./Pakistan's former finance minister, Shahid Javed Burki, often mentions that today's Pakistan is a very young country, with more than 50pc of the population under the age of 25 years. By his calculations, in the cities, more than 75pc of the population are under the age of 25 years old. These youth, and their energy and enterprise, have the potential to raise Pakistan up. At the same time, it seems that we are holding them down, by lowering their productivity, because of poor air and water quality. Why can't we improve the physical environment and green our economic growth? After all, it will only make our youth even more productive and our country even richer. Let's not please ever say again that we have to grow first and clean up later./(The writer is an environmental sustainability and climate expert, and a former practice manager of the World Bank's Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

A green Dhaka is what matters not a dirty one,"Dhaka, Feb. 21 -- THE sufferings of city dwellers become never ending. They have to face waterlogging in the rainy season while it is impossible to move without taking dust and vehicles' emission through the nostrils in the dry season. A government report said the quantity of dust in Dhaka's air is three times higher than tolerable level. As a consequence, the residents are running the risk of various health problems./The Global Air Report 2017 said Dhaka ranked second on a global list of cities with worst air pollution, which claims 1,22,400 lives in Bangladesh a year. The World Health Organisation in its latest report also mentioned Dhaka as fourth dirtiest city in the world. The WHO identified 91 dirty cities of 25 countries. Of them, three cities are Dhaka, Narayanganj and Gazipur./Physicians warned that dusty air contains led, urea, parabean and some other poisonous materials which are very harmful. It's a matter of great concern that people are moving in such unhealthy condition finding no other way. As per the statistics, about 92 thousand people die every year in our country only due to air pollution. Of them, 13,100 die only in Dhaka. So, there is no need to elaborate breadth and length of the danger. Different types of pollution such as air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, land pollution and radioactive pollution are constantly contributing in various chronic diseases. Sometimes it becomes fatal./A local daily reported that dust-layers are now seen on trees, houses and other road-side establishments in different parts of the city. The tree-leaves become pale and gray, not green. The restaurants and eateries are also facing an unhygienic situation./Both the Dhaka North and South City Corporations earlier had announced to make the city green. They also announced about taking a bunch of plans in this regard. But we don't see any initiatives to protect the city dwellers from the pollution. Even the water therapy taken by the city corporations failed to bring any positive result./At present, Dhaka has turned into an unlivable city. We think, it becomes essential to protect the capital from air, sound, water and other pollutions in an emergency basis. The city corporations must steep up efforts, including water spraying and road cleansing, to make the city livable./Besides, the authorities must ensure implementation of environmental law. There is no way except taking stern action who are responsible for polluting the city. We want a green Dhaka, not a dirty one./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Growing threat to public health from air pollution,"Dhaka, March 13 -- NO wonder why Dhaka is the most polluted city in the world. We have repeatedly penned on the capital's increased air pollution, and now it has been learnt that airborne ultra-fine dust has been added in the list to pose a serious threat to public health in the capital./Heavy presence of ultrafine dusts also called particulate matters in the air is attributed to the capital's poor dust management system. However, people in the capital have no option but to breathe the heavily polluted air full of dusts./The Air Quality Index of Department of Environment's (DoE) Clean Air and Sustainable Environment Project has clearly stated a month ago - that the capital and the nearby industrial cities of Gazipur and Narayanganj are exposed to between 'extremely unhealthy' and 'very unhealthy' air conditions. The situation is turning worst when heath parishioners are warning since last year that children would be the worst victims of the capital's air pollution with intense dust pollution unless the authorities were sensitized to address the issue immediately. And what is more, brick-kilns, unplanned digging and construction works, pollution caused by heavy industries and unfit automobiles; which are routinely adding to air-pollution have been left at their will to continue polluting city air without respite./By now, the number of patients suffering from asthma, bronchitis and COPD diseases have increased many times at our public and private hospitals. Rather terrifyingly, there has been no credible authority to address the capital's air pollution and serious public health issue as of now. If the concerned government's authorities are unable to address the predicament - it's time they admit their failure and weaknesses other than sidetracking their responsibility. People can't be left highly vulnerable to heavily dust infected air. If necessary, they should immediately seek support from international organisations and firms to effectively deal with air pollution. Most importantly, it's time for public involvement to combat air pollution in our cities. Citizens forum must take the issue at various level to create pressure and force remedial measures to protect public health./The capital of nearly 20 million people now need quick protective measures instead of leaving them to helplessly read more horrifying revelations. Health authorities should immediately take these findings with due diligence, and, if necessary, seek international cooperation in taking urgent action. This alarming rise in health hazard should not continue to cause greater risk to public health./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"Dhaka world's third most polluted city, but who cares?","Dhaka, May 4 -- QUOTING World Health Organization (WHO), news media reported that seven million people suffer premature deaths due to household and outdoor air pollution every year around the globe. The South East Asian region accounts for 2.4 million of the seven million premature deaths while nine out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants. Among the cities of over 14 million residents, Dhaka has been ranked third in terms of the presence of fine particulate matter with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 micrometers (PM10) in the air. While the acceptable levels of PM10 in every cubic meter is 60, in Dhaka's air it is 147. It is 292 in Delhi and 284 in Cairo. Except for coordinated efforts, improvement of air quality is quite difficult against the soaring industrialization and unaware to pollution./The air toxins -- sulphate and black carbon -- are the greatest health risks as they can penetrate deep into the lungs or cardiovascular system. Non-communicable diseases are the leading causes of deaths globally and air pollution contributes significantly to NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and lung cancer. The WHO recognized that air pollution is a critical risk factor for NCDs, causing an estimated one-quarter (24 percent) of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25 percent from stroke, 43 percent from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29 percent from lung cancer./According to the WHO, Dhaka is ranked as one of the top mega-cities in the South East Asian region where residents are exposed to pollutant air particulates. More than 4,300 cities in 108 countries are now included in WHO's ambient air quality database, making this the world's most comprehensive database on ambient air pollution. Since 2016, more than 1,000 additional cities have been added to the database, which shows that more countries are measuring and taking action to reduce air pollution than ever before./Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalized people bear the brunt of its adverse impact. It is unacceptable that over three billion people -- most of them are women and children -- are still breathing deadly smoke every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes. If we don't take urgent action on air pollution, we will never come close to achieving sustainable development.

Fighting inequality on all fronts,"Dhaka, May 19 -- Inequality is increasing in Asia and the Pacific. Our region's remarkable economic success story belies a widening gap between rich and poor. A gap that's trapping people in poverty and, if not tackled urgently, could thwart our ambition to achieve sustainable development. This is the central challenge heads of state and government will be considering this week at the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). A strengthened regional approach to more sustainable, inclusive growth must be this Commission's outcome./It's imperative, because ESCAP's Sustainable Development Goal Progress Report shows that at the current rate of progress, Asia and the Pacific will fall short of achieving the UN's 2030 Agenda. There has been some welcome progress, including in some of the least developed countries of our region. Healthier lives are being led and wellbeing has increased. Poverty levels are declining, albeit too slowly. But only one SDG, focused on achieving quality education and lifelong learning, is on track to be met./In several critical areas, the region's heading in the wrong direction. Environmental stewardship has fallen seriously short. The health of our oceans has deteriorated since 2015. On land, our ecosystems' biodiversity is threatened. Forest conservation and the protection of natural habitats has weakened. Greenhouse gas emissions are still too high. But it's the widening inequalities during a period of robust growth that are particularly striking./Wealth has become increasingly concentrated. Inequalities have increased both within and between countries. Over thirty years, the Gini coefficient increased in four of our most populous countries, home to over 70 per cent of the region's population. Human, societal and economic costs are real. Had income inequality not increased over the past decade, close to 140 million more people could have been lifted out of poverty. More women would have had the opportunity to attend school and complete their secondary education. Access to healthcare, to basic sanitation or even bank accounts would have been denied to fewer citizens. Fewer people would have died from diseases caused by the fuels they cook with. Natural disasters would have wrought less havoc on the most vulnerable./The uncomfortable truth is that inequality runs deep in many parts of Asia and the Pacific. There's no silver bullet, no handy lever we can reach for to reduce it overnight. But an integrated, coordinated approach can over time return our economies and our societies to a sustainable footing. Recent ESCAP analysis provides recommendations on how to do just that./At their heart is a call to in invest in our people: to improve access to healthcare and education./Only a healthy population can study, work and become more prosperous. The universal basic healthcare schemes established by Bhutan and Thailand are success stories to build on. Expanding social protection to low income families through cash transfers can also help underpin a healthy society./Increasing investment in education is fundamental to both development and equality. Here the key to success is making secondary education genuinely accessible and affordable, including for those living in rural areas. Where universal access has been achieved, the focus must be on improving quality. This means upskilling teachers and improving curricula, and tailoring education to future labour markets and new technologies./Equipping people to exploit frontier technologies is becoming more important by the minute. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a rapidly expanding sector. It can quicken the pace of development. But it is also creating a digital divide which must be bridged. So investment in ICT infrastructure is key, to support innovative technologies and ensure no one is left behind. Put simply, we need better broadband access across our region. Geography can't determine opportunity./This is also true when it comes to tackling climate change, disasters and environmental degradation. We know these hazards are pushing people back into poverty and can entrench inequality. In response, we need investment to help people to adapt in the region's disaster hotspots: targeted policies to mitigate the impacts of environmental degradation on those most vulnerable, particularly air pollution. Better urban planning, regular school health check-ups in poorer neighborhoods, and legislation guaranteeing the right to a clean, safe and healthy environment into constitutions should be part of our response./The robust growth Asia and the Pacific continues to enjoy, gives us an opportunity to take decisive action across all these areas. But for this to happen, fiscal policy needs to be adjusted. More effective taxations systems would increase the tax take, and better governance would increase people's willingness to contribute. Public expenditure could then be made more efficient and progressive, the proceeds of growth shared more widely, and inequalities reduced./My hope is that leaders will seize the moment, strengthen our commitment to fighting inequality on all fronts and put us back on track to sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Mediterranean diet may curb air pollution's effect on health,"Dhaka, June 1 -- Consuming Mediterranean diet rich in antioxidants could reduce the adverse effects of air pollution on health./A diet which includes antioxidants present in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, olive oils, fish and poultry over red meat and processed foods, can weaken the adverse effects of exposure to high levels of air pollution, says researchers./The study showed that people who least adhered to these antioxidant-rich foods had 17 per cent higher risk of cardiovascular disease related deaths for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter increase in long-term average PM2.5 exposure, compared to 5 per cent in those who consumed such diet./""Given the benefits we found of a diet high in antioxidants, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that particle air pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion adversely affects health by inducing oxidative stress and inflammation,"" said George Thurston from Department of Environmental Medicine at the New York University./The study, presented at the American Thoracic Society 2018 International Conference in San Diego, included data from 548,699 participants for over a period of 17 years./They were linked to estimates of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) based on census tract information./Deaths from all causes increased by 5 per cent for every 10 parts per billion (ppb) increase in long-term average NO2 exposure in those with least consumption of the diet as compared to 2 per cent among the people with higher consumption./""However the diet did not appear to protect against the harmful effects of long-term exposure to O3.the ozone effect was not significantly blunted by a Mediterranean diet, so ozone apparently affects cardiac health through a different mechanism,"" said Thurston./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Law to prevent noise pollution,"Dhaka, June 1 -- Environment pollution has reached an unbearable level. In many ways our environment is being polluted. One of the main causes of environmental pollution is noise pollution. At present, the condition of noise pollution in Dhaka city is very alarming. It seems to be a problem, but because of our unconsciousness we often say that it cannot be resolved. But these problems are made by humans. If we adopt a little awareness then it is possible to control this problem. Noise pollution also affects heart, blood circulation, food canal and stomach besides causing some mental complications, according to psychiatrists and cardiologists. People of different ages also suffer from various diseases because of this pollution in Dhaka city. Sometimes intolerable sound pollution may cause death to ischemic heart patients./Sound control is one of the constraints of environmental pollution. At home, in the office, on the streets and even in recreation, we are being subjected to noise pollution in a number of ways. Worldwide, people have the right to prevent environmental pollution. In Bangladesh, the issue of prevention of environmental pollution is also a matter of concern. Many people are working for the development of public awareness and environmental development in order to preserve the environment. The media will have to move forward in this regard./According to World Health Organisation (WHO), the safe limit of sound is 45 decibels. Sound over 65 decibels creates heart diseases and over 90 decibels of sound leads to ulcer, hearing problems and changes of nerve system and that of over 120 decibels creates pain in the ears and destroys hearing ability gradually./According to a study of BUET on noise pollution, 45 decibels of sound was around the city in 1985 which was tolerable, but in 1990 it rose to 55, in 2000 it was 75 and in 2013 it rose to 110 decibels to some of the areas. On average, 105 decibels of sound is created in Dhaka city everyday which is alarming and a permanent health hazard to the city dwellers. The study also says high-pitched sound of hydraulic horns of buses, trucks, private cars and even motorcycles, cassette players in the market and buses, loud speakers and roadside mills and factories severely affect passengers and passers-by. Noise pollution around Dhaka city is increasing day by day due to growing number of public private vehicles./Recently the use of polythene shopping bags was announced by the government's positive steps for the promotion of public interest and environment. Which has had significant impact in social life? Private organizations and media have come forward and have played an important role in making it effective. At present, air pollution-prevention of water pollution and a forestation issues are discussed, but only the limited constraints of discussion or thinking about noise pollution./There is no clear idea among the public about noise pollution due to severe health problems. Although several non-governmental organizations have some work on this, it is very little compared to the problem. There is no law in our country to control noise pollution; traffic laws are not being properly observed. Work for a Better Bangladesh is working to control the control of noise pollution including the control of tobacco control, air pollution, and limiting the use of polythene bags./Our recommendations have been presented in this report by taking the public opinion about some of the fundamental issues related to noise pollution and controlling it, which we believe is important for increasing public awareness and determining government policies. Those organizations or individuals, who are interested in working with noise pollution, hope they will benefit from this report. We believe that the guidance given by the increase in public awareness and unified action efforts of government non-governmental organizations will help to take sound pollution to the level of control./We can easily follow the methods of preventing pollution:/If we are a little aware of ourselves, we can protect ourselves from being polluted; Give the volume of the TV and music system used at home. Do not play car horns unusually unnecessarily. Do not use loudspeakers. Playing the band in the wedding procession, stop-cracking crackers. Talk about complying with all the noise pollution laws./Use organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers. Use paper instead of polythene. Use cotton and jute instead of polyester. Arrange the polythene bag properly. Add more trees and plants. Regarding compliance with all laws related to chemical pollution. Electronic pollution in the whole world has been horrific. Extraction of pollutants from digital or electronics is used to throw away or use. Sometimes the virus is infected by this pollution./That's a great challenge to save a new computer or digital gazette. To avoid this, different companies employ other companies to remove such contaminated waste. In India, only a few companies are working to stop digital pollution. It is seen, Mumbai, after Bangalore, the most electronic pollution is in Calcutta. But hopefully the awareness of this pollution is increasing./Sound pollution across the country including the capital has now reached a critical level. Therefore, it is now referred to as 'word terrorism', expressing solidarity with the demand of Environmental Organizations, 13-point demand, including sound pollution prevention law, Bastian. Because noise pollution is now life-threatening terrorism; It is important to protect our environment and public health in deep crisis./At present, the level of noise pollutants from different parts of Dhaka city ranges from 80 decibels to 110 decibels. In some places it even more./This level is growing with time. In the vehicle, the use of high level noise sound, heavy hydraulic horn use, construction noise, brick-kiln machine, besides yellowing, marriage, fertility, birthdays, New Year, high sound effects, and high sound sounds are being terrorized. As a result, due to noise pollution, the hearing loss of the people is decreasing, sleeping at night, heartburn and new cardiovascular disease, decreasing performance and severe harm to students' education. So this word terrorism must be stopped at any price./In the end, I want to say that the implementation of the Sound Pollution Control Act, the law enforcement agencies form a mobile team, identify the sound terrorists, take legal action, stop construction of any kind of noise making work including construction of residential areas at night, ensure that there is no higher horn in the car, unnecessary horn If it is possible to train and alert the drivers about not using them. Everybody to work together to reduce the noise level so that in the long run people can eradicate noise pollution from the country once for all with awareness of all is more important./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Accreditation : Ensuring a safer business world,"Dhaka, June 10 -- The theme of World Accreditation Day, 2018 focuses on how accreditation delivers a safer world. 9 June marks World Accreditation Day, a global initiative, jointly established by International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), to raise awareness of the importance of accreditation./What are the issues? There are more than 2.78 million deaths per year as a result of occupational accidents or work-related diseases. Approximately 125 million people in the world are exposed to asbestos - in the workplace, resulting in an estimate of several thousand deaths from asbestos-related lung cancer each year. One in eight of total global deaths, around 7 million people annually die as a result of air pollution exposure and there were 1.25 million recorded road traffic deaths globally in 2013 published in reports of World Health Organization./There are also 374 million non-fatal work-related injuries and illnesses every year, many of these resulting in extended absences from work. Apart from the significant human cost, the economic impact of poor occupational safety and health practices is estimated to be 3.94% of global Gross Domestic Product (or about US$2.8 trillion, in direct and indirect costs of injuries and diseases) every year according to a report of International Labor Organization./Recent problems with tainted food, drugs, electronic devices and other consumer products have made clear that more needs to be done to protect consumers. Injury statistics indicate that design problems, defects and inadequate safety information for consumer products are associated with many injuries./In wider society, we expect that products we buy, from electrical goods to children's toys, our environment specially water without contaminants, air free from harmful pollutants./Large scale infrastructure projects such as road, bridges and public transportation systems are safe to use. Our daily sources of energy, such as gas or electricity, should also be accessible without risk of injury or harm. Basic services such as drinking water and medical tests should be relied upon./What is the role of accreditation?/Completed projects, raw materials, products, services, management systems, and/or personnel can be evaluated against a standard, code of practice, or regulatory requirement by testing and calibration laboratories, inspection bodies and certification bodies (collectively known as conformity assessment bodies). Conformity assessment bodies are used to check that products and services are safe to use. Accreditation is the independent evaluation of these conformity assessment bodies against recognized standards to carry out specific activities to ensure their integrity, impartiality and competence./Through the application of national and international standards, government departments, businesses and wider society can have confidence in the calibration and test results, inspection reports and certifications provided./Accreditation bodies are established to ensure that conformity assessment bodies are subject to oversight by a competent body. Internationally recognized accreditation bodies, which have been evaluated by peers as competent, sign international arrangements that enhance the acceptance of products and services across borders, thereby creating a global infrastructure to support health and safety related processes./These arrangements are managed by IAF, covering accreditation of certification bodies and verification/ validation bodies, and ILAC, in the areas of testing, calibration and inspection body accreditation. This system ensures that the accreditations issued by different accreditation bodies is consistent across the globe. As a result, products and services tested, inspected or certified once under the IAF and ILAC umbrella, can be accepted everywhere with equal confidence./What benefit does accreditation provide for Government &#38; Regulators? The role of Government and Regulatory bodies is to ensure that businesses provide a safe working environment. They can set policy or technical requirements for products or services that are placed in the market and rely on accredited conformity assessment bodies to verify compliance with those requirements. Accreditation can be used to support health and safety policy in different ways. For example, markets can 'self-regulate' through businesses voluntarily agreeing to meet set standards./This can be applied where there is a need to reassure markets on the conduct of business while minimizing risks, but where there is no desire by Government for regulatory intervention./Alternatively, businesses that demonstrate compliance with standards through accreditation may earn 'recognition' from regulators who trust them to comply with their legal obligations. This enables regulators to reduce oversight and inspection visits, saving tax payers' money. This 'Earned recognition' can achieve the same or better outcomes as regulation, but on a voluntary basis. In this way, the cost of regulation is reduced for both the government and the regulated business./International accreditation arrangements provide Regulators with a robust and credible framework to accept accredited test results, inspection reports and certifications from overseas, with an equivalent level of confidence as if they were carried out in the local economy. We can examine case studies of accredited services around the world./Dubai has beaches, hotel pools, residential and sports complexes, and water parks that are under the supervision of thousands of lifeguards. The Public Health &#38; Safety Department of Dubai Municipality uses the accredited certification of lifeguards as a measure to create a safer experience for tourists./The scheme uses ISO 17024 and covers the certification of pool lifeguards, shallow water lifeguards and beach lifeguards. The scheme assesses lifeguards for water rescue and basic first aid skills. After successfully completing examinations and certification requirements, the lifeguards receive a certificate and card from an accredited provider./Accredited certification is used by the Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic to assess the professional competence of those that use electronic tools or carry out operations using electronic equipment. Accredited certification is required through the public tender procurement process as per the rules and requirements stated in the Regulation No. 9/2011 Coll. Accreditation against the requirements of ISO/IEC 17065 (product certification) is used for assessment of professional competence to ensure that electronic tools are used competently and therefore, safely./For Businesses:/Businesses can demonstrate compliance with best practice by implementing a health and safety management system in order to: improve reputation and increase opportunities to gain new business, lminimise risks of downtime through accidents, ldemonstrate commitment with legal obligations, achieve potential cost savings from public liability insurance premiums and retain and attract staff./Build Safe Northern Ireland requires OHSAS 18001 in construction tenders. contractors, consultants (and their supply chains) seeking to tender for public sector works contracts must be able to satisfy the Government Construction Client that they have the resources and competence to manage health and safety. Businesses with OHSAS 18001 accredited certification are, therefore, well placed to be eligible to tender for work. it is a de facto 'license' to trade as key purchasers expect. Accreditation provides market differentiation and objective proof that products are safe and meet specification. Accreditation is increasingly recognized in tender documents and for overseas trade. In some cases, it can result in reduced levies or audits./On 12th March, ISO published ISO 45001, Occupational health and safety management systems - Requirements that provide a framework for organizations to improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks and create better and safer working conditions. Accredited certification to this standard can help businesses improve its ability to respond to regulatory compliance issues, reduce disruption costs, and reduce the cost of insurance premiums./For Employees:/Working for a company that has implemented an occupational health and safety management standard sends a clear signal to employees and stakeholders that they view employees' health and safety as a priority within the organization. It will identify risks and ensure a safe working environment./For Citizens:/Public confidence can be gained from goods or services that are accompanied by an accredited certificate of conformity. .All adventure tourism operators throughout New Zealand require safety certification under the New Zealand Adventure Activities Certification Scheme. Providers need to undergo and pass a safety audit that certifies safety processes meet the safety audit standards./Supporting protection from terrorism. The UK Government has introduced a surveillance camera code of practice that contains 12 guiding principles to ensure and demonstrate to communities that cameras are only ever used proportionately, transparently and effectively by relevant authorities (police, police crime commissioners, local authorities and non-regular police forces). Accredited Third party certification enables organizations to clearly demonstrate that they comply with the surveillance camera code of practice. Certification indicates best practice and compliance with the code./Accreditation provides a globally-recognized tool to not only assess and control risks of the internal operation of businesses but also the products and services they place in market. In this way, Regulators, purchasers and employees can demonstrate confidence that accreditation delivers a safer world./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

What are we breathing in!,"Dhaka, June 13 -- Professor Dr. Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder and Kazima Khatun/The air of our surroundings is not as pure as it needs to be. Everyday air is getting polluted by human activities such as industrial production, vehicles emission, and brick-making kilns and also from natural phenomenon as like- blowing dust particles. But the human activities influence the pollution mostly as environmental scientists said in 1999 that in the high amount of lead in the atmosphere from gasoline, ceramics, paints, batteries etc. are factors in air pollution. Bangladesh is a developing country where environmental pollution becomes a burning issue. Among the pollutions, air pollution becomes the priority throughout the world. Where Bangladesh is ranked as the third position in the world's most air-polluted city according to WHO (World Health Organization)./In Bangladesh, it is a country of rapid growth in population and in development. Along with the increasing population and development, there are many factors which are increasing the risk of polluted air. As there is doing much-developing work and for increased population building more buildings so the brick-making kilns are producing not only bricks but air pollutants also. Most of these kilns use coal and wood as their sources of energy, resulting in the emission of particulate matter, oxides of sulfur, and volatile organic compounds, which are very toxic to our environment as well as to our health. The people who are working in those kilns and the surrounding areas face many chronic diseases which are caused by cancer also./Additionally, vehicles emission is one of the major sources of air pollutants in the city. The vehicles get its energy from burning of fossil fuel such as petrol, diesel, and alternative-fuel engines and batteries, consequences of emissions from this are CO2, Carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and unburnt hydrocarbons are gases, are generally invisible and other particular matters. Low-quality vehicles emit this pollutant more than modern technological vehicles. Moreover used rubber wheels of vehicles are burnt, which produce black carbon and toxic gases./This vehicle's emission gases are threats to human health as like heart diseases, respiratory problems, while long-term exposure may affect lung function and increase the response to allergens in sensitive people and in the chronic stage, this disease becomes cancer. This pollutant is also threat to our environment as all of them are GHGs./On the other side, industrial emission and technological emissions are also responsible for our air pollution. In the production process, prime sources of energy are fossil fuel and electricity. From the burning of this fuel, many types of greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds and other particles released into the atmosphere. Beside it, those gases are very poisonous to living things and especially to human health which not only affects those occupational people but local people also./This is just the outdoor air pollutions but there is also indoor air pollution occurs./There are some sources in our houses from where the indoor air contaminates with pollutants. Indoor air pollution includes the household places, commercial buildings, and others buildings. From the burner or stove in our houses, smoking inside the places, spoiled organic wastes, using pesticides to kill insects in our houses etc. are the factors affecting the indoor air pollution. Burning inside of the houses, it releases the co2 which remains a long time inside it./From the spoiled organic wastes, methane gases release inside the house and using pesticides increases the aerosols. These impacts on our health as a problem in skin, brain, nerves system and respiratory system, which in long term it can be caused to cancer./The Dhaka city and along with other metropolitan city's air pollution is responsible for a great health impact. From the emission of those gases, volatile compounds and other particles, the air of the city getting poisonous and turning into inhabitable place. In the pollutants, Nitrogen dioxide causes respiratory infection./Carbon monoxide reduces delivery of oxygen into the human body, creates a severe headache and decreases visual perception and manual dexterity./The ingested lead is deposited in bones and tissues causing brain and kidney damages. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally air pollution caused 4.2 million deaths and indoor pollution caused 3.8 million deaths in 2016 and More than 37,000 Bangladeshis die annually from diseases related to this pollution./Air pollution has become a very concerning issue to have a better and healthy life./It's caused to a lot of diseases and threats to the environment. Dhaka is already realized to how poisoning the life is getting and the degradation of environment occurring from the latest database of WHO in world air pollution. Our government should take some serious and effective steps regarding air pollution as like improving traffic system, banned all the low-quality vehicle, funding more on air quality assessment, creating a national air quality monitoring center and a sustainable development to our country./Accordingly, the writers are associated with teaching and research in Department of Environmental Science at Stamford University Bangladesh./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Indoor air pollution causing serious respiratory diseases,"Dhaka, July 11 -- Indoor air pollution levels are reported to be higher with biomass fuel, and a number of respiratory diseases in children are associated with pollution from burning such fuel. However, little is known about the situation in developing countries. The aim of the study was to compare indoor air pollution levels and prevalence of symptoms in children between biomass- and fossil-fuel-using households in different seasons in Bangladesh. More than 4.5m affected, says UN group, while tests suggest children's shorter height increases exposure on busy roads. More than 4.5 million children in the UK are growing up in areas with toxic levels of air pollution, the UN children's organisation Unicef has warned. /Tests suggesting that children walking along busy roads are exposed to a third more air pollution than adults, as their shorter height places them close to passing car exhausts, were also released recently. The Unicef report found that almost a third of under-18s live in places with unsafe levels of small particulate pollution, including 1.6 million under-fives and 270,000 babies. The analysis is based on the World Health Organization limit set in 2005, which is 60% lower than the legal limit in England and Wales. The UK government has lost three times in the high court for failing to deal with illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution and is now being taken to Europe's highest court. On Wednesday, MPs from four select committees said serious concerns remained over the government's commitment to reducing the impact of air pollution on public health. The latest government action plan sets a goal to halve the number of people living in areas above WHO particulate limits by 2025. Amy Gibbs, at Unicef UK, said: The findings force us to face a shocking reality about the acute impact on children's health. Worryingly, one third of our children could be filling their lungs with toxic air that puts them at risk of serious, long-term health conditions./Honestly, I had thought and assumed and hoped that with LEDs we were turning the corner. Light pollution is on the rise in countries like the UK, US and Germany./The world is experiencing a marked increase in light pollution at night, a study has found, with the changes potentially playing havoc with our sleeping patterns and stopping us seeing stars. Scientists were surprised to see that the adoption of energy efficient bulbs across the developed world nonetheless coincided with an increase in light pollution and could actually be masking a bigger problem. From 2012 to 2016, the surface area of the planet that is artificially lit at nighttime grew by more than 2 per cent each year. Scientists now say that people's sleep could be impaired as a result, which would be detrimental to our health and wellbeing. Late Love Island star Sophie Gradon posted heartbreaking tweet days before her death.Why Qatar will be even worse than Russia for fans travelling to the World Cup. Women rugby players' kiss prompts outpouring of solidarity after criticism: The ecosystem is also at risk, with the changes impacting the migration and reproduction patterns of birds, fish, amphibians, insects and bats. And if the trend continues, seeing the Milky Way or stars in the night sky from inside towns and cities could soon become a thing of the past. The findings were made by GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences using data from a NASA satellite, and published in the journal of Science Advances. The scientists concluded that light pollution was on the rise in some of the world's brightest nations, like the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Italy. The measurements coincide with the outdoor switch to energy-efficient and cost-saving light-emitting diodes, or LEDs. Christopher Kyba of the GFZ team said that the findings shattered the long-held notion that more energy efficient lighting would decrease usage on a global scale./Asia, Africa and South America, for the most part, saw a surge in artificial night lighting. The team expected to see a decrease in brightness in wealthy areas like the UK, US and Germany where energy-efficient LEDs had been rolled out, because the bluer light they emit cannot be picked up by the satellite's light sensor. Instead, we see countries like the US staying the same and the UK and Germany becoming increasingly bright, Many people are using light at night without really thinking about the cost,"" he said. Air pollution kills 15,000 Bangladeshi each year, according to a World Bank report. In 1995, the average ozone concentration in Mexico City was about 0.15 parts per million, 10 times the natural atmospheric concentration and twice the maximum permitted in Japan or the United States. The density of lead in the air of Dhaka is 463 nanograms per cubic metre, which is 10 times more than the acceptable standard and several times more than the above-mentioned cities, even than the most polluted city of Mexico. The large number of children, street children, local streetwalkers, and rickshaw pullers in Dhaka City are at particular risk from this air pollution. Young children are mostly exposed to cadmium through inhalation of smoke and contaminated soils and dust from industrial emissions and sewage sludge. In 1999 environmental scientists said that the high lead in the environment from gasoline, paints, ceramics, batteries, etc. are factors in the increased risk of polluted air. Another study revealed that blood lead levels were very high and at toxic levels in children presenting with psychomotor delay and behavioral problems, indicating lead poisoning. According to this report, there are two major sources of air pollution in Bangladesh, vehicular emissions, and industrial emissions./These are mainly concentrated in the cities. There are also many brick-making kilns operated seasonally, mainly in dry season all over Bangladesh. Most of these kilns use coal and wood as their prime sources of energy, resulting in the emission of particulate matter, oxides of sulfur, and volatile organic compounds. Additionally used rubber wheels of vehicles are burnt, which produce black carbon and toxic gases./These are harmful for health.In order to accommodate the growing population, the construction of high-rise buildings is growing rapidly. Along with these buildings, the numbers of slums are also growing. The tremendous force of population has made it almost unfeasible to maintain a clean environment in the capital city of Dhaka./It's unacceptable that the most vulnerable members of society, who contribute the least to air pollution, are the ones suffering most from its effects, she said. The government must accept this is a children's health crisis and offer targeted action and funding to reduce their exposure. The tests on children's exposure next to busy roads are relevant to the millions of children walk to school each day, with experts are advising that where practical parents choose quieter routes, away from traffic, as this can cut pollution exposure by almost two-thirds./Other scientists have suggested parents use covers on their prams and buggies during the school run to protect their infants from air pollution. Half of all children walk to school, but being driven to school by car instead can actually result in greater pollution exposure for those inside the vehicle, previous research has shown. Prof Jonathan Grigg, at Queen Mary University of London, said: My research has shown that exposure of young children to higher amounts of air pollution from traffic has a major impact on their lungs./Although parents can reduce this impact by walking on less polluted roads, the UK government must take further steps to reduce toxic emissions on all roads. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said the school run tests were troubling: This a further demonstration of why we need to take strong action now to improve air quality. He said the government was acting, but added: ""By taking simple steps, like leaving the car at home for the school run, we can work together to reduce air pollution and protect our health. Lack of funding for local authorities to tackle air pollution is a key issue, the select committee MPs said. The car industry is partly responsible for our toxic streets, and seeing the government resist calls for an industry-financed Clean Air Fund is incomprehensible, said Neil Parish MP, chair of the environment committee. Bangladesh is one of the least developed nations in the world. Since it's beginning (1971), there has been some growth in the industrial sector. Industries are mainly concentrated in major urban metropolitan areas such as Dhaka and Rajshahi; seaport cities such as Chittagong and Khulna; the inland port city Narayanganj; and other divisional towns. Obviously, the air pollution problem is more severe in these areas. Apart from unplanned industrial development in these areas, the severity of the pollution is increased mainly due to exhausts from two-stroke engine and diesel-run vehicles. The newspaper, New Nation, published in 2010, mentioned that the pollution-vomiting vehicles (20 to 25 years old vehicles) are again on the high roads. Many owners have changed bodies of their old buses and also tinted those but the engines are the same. These unfit busses are creating traffic jam and making the air polluted by blowing up black smoke, causing serious health hazards to the commuters./Recently, the government has decided to launch a drive in Dhaka city to remove 25-year-old buses, minibuses and trucks from the street as one of the measures to ease the nagging traffic congestion according to a 2010 article from Daily Star, a Bangladeshi newspaper. The New Age newspaper mentioned in a 2010 article that this drive, mainly aimed at solving traffic jam and checking environment pollution, would certainlyhelp to reduce air pollution in the city, too. More than eight million children live with illegal levels of air pollution, figures show. Around three-fifths of youngsters live in areas where limits have been breached. Each year 40,000 premature deaths in the UK are said to occur due to rising contamination. More than eight million children live in areas of the UK with illegal levels of air pollution, figures suggest./Some 8.3 million under-18s live in local authority areas where levels of harmful pollutant nitrogen dioxide exceeded legal limits in 2015, according to analysis by the Labour Party of figures from the House of Commons Library. Around three-fifths of youngsters were living in areas across the UK where pollution limits were breached in 2015, the estimates show. All children in London face illegal pollution levels, as the air quality limits were exceeded in all boroughs in the capital./Outside London, Yorkshire and the Humber was the worst affected region, with an estimated 83 per cent of youngsters living in areas with illegal pollution, followed by the North East, North West and West Midlands./The Department of Environment (DOE) recently signed an agreement with the Norwegian Institute of Air Research (NILU), under which Bangladesh will receive a $1.3 million U.S. dollars grant for air quality and research./The grant will be utilized for aid quality monitoring across the country, a first ever study on the country's air quality impact on health, inventorying the sectoral emission and green house gases (GHGs), air quality modeling and development of an air quality forecasting system. It is the city's moral duty to protect its people from any kind of health related problems. Paying no attention to these issues results in grief and death. What we foresee, 10 years from now, is that our young children won't be able to smell what their mothers are cooking./Rather, they will be inhaling and exhaling only polluted air. One has to remember that the arrogant roar of an engine can easily drown the crying of a child. The level of lead poisoning is a major factor responsible for decreasing the mental abilities of the children as a result of which the country will have acute shortage of intellectuals in the long run. The only way to enhance the ethical accountability of public administration is the Bangladesh government should immediately translate its National Environmental Policy and Transport Policy into action. It was suggested that the measured indoor air pollution did not directly result in symptoms among children. Other factors may be involved./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Proper disposal of medical waste to prevent diseases underscored,"Dhaka, July 24 -- Health experts at a seminar have urged the healthcare givers and institutions concerned to engage in proper management and disposal of medical waste to prevent the spread of communicable diseases./They came up with the call at the seminar on 'Medical Waste Management' jointly organised by Rangpur City Corporation (RpCC) and PRISM Bangladesh Foundation on Sunday at Begum Rokeya auditorium in Rangpur. Mayor of Rangpur Mostafizar Rahman Mostafa attended the seminar as the chief guest with Chief Executive Officer of RpCC Abu Saleh Md Musa Jongi in the chair./Divisional Director (Health) Dr Md Mostafizur Rahman, Civil Surgeon Dr Abu Md Zakirul Islam, President of Rangpur unit of Bangladesh Medical Association Dr Delwar Hossain, Deputy Director of the Department of Environment Mesbabul Alam and Superintending Engineer of RpCC Amdad Hossain addressed as special guests./Executive Director of PRISM Bangladesh Foundation Khondker Anisur Rahman delivered welcome speech in the seminar./Adviser of PRISM Bangladesh Foundation Dr Masum A Patwary delivered presentation on 'Collection and final management of harmful medical waste of healthcare organisations situated in RpCC area' as the main resource person. The experts said about 20 percent of healthcare waste could be dangerous to cause infection and parasitic diseases which are preventable and treatable and remaining as the primary causes of death worldwide.

Steps needed to save Dhaka city from worst air pollution,"Dhaka, Aug. 25 -- Media report that Dhaka is the third worst polluted city with 14 million and above population in the world next to Delhi and Cairo with serious impact on healthy living of the people and life threatening diseases is serious public health threat. The WHO report released recently said seven million people suffer premature deaths due to household and outdoor air pollution every year around the globe. The South East Asian region accounts for 2.4 million of the seven million premature deaths while nine out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants. The biggest challenge is how to keep the pollution level down, improve the quality of air and make our cities livable./The air toxins - sulphate and black carbon - are the greatest health risks as they can penetrate deep into the lungs or cardiovascular system. Non-communicable diseases are the leading causes of deaths globally and air pollution contributes significantly to NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and lung cancer. The WHO recognized that air pollution is a critical risk factor for NCDs, causing an estimated one-quarter (24 percent) of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25 percent from stroke, 43 percent from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29 percent from lung cancer./According to the WHO, Dhaka is ranked as one of the top mega-cities in the South East Asian region where residents are exposed to pollutant air particulates. More than 4,300 cities in 108 countries are now included in WHO's ambient air quality database, making this the world's most comprehensive database on ambient air pollution. Since 2016, more than 1,000 additional cities have been added to the database, which shows that more countries are measuring and taking action to reduce air pollution than ever before./Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalized people bear the brunt of its adverse impact. It is unacceptable that over three billion people -- most of them are women and children -- are still breathing deadly smoke every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes. If we don't take urgent action to cut air pollution, we will never come close to achieving sustainable development. The deadly air pollution will kill more and more people if we fail to address it now./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"Environ pollution taking toll on lives, growth","Dhaka, Sept. 17 -- Bangladesh has become a worst victim of environmental pollution that resulting in 3.4 percent loss of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and higher the number of untimely deaths and disability adjusted lives in cities every year, a World Bank (WB) report says./The WB report said the loss of GDP and lives (foregone labour output due to untimely deaths) is creating obstacles towards achieving the targeted status of Upper-Middle-Income Nation./The WB report noted that, in the global canvas, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by pollution and environmental risks. Across Bangladesh, 28 percent of all deaths are from diseases caused by pollution, much higher than 16 percent of global average./""Urban environmental pollution is already imposing a significant cost on Bangladesh's economy,"" the WB said in the report styled ""Enhancing Opportunities for Clean and Resilient Growth in Urban Bangladesh: Country Environmental Analysis 2018"". The report was released in Dhaka on Sunday (September 16)./""In 2015, the economic impact was estimated at US$ 6.52 billion in urban Bangladesh, which are equivalent to 3.4 percent of the national GDP of that year. Of the amount, estimated loss of US$ 1.44 billion was in Dhaka alone. In the same year, the total annual number of deaths was estimated at 80,000 and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were 2.6 million attributable to air pollution, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene, arsenic in drinking water and occupational pollutants,"" it said./Goldman Environmental Prize winner and Chief Executive of Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association, Syeda Rizwana Hasan said brick fields continuing operations around urban areas, big infrastructural works going on without safety coverage, occupational pollutants, impure water supply and weak sanitation at both the households and public infrastructures at cities are causing to the huge loss./""Wetlands are filled and greeneries in and around cities disappeared. River waters also polluted seriously. Amid such a circumstances, how we would prevent the loss of lives and economy?,"" Syeda Rizwana told The New Nation on Sunday afternoon./According to WB report, the economic cost of this mortality in terms of foregone labor output estimated at US$1.40billion in all urban areas of Bangladesh, of which US$ 310 million in Dhaka alone./""In tandem with its economic development, Bangladesh has been increasingly urbanizing-led by the massive growth of Dhaka. In this capital city, population grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent and is expected to increase from 28 percent of Bangladesh's total population to 40 percent by 2025.

Dangers of environment pollution,"Dhaka, Oct. 11 -- The air quality in Bangladesh has been declining over the years at an alarming rate. It worsens significantly during the winter in Dhaka. So much so, that five among the top 10 causes of death in Bangladesh is related to air pollution, according to the World Health Organization. The government has identified brick kilns, construction works as well as vehicles run by fuels with high levels of sulfur as the major sources of air pollution. /Dhaka topped the list of US Air Quality Index (AQI) for having the worst air pollution in the world. Data obtained from smartphone application AirVisual shows the user real-time air pollution index of any city across the globe. A real-time map of the US AQI, found on web portals aqicn.org and waqi.info, also supported the data found in the application.The index terms the air quality of Dhaka extremely unhealthy, as the city consistently ranks between 301 and 500. There is no denying that the quality of Dhaka's air is quite terrible,"" At least a thousand brick kilns operate in and around the city during winter. It is one of the reasons behind the bad air quality here, The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the AQI to report air quality. This AQI is divided into six categories, indicating increasing levels of health concern. An AQI value of over 300 represents hazardous air quality and below 50 indicates that the air is good. The index is based on five criteria pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide./Last year, a study report of World Health Organization claims that although particulate pollution levels are quite high in the capital, it is 44th among the cities it monitors, in terms of fine particle (PM2.5) pollution. In terms of PM10, or coarse dust pollution, it ranks 71st./The increases of fossil fuel, growth of population and the excessive amount of environmental pollution have turned the world into an inhabitable place. In the consequences of these alarming situations environmental movement has been started throughout the world. The environment movement has been started centering how the earth can be saved from the environment pollution. The several environment experts have led and is continuously leading to this movement in diversified ways like Rachol Luis Carson,at the end of 1950, wrote a book named ""Silent Spring"" showing the environmental destructive role of the insecticides and this helped to raise the consciousness of the American mass on the environmental issues and accelerated the environment movement.In 1998 they founded an organization named Bangladesh Environment Network (BEN). In the January of 2000 an international conference on the environment of Bangladesh (ICBEN) was organized with the initiative of the PRS, BEN and other environmental organizations.The aim of this conference was to unite all the environmental working organizations./The environment has been wielding the whole world life and its ecosystem from the time immemorial. Untoward environment destroys the living world. On the other hand, the utile environment ameliorates the community and civilization. From the primitive era the human being have been competiting with the environmental setbacks for their survival and in this way, to march forward. That's why; a world watchword has been lilting that there is no substitute to the patronage of the environmental equipoise./From an occult espial it becomes clear that various natural disasters are continuously increasing due to the environmental imbalances. Bangladesh is not out of this misfortune rather her circs is more minatory. The rate of forest land is only 6% where 25% forest land is necessary for the environmental balance of a country. The rate of environment pollution is also high and as a result, various problems related to environmental imbalance are increasing day by day in Bangladesh. So, we need a strong and wide spread environment movement. The environment movement was hatched in the decenniad of 80 in Bangladesh. This has got momentum in the decade of 90. Many environment pioneers were united under the organization ParibashRakkhaShopoth (PRS). The people of Bangladesh living in the abroad have also united to protect the environment This case has played a significant role in the further flourishment of environment vibrancy./Subsequently in different cases the right to a pollution free environment has been declared as a fundamental right. In this way, the environmental vibrancy has got more impetus through the movements like Save Environment Save Rivers, and Work for Better Bangladesh. Some positive initiatives have been taken up to now with the hard efforts of the environmental organizations and members of the civil society. Introduction of the lead free gasoline, banning of two strokes vehicles and polythene products, passing of the water reservoirs protection Act and Brick lin Establishment Act, formation of commission on rivers are the results of some successful attempts of the environment movement.In 2010 in the third galaxy of ICBEN the environment sibbed program The Calling for Dhaka-2010 was sheltered. In this proclamation an analysis of all the basic reasons of the environmental problems and recommendations on how to solve those were prepared. The government and the administration have to play the key role in the decision making processes./So the program was held to influence the governmental environmental policies. Besides in order to inspire the people from all the sections different political parties, professionals, social, cultural and sport organizations were summoned to be connected with this vital movement. Lately, we have eyed the vigorous role of different environmental pressure groups like National Oil, Gas and Electricity Protection Committee, National Sundarbans Protection Committee and other collateral bodies against the Rampal issue./These organizations have drawn up the bad consequences of the establishment of the Rampal Electric Plant at a place nearly 14 kilometers away (within the environmental critical zone) from the Sundarbans, the World largest mangrove forest. They are trying to influence the government to change their decision. They have conducted various researches and experiments on the compatibility of establishing of such a big electric plant near a world heritage and found that if this project is implemented then the whole bio diversities, rivers and the unique features of the mangrove forest will be vanished with the passage of time and our overall environmental harmony will be spoiled./Though there has been an incessant assiduity to carry on the environment movement the environmental degradation of the country is not emasculating at a satisfactory rate. The water pollution and grabbing of water land are not stopped and thus the marshy lands are dying gradually. Industrial pollution, air pollution and sound pollution are increasing./According to the draft roadmap, import of diesel containing over 500ppm sulfur content will not be allowed from this year and the imported fuel will go through the distribution network without blending. In addition, the import of diesel with 350ppm or less sulfur content will only be allowed from 2020. The ceiling of 50ppm sulfur content for imported diesel will go into effect by 2023./Currently, the upper limit of sulfur content in diesel fuel in Bangladesh is 2500ppm.High sulfur content in diesel is partly responsible for particulate matter which is a major pollutant from diesel vehicles. According to WHO, PM10 and PM2.5 can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer. Among the top 10 causes of death in Bangladesh, five of them-lung cancer, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke-are related to air pollution. According to the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH), nearly seven million people in Bangladesh suffer from asthma-over half of them children./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dust pollution in winter,"Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- Bangladesh is the favorite playground of nature decorated with six seasons. Researchers have started to think about new pollution as well as the new season,a kind of pollution is dust pollution. Dust pollution means the presence of particles (e.g. PM2.5 to PM10 microgram) in the air which degrades the air quality and has a harmful effect on human health. These particles vary greatly in size, composition, and origin, and may be harmful. Particulate matter may be in the form of fly ash, soot, dust, fog, fumes etc. Considering the diameter of particles, they can be classified as PM10 (coarse and fine particles), PM2.5 (fine particles). Both of them PM2.5 is more harmful then PM10.In the dry season, the amount of dust pollution increases more than the other times. Day by day the amount of dust include air pollution in the city has been increasing./The air quality, particularly in Dhaka has undoubtedly been getting worse. According to World Bank's Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) 2018 report, air pollution lead to deaths of 46,000 peoplein yearly in Bangladesh. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Cancer Agency listed PM2.5as ""G -1 carcinogen"". Hence Dust pollution is not only responsible for health hazards, but also responsible for our environment and financial loss./The Ministry of Environment, Forestryand climate changewith the assistance of the World Bank has undertaken the Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) project to address the issue of urban air pollution through demonstration intervening and providing technical assistance for capacity building and reform in key polluting sectors./They have 11 total Continuous Air Quality monitoring stations (CAMS)which are available across the country to ensure the quality of air. Among them three stations we located in Dhaka, two in Chattagram, one for Rajshahi and Khulna, Gazipur, Narayanganj, Sylhet and Barisal respectively. Through these stations, air pollutants (PM2.5, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, etc.) are measured in these cities. Department of Environment has prepared air quality index./According to the air quality index (AQI), if AQI less than 50, it is ""green or healthy"", when it range from51 to 100, represent ""medium air"", which is not harmful to humans,as well when it is between 101 to 150, then the air is called ""warning air"", which is mildly harmful to humans. However, air quality index of air whenever crosses151, represents harmful to human health. If the level of AQI is 150 to 200, then it is ""unhealthy"". It is ""very unhealthy"" in the range of 201 to 300 and the level of 301 to 500 is marked as ""extremely unhealthy"" or hazardous air. At present AQI level of Dhaka has 309, which is in extreme ""unhealthy"" position. According to the Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) project, the value of AQI is leading to a higher place from October to February of theyear. However, from March to August, average AQI is in normal stage./At the beginning of the dry season, dust was mixed in the air due to unplanned development activities work like gas, electricity, water, drainage and roads repair and renovation. After cleaning the drain, the waste is kept on the side of the road, which is responsible for the dust-pollution./In addition, due to the presence of the pathogen in the drain is responsible for unhealthy air. Building materials such as (bricks, sand, earth, cement, brick chips), which are usedfor Construction purposes, are transported openly from one place to another, they have a contribution to dust pollution. According to the information of the Department of Environment, 58% brick kilnsare the main sourceofair pollution in Dhaka. 4,500 bricks kilns are situated around the Dhaka./Burning of Extra wood coal, wood pulses, furnace oils in the brick kilns is also release dust, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxides which are polluting the air of Dhaka. Apart from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), various types of potential matter, ash, dust, carbon, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. Moreover, Pb contaminated dust mixed with air fromproducts such as the lead battery, petrol, diesel, hair dryer, powder color, etc. Apart from color, seal and wood-industry, formaldehyde is also deterioratingair quality./The charcoal and the tiny particles from the burning wood also mixed with the air. Harmful microbes mixed with the dust which is the resultant product of decomposition of garbage. Again, we are burning that dirtrubbish at the road side which is againleading to dust pollution./Due to the dust pollution; temporary and chronic health problems appear. One of the most difficult problems is irritation of the eyes, coughing, sneezing, high fever, asthma, and headache. Dust mixed germs &#38; heavy metals cause diseases such as lung cancer, asthma, bronchitis, tuberculosis, kidney damage, high blood pressure, birth defects etc. It has also effects on mental health, heart attack, liver problems, pregnant women, dermatitis and pneumonia etc. Coarse and fine particles also adversely affect the cognitive function of children by changing the brain structure./Stamford University Bangladesh's Department of Environmental Science and Work for Better Bangladesh jointly conducted a research on the samples collected from 12 points locations in Dhaka. The results showed that the amount of harmful dust specially PM2.5 in air of Dhaka is more than the ideal standard. This department also conducted a study on lead pollution in the Dhanmondi area and found the considerable amount of lead in the sample station. This study found the Pb contamination the dust for all samples ranges from 11.40 ppm to 1000ppm./The Bangladesh government has made laws to prevent air pollution. According to Bangladesh EnvironmentConservation Act 1995, sub-section (1) of section 6- Restrictions vehicles emitting smoke injurious to environment-(1) A vehicle emitting smoke or gas injurious to health or environment shall not be operated nor shall such vehicles be switched on except for the purpose of test operation for stopping the emission of such smoke or gas. For the first offense of violating the provisions of Sub-section (1) of section 6; In case of the first offense, a fine not exceeding taka 5(five) thousand; in case of the second offense, a fine not exceeding taka 10 (ten) thousand./In case of subsequent offense, an imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or a fine not exceeding taka 10 (ten) thousand or both. Law to prevent pollution of brick kiln- If a person violates the provisions of Section 4, the brick field produces brick in brick kilns without obtaining a license from the district administrator, then he is not punished with imprisonment for more than one year (one year) or more than one (one) Shall be punished with fine which may extend to one thousand taka, or with both. The government is working to create Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution./Everyone needs to be aware to reduce air pollution. The educational campaign shall be run. It is very important to provide information, education and motivation to the public about the overall air pollution. Must have plan and act appropriately. The existing law must be applied accordingly, if necessary, new legislation shall be enacted. Modern technology and low sulfur coal should be used during brick making. Construction materials should be covered./Roads should be kept clean, all the garbage should be removed at certain places, increasing the use of CNG gas instead of diesel and van the use of un-fitness vehicles. Everyone is interested in using public transport without using a personal car. Take effective steps to make the use of catalytic converters in brickfield and modernization of vehicles./The threat to child health needs to be prepared, implemented, and monitored by our plans to protect against this air pollution and the health complications arising from this. Consistent action plans shall be taken at national and local levels. At the same time, the successful application of the administrative system is absolutely necessary. The media's important role in this regard is must. With wide publicity by highlighting the negative aspects of air pollution, it has to come forward to solve this problem./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Increase cancer treatment facilities in country,"Dhaka, Dec. 2 -- APART from relevant facilities, the number of specialist doctors for cancer treatment in the country is inadequate compared to the rising number of patients. Many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer every year due to food adulteration, environment pollution, unhealthy lifestyle, obesity, drug addiction, deterioration of microenvironment and other reasons. There are only 145 cancer specialists in 20 hospitals, including 11 private hospitals in Bangladesh against 15 lakh cancer patients while more than one die of cancer each year./The inadequate treatment facilities force many emergency patients to stay in queue for months to receive different types of therapy, life-saving treatment, available in hospitals that eventually become deadly. Experts fear that the number of cancer patients will rise further in the coming years, which needs immediate attention of the government and entrepreneurs to set up specialized cancer hospitals, and national awareness building about safe food, pollution and healthy lifestyle./At the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICRH), where cancer treatment cost is comparatively low but inadequate therapy machines deprive many to get treatment in time. According to the WHO, Bangladesh should have at least 160 radiotherapy centres considering its population, but unfortunately, the country has only 20 such centres. Besides, the government must have sufficient data regarding cancer patients across the country as the data delinquency puts obstacles on planning. The main obstacle of cancer treatment is that a majority of the patients seek treatment when their cancer is at the advanced stage when they need radiotherapy. At the stage of emergency treatment necessity, a full course of radiotherapy costs between Tk 15,000 and Tk 30,000 while the lavish private hospitals offer the same course at the cost of Tk 2-3 lakh. Most of the cancer patients are from lower and lower-middle income groups./People's health is vital for national development. It's the need of time to develop necessary cancer treatment centre with high-edge equipment, trained healthcare assistants, and physicians. Making treatment available would not ease the problem alone rather stopping the cause of cancer is more important. Water and Air pollution, contamination in food and lifestyle are basic aspects that need to be improved to resist cancer and other major diseases like heart, respiratory, diabetes and kidney complications./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

122 Illegal brick kilns in Mymensingh,"Mymensingh, Feb. 16 -- Some 122 out of 260 brickfields in Mymensingh district have no clearance from the Department of Environment, it is alleged/Some 142 illegal brick kilns are running defying ban at Mymensingh District. They are using wood and tires for burning. These brick fields have been developed by some illegal traders through the syndicate without environmental slip. Apart from the rules after manage local administration these bricks kiln burn woods, old tires and plastic products. As the increase in air pollution levels and decreasing environment friendly trees day by day. As a result residents of this area are at risk of health. As well as the decrease in the crop land, the yield has decreased the fruit tree plants. Regardless of any rules and regulations Grow up these black smoke in the brick field the production of cropland and the yield of the fruit tree have decreased in the alarming rate. Some brick field is being run on cropland, with low-height chimney and burning firewood instead of coal at Upazilas village in Mymensingh Districts. In a circular in May 2012, the Directorate of Environment (DoE) prohibited operation of traditional brick kilns with iron sheet chimney or fixed chimney./The Brick Manufacturing and Brick Kilns Establishment (Control) Act-2013 has been passed to establish control over brick manufacturing and brick kiln establishments for the interest of conservation and development of environment and biodiversity./Barishal Correspondent adds: A mobile court led by Mozammel Haque Chowdhury, Administrative magistrate of Barishal District Administration on Wednesday fined Tk 7.5 lakhs against four brick kilns of Babuganj upazila for violating Environmental Act./Law enforcers and fire service forces accompanied the mobile court during the drive in different areas under Babuganj upazila of the district.Mozammel Huque Chowdhury, magistrate of the court, said the fined amounts and brick kilns were Abbasuddin owner of Fine Bricks (Tk 2 lakhs), Anowar Hossain, manager of Master Bricks (Tk 1 lakh), Anisur Rahman, manager of Salam Bricks( Tk 2 lakhs) and Milton Akon, owner of Akon Bricks( Tk 2.5 lakhs)./Magistrate of the mobile court explained that the brick kilns were fined for violating different sections of environment and other related acts including height and pattern of chimney, use of fuel, polluting environment, operating near agricultural and housing areas etc./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

People need respite from polluted air,"Dhaka, March 7 -- IT'S really miraculous that people of Bangladesh are still living despite gradual decay of their vitality inhaling the most polluted air in the world. The 2018 World Air Quality Report has directly blamed that country's air pollution issue was ignored deliberately by the authorities concerned. Air pollution will cause around seven million premature deaths globally next year along with a major economic impact, where Dhaka will have to bear a lion share. Though brick kilns and vehicles run on fuel with higher level of sulfur have been identified as the major sources of air pollution, the government has a very little interference, which in turn becomes susceptible./The air quality of Bangladesh is the worst while Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Bahrain are following. The quality of air in Iceland, Finland and Australia are among the healthiest on the earth. Delhi is the most polluted capital city while Dhaka is second in that category followed by Kabul, Manama and Ulaanbaatar of Mongolia. Ambient airborne particles, measure up to 2.5 microns in size, is the measuring value as the particle can penetrate deep into the human respiratory system and from there to the entire body, causing a wide range of short- and long-term health effects./The air pollution is the silent but prolific killer of humanity. It is one of a variety of manmade environmental disasters that are currently taking place all over the world. The air pollution seriously affects the respiratory tract and causes irritation, headache, asthma, high blood pressure, heart ailments and even cancer. Particularly in the case of Dhaka, living in this city is not really like living in the crater of an active volcano but it is like living on a sleeping volcano which may erupt any time and engulf everything. But neither the government nor the residents are fully realising what crisis is emerging for them./The government has taken various steps to reduce emission of harmful smoke from brick kilns, including promoting cement blocks for construction work. Besides, a law had enacted in 2018 to make brick kilns environment friendly. But it did a little help. The pollution issue should be high on the agenda of the government as well as political parties./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Over one lakh die every yr due to air pollution,"Dhaka, March 15 -- Various diseases, including respiratory problems, are increasing in the country because of air pollution. When more than one lakh people die every year in air pollution, the number of people suffering from respiratory diseases has reached the crore. Experts say that the control of the disease can be possible only by preventing the rapid identification of the victims, as well as prevention of air pollution./According to the Bangladesh Asthma Association, the number of asthma or respiratory patients in the country is about 10 million, where about 2.5 to three lakh people are being added every year. Experts say that air pollution is the biggest cause of asthma or respiratory. Although 38 percents of total pollution are created by kilns, no effective action is taken to stop it. In addition to the unpredictable industrialization, toxic smoke emitted from slow vehicles, is the cause of respiratory diseases. Climate experts say brickfields should be reduced./Industries should always have industrial belts. There will be measures to reduce pollution levels. It is possible to control this disease very quickly by rapid identification. However, urgent calls for creating medical opportunities at the marginal level can solve the problem./Poribesh Bachaon Andolon (Poba) and Civil Rights Protection Forum claim that 90 percent of the residents of Dhaka are now victims of air pollution. Apart from this, 40 percent of the inhabitants suffer from respiratory diseases. This pollution is increasing every day./According to a World Bank Research Report titled 'Bangladesh Environmental Analysis-2018' said, 80 thousand people die every year due to environmental pollution. In one year, 28 percent of the deaths happen due to environmental pollution in Bangladesh, which is 12 percent more than global pollution death rate (16) each year./In February 2018, a report released by the US-based research organization Health Effects Institute and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said that due to air pollution, 1.22 lakh 400 hundred people are dying in Bangladesh every year./However, there is a statistical gap. But both of them/refer to the horrifying picture of environment or air pollution in the country. According to them, the biggest part of environmental pollution in Bangladesh is air pollution. Dust is the major part of air pollution./National Institute of Chest Disease and hospital doctors said that air pollution became a major threat to public health in Dhaka. Especially due to the rapid increase in respiratory and cardiovascular disease, various chemical pollutants mixed with the air are blamed. In this case, the level of pollution during the traffic congestion in roads is the most harmful phase. The harmful components of the air do not appear in the eyes, but can enter the human body, causing respiratory problems, pneumonia, eye problems, colds, coughs, tuberculosis, heart disease, asthma and lung cancer./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

1.23 lakh killed in BD by air pollution,"Dhaka, April 5 -- The indoor and outdoor air pollution killed about 1.23 lakh people in Bangladesh in 2017, a study said./The study warned also that the life of a South Asian child would be shortened on average by 30 months due to the pollution./Two US based institutes Health Effects Institute (HEI) and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on Wednesday released a detailed report on quality of the global air with title, ""State of Global Air-2019""./Another study revealed recently that made Bangladesh's capital most worst in the Air Quality Index (AQI)./Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as 'very unhealthy'. If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as 'hazardous'./The State of Global Air 2019, which used data from the period 1990 to 2017, estimated that if air pollution levels met the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, life expectancy in Bangladesh would have seen the highest expected gain of nearly 1.3 years./The report revealed that South Asia was the most polluted area in the world adding that worldwide air pollution was responsible for more deaths than many better-known risk factors such as/malnutrition, alcohol abuse and physical inactivity. Air quality in Asia remained stubbornly poor, especially in Bangladesh the entire population has remained exposed to PM2.5 levels above 35 ?g/m3 since 1990, according to the third annual State of Global Air report./The study found that China and India together were responsible for over half of the total global attributable deaths, with each country witnessing over 1.2 million deaths from all air pollution in 2017. China has made initial progress, beginning to achieve air-pollution decline./Overall, long-term exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution contributed to nearly five million deaths from stroke, diabetes, heart attack, lung cancer, and chronic lung disease in 2017./Out of these, three million deaths are directly attributed to PM2.5, half of which are from India and China together. The South Asian region - Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan - led the world as the most polluted, with over 1.5 million air-pollution related deaths according to the report./In 2017, air pollution was the fifth highest mortality risk factor globally and was associated with loss of 147 million years of healthy life, the report added./""In 2017, annual PM2.5 exposures were highest in South Asia, where Nepal [100 ?g/m3], India [91?g/m3], Bangladesh [61 ?g/m3], and Pakistan [58 ?g/m3] had the highest exposures,"" it said./The study found that 3.6 billion people (47% of the global population) were exposed to household air pollution from the use of solid fuels for cooking in 2017. These exposures were most common in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East Asia./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"Reduce air pollution, save future generation","Dhaka, April 17 -- Nowadays air pollution is a great concern. According to the Global State Air 2018, indoor and outdoor air pollution lead to 1.23 lakh deaths in Bangladesh in 2017. Here also report says that the life of South Asian children will be shortened than by 30 months on average if they will grow up in the current high levels of air pollution. This report considered air pollution as the fifth risk factor for mortality worldwide. It also shows that less developed countries suffer PM2.5 exposures that are four to five times more developed countries./This report estimated that air pollution contributes to almost 5 million deaths globally, nearly 1 in every 10 in 2017. Air pollution (ambient PM2.5, household, and ozone) is also estimated to have contributed to about 4.9 million deaths (8.7% of all deaths globally), 147 million years of healthy life lost in 2017. This report is further mentioned that more than 90% of the world's population lives in areas exceeding the annual air quality guideline set by the World Health Organization (WHO)./Other findings, PM2.5 pollution contribute to nearly 3million early deaths in 2017. Scientific evidence supports a relationship between exposure and ambient PM2.5 to ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lower respiratory infections. Air pollution contributes to both non-communicable and communicable disease. WHO reported that 21% deaths due to pneumonia, 20% from stroke, 34% from ischemic heart disease, and 19% from (COPD) 7% from lung cancer./In 2017, exposure to PM2.5 was the third leading risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and disability-adjusted life year (DALYs). Household air pollution remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with a particularly heavy toll in less-developed countries and the study found that 3.6 billion people were to household air pollution from the use of solid fuels for cooking in 2017./This report represents life expectancy at birth. Air pollution collectively reduces life expectancy by 1 year and 8 months on average worldwide, where life expectancy by 1 year and 7 months in South Asia. High exposures to ambient PM2.5 are a major contributes to loss of life expectancy around the world./On the other side, WHO reported that due to indoor and outdoor air pollution every year 570,000 children under 5 years die from respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. According to the WHO Global Ambient Air Quality Database-2018, 97% of cities are in low- and middle- income countries where the place people live in exceeds WHO air quality limit./Reference to Cancer Fact and Figures-2018, published by the American Cancer Society, the number of patients suffering from respiratory cancer is approximately 25.33 lacks and people died for respiratory cancers are approximately 15,877. According to the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital, in 2018 about 269 people have died from cancer disease in our country, among these 54 people died from lung cancer./According to the UNICEF study, 30 million children live in the presence of polluted air in the world, of which 22 million live in South Asia. International Private Environmental Organization Green Peace estimates that due to air pollution, 70 million people worldwide are likely to die next year./Some sources are continuously emitting PM2.5. Brick kilns are major source of PM2.5 in Bangladesh. Various development activities, burning of fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas), unplanned gas, electricity, water, drainage and roads activities are released PM2.5./In 2018, The Department of Environmental Sciences of Stamford University Bangladesh conducted a study to detect outdoor airborne mycoflora. Four air samples for microbial pollution were collected from different area of Dhaka University. There are total of 2,681 fungal colonies found in the sample. In this study, 8 fungal genera have been recorded viz- Alternaria, Aspergillus, Curvularia, Fusarium, Penicillium, Rhizopus and Trichoderma. Aspergillus was found in the highest frequency in the present investigation, among the identified fungal genera. Those mycoflora have a great impact on human health and plant./The Bangladesh government has made laws to prevent air pollution. According to Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995, sub-section (1) of section 6- Restrictions vehicles emitting smoke injurious to environment-(1) A vehicle emitting smoke or gas injurious to health or environment shall not be operated nor shall such vehicles be switched on except for the purpose of test operation for stopping the emission of such smoke or gas. For the first offense of violating the provisions of Sub-Section (1) of section 6, the fine is not exceeding Taka 5 (five) thousand. In case of the second offense, a fine is not exceeding Taka 10 (ten) thousand. In case of subsequent offense, an imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or a fine not exceeding Taka 10 (ten) thousand or both./Law to prevent pollution of brick kiln- If a person violates the provisions of Section 4, the brick field produces brick in brick kilns without obtaining a license from the district administrator, then he is not punished with imprisonment for more than one year (one year) or more than one (one). Shall be punished with fine which may extend to one thousand taka, or with both. The government is working to formulate Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution./Our effective role will be to prevent air pollution. First, we have to identify the sources of contamination and reduce pollution. It is necessary to apply conventional law appropriately. If necessary, new legislation should be implemented. Children, old and pregnant women are more vulnerable to air pollution. Awareness is the key to preventing air pollution. Air pollution great threatens child health. To protect children from this, we need to formulate, implement and monitor our plans. Action should be taken at the national and local level against air pollution. An educational campaign should be run in print and electronic media./(Professor Dr. Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder, Chairman, Department of Environmental Science, Stamford University Bangladesh, e-mail: /<a href=""mailto:kamrul_sub@hotmail.com"">kamrul_sub@hotmail.com</a>/)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Health risks of Rohingyas,"Dhaka, July 13 -- A significant number of Rohingyas are facing serious health risks due to lack of limited access to healthcare services in the crammed camps of Cox's Bazar. Currently, it has become a challenge to address their health needs, said a survey report./Owing to a large number of Rohingya refugees and their congested living condition in the camps, the world's largest refugee settlements, there has been an overwhelming increase in their health hazards./The report said, refugees require nine million liters of safe water daily. In addition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services are reaching only 30 per cent of the Rohingyas./The survey conducted by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) with support from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) showed that air and water pollution is the main cause of Rohingya's health risks./Istiakh Ahmed, coordinator of the study, said, extensively polluted air and water creates serious health risks for the refugees. ""It's imperative to act swiftly to cut the risk factors.""/There have been reports of outbreak of measles in the camps and the number of affected cases is 419. The risks of waterborne and other infectious diseases are still exceptionally high due to their unhygienic living conditions, it said./It said, diphtheria outbreak has resulted in 38 deaths and more than 5,800 suspected cases of the disease have been reported. There have also been reports on respiratory problems and skin diseases among the refugees./Among 91,556 adolescent girls and women, 54,633 are pregnant or lactating mothers. Lactating mothers (9.2pc of total refugees) and pregnant women (4.9pc of the total population) have been identified as the two highest numbers of vulnerable groups within the Rohingya Refugees./An estimated 42,000 pregnant women, 72,000 lactating mothers and 240,000 under-five children need health assistance. Majority of women are giving births at home, and only 22pc of births occur in health facilities. 2,592 lactating women and 1,145 pregnant women have been admitted to different health center for malnutrition treatment./In coordination with international organisations some local organisations are working to curve the health problems of the Rohingyas./Friendship, a country based non-governmental organization, operates various programmes to facilitate the Rohingya's health issues./Basic Clinics, Friendship Comprehensive Maternity Clinic and Birthing Center, Trained Birth Attendants (TBA), Pediatric Clinic, Health Outreach, Health, Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (SRH), Gender Based Violence (GBV) Counseling and Mental Health and Psycho Social Support (MHPSS), Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) support are the main programme in health issue, said Runa Khan, Founder and Executive Director of Friendship./The study report said, air quality analysis in the refugee camps showed that the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was higher both indoors and outdoors in the camps than Bangladesh standard./During the survey, 61 per cent of the respondents were being treated for medical conditions like wheezing, tightness of chest, rapid breathing, eczema, high fever, skin irritation, shortness of breath and burning or irritated eyes./The ICCCAD analysis found all surface water samples and a significant (highest 62 percent) number of groundwater samples tested contain coliforms, a group of bacteria. One of its possible reasons could be the proximity of tube wells to latrines./Additionally, manganese was detected in 48 per cent tested samples at concentrations higher than the Bangladesh standard, which may impede cognitive development in children./Survey results showed that diseases and illnesses such as diarrhoea, coughing and skin diseases are major concerns in the camp area. Since 38 per cent of the surveyed water supply lines are passing through the drainage system, chances of spread of diseases from waste are higher./The report says only 17 percent respondents throw their waste in a public bin while others do it in the open space./The ICCCAD recommended creating environmental awareness within the Rohingyas and local communities, engaging them in its protection, setting up a proper drainage system and sewage treatment facilities and ensuring solid waste management./Dr Azharul Islam Khan, head of hospital at ICDDR,B, said he has no idea of air pollution in Rohingya camps but water and sanitation status is now better than the initial days of the Rohingya influx in 2017./""Also, massive cholera vaccine and health campaigns were undertaken. These measures helped prevent outbreak of diseases,"" he told this correspondent./The ICDDR,B doctor, however, expressed worries that shortage of funding may be an issue in terms of promoting health campaigns-something that the international community needs to look at./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The Anthropocene Epoch,"Dhaka, July 16 -- Humans dominate Earth. Since 1950, globalisation and business tools have come handy with increased usage. The temperature is increasing causing an increase in Greenhouse Effect which is the trapping of the sun's warmth in a planet's lower atmosphere, due to the greater transparency of the atmosphere to visible radiation from the sun than to infrared radiation emitted from the planet's surface. Biodiversity which is the variety of plant and animal life in the world or in a particular habitat, a high level of which is usually considered to be important and desirable is decreasing. By 2030, the world population is expected to become 9 billion according to United Nations./2000 years ago Hippocrates created the link between surroundings and disease in ancient Greece. Waiora in Maori with 'wai' being water and 'ora' being life, the health of human and other animals and natural systems are emergent properties./Anthropocene is the period of time during which human activities have had an environmental impact on the Earth regarded as constituting a distinct geological age. Climate Change, effects of multiple environmental changes on food availability and quality like El Nino, emerging disease like SARS and zika, unsustainable cities, future fish requirements, reducing food waste, forest conservation, and family planning are all because of Anthropocene. Climate Change reduces food growth which leads to increased stunting. Lower monitoring of air pollution also contributes to climate change./Climate change in Bangladesh is a pressing issue. According to National Geographic, Bangladesh is one the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change. Bangladesh being located on the Tropic of Cancer receives fairly direct radiation throughout the year and maintains relatively high temperature./El Nino is a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean with a global impact on weather patterns. The cycle begins when warm water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean shifts eastward along the equator toward the Coast of South America. El Nino is the reason for hotter summers with lower rainfall mostly seen recently in Bangladesh. El Nino effect on Bangladeshi agriculture is strong. The situation is linked to water shortages, degradation of soil and disruption in planting of crops. When rainfall is low, less crops are produced. This causes a negative effect on food security. Droughts during El Nino can cause an adverse effect on biodiversity, wildlife and livelihoods. Reduced rainfall can cause a decrease in supply of water. Water users, either in districts or individuals that rely on ground water, may see a degradation in water quality as lack of groundwater recharge from reduced rainfall can lead to increased saltwater intrusion. The impacts of El Nino will also be felt in the energy sector as hydropower production may decline due to water availability in reservoirs and rivers. If hot conditions persist, energy use for cooling can put additional demands on energy grids./Bangladesh is a high risk country for emerging infectious diseases because of its high population density and poverty. Emerging infectious diseases like SARS and zika can threaten all people throughout the world. It should be taken into consideration whether the country is fully prepared to address outbreaks./In 2007, humanity passed a historic milestone. For the first time ever, more people lived in urban environments - namely, cities - than in rural areas. Since then, the trend has only continued, as the global urban population has grown year over year, to 54 percent of all people today./Cities like Dhaka everywhere, are not sustainable. The average city-dweller consumes many more resources, and emits far more greenhouse gas, than their rural compatriots, anywhere in the world. If more people move into unsustainable cities, resource consumption will increase, meaning urbaniSation could lead to near certain disaster, not just with global climate, but also with regards to air pollution and water./Global consumption of fish has doubled since 1973 according to WorldFish Centre, and the developing world has been responsible for nearly all of this growth. Countries with rapid population growth, rapid income growth, and urbaniSation tend to have the greatest increases in consumption of animal products, including fish products, and the developing world has experienced all three trends with Bangladesh not falling behind./According to a baseline study, the people in Bangladesh are wasting about 5.5% of the total procured food. Of the total wastage, 3% is being made during procurement and preparation stage, 1.4% during serving, and another 1.1% from the plates. As Bangladesh is one of the most densely and highly populated countries in the world, there will be a problem of food scarcity if the problem of wastage is not addressed./Bangladesh is gradually succeeding in forest conservation through continuous changes in related policies, laws and regulations. The country needs to put more focus in maintaining forests as this will help to address the greenhouse effect./Bangladesh has made remarkable achievements in reducing the average number of children per woman of reproductive age (total fertility rate - TFR). This figure was above seven in the early 1970s, but, according to World Bank, it is now merely 2.2. Bangladesh currently has the lowest TFR in South Asia. As Bangladesh is a very populous country with an increasing young adult population, care should be taken for decreased childbirths for sustained survival in the Anthropocene Epoch./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

How climate change affects children's health,"Dhaka, July 19 -- We know that climate change is making heat waves hotter and longer, and more heat means more kids aren't able to go outside and play. This is a critical issue because the number one health challenge facing our children today is obesity. More heat also makes more ozone, an air pollutant that's harmful to our lungs, and especially the lungs of kids with asthma./Ozone can also harm pregnant women and their growing fetuses as air pollution is associated with early birth and small babies, which can lead to lifelong health problems./With climate change, we're also seeing more heavy downpours and droughts. Heat plus droughts can cause wildfires, and wildfires produce severe air pollution that worsens asthma attacks and can promote respiratory infections, including pneumonia./Kids face unique health burdens because of climate change, according to the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP), including ""the broad effects of weather disasters, exacerbated allergic and asthmatic diseases, food and water insecurity, and heat-related deaths.""/Pediatricians are already seeing the effects of climate change in their patients. Because of climate change, winters are shorter, making outdoor allergy seasons longer and warmer. This worsens allergies and increases the chances of asthma symptoms./Children are especially vulnerable to both the immediate and long-term impacts of climate-fueled natural disasters. The imminent threat to children from extreme weather is clear: They're smaller and less physically capable than adults. They spend more time outside, increasing their exposure to dangerously high heat and more. They often rely on/others for decision-making and care, leaving them especially vulnerable during and immediately after emergencies like flash flooding./We know that by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas-which are the major contributors to climate change-we can improve children's health right now. For instance, by burning less fossil fuel, we can reduce air pollution, which, as mentioned above, is associated with various health problems including asthma. When the air quality is too dangerous, we stop kids from playing outside, which is way climate change impacts obesity. Improving air quality can help prevent this./Moreover, when we take steps to build our cities and infrastructure with climate change in mind, we'll see immediate improvements in our children's health. When we use more renewable energy and create more green space, our cities will be cooler and have less air pollution. When our communities are designed to promote public transportation and walking, we'll have healthier environments for kids./Our kids are learning more about our changing world than we did. When they tell us that they want change, we must listen and voice their desires. A livable climate can't wait until they take on positions of authority./Many towns and cities want to decarbonize-in fact they're leading on this issue-and parents can play a role in shaping those efforts. When your neighborhood is getting redeveloped, ask that plans be made to make it easier to walk and bike safely, ask for green space and access to public transit. These actions will benefit everyone's health and especially the health of our children./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Breathing the worst air in Dhaka,"Dhaka, Sept. 21 -- THE Air Quality Index (AQI) on Thursday morning showed that Dhaka's air quality was the second-worst in the world. Dhaka had a score of 190 at 8:21am, indicating that the quality was unhealthy. When the AQI value is between 101 and 200, there is an increased likelihood of adverse effects and aggravation to the heart and lungs among general public, particularly for sensitive groups. The presence of heavy metal in the air poses danger for public health and healthy growing up of kids. The government has taken very few steps to upgrade the air quality that leads vested quarters to erect brick kilns outskirts of the city in all direction, while development works like road and building construction works made the air quality worst./The index for reporting daily air quality informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The big picture of the effect of air pollution shows natural disasters like floods, cyclones, storms, sea-level surges, riverbank erosion, earthquakes, intermittent droughts, salinity intrusion, and frequent thunderstorms and hailstorms. The air pollution not only fuels climate change but is also a major threat to human health. It is one of the major environmental concerns in Bangladesh due to our inadequate and dysfunctional disposal sites that create acute health problems. The continuous inhalation of heavy metals consisting of dust, fumes, mist, and smoke cause long-term health problems such as chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys. Repeated exposure to air pollution affects children's lungs and can worsen or complicate medical conditions in the elderly./A study said nearly seven million people in Bangladesh suffer from asthma -- over half of them children. However, the big questions are: How can we curb air pollution? What are the causes of pollution? Who is responsible for such pollution? How are we responsible for this? Our reckless attitude and irresponsibility are the prime causes behind the worst air quality in the heart of the green delta. The government focus on development would be futile if people unable to breathe./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Eco-Friendly Travel,"Dhaka, Sept. 28 -- The day 27 September was World Tourism Day and it was celebrated worldwide to encourage tourists. This year's the theme of World Tourism Day was ""Tourism and Jobs-a Better Future for All"". Tourism has experienced continued expansion and diversification, and it has become one of the fastest-growing and most important economic sectors in the world. It is beneficial for communication with communities in world wide. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) promotes the Tourism Day for establishing sustainable, responsible, and universally accessible tourism. The tourism industry of any country is a profitable industry. Bangladesh is not exceptional; the tourism industry can contribute enormously to our country's economy./There are so many tourist places in Bangladesh which can attract tourists more. Bangladesh has a natural beauty all over the country. Cox's Bazar is the world's longest unbroken natural sea beach; Sundarban is the only mangrove forest in the world with the view of Sunrise and sunset from the same beach in the beautiful beach of Kuwakata. The Chattogram Hill Tracts, Kaptai Lake, surrounded by green forests of Bandarban, Rangamati's Sajek Valley, past stands as a witness to the country's archaeological Paharpur, Mainamoti, Wari Bateshwar, Lalbagh Fort, Ahsan Manzil, sixty-domed mosque etc. In addition, to the tourists who travel to these places, international tourists are crowded at different times of the year in our country./The infrastructure (Such as hotels, resorts, restaurants, shopping malls, transit facilities, cellphone shops, beauty shops and service providers) of the tourism industries are developing rapidly. Due to creating this infrastructure, the environment is losing the natural balance. We are destroying the forest which is the habitat of biodiversity and vegetation for recreation. Every construction activities are being polluted air, water and soil of the developing area. The uncontrolled activities of tourist are resulting in the depletion of the surrounding environment. During the road construction period, the amount of particulate matter is increasing which contribute to air pollution. Smoke, dust, fumes are emitted from motorized rides such as coal or wood smoke, speedboats, engine-driven boats, which is another cause of air pollution in the tourist area. Oil emitted from tourist-driven ships and engine boats which pollutes the water. On the other hand, they are arranging barbecue that pollutes the air by smoke and it's also generated solid waste. Lack of sanitation and waste management in hotels, resorts, restaurants being contaminated water. Finally, the contaminated water mixed with lakes, rivers and seawater. Leachate of decomposing waste pollutes the groundwater. Plastics used by tourists (once used glass, plates, etc.) and plastic packets of food have spread to the soil and water. Tourists use a high-quality sound system which is the main cause of noise pollution. Also, making noise or excessive noise in cars can be harmful to wildlife, birds or sea creatures.
