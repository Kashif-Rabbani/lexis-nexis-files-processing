Unspontaneous combustion," SINCE the mid-1980s, when Indonesia first began to clear its bountiful forests on an industrial scale in favour of lucrative palm-oil plantations, ""haze"" has become an almost annual occurrence in South-East Asia. The cheapest way to clear logged woodland is to burn it, producing an acrid cloud of foul white smoke that, carried by the wind, can cover hundreds, or even thousands, of square miles./The intervening decades have seen the passage of numerous national and international regulations to stop the fires, but all, it seems, to no avail. The past two weeks have seen some of the worst smog ever, taking a severe toll not only on peoples' lungs, throats and tempers, but also on diplomatic relations and Indonesia's attempts to improve its environmental image. Worse still, despite the outcry, it is hard to see how matters are going to improve over the next few years./Most of the burning, which starts every dry season, is concentrated this year in Riau province on the east coast of Sumatra. Indonesia is the world's biggest palm-oil producer and Riau its most productive province. Sadly for Singapore and Malaysia, it lies just across the Strait of Malacca from them. From June 16th Singapore and large parts of Malaysia were smothered in smog from this year's fires./In Singapore the pollution was the worst ever, pummelling the previous records set in 1997, when the haze affected six countries and perhaps 70m people. Then, the Pollutants Standard Index (PSI) in Singapore, a measure of air quality, hit a panic-inducing 226, defined as ""very unhealthy"". On June 19th, by contrast (the day of the satellite picture above), the PSI climbed to over 300, defined as ""hazardous"", before peaking at 401 on June 21st. The government issued face masks and almost everyone took its advice to stay indoors. Malaysia declared a state of emergency in parts of its southern state of Johor when the Air Pollution Index, only slightly different from Singapore's PSI, exceeded 500; it reached 750 on June 23rd. Kuala Lumpur, the capital, and coastal cities were also badly affected, as was Riau province itself, where hundreds were evacuated./Fraternal relations within the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the regional political grouping, quickly dissolved into acrimonious finger-pointing. Agung Laksono, the minister in charge of Indonesia's response to the crisis, said that Singaporeans were behaving ""like children, in such a tizzy"". Singaporeans and Malaysians pointed out that Indonesia was the only ASEAN member not to have ratified a 2002 Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. It was only on June 24th, when the damage was done, that its president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, apologised to his irate neighbours./At least three laws in Indonesia prohibit the burning and clearance of forests, and in particular Sumatra's extensive peat wetlands. But environmental campaigners argue that the government has never seriously enforced these laws. Despite the arrest in Sumatra this week of eight farmers, supposedly caught red-handed, hardly anyone has been successfully prosecuted over the years for lighting fires. Palm oil's economic importance to Indonesia seems to afford the industry protection. Last year exports totalled $17.9 billion, second only to coal. Some 5m people live off the industry. These are big numbers in a relatively poor country./About half of the vast amount of land on which the fires are burning in Sumatra belongs to big palm-oil conglomerates, many of them Malaysian-owned. They have been accused of setting illegal fires in the past, in order to clear more of their concessions for palm oil. Satellite imagery clearly shows fires burning on the land of some of them, and the Indonesian government has named eight companies that it wants to investigate. Even so, it is going to be very difficult to apportion blame. One company, Singapore-based Asia Pacific Resources International Limited, acknowledges that there have been three fires on its land, but claims these had ""originally started outside of its concession area""./Another perennial problem is corruption. This year's disaster was preceded on June 14th by the arrest of Rusli Zainal, the governor of Riau since 2003. He was charged, among other crimes, with dishing out illegal logging permits to finance a forthcoming re-election campaign. Under the country's political decentralisation in 2001, generally considered to be good for democracy, the power to regulate land use passed from Jakarta to regional and often district-level politicians. They have often abused this authority to raise money./For peat's sake/Much of the area now burning in Riau is peat wetland, almost all that's left after years of rampant deforestation. Peat, which can go down to a depth of 30m in Sumatra, is highly combustible, even many metres down. A fire doused on the surface might smoulder underground long after. It is illegal to burn peat for commercial development. But as the past few weeks have proved, the law is not enough. And, ominously for those hoping for clear skies and clean air, a lot of peat is left."
Second generation action needed to check air pollution in Dhaka city," As Dhaka is becoming the most densely populated and a rapidly growing city, experts have come up with a package of suggestions like second generation action plan to check air pollution, largely responsible for various diseases among the dwellers./In this respect, their suggestions spoke clearly of accelerating vehicle technology leapfrog, scaling up of public transport, integrated multi-modal transport options, car restraint, walking and cycling for clean air in the capital city of Bangladesh./The second generation action plan obviously stands for, among other steps, more up-to-date and realistic as well as visionary approaches towards stricter management of vehicular traffic movement side by side with more drastic control on emission of poisonous smokes into the air./The suggestions were placed at a workshop on Air Quality and Sustainable Transpor-tation Challenge in South Asian Cities, jointly organised by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and Work for a Better Bangladesh (WBB) Trust recently./The workshop was a part of a joint initiative to build a forum for city dialogue on air quality and sustainable mobility in South Asia and to find solutions to the daunting air pollution and mobility challenges facing the cities in the region./Dozens of stakeholders including policy makers from the concerned ministries, departm-ents/agencies, experts, academicians and civil society groups involved with the implementation of clean air, transportation and mobility related policies in Bangladesh discussed the dangerous effects of air pollution and transportation challenges in Dhaka city./While stressing upon future actions to check the menacing air pollution in urban areas, the speakers said the South Asian cities including Dhaka and New Delhi, already having taken some significant steps to control air pollution, are facing newer challenges with the rapid rise in population and increasing movement of vehicles./The only way these cities can address the twin challenges of air pollution and congestion is by protecting their inherent strength in sustainable commuting practices-public transport, walking, cycling and compact city design,"" a CSE expert said adding, these cities have to recognise their inherent strength otherwise pro- car policies can destroy this advantage and lead to enormous pollution, ill health and fuel wastage./Earlier, the CSE shared the findings of an opinion survey of a select group of stakeholders in Dhaka to assess the public perception of the growing problem of pollution and congestion and the nature of intervention needed./According to the survey findings, about 80 percent of the respondents travel daily by bus, or use cycle rickshaws and walk while 20 percent use cars./A snapshot of the ongoing survey brought out the challenges that Dhaka is facing deteriorating air quality and health impacts due to air pollution. The survey brought out overwhelming support for the public transport as the respondents stressed on the need for good quality, reliable, convenient city bus services and walking and cycling facilities./After the WBB Trust presented the mobility challenges in Dhaka, the speakers addressed issues like air quality monitoring and management; gaseous fuel programme, public transport strategies to reverse the trend of growing dependence on cars, non-motorised transport, walking and cycling strategies, car restraint strategies and parking policy; challenges of in-use vehicles and roadmap for effective vehicle inspection programme in Bangladesh and role of civil society in the transition./There has long been complaints of headache, eye and skin irritation as well as breathing problem, which are very common among the users of the city's roadways./The situation, seriously harming the children and the elderly people, is feared to worsen further with increase of population and economic development in this city./Environmentalists say inadequate traffic management practices, undue encroachment onto the available road space by vendors and traders, poor road user behavior, lack of road space for commuters, inadequate enforcement of traffic regulations and traffic induced pollution in Dhaka are putting the dwellers into a dangerously harmful state./With its rapid growth over the decades, Dhaka has been a showcase for almost every imaginable problem emanating from quantitative and qualitative inadequacies of existing urban infrastructures and the inefficient urban and environment management systems./Since the transportation congestion has changed so dramatically in type and magnitude, the environmentalists find it as the number one source of urban environment problems, calling for a significant expansion of the city's structure from mono- centric to the poly-centric."
WHO to discuss regional health issues next month," Health ministers from the 11 countries of WHO's South-East Asia Region will meet in New Delhi, India from 10 to 13 September to discuss key health issues facing the Region./The Thirty-first Meeting of Health Ministers of the Region, where the Bangladesh Health Minister Prof. Dr AFM Ruhal Haque is due to join, will be held on 10 September./The Health Minister's Meeting is a forum for exchange of national experiences on the political, social and economic dimensions of health. The meeting is being hosted by Indian Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad./This will be followed by the Sixty-Sixth Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia. The Regional Committee is a statutory body comprising the Member countries, which meets once a year to review progress and regional implications of the World Health Assembly decisions and to map the way forward./Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General, and Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia, will be present with their team of senior advisers at both meetings./The Meeting of Ministers of Health will discuss ways to address the leading risk factor for mortality in the Region from hypertension. The ministers are expected to adopt the 'New Delhi Declaration on High Blood Pressure' as well./In the Regional Committee Meeting, key technical issues such as Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which is to ensure that all people get necessary healthcare without any financial hardship, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), for which each year around 7.9 million people die, are scheduled to be discussed./Member States are expected to consider the reduction of household air pollution as an additional target for the Region. The Regional Committee will also deliberate on the Regional Action Plan for Prevention and NCDs and put some light on measles elimination and rubella control."
A kerosene lamp which also cooks food without polluting," A lamp which produces high quality light and doubles up as a device to cook food without causing pollution has been invented by a team of engineers in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, reports AFP./Suitable particularly for rural households which lack clean cooking fuel and electricity, the device, aptly named Lanstove (lantern combined with cook stove), has been developed by researchers from Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) in Maharashtra's Phaltan./IIT graduate Anil Rajvanshi, who led the team, says the clean-combustion kerosene lanstove provides excellent light equivalent to that from a 200-300 W electric bulb and cooks a complete meal for a family of five just like an LPG stove./""To our knowledge this is the first such device where both lighting and cooking are combined together resulting in tremendous energy efficiency and saving of fuel,"" he says in a research report published by the institute./The Lanstove consists of a nine litre pressurised kerosene cylinder, a high light output mantle lantern and a very efficient steam cooker which is based on heat pipe principle./The device has been designed so that kerosene is pressurised and stored in a small separate cylinder from where it flows into the combustor and burns very cleanly just like in the LPG cookstove./""We developed this technology with our own funds and the trials were funded by Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi,"" Rajvanshi told PTI./Millions of people in rural India cook and heat their homes using open fires and leaky stoves burning biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal./Nearly 2 million people die prematurely from illness like those caused by chronic obstructive respiratory disease attributable to indoor air pollution from household solid fuel use, World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates./Research by NARI shows that carbon monoxide levels from these new lanstoves are less than 3 parts per million (ppm), whereas those from regular ""chulhas"" are between 250-400 ppm or 80 to 130 times more than from the lanstove./""Thus lanstove is an extremely clean device and equivalent to LPG stove,"" say NARI engineers. Lanstove has been tested for the last eight months in 25 rural huts in western Maharashtra which do not have electricity./After the successful trials, the technology is now available for commercialisation and the institute is now looking for suitable entrepreneurs who can market it in the rural areas./""It has shown excellent results with users commenting that it does not produce smoke like their existing biomass powered chulha and gives excellent light compared to the presently used hurricane lanterns and tin wick lamps,"" Rajvanshi says./However, engineers regret that Lanstoves cannot be made available on a large-scale in rural areas because of government regulations on the supply of kerosene./""Today below poverty line (BPL) families get only five litres of kerosene per household every month while Lanstove users need at least 15-20 litres of kerosene per month,"" he points out demanding that kerosene should be allowed to be sold in open market freely."
Air pollution a leading cause of cancer," The air we breathe is laced with cancer-causing substances and is being officially classified as carcinogenic to humans, the World Health Organization's cancer agency said on Thursday, reports Reuters./The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cited data indicating that in 2010, 223,000 deaths from lung cancer worldwide resulted from air pollution, and said there was also convincing evidence it increases the risk of bladder cancer./Depending on the level of exposure in different parts of the world, the risk was found to be similar to that of breathing in second-hand tobacco smoke, Kurt Straif, head of the agency's section that ranks carcinogens, told reporters in Geneva./""Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,"" deputy head Dana Loomis said in a statement. ""The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.""/Air pollution, mostly caused by transport, power generation, industrial or agricultural emissions and residential heating and cooking, is already known to raise risks for a wide range of illnesses including respiratory and heart diseases./Research suggests that exposure levels have risen significantly in some parts of the world, particularly countries with large populations going through rapid industrialization, such as China./IARC reviewed thousands of studies on air pollution tracking populations over decades and other research such as those in which mice exposed to polluted air experienced increased numbers of lung tumors./In a statement released after reviewing the literature, the Lyon-based agency said both air pollution and ""particulate matter"" - a major component of it - would now be classified among its Group 1 human carcinogens./That ranks them alongside more than 100 other known cancer-causing substances in IARC's Group 1, including asbestos, plutonium, silica dust, ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke./Air pollution is highly variable over space and time. Loomis said there was relatively high exposure in Asia, South Asia, eastern North America, some places in Central America and Mexico, as well as North Africa./But although both the composition and levels of air pollution can vary dramatically from one location to the next, IARC said its conclusions applied to all regions of the world./""Our conclusion is that this is a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths,"" Dr. Christopher Wild, director of IARC, told the news briefing in Geneva./IARC's ranking monographs program, sometimes known as the ""encyclopedia of carcinogens"", aims to be an authoritative source of scientific evidence on cancer-causing substances./It has already classified many chemicals and mixtures that can be components of air pollution, including diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals and dusts. But this is the first time that experts have classified air pollution as a cause of cancer./Wild said he hoped the comprehensive evidence would help the WHO, which is revising its global 2005 guidelines on air quality. The UN agency makes on recommendations on public health issues to its 193 member states./Asked why it had taken so long to reach the conclusion, he said that one problem was the time lag between exposure to polluted air and the onset of cancer./""Often we're looking at two, three or four decades once an exposure is introduced before there is sufficient impact on the burden of cancer in the population to be able to study this type of question,"" he said."
Pneumonia still responsible for one fifth of child deaths," The GAVI Alliance, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) are highlighting essential actions that can help end child deaths from this disease, an official release said./""Every 30 seconds, a child younger than five dies of pneumonia. This is a great shame as we know what it takes to prevent children from dying of this illness,"" says Dr Mickey Chopra, Chief of Health, UNICEF. ""Tackling pneumonia doesn't necessarily need complicated solutions.""/Many factors contribute to pneumonia, and no single intervention can effectively prevent, treat and control it./Five simple but effective interventions, if implemented properly, will help reduce the burden of the disease that is responsible for almost one fifth of all child deaths around the world./These are exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and continued breastfeeding comple-mented by nutritious solid foods up to age 2; vaccin-ation against whooping cough (pertussis), measles, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcus; safe drinking water, sanitation and handwashing facilities; improved cooking stoves to reduce indoor air pollution; and treatment, including amoxicillin dispersible tablets and oxygen./The GAPPD presents an innovative framework bringing together prevention, protection and control of both pneumonia and diarrhoea - two of the world's leading killers of children under 5 - to make more efficient and effective use of scarce health resources./The GAVI Alliance is helping to accelerate the fight against pneumonia by increasing access to pneumococcal vaccines, thanks to GAVI's innovative Advance Market Commitment (AMC), but also to the five-in-one pentavalent vaccine which protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b, another major cause of pneumonia,"" says Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI Alliance./Since the launch of the GAPPD seven months ago, several countries have taken this forward. For example, Bangladesh and Zambia are translating the GAPPD into local implementation plans in some districts./Programme managers responsible for immunisation, child health, nutrition and water and sanitation have joined forces to accelerate progress and eliminate preventable deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea./In addition, in October 2013, WHO published new technical advice for countries based on a review of the latest evidence, guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia were updated, recommending simpler antibiotic regimens./A handbook to guide district and health facility staff on how to introduce the pneumococcal vaccine emphasizes using new vaccine introductions to scale up access to other essential interventions to protect, prevent and treat pneumonia, in line with the GAPPD./""To achieve the vision and goals of the integrated plan-to end preventable deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea in the next generation-the children of the world need to see political will, coordinated efforts, and increased resources at the global and national levels to fight these stubborn killers,"" says Dr Elizabeth Mason, Director of WHO's Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health."
Preventive measures can reduce asthmatic childhood deaths," Mass awareness as well as preventive measures is very vital to cut the existing rate of childhood patients suffering from asthma and death caused by the disease./""Out of 250 deaths, one dies in asthma, which is more prevalent among the children than the adults, in the region monthly,"" said Dr Belal Uddin, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Department of Rajshahi Medical College and Hospital./He blamed various adverse reasons particularly air pollution, urbanization and indiscriminate smoking for the prevalence of the disease and the cold weather associated with some other allied factors always trigger the disease./Dr Belal, however, said creation of awareness among the public in general and proper and timely preventive measures could manage the disease at a greater extent./In this context, he viewed that the asthma is a chronic disease causing considerable deaths of the children and it is common in modern metropolitan cities in comparison with the rural areas./Dr Asgar Hossain, Associate Professor of the same department, said the asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder causing hyper- responsive of airways to certain stimuli resulting in recurrent variable airflow limitation that presents as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing./He said around 80 percent of the children was infected with the asthma before six years of age. Some certain factors are closely associated with the childhood asthma, which include the parental history of the asthma, maternal smoking - particularly during pregnancy - and other disorders. Prof Asgar, however, said as the asthma is a chronic disease, it should be managed at home, excepting the severe acute one. If home management is done intelligently and skillfully, most asthmatic patients can lead a symptom-free normal life, he added./Proper prevention of allergy (pollen, dust and frugal spores), sports (games and exercises), temperature (cold, wet and windy weather), heredity, mites and anxiety (stress and worries) can reduce the sufferings caused by the disease, he recommended while talking to BSS here yesterday night."
M&S brings anti-pollution stoves in Bangladesh," Marks & Spencer has joined Unicef in a project that will help Bangladesh's children breathe fresh air and cut carbon emission to lessen impact of climate change. Unicef says under the new partnership beginning next February, Marks & Spencer will fund 40,000 ""fuel efficient, low pollution"" cooking stoves to be made and marketed by Bangladesh's entrepreneurs. Unicef in a statement on Tuesday said the initiative came in the wake of health hazards of household air pollution due to conventional stoves. Citing World Health Organization, the statement said the traditional indoor stoves generated smoke and killed 49,000 people a year in Bangladesh./Seventy percent of those killed are children under five. Medical journal 'Lancet' says indoor air pollution from solid fuel poses ""third biggest risk"" for deaths in South Asia, killing more people than killed by malaria or tuberculosis. Women and children, who mostly cook, are the most affected. Unicef says the new stoves are 50 percent more fuel efficient than traditional stoves, producing one tonne less carbon emissions each year. It says currently 90 percent of Bangladesh's households depend on biomass such as wood, forest cuttings and cow dung for fuel, but less than two percent of those households use fuel efficient stoves./The fuel efficient cook stoves help to reduce deforestation and limit local flooding, it says. Bangladesh is one of the high risk countries impacted by climate change, particularly because of rising sea levels that could make millions of people homeless. M&S and Unicef earlier this year announced an international partnership to raise £1.75 million over the next three years. Employees across M&S' 431 stores in over 50 countries have been raising money for Unicef's work providing life changing education for children, the UN agency says in a statement."
The poor need cheap fossil fuels," There's a lot of hand-wringing about our warming planet, but billions of people face a more immediate problem: They are desperately poor, and many cook and heat their homes using open fires or leaky stoves that burn dirty fuels like wood, dung, crop waste and coal. About 3.5 million of them die prematurely each year as a result of breathing the polluted air inside their homes - about 200,000 more than the number who die prematurely each year from breathing polluted air outside, according to a study by the World Health Organization. There's no question that burning fossil fuels is leading to a warmer climate and that addressing this problem is important. But doing so is a question of timing and priority. For many parts of the world, fossil fuels are still vital and will be for the next few decades, because they are the only means to lift people out of the smoke and darkness of energy poverty. More than 1.2 billion people around the world have no access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook for 2012./Most of them live in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia. That is nearly four times the number of people who live in the United States. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, excluding South Africa, the entire electricity-generating capacity available is only 28 gigawatts - equivalent to Arizona's - for 860 million people. About 6.5 million people live in Arizona. Even more people - an estimated three billion - still cook and heat their homes using open fires and leaky stoves, according to the energy agency. More efficient stoves could help. And solar panels could provide LED lights and power to charge cellphones. But let's face it. What those living in energy poverty need are reliable, low-cost fossil fuels, at least until we can make a global transition to a greener energy future. This is not just about powering stoves and refrigerators to improve billions of lives but about powering agriculture and industry that will improve lives. Over the last 30 years, China moved an estimated 680 million people out of poverty by giving them access to modern energy, mostly powered by coal. Yes, this has resulted in terrible air pollution and a huge increase in greenhouse gas emissions. But it is a trade-off many developing countries would gratefully choose./As China becomes wealthier, it will most likely begin to cut its air pollution problem through regulation, just as the rich world did in the 20th century. But, admittedly, cutting carbon-dioxide emissions will be much harder because these emissions are a byproduct of the cheap energy that makes the world go around. Today, 81 percent of the planet's energy needs are met by fossil fuels, and according to the International Energy Agency, that percentage will be almost as high in 2035 under current policies, when consumption will be much greater. The unfortunate fact is that many people feel uncomfortable facing up to the undeniable need for more cheap and reliable power in the developing world. The Obama administration announced recently, for instance, that it would no longer contribute to the construction of coal-fired power plants financed by the World Bank and other international development banks. This should not have been a surprise./The last time the World Bank agreed to help finance construction of a coal-fired power plant, in South Africa in 2010, the United States abstained from a vote approving the deal. The Obama administration expressed concerns that the project would ""produce significant greenhouse gas emissions."" But as South Africa's finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, explained at the time in The Washington Post, ""To sustain the growth rates we need to create jobs, we have no choice but to build new generating capacity - relying on what, for now, remains our most abundant and affordable energy source: coal."" The developed world needs a smarter approach toward cleaner fuels. The United States has been showing the way. Hydraulic fracturing has produced an abundance of inexpensive natural gas, leading to a shift away from coal in electricity production./Because burning natural gas emits half the carbon dioxide of coal, this technology has helped the United States reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the lowest level since the mid-1990s, even as emissions rise globally. We need to export this technology and help other nations exploit it. At the same time, wealthy Western nations must step up investments into research and development in green energy technologies to ensure that cleaner energy eventually becomes so cheap that everyone will want it. But until then they should not stand in the way of poorer nations as they turn to coal and other fossil fuels. This approach will get our priorities right. And perhaps then, people will be able to cook in their own homes without slowly killing themselves."
Air pollution kills seven million," Seven million people died as a result of air pollution in 2012, the World Health Organization estimates. Its findings suggest a link between air pollution and heart disease, respiratory problems and cancer. One in eight global deaths were linked with air pollution, making it ""the world's largest single environmental health risk"", the WHO said. Nearly six million of the deaths had been in South East Asia and the WHO's Western Pacific region, it found. The WHO said about 3.3 million people had died as a result of indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths were related to outdoor air pollution, mainly in low- and middle-income countries in those regions. WHO public health, environmental and social determinants of health department director Dr Maria Neira said: ""/The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes. ""Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution. ""The evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe."" Reducing air pollution could save millions of lives, said the WHO. WHO family, woman and children's health assistant director-general Dr Flavia Bustreo said: ""Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly. ""Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves."" The WHO assessment found the majority of air pollution deaths were linked with cardiovascular diseases./For deaths related to outdoor pollution, it found: 40% - heart disease 40% - stroke 11% - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 6% - lung cancer 3% - acute lower respiratory infections in children For deaths related to indoor pollution, it found: 34% - stroke 26% - heart disease 22% - COPD 12% - acute lower respiratory infections in children 6% - lung cancer University of Birmingham professor of environmental and respiratory medicine Jon Ayres said the review needed to be taken seriously. ""The estimates for the impact of outdoor air pollution are robust and as accurate as can be developed at the moment,"" he said. The WHO estimates were based on: satellite data ground-level monitoring modelling how pollution drifts in the air pollution-emissions data"
Pollution and Dust in Britain Bring Health Warnings," A combination of air pollution and dust from the Sahara on Wednesday prompted British authorities to issue a smog alert and a health warning for the elderly and for people with heart or lung problems. High levels of air pollution were reported in several parts of England, with the worst conditions in the eastern part of the country, where light easterly winds trapped domestic pollution, brought in particles from the European continent and drew in Saharan dust. Central London had moderate levels of air pollution on Wednesday, with a score of 6 on an index on which 10 ranks ""very high.""/In recent days, motorists in some parts of the country have reported seeing a light-colored film accumulating on vehicles, evidence of dust from the Sahara, experts say. ""I am looking out of my window and the sky is milky white,"" said Rob MacKenzie, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Birmingham. ""Call it mist or haze or smog, that reduced visibility is telling you that pollution in the air is greater than normal."" Professor MacKenzie said Saharan dust, which is often found in the air in Southern Europe, also reaches Britain regularly and has been seen on cars in Birmingham in recent days./""What is uncommon is for it to trigger an air pollution alert,"" he said, adding that pollution levels in Britain and continental Europe were now so high that a natural event, like the arrival of Saharan dust, could push air quality to worrisome levels. High levels of pollution in and around Paris last month led the French government to impose a partial driving ban, reduce speed limits and offer free mass transit for several days. Most people are not affected by temporary spikes in air pollution, said Sotiris Vardoulakis, the director of the air pollution and climate change group at the Center for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards of Public Health England, a government agency./But vulnerable groups, including people with heart or lung conditions, could experience a worsening of their symptoms. ""On occasions where levels are high, adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms,"" Mr. Vardoulakis said in a statement. Older people were also advised to reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, as was anyone with sore eyes, a cough or a sore throat. High pollution levels were forecast for Thursday in East Anglia, the Midlands, parts of Wales and the northwest coast of England, but a shift in the weather by Friday should help bring pollutant levels down, according to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Britain's environmental protection agencyd./""The high level of air pollution this week is due to a combination of local emissions, light winds, pollution from the Continent and dust blown over from the Sahara,"" the department said in a statement. ""We want to keep improving air quality and have introduced a new five-day forecast service in addition to investing heavily in local and transport initiatives to tackle this issue head on."" But environmental campaigners called on the government to take more action to curb domestic air pollution./""We know that part of the problem is caused by Saharan dust, but we also know that the United Kingdom has an abysmal record in tackling air pollution in our towns and cities,"" said Keith Taylor, a member of the European Parliament from the Green Party. ""The smog isn't just from the Sahara, it's from our cars and factories too,"" Mr. Taylor added. ""We must not let the government or local authorities hide behind the 'Saharan dust' as they try to escape blame for a deadly pollution problem that they're failing to take seriously."""
Air pollution linked to one in 12 deaths in London," Pollution shortens the average Briton's life expectancy by six months, with 1 in 12 deaths in some areas of the country partly attributable to poor quality air, health officials have said. In the most comprehensive warning yet over the health burden of pollutants in the air we breathe, Public Health England (PHE) has calculated the impact on the local population in every UK local authority area. The report found that pollutants contribute to 29,000 deaths in the UK a year, and the average British citizen has their life expectancy shortened by six months because of long-term exposure to pollutants caused by car exhausts, industry and domestic energy use. While rural areas fare well, city-dwellers are badly affected and in some parts of London as many as one in 12 deaths can be partly attributed to the effects of particle air pollution. Their warning comes a week after widespread smog sparked health warnings and led to spikes in ambulance calls for respiratory conditions./However, the new figures refer to long-term exposure rather than any extreme events such as last week's unusually high pollution levels. They are based on scientific models of the average concentration of air pollution in a given area, compared to the number of deaths in a single year. Air pollution is never the single cause of death, rather it is a factor which can exacerbate underlying health problems, including respiratory illnesses like asthma or COPD, as well as cardiovascular conditions. The proportion of deaths in which air pollution played a part varied widely across the UK, from only 2.5 per cent in rural areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland, between three and five per cent in Wales, but were as high as eight per cent in some London boroughs. Residents of the north London borough of Barnet and Bromley in the south-east had the highest likelihood of dying from a condition exacerbated by air pollution, with estimates suggesting that more than 160 deaths per year could be attributed to air pollution in each of the boroughs./Dr Sotiris Vardoulakis, PHE's head of air pollution and climate change said that the advice meant that people living in high pollution areas should be aware of their heightened risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease. ""Mortality related to air pollution is substantial - there is a significant burden on public health, which can be compared to burdens like tobacco smoking, or alcohol use,"" he told The Independent. ""People who are suffering from asthma are sensitive, they might see an exacerbation of their condition, but pollution affects the whole population,"" he added. ""It might be a contributory factor in many deaths - most of them due to cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.

Leaders fiddle as Sumatra burns," PEKANBARU, the capital of Riau province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, has been shrouded in an acrid white cloud of smoke so dense that visibility is down to 50 metres (about 160 feet). The air quality is officially described as ""dangerous"", and most people are wearing face masks, even indoors. Nearly 50,000 people in Riau have already been treated for respiratory, eye or skin problems. All flights last week were cancelled, and only a few have got through since. The provincial governor has declared a state of emergency. /The haze is back, and has arrived earlier this year than usual. Drive to Pekanbaru from the ferries that dock at a north Sumatran port, and you can see what the cause of the problem is: mile upon mile of smouldering or charred land. Much of it is peat-bog, where fires can burn up to two metres underground and take weeks to end. A few minutes in, the inferno stings the eyes and sets off a hacking cough. These fires have been burning for nearly two months. According to Greenpeace, a pressure group, more than 1,000 fires covering at least 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of forest and peatland are burning in Riau. And that is just one province among several with fires blazing. For Sumatra, it is an annual environmental trauma. /But when the haze drifts across the Strait of Malacca to cover Singapore and Malaysia, it is a regional nightmare, too. Some schools began to close in Malaysia this month; the night air in Singapore smelled of bonfires before rain provided some relief. Last year the haze shattered all air-pollution records in both countries, and diplomatic rows broke out with Indonesia. It will take only a slight change in wind direction for Sumatra's fires to cause an even bigger haze over the region this year. Everyone knows why the haze happens, yet it keeps on occurring. That angers Indonesians as much as Singaporeans and Malaysians. /The fires are usually started deliberately, often to clear land to make way for palm-oil plantations. Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of palm oil. Successive governments have passed a mountain of laws and regulations outlawing burning, yet enforcement is so poor that people carry on regardless. On March 16th, when he dropped in on Riau on an emergency visit, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said he was ""ashamed"" of the situation .One recent fire illustrates many of the problems. Between Pekanbaru and the east coast is Giam Siak Kecil Bukit Batu, a huge UNESCO-listed peatland and forest reserve that is home to the Sumatran tiger, among other species. /It has been invaded by over 2,000 people from north Sumatra who are clearing the land by burning about 3,000 hectares. Local village heads are suspected of selling plots of land to the newcomers, aided and abetted by a local military officer previously convicted of illegal logging in western Sumatra. That points to the habitual collusion between the authorities and those illegally clearing land, both of whom profit from the lucrative palm-oil business. In response to this case, the head of the army in Riau, Prihadi Agus Irianto, has said that it is time for the armed forces to acknowledge that officers are involved in illegal logging and burning. On March 12th a former governor of Riau, Rusli Zainal, was found guilty of graft, including issuing logging licences that resulted in forest destruction. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Yet, as some Indonesian politicians are keen to point out, the problem is not all down to official corruption. About half of the fires burn on plantations owned by big palm-oil and logging corporations. /By law, they are supposed to be responsible for preventing and putting out fires on their concessions, but the regulations are seldom enforced. This year, using satellite imagery, Greenpeace claims to have found fires on land owned by 36 pulp-and-paper companies and 15 palm-oil companies. Many of these are local subsidiaries of Malaysian and Singaporean giants. Yet proving a deliberate intent to start the fires has always been hard. The case against one company, Adei Plantation and Industry, a subsidiary of Kuala Lumpur Kepong, listed in Malaysia, is being watched closely. /The firm was one of eight accused last year of starting fires, and now-a first in Riau-a local manager and a director have been brought to trial. If found guilty, they face up to ten years in jail and the company could lose its permit. The director of a local NGO, Muslim Rasyid of the Network for Riau Forest Rescue, argues that this is a landmark trial, and that if the company is punished, it could act as a deterrent to others. Perhaps, but first the trial has to reach its conclusion. Proceedings have been delayed. The judge, who is based in Jakarta, the capital, could not attend the courtroom last week because planes could not land in the haze."
A proposal," Every year at the public and private sector, the Bank Foundation gives stipends to students at various levels. This is a very creditable programme. This year also the programme is on. Some private banks have given stipends. But the condition is those students who have passed HSC in 2013 and have got admitted to the academic session of 2013-14, they have got these stipends. /But those who have got admitted for the second time, that is, passed HSC in 2012, they are not getting the opportunity for these stipends. It is a matter of regret that in the competitive examinations of the university, everybody does not get a chance to be admitted the first time. That is why from a humanitarian viewpoint those who have got admitted for the second time may be given the opportunity for receiving stipends. /I draw the kind attention of the Bank Foundation for this opportunity to give stipends to those who have been admitted for the second time Md Hashmatullah Islami Univeristy, Kushtia Railway line at Manikganj It is very important to be able to go to Manikganj. Once the Dhaka-Aricha road was the most important road of Bangladesh. /But after the Jamuna Bridge was built this road is less busy. Still to go from Dhaka to Paturia-Daul-atdia, Rajbari, Faridpur, Magura, Kushtia, Jenidah, Meherpur, Chuadanga, Narail, Jessore, this road is still the favoured road. Though Manikganj district is agriculture oriented, at present there has been an industrial revolution. To carry the finished products of the factory to all destinations in the country, a railway line is very necessary. If a railway line is constructed from Dhaka to Savar EPZ and then onto Manikganj and Paturia, then, the people of Savar, Manikganj, Dhamrai can attend office at Dhaka and return home by evening. Later on when the second Padma Bridge is built at Paturia-Daulatdia, one can reach Chittagong on this railway line.

Although the groundwater extraction for agricultural production boosted the production, the indiscriminate installation of shallow and deep tubewells (DTW and STW) has created health hazards for people. /One of the major reasons behind the spread of arsenicosis is the violation of the command areas while installing the tubewells. The restriction of the specific command areas for STWs and DTWs was not obeyed and those devices were installed indiscriminately by the owners since the government decided to privatise the use of the irrigation devices. /The weakening role of Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) since 1975 also played a vital role in the unplanned expansion of the groundwater irrigation. A survey by the minor irrigation division of BADC revealed that a distance of at least 2,800 metres should be maintained between two deep tube wells, whereas privately owned tubewells in most of the areas in the country, including those set by Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA), kept only a 1,200-metre distance.

Effective strategy to cut consumption and save lives," The member states of the World Health Organization created World No Tobacco Day in 1987 to draw global attention to the tobacco epidemic and the preventable death and disease it causes. In 1988, Resolution WHA42.19 was passed, calling for the celebration of World No Tobacco Day every year on 31 May. Since then, every year the day is observed by the member states with a specific theme for the day./The Day provides an opportunity for governments, non-government organizations and individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to a tobacco-free environment and thus ensure better health. The theme of the World No Tobacco Day for 2014 is Raise taxes on tobacco. Smoking is a health problem, the costs of which include sickness, pain, grief and misery. But tobacco use also imposes a significant economic burden on society./In addition to the direct medical costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses, there are other indirect costs including lost of productivity, fire damage and environmental harm from cigarette litter and destructive farming practices. The total burden caused by tobacco products more than outweighs any economic benefit from their manufacture and sale. WHO key facts on tobacco: Facts reveal that tobacco kills nearly 6 million people each year./More than five million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while more than 6,00,000 are the result of non-smokers being exposes to second-hand smoke. Unless urgent action is taken, the annual death toll could rise to more than eight million by 2030. Nearly 80 percent of the world's one billion smokers live in low and middle-income countires./The fact further shows that consumption of tobacco products is increasing globally, though it is decreasing in some high-income and upper middle-income countires. Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care and hinder economic development. In some countires, children from poor households are frequently employed in tobacco farming to provide family income. These children are especially vulnerable to ""green tobacco sickness"", which is caused by the nicotine that is absorbed through the skin from the handling of wet tobacco leaves. There are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, of which at least 250 are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. You cannot be safe so long there are smokers around: It is now well accepted globally that you cannot be safe so long there are smokers around. For whatever reason if you inhale the air polluted by tobacco smoker you run the same risk as the smoker for having the adverse effect of smoking on your health./This is called second-hand smoke. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places./The poor and tobacco consumption: It is the poorer and the poorest who tend to smoke the most. Globally, 84% of smokers live in developing and traditional economy countries. At the country level, tobacco counsumption varies by socio-economic group. In many countries, at all levels of development and income, it is the poor who smoke the most and who bear most the economic and disease burden of tobacco use. A study of smoking prevalence among men in Chennai (India) in 1997 shows that the highest rate is found among the illiterate population (64%)./This prevalence decreases by number of years of schooling, and it decreases to about one fifty (21%) among those with more than 12 years of schooling. A study in the United Kingdom shows that only 10% of women and 12% of men in the highest socio-economic group are smokers while 35% of women and 40% of men in the lowest socio-economic group smoke. Tobacco increases the poverty of individuals and families: WHO facts reveal that tobacco and poverty create a vicious circle. In most countries, tobacco use tends to be higher among the poor./Poor familires, in turn spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco. Money spent on tobacco cannot be spent on basic human needs such as food, shelter, education and health care. Tobacco can also worsen poverty among users and their families since tobacco users are at much higher risk of falling ill and dying prematurerly of cancers, heart attacks, respiratory diseases or other tobacco-induced diseases, depriving families of much needed income and imposing additional costs for health care./Specific goals of the World No Tobacco Day 2014: As mentioned above a specific theme for the day which provides an opportunity for governments, non-government organizations and individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to a tobacco-free environment and thus ensure better health, this year's theme focuses governments should increases taxes on tobacco to such levels that help reduce tobacco consumptions and individuals and civil society organizations work together to encourage their governments to increase taxes on tobacco to such levels that reduce consumption./Because tax on tobacco is an effective strategy to reduce consumption and thus save lives of million. Taxes discourage tobacco use: WHO fact on tobacco shows that tobacco texes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among young and poor people. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10 percent decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 percent in high-income countries and upto 8 percent in low-and middle-income countries. Comprehensive tobacco control measures especially those demand-reduction measures such as higher taxes, advertising and promotion bans, smoking bans in public places and helping those who wish to quit are effective in reducing tobacco usage and consequently tobacco attributable deaths and diseases./From the income perspective, higher taxes will likely increase the share of income spent on tobacco, creating big opportunity costs on families' immediate needs such as education and health expenditures. When evaluated from a broader perspective, tobacco control is not only effective but also has positive impacts on the poor, society and the economy. That is because a substantial portion of the world's tobacco consumers are poor, and the poor suffer more from the burden of tobacco-attributable diseases and deaths. Given the higher price sensitivity among the poor, as taxes increases, it is more likely that the poor will quit or reduce the quantity of tobacco consumption. Consequently, a tax increase can be blessing as it becomes an incentive for poorer populations to stop using tobacco./Moreover, reducing tobacco consumption will help to create a long term benefit. In the mid to long run, as smokers gain their health, better health will improve the social and economic development of countries. Tobacco Control Act: Aa a member state of the WHO and for the health and welfare of the people, Government of Bangladesh is cordial towards control of tobacco and smoking. It passed smoking and tobacco products usage control law in 2005 and made it effective in the same year. Subsequently an amendment was made in 2013 to make the law more effective./The amended law banned smoking in public places including transport and kept provision of a fine of tk.300 which was tk. 50 earlier. According to new law leaves, roots, branches and other parts of tobacco or such plants would be treated as intoxicants. Moreover, cigarettes and bidi, tobacco power (gul), aromatic tobacco (jorda) processed tobacco (khoyni) and white leaves of tobacco will be considered as tobacco products. Amended law bans sales to minors and use of ""light"", ""mild"", ""slim"" and use of misconceptions on the pack is banned./We urge upon the honourable Members of the Parliament to work together for tobacco taxation on various categories of tobacco products in such a higher and proportionate rate so that tobacco users, particularly young and poorer section of the society are compelled to quit or atleast reduce tobacco consumption which in turn can help creating big opportunity costs on families' immediate needs such as education and health expenditures. As we know the industry is powerful giant, only individuals efforts will not work./We must work together for a tobacco-free society. We have strength of law. Alongwith Governemnt and WHO efforts; health personnel, public representatives, social workers, NGOs, health workers, religious leaders, school teachers and individuals may work to raise awareness about the dangers of tobacco and smoking. The theme of World No Tobacco Day this year is very timely and appropriate and be utilized in a befitting manner. Working together we shall certainly win over the tobacco industry and thus keep our environment free from tobacco hazards for the health and welfare of the people.

Cross border air pollution," The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region has received enough attention for being the source of rivers that supply water to 1.3 billion people downstream but it has got far less attention for its misery as the recipient of massive air pollution originating in the plains, says Arnico Panday, senior atmospheric scientist at the ICIMOD./The Kathmandu-based ICIMOD (International Center for Integrated Mountain Development) founded in 1983 serves eight regional member countries of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan. Across northern South Asia during the dry season, individual plumes from hundreds of millions of cooking fires, tens of millions of diesel vehicles, generators and pump sets, as well as tens of thousands of brick kilns merge together into one thick brown haze layer that extends across international borders from Pakistani Punjab to Bangladesh, penetrating deep into the Himalayan valleys./A major constituent of this haze is black carbon. and has major impacts on people's health.It is also a 'short-lived climate pollutant' (SLCP) - an air pollutant that has significant impact on local and regional climate.Unlike the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2), which, once emitted, stays in the atmosphere for centuries impacting global climate, SLCPs have atmospheric lifetimes of days to months.The good news is that shutting down the sources of SLCPs reduces their climate impact within days to months./The bad news is that the HKH region is near a major source region for black carbon: the Indo-Gangetic Plains, where more than half a billion people live along the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra rivers and their tributaries.While globally black carbon has the second biggest impact on climate after CO2, its impact in northern South Asia is much bigger than its global average.Black carbon contributes to the melting of Himalayan glaciers and snowfields, warms the atmosphere at higher elevations and cools it at lower elevations, affecting atmospheric circulation patterns./In addition, it contributes to changes in monsoon clouds and in the timing and intensity of rainfall, with potentially significant impact on droughts, floods, landslides, hydropower, agriculture and drinking water availability. Effective policy making at the national and regional levels with detailed maps of the emissions sources as well as free-flow of real time data to the public and policy makers across borders might help improve the situation."
Ending conventional brick fields," Finance Minister AMA Muhith on Tuesday said a timeframe has to be set to eliminate conventional brick fields from the country. Supporting an idea of introducing hollow-block in building construction for the sake of environment and saving the top soil, he said, ""We must set a timeframe to bring an end to the production of conventional bricks. We must bring them under control. ""The Finance Minister said this while addressing a seminar on energy efficiency organised by Power Division at Mukti Hall of Biduyt Bhaban in the city./Chaired by Power Division additional secretary Tapos Kumar Roy, the seminar was addressed, among others, by State Minister for Power and Energy Nasrul Hamid Bipu and Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman AR Khan. Power Division joint secretary Siddique Zobair made a presentation at the seminar, titled 'Energy Saving in Bangladesh: problems and possibility'. The government has undertaken a programme to replace the conventional brick fields with automatic ones which is experiencing difficulties. Efforts must continue in this regard. Still, there's enough time for replacing the bricks with hollow blocks. Mass awareness needs to be created./The country's power generation capacity is more than 10,000 MW, but supply is about 7,000 MW because of weakness in transmission and distribution system. Also there must be special incentives for renewable energy-related products to promote green energy across the country. There should be incentives for those real estate companies that will set up green buildings through using energy efficiency equipment and power system./The production and use of conventional brick in real estate is destroying our top soil and other environments as well. No fruits are produced in Keraniganj because of pollution by more than 100 brick fields there. Industries will get tax benefits for going outside Dhaka. But this has led to indiscriminate and unplanned setting up of industries in rural areas which creates a big problem for power supply and distribution.

Generally there are four types of medium./They are namely: written , verbal, nonverbal and visual.Along with these communication mediums , there are also two other types of medium-Physical Media and Mechanical media .All these mediums can be used by the HR division for recruitment purpose .The sue of these mediums should be made intelligently by keeping the nature of recruitment in mind .Sharing of detailed and necessary information is also must to avoid any incident of misleading the target people Different mediums have different levels of appeal to different groups of people. Not one single medium should work for all kinds of target people.So the use of mediums and the use of proper language are important for the right recruitment process.All the mediums have both some positive and negative aspects.The HR division should try to avoid the negative aspects and try to utilize the positive aspects so that the use of mediums can be counted as blessings for them, not as curse./One very important thing to remember for the HR managers is that the trend of medium always changes . So they have to keep themselves open to adapt any change that may take place in the media Jalal Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury Dhaka Dhaka unfit for living The Dhaka metropolis has become unfit for living .Every day the flood of human beings who enter Dhaka from other districts should be lessened gradually.

Kabir Ahmed Gulshan, Dhaka Unplanned urbanization Unplanned urbanization is plaguing the cities of the country and is leading to land-grabbing of arable and shallow water-bodies. Population of Dhaka city is growing fast as a large number of people are coming to the city every day for different purposes, from the adjoining upazillas and districts./Dhaka already has become unmanageable city due to huge pressure of increased people. The situation of Dhaka city will be worsened, if we fail to take proper plans to address emerging future challenges for sustainable development of the city. Other big cities including Chittagong also are witnessing mounting pressure to meet the demand of increased population and a vast tract of arable land across the country is losing due to unplanned urbanisation keeping a negative impact on the agriculture sector of the country There is now the urgent need for a comprehensive plan to accommodate the gradually increased people and for ensuring planned urbanisation. There are many reasons why people are flocking to the urban centres and most important reason is economic. Bangladesh urgently needs a holistic urban strategy both to manage urbanisation and to maximise the growth potentials of urban centres and the public agencies, academic and research institutions and NGOs have to come up with a comprehensive and realistic plan to solve the problems./Kabir Ahmed Gulshan, Dhaka Groundwater irrigation created arsenicosis Arsenicosis is a bane cast on our water resources.

Cataracts," A cataract is a clouding of the eye's natural lens, which lies behind the iris and the pupil. The lens works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina at the back of the eye. The lens also adjusts the eye's focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away. The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it. But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it harder to see. Researchers are gaining additional insights about what causes these specific types of proteins (crystallins) to cluster in abnormal ways to cause lens cloudiness and cataracts./One recent finding suggests that fragmented versions of these proteins bind with normal proteins, disrupting normal function. Cataracts are classified as one of three types: A subcapsular cataract begins at the back of the lens. People with diabetes, highfarsightedness or retinitis pigmentosa, or those taking high doses of steroids, may develop a subcapsular cataract. A nuclear cataract is most commonly seen as it forms. This cataract forms in the nucleus, the center of the lens, and is due to natural aging changes. A cortical cataract, which forms in the lens cortex, gradually extends its spokes from the outside of the lens to the center. Many diabetics develop cortical cataracts. Symptoms and signs A cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting. A cataract may make light from the sun or a lamp seem too bright or glaring./Or you may notice when you drive at night that the oncoming headlights cause more glare than before. Colors may not appear as bright as they once did. The type of cataract you have will affect exactly which symptoms you experience and how soon they will occur. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in your near vision, called ""second sight."" Unfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract worsens. On the other hand, a subcapsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it's well-developed. If you think you have a cataract, see an eye doctor for an exam to find out for sure. Causes No one knows for sure why the eye's lens changes as we age, forming cataracts. Researchers are gradually identifying factors that may cause cataracts - and information that may help to prevent them. Many studies suggest that exposure to ultraviolet light is associated with cataract development, so eye care practitioners recommend wearing sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat to reduce your exposure./Other types of radiation may also be causes. For example, a 2005 study conducted in Iceland suggests that airline pilots have a higher risk of developing nuclear cataract than non-pilots and that the cause may be exposure to cosmic radiation. A similar theory suggests that astronauts, too, are at risk from cosmic radiation. Other studies suggest people with diabetes are at risk for developing a cataract. The same goes for users of steroids, diuretics and major tranquilizers, but more studies are needed to distinguish the effect of the disease from the consequences of the drugs themselves. Some eye care practitioners believe that a diet high inantioxidants, such as beta-carotene (vitamin A), selenium and vitamins C and E, may forestall cataract development. Meanwhile, eating a lot of salt may increase your risk. Other risk factors include cigarette smoke, air pollution and heavy alcohol consumption. A small study published in 2002 found lead exposure to be a risk factor; another study in December 2004, of 795 men age 60 and older, came to a similar conclusion./But larger studies are needed to confirm whether lead can definitely put you at risk and, if so, whether the risk is from a one-time dose at a particular time in life or from chronic exposure over years. Treatment When symptoms begin to appear, you may be able to improve your vision for a while using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, appropriate lighting or other visual aids. An intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted in the eye in place of the clouded natural lens. Shown is Alcon's AcrySof Natural IOL; it filters out blue light, which may be harmful to eyes. Think about surgery when your cataracts have progressed enough to seriously impair your vision and affect your daily life. Many people consider poor vision an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain vision./Cataract surgery is very successful in restoring vision. In fact, it is the most frequently performed surgery in the United States, with more than 3 million Americans undergoing cataract surgery each year. Nine out of 10 people who have cataract surgery regain very good vision, somewhere between 20/20 and 20/40. During surgery, the surgeon will remove your clouded lens and in most cases replace it with a clear, plastic intraocular lens (IOL). New IOLs are being developed all the time to make the surgery less complicated for surgeons and the lenses more helpful to patients. Presbyopia-correcting IOLs potentially help you see at all distances, not just one./Another new type of IOL blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays, which research indicates may damage the retina (see illustration). Read more on this website about what to expect if you have cataract surgery and how to deal with rare cataract surgery complications. Also, men should be aware that certain prostate drugs can cause intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) during a cataract procedure"
Dhaka-Aricha highway," The priority projects of the present government are the development of the country's highways with four lanes. In the meantime, work on four lanes of the Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Mymensingh highway has advanced. Government will start implementing four lane-highway on the Dhaka-Tangail and Dhaka-Sylhet. But the entry-point to the South-West, the Dhaka-Aricha highway is still untouched. From Dhaka Nabinagar to Paturia the road is of two lanes. If this is made into four lanes, the pressure on this road and traffic jam will lessen. People can travel more easily on this road. It is our appeal to the Communications Minister that the Dhaka-Aricha highway be made into four lanes as soon as possible. Kazi Abul Bashar Pallabi, Mirpur, Dhaka Increase of pension Previously during the fixation of pay in new pay scale, the pension of retired person used to increase by ten per cent only. At that time prices were static./But nowadays the commodity prices are rising rapidly and the retired persons are finding it difficult to survive on their pensions. The Prime Minister has realized the problem, and during announcement of the last pay scale considered the increase of pensions for pensioners by fifty per cent. WE are grateful to her. Those who have retired twenty years ago or before that, their pay scale has become five to six times by now. Those who are working get pay about five or six times that of the pensioners. The sons and daughters of pensioners are not being able to bear the cost of their parents. So the government should ease the condition of pensioners according to the needs of the time. With rise in pay scales, pensions should also rise. During retirement the government awards fifty per cent of pay as gratuity .The pensioner can now demand fifty per cent of the new pay scale as pension. In this situation during recommendation of new pay scale, the pension money should be also raised according to the new pay scale to fifty per cent of the pay scale./Monir Ahmed Choudhury Retired Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Public University expenses In our country there is scope of getting higher education from private and public universities. Though there are doubts about the educational standards of the private universities, the public universities are of uniformly high standard. The private universities charge a lot of money from its students for which meritorious but poor students cannot study in private universities. In public universities only the meritorious students study. But with evening part-time professionals teaching, weekends, and other such special occasions, the public universities are also taking large amount of fees. Public universities run with money of the public so they should bear the cost of the meritorious students./Those public universities have announced the fees for master's programme which are huge, they should bring the fees down to affordability of all students. I am drawing the attention of the Chancellor about these fees of public universities.

Repairing the roads costs a lot of money.Many roads still are unrepaired because of lack of funds.The carrying of heavy cargo inside Dhaka and other cities should be prohibited. Bangladesh is a riverine country. The cargo carried by trucks can be carried on the rivers.Otherwise all roads within the cities will become unfit for passenger vehicular travel.

Preventing drug business," At Banglabazaar Bank Hill and Amin Jute Mills colony under Bayazid Bostami Thana near Roufabad Starship lane, Yaba, Bangla liquor and whoring business is carried on This is going on for a long time. The local people are not getting results by asking the administration.On the other hand the drugs businessmen are heckling the complainants.Yaba and prostitution is going on at West Shahidnagar and AMIN Jute Mills Colony football field under the nose of the local administration. The youth are sinking due to the use of drugs The guardians are very worried. The Chittagong Metropolitan Police Commissioner and the Bayazid Bostami Than force should take steps to stop all these criminal acts Syed Al Mahmud Bayazid Bostami, Chittagong Talent or money The plan to increase the number of marks for oral examinations for appointment of teachers of primary schools is basically a corrupt plan./To increase the number of marks for oral examinations means opening up the path to corruption and bribery In those jobs where there are camparatively more marks in the oral part of the examinations has devalued merit. From PSC to university entrance examinations and service examinations question papers are being leaked out and answers sent by mobile phones SMS. Also the quota system is making the meritorious depressed. The meritorious are getting ahead in various examinations, but are falling behind in the test for money. If this goes on, in five years the youth of Sonar Bangla will not cultivate merit but try to earn money illegally. If there is money,there are jobs, mobile phone answers and without money there is no merit and no jobs. WE appeal to those who think about the country and the people, that the number of marks in oral examinations should not be increased as it is a blueprint for corruption. Md Rafiqul Islam Tangail Preserving graves of Muktijoddhas The government has taken up the preservation of the graves of Shahid and awarded muktijoddhas./The work of preservation of Shahid Muktijoddhas has already started. Soon the preservation of graves of awarded Muktijoddhas will start. This is very praiseworthy step of the government. WE can preserve the memory of the Liberation War for future generations. Shamsul Haq is a Muktijoddha who was awarded Bir BIkram. He used to work in the armed forces. He was working for the eight East Bengal regiment during Pakistani times. He was naib Subadar. He rushed into the War of Liberation on 25th March, when the Pakistani army started attacking. He fought in the Greater Chittagong area.Then he became part of the Zforce and fought in Sector number four.He received the Bir Bikram award for his heroism ion the battle of Kanaighat in December, 1971.

They are disappointed because the announcement was not realized. Eighty percent of the people of Bangladesh are agriculturists and dependent on agriculture. The country's highest development is from the agriculture sector. The country is now selfsufficient in food. The Dpiloma Krishibid Subassistants are working tirelessly, working with the sweat of the brow defying rain and sun. And their very small but logical demand for the tenth grade salary scale and second class officer status is not being fulfilled.The Prime Minister had agreed to their longstanding demand and announced about the tenth grade salary and second class status.

"Try jam today; Policies to slow down warming may be more attractive if framed as ways of speeding up growth,"," FOR years, people who worry about climate change have tried to persuade, cajole or scare governments into doing more to stop it. Nothing has made much difference. Carbondioxide emissions have risen relentlessly; in 2013 the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased at its fastest rate for 30 years. Now, a team of the great and the good has a cannier pitch. In the leadup to the New York climatechange summit they have issued a report arguing not that global warming will destroy the Earth, but that much of what is needed to reduce its risks would be a good idea anyway. The group is chaired by Felipe Calderon, a former president of Mexico, and Nicholas Stern, author of an early review of the economics of climate change which played up the costs of inaction more than benefits of action./Its members are a Who's Who of global influence: four former presidents or prime ministers; two Nobel economics laureates (Michael Spence of New York University and Daniel Kahneman of Princeton); and a bevy of people from all the main multilateral financial institutions (such as the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank). They are people who know what presidents and finance ministers think is important, which is getting and keeping economies going. ""Better Growth, Better Climate"" starts not with threats to the environment but with weak global demand and dangers to jobs and income. Productivity and job growth in rich countries is feeble; middleincome countries are only rarely graduating into the rich club; poor countries fear they will not catch up. The solution, say the authors, is structural reform in urban infrastructure, in farmland and forests and in energy markets./Not by coincidence, these areas between them account for the lion's share of greenhousegas emissions. Cities and their inhabitants' consumption account for about 70% of global emissions. They are also where almost all the world's net population growth will occur in the next 20 years. For leaders of middleincome and poor countries getting urbanisation right is already critical. The report says ""getting it right"" means encouraging cities that are dense, not spread out, with good public transport, not clogged highways. Sprawl wastes money. It ends up subsidised through the provision of more extensive systems of roads, sewers and the like; it reduces the gains in productivity that agglomeration provides. The report reckons that sprawl costs America $400 billion a year and quotes research from China that says labour productivity would rise 9% if its cities were denser./The authors reckon better infrastructure policies would lower the capital requirements of urbanisation by $3 trillion over the next 15 years and be popular, too (riots in Brazil this summer were partly over the poor quality of urban services). Happily, they would also cut greenhousegas emissions by the equivalent of 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, mainly because commuters would switch from cars to public transport (or bicycles). The report also pays a lot of attention to agriculture and forests, which are economically important in low and middleincome countries and account for a quarter of the world's emissions. At the moment, governments spend about $16 billion a year on agricultural research and development in developing countries; this, the report says, should be doubled. It also calls for drastic changes to farm subsidies. Subsidies for fertilisers lead to their overuse in many places, which brings with it environmental problems including the emission of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas. Where this happens, fertiliser subsidies should be cut back. If all this were done, the authors calculate, greenhousegas emissions could be the equivalent of 4.2 billion to 10.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide less per year than they would otherwise be by 2030./Lastly, the report proposes a combination of subsidy cuts and new investment in energy. Subsidies on fossil fuels (mainly in oilexporting countries) run at $540 billion a year, a massive encouragement to burn carbon that should be done away with. So, to the extent practicable, should the use of coal. Over the past decade increased electricity demand has been mostly met by coalfired power plants, especially in China and India. If they continue in this way both countries will soon be importing huge amounts of coal, which would lead to higher, more volatile prices. And coal also kills a lot of people. Outdoor air pollution, largely from coal though also from cars and other industry, kills 4m people a year, more than any infectious disease, and in so doing has huge economic effects (see chart). The authors argue therefore that some of the $45 trillion of infrastructure spending needed to keep up with energy demand in emerging markets over the next 15 years should go on encouraging lowcarbon renewable forms of energy./Add that strategy to greater energy efficiency and reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and you save greenhousegas emissions equivalent to another 5 billion7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. The authors thus think their prescriptions could reduce annual greenhousegas emissions by as much as the equivalent 24 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. At the moment emissions are equivalent to 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year; at current rates that will rise to 68 billion tonnes by 2030. Models based on a need to keep warming at or below 2Aâ(EURO)sÂ°C, compared to the preindustrial climate, suggest they need to drop to 42 billion tonnes by then. So at best the report's measures could deliver 90% of that; a lower limit might be 50%. And there would be a lot more cuts to make post2030. But if such reforms deliver growth, too, they will not just endear themselves to politicians. They will make at least some of the world better able to pay the costs of adapting to the climate change it has failed to avert"
Air pollution causing deadly health crisis,"ames Gallagher/_: New schools, care homes and hospitals should be built far away from major roads because of the dangers of air pollution, a report by MPs says. The Environmental Audit Committee argues air pollution is a ""public health crisis"" causing nearly as many deaths as smoking. It also suggested a scrappage scheme for diesel cars to cut emissions. The government said it was ""investing heavily"" in clean air, but campaigners said it was ignoring the issue./There are an estimated 29,000 deaths annually in the UK from air pollution. Nitrogen dioxide is known to cause inflammation of the airways, reduce lung function and exacerbate asthma. Particulate matter  tiny invisible specks of mineral dust, carbon and other chemicals  are linked to heart and lung diseases as well as cancer. Some particulate matter lodges in the lungs, while the finest particles can enter the bloodstream, risking damage elsewhere in the body. Joan Walley, the committee chairwoman, told the BBC: ""There is a public health crisis in terms of poor air quality./There are nearly as many deaths now caused by air pollution as there are from smoking, so the main thing is we stop a new generation of children being exposed."" She said government ""should make it impossible"" for new schools, care home or health clinics to be built in pollution hotspots. She added that ""well over a thousand"" schools were already near major roads and that it ""made sound economic sense"" to filter the air coming into the buildings./The committee's report says traffic is responsible for 42% of carbon monoxide, 46% of nitrogen oxides and 26% of particulate matter pollution. It said government had promoted diesel vehicles as they produced less of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. But the committee said diesel was now seen as ""the most significant driver of air pollution in our cities"". They called for government to pay for diesel drivers to upgrade their engines or for a national scrappage scheme to take the most polluting vehicles off the road. Dr Ian Mudway, a lecturer in respiratory toxicology at King's College London, told the BBC: ""The evidence is there./The 29,000 figure is very solid, so really it is a case of acting. ""But it is a strange one, because it's their third [report] in five years and it is an attempt to get the government to do anything."" The British Lung Foundation said the recommendations ""may seem drastic"", but air pollution was so bad they were necessary ""to protect the nation's health""."
Quit tobacco for a safe and healthy life," Every year on 31 May, World No Tobacco Day reminds us that tobacco causes health problems that include sickness, pain, grief, and misery due to various diseases and involves many medical costs for the treatment. In addition to medical costs, there are other indirect costs including lost of productivity, fire damage, and environmental harm etc. The day is observed every year in the member countries with a theme selected by the WHO./The theme of the World No Tobacco Day for 2015 is Stop illicit trade of tobacco. World No Tobacco Day provides an opportunity to create attention and action for all the partner countries, non-government organizations, and individuals in every community to work together for a tobacco-free environment that can ensure better health./The global tobacco epidemic kills nearly 6 million poeple each year of which more than 600000 are non- smokers dying from breathing second-hand smoke./Unless proper steps taken, the empdemic will kill, more than 8 million people every year by 2030 and more than 80% of these preventable deaths will be among people living in low and middle-income countries. In Bangladesh, 43% of adults use some form of tobacco./Smokeless tobacco is used by 28% of women and 26% of men, whereas 45% of men and 1.5% of women smoke cigarettes. 57,000 people die every year from tobacco related diseases and 3,82,000 people were suffering from diseases and disabilities due to use of tobacco./At this scenerio, as a member country, Bangladesh will also observe the day in a befittig manner to materialze the WHO strategies and policies for the health benefit of the people. Why innocent non-smokers will be vulnerbale to the deadly habit of smoking: This is a question why at no fault of the non-smokers they will be vulnerable to the deadly habit of smoking. It is fact that non- smokers cannot be safe so long, there are smokers around. In anyway if non-smokers happen to inhale the air polluted by tobacco smokers they run the same risk as the smokers for having the adverse effect of smoking. This is called second-hand smoke./Second- hand smoke is the smoke that fills restaurants, offices or other compact spaces when people burn tobacco products such as cigarettes, bidis and water pipes.WHO facts reveal that there are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke of which at least 250 are know to be hrmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory disease, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight./Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places. Over 40 percent of children have at least one smoking parent. Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care, and hinder economic development. As such, steps have been taken by various governments to protect the rights of the non- smokers./In our country non-smokers' rights have been protected in the tobacco control law. Tobacco accelerates poverty: Tobacco and poverty create a vicious circle. Tobacco use is higher among the poor. Poor familires, in turn spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco./Money spent on tobacco deprives the family of basic human needs such as food, shelter, education, and health care. Tobacco accelerates poverty among users and their families since tobacco users are at much higher risk of falling ill and dying prematurerly of cancers, heart attacks, respiratory diseases or other tobacco- induced diseases./Specific goals of the World No Tobacco Day 2015: Raise awareness on the harm to people's health caused by the illicit trade of tobacco products, show how health care gains and progrmmes, tobcco control policies like increased tax and prices, pictorial health warnings and other measures are undermined by the illicit trade in tobacco products, demonstrate how the tobacco industry is involved in the illicit trade of tobacco products, highlight how the illicit trade of tobacco products is a means of accumulating wealth for cirminal groups to finance other organizxed crime activities including drugts, human and arms trafficking, as well as terrorism and hinder promote WHO framework convention on tobacco control./Taxes help reduce tobacco use: WHO studies shows that tobacco taxes are the most effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among young people and poor people./A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10 percent decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 percent in high-income countries and by upto 8 percent in low-and middle-income countries./Tax structure on cigarettes in Bangladesh is based on 4 stages, the lowest being 40% and the highest 60%. The supplementary duty/tax on bidis ranges between 20% and 25% depending on whether it has filter or not./In the last budget, it was sought to impose 1 percent health development surcharge on all imported and domestically produced tobacco products for utilizing the fund collected from this source on the treatment of the victims of tobacco related diseases. This was a praiseworthy step, but it has to be higher and effectively introdued for the health and welfare of the people. Revolutionary steps by the Government: Bangladesh Government is working seriously towards implementation of the tobacco control law, which resulted in passing of the Tobacco Control Amendment Bill by the Parliament in April 2013 over the many loopholes of previous law./This was an important step in the history of tobacco control movement in Bangladesh. The features of the law are: the scope of tobacco control measures have been extended to include smokeless tobacco products, Graphic/Pictorial health warnings, covering 50% of the surface, on both tobacco packet sides (also chewing tobacco and bidis) are included./The fine for smoking at public places or transports has been increased from 50 taka to 300 taka. Establishment of the National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is a milestone, which works for the proper implementation of the law, monitor tobacco control activities, research on tobacco control and do related activities/actions on tobacco control for the health and welfare of the people./Tobacco users need help to quit: WHO fact reveals that smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most of them want to quit the deadly habit. As nicotine exists in tobacco, it becomes difficult on the part of the smokers to quit./Nevertheless, counselling, cooperation from the near and dear ones, medication and various awareness measures can help a smoker to quit the habit. The history of tobaco control movement in Bangladesh is glorious. With the establishment of National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the movement got strong footing./WHO theme, Stop illicit trade of Tobacco on the day is an opportunity for all involved in tobacco control programme./Different NGOs, health personnel, policiy makers, social workers, academic institutions, and individuals are working towards a tobacco-free environment. We have many achievements in this regard. Nevertheless, we have to work against tobacco until the last victory./Working together, we shall be able to quit tobacco for a safe and healthy life for all. (M A Jabbar writes on health and environment issues and is executive secretary of ADHUNIK, national anti- tobacco organization of Bangladesh.)"
Cleaning pollution," Bangladesh faces major challenge of environmental degradation that needs to be corrected for avoiding health hazards and economic catastrophe. The situation is taking alarming turn in the urban areas especially in the capital city of Dhaka. The environmentalists identified slums, setting up garment industries in the residential areas and Hazaribagh tannery as the major sources environmental pollution in the metropolis./According to a report about 25 people die every year due to poisonous effect of pollution. The slums are major source of pollution in the urban areas. An estimated half a million people live in sub-human condition in the slums./These people have no access to sanitation and health care. The slum people pollute water and they themselves use the same dirty water for drinking and cooking that results in spread of water borne diseases. The slums are raised around the densely populated areas .So the pollution in the slums affect the citizens as a whole./The setting up of garment industries in the residential areas create the same problem. The black smokes emitting from the factories is also polluting environment. It is frightening to think of disastrous effect of Hazaribagh tannery. The area is not liveable at all. The wastes from the tanneries are polluting the water of the river Buriganga which is now a dead river./It remains an utter surprise that the govern ment has been failing again and again to relocate the tennaries from Hazaribagh to somewhere in Savar. The government sources blame unwillingness of the owners to complying to the government order./This is simply ridiculous becacse that government that fails to compel the citizens to listen to the government, has no right to govern. It is primarily responsibility of the government to relocate the tennaries from the densely populated city area to the isolated industrial zonespecially to be set up for the hazardous industries like the tennaries. Environmental concerns remains paramount to integrate development with the clean environment to save the life of the people and the nature. But our planners unfortunately, do not give enough attention to this issue. There are scores of seminars and workshops in the country to improve the environment. But in reality there has been very little improvement in air pollution and sanitation. The government should give priority to fight the environmental hazards particularly in the city slum areas to protect the people and the nature. The World Bank and other multilateral donors are providing fund for improving the environment. But unfortunately, the government's prioritization is lacking in this sector."

Nowadays there are no such advertisements in radios and TV stations. But smoking is seen in many plays and cinemas by the stars. In our neighbouring country, India, before every cinema starts, it is publicized that ""Smoking is injurious to health"" But in our country such statements are not given in cinemas and plays. Smoking may be needed for the sake of the story in plays and cinemas, but there should be a warning message that smoking causes cancer.

I appeal to the concerned authorities to open a branch of Pubali and other banks at the Narisha bazaar. Md Rakibu Hasan Narisha, Dhaka Establish more technical schools BRAC has a good number of primary schools completing 5 years primary schooling curriculum in four years. BRAC has also been replicating its model to other countries in the world./Now, BRAC, the largest NGO in the world, has established a few secondary schools across the country particularly in the rural areas. We learnt from the print media a few years ago that the government incurred loss of Tk. 600 crore yearly due to excessive educational institutions across the country which numbers near 5000. Moreover, we find in many intermediate colleges there are more teachers than students and many teachers enjoy more off days than working days and even they take one or two classes in a week Grade IX can be opened in those intermediate colleges as early as possible./The government is going to establish 100 technical schools in some upazilas. Technical schools are more suitable for us than general schools. We also know that some other NGOs are also working in the education sector aiming uplift there./We had an experience to prepare lessons for using in the computer classes. We had an acute shortage of animators for preparing the computer lessons. But this type of work, I think can be done by our students of grade V if they receive 6 months training on it. So, we ask BRAC as well as other NGOs to establish more Technical schools rather than general schools across the country and turn general schools into technical schools."
"Outdoor air pollution killed 0.65 million Indians in 2010, says study"," These deaths were in adults older than 30 years and children younger than five years. Of the 3.3 million premature deaths worldwide in 2010 caused by outdoor air pollution, about 0.65 million deaths took place in India. These deaths were in adults older than 30 years and children younger than five years. India has the second highest premature deaths caused by outdoor air pollution. With 1.35 million deaths annually, China ranks number one in the world./A study published today (September 17) in the journal Nature has for the first time taken into account the data from highly polluted regions like Asia for estimating the global mortality caused by air pollution. At 0.32 million, more than half of premature mortality due to outdoor air pollution in India was from residential energy use for heating and cooking. Power generation was the second biggest culprit causing nearly 90,000 deaths in 2010. Of the seven sources of outdoor air pollution, residential energy use is the most important category that causes the most premature deaths worldwide./""It contributes to one-third of premature mortality globally,"" J. Lelieveld, the first author from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany, said in a press briefing. ""Residential energy use is an inefficient form of fuel combustion that causes lot of smoke and is by far the most important cause of premature mortality in Asia./Emissions from residential energy use, together with waste disposal and diesel generators, contributes to 32 per cent deaths in China but 50-60 per cent in the case of India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam./While outdoor household air pollution from solid fuels was the leading cause of mortality (0.44 million deaths) even in China, other sources like agriculture (0.39 million deaths) power generation (0.24 million deaths) caused a sizable number of deaths unlike in India. Air pollution is associated with many health impacts. The different disease categories include cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease leading to strokes and heart attacks. ""Strokes and heart attacks are responsible for nearly 75 per cent of air pollution related mortality, and more than 25 per cent is related to respiratory disease and lung cancer,"" said Dr. Lelieveld./What is of greater concern, particularly for India and China, is that the authors' estimate of 1 million premature deaths globally due to emissions from solid fuel and also waste disposal and diesel generators is in addition to the 3.54 million deaths per year due to indoor air pollution from the same sources. According to Dr. Kalpana Balakrishnan, who is not connected with the study and is the Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health at Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, there were one million deaths in India in 2010 due to household air pollution from solid fuels./If emissions from residential energy use cause one- third mortality worldwide, another one-third comes from power generation, industry, biomass burning and land traffic. But these have a relatively smaller contribution in the case of India - 90,000 deaths from power generation, 42,000 deaths from industry, 42,000 deaths from biomass burning, and 30,000 deaths from land traffic./On the basis of model projections, the authors predict that premature mortality from outdoor air pollution could double by 2050 on the basis pf projected rates of increase in pollution and population levels, with 6.6 million premature deaths forecast globally per year, including large increases in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific. While 1 million lives can be saved every year by reducing ambient exposure to pollution, about 3.54 million lives can be saved annually by lowering indoor exposure to PMemissions, notes Michael Jerrett from the University of California, Los Angeles, in an accompanying News article. ""The improved chulhas, which are supposed to be smokeless, provide very little health relevant exposure reduction,"" Dr. Balakrishnan said./That is because solid fuel can't be burnt in relatively inexpensive stoves. There is compelling evidence to move towards cleaner fuels than cleaner chulhas."
Leaving Our Children Nothing," Our generation has a unique opportunity. If we set our minds to it, we could be the first in human history to leave our children nothing: no greenhouse-gas emissions, no poverty, and no biodiversity loss. That is the course that world leaders set when they met at the United Nations in New York on September 25 to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 17 goals range from ending poverty and improving health to protecting the planet's biosphere and providing energy for all. They emerged from the largest summit in the UN's history, the ""Rio+20"" conference in 2012, followed by the largest consultation the UN has ever undertaken./Unlike their predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals, which focused almost exclusively on developing countries, the new global goals are universal and apply to all countries equally. Their adoption indicates widespread acceptance of the fact that all countries share responsibility for the long-term stability of Earth's natural cycles, on which the planet's ability to support us depends. Indeed, the SDGs are the first development framework that recognizes a fundamental shift in our relationship with the planet. For the first time in Earth's 4.5-billion-year history, the main factors determining the stability of its systems are no longer the planet's distance from the sun or the strength or frequency of its volcanic eruptions; they are economics, politics, and technology. For most of the past 12,000 years, Earth's climate was relatively stable and the biosphere was resilient and healthy. Geologists call this period the Holocene./More recently, we have moved into what many are calling the Anthropocene, a far less predictable era of human-induced environmental change. This fundamental shift necessitates a new economic model. No longer can we assume - as prevailing economic thinking has - that resources are endless. We may have once been a small society on a big planet./Today, we are a big society on a small planet. And yet, far from being utopian, the SDGs are achievable by 2030. Some countries, including Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are well on the way to achieving many of them, and much progress is being made elsewhere around the world. In the last few decades, poverty has been halved. Despite the headlines, violent conflict is on the wane. Diseases are being eradicated. The global population is set to stabilize. The ozone layer is showing signs of recovery. And the digital revolution is disrupting entire industries in ways that could benefit the planet./Eradication of extreme poverty is well within our reach. Today, about 800 million people live on less than $1.25 a day. According to a recent World Bank report, about 30% of them live in India, a sleeping giant about to industrialize, given the right incentives. Poverty is declining in other countries as well, including Nigeria (where 10% of the poorest live), China (home to 8%), and Bangladesh (6%). The main source of doubt concerns wealthy countries' commitment to help developing countries cut greenhouse-gas emissions as they end poverty./Without the proper assistance, poor countries risk becoming locked into reliance on coal and oil for at least another generation, putting the entire planet in danger of out-of-control climate change. World leaders need to realize that the cost of transforming the global energy system is far less than coping with the consequences of burning the planet's remaining fossil fuels. Research published this month concluded that consuming all remaining hydrocarbons would result in the melting of the entire Antarctic ice sheet, potentially raising sea levels by 58 meters. And higher sea levels are just one potential threat. Drought and crop failure resulting from climate change, for example, could trigger violent conflict. Fortunately, there is abundant evidence that countries and industries can thrive without contributing to climate change. By 2030, several countries are likely to have freed themselves from fossil fuels, with Sweden, France, and Germany probably in the lead. These countries will have less air pollution, improved health and wellbeing, and thriving economies./They will also place less pressure on the biosphere. By some estimates, life on Earth has never been so diverse. The value of biodiversity is that it makes our ecosystems more resilient, which is a prerequisite for stable societies; its wanton destruction is akin to setting fire to our lifeboat. Ending poverty and reducing emissions, including by effectively managing land use and halting deforestation, will go a long way toward stopping the trend and reversing the damage. Companies such as Ikea and Unilever are leading the way with genuine efforts to assume responsibility for the planet's climate, resources, and ecosystems./One reason is that rising consumer awareness makes ecosystem degradation bad for business. At the same time, all industries, from information technology to agriculture, depend on services provided by nature. Managing forests, rivers, grasslands, and coral reefs in sustainable ways makes them more resilient and increases their ability to absorb greenhouse gases, which is good for business./We are the first generation that can make an informed choice about the direction our planet will take. Either we leave our descendants an endowment of zero poverty, zero fossil-fuel use, and zero biodiversity loss, or we leave them facing a tax bill from Earth that could wipe them out."
Check dust pollution," Dust thou art, to dust returneth' is an inviolable truth. So, what is there in it to grudge about when the roads are dusty? Roads will naturally gather dust and it cannot be stopped any way. One will, perhaps, come by such a reply when he expresses his exasperation about the road dust./In fact, the matter of road dust is being trivialized. But, according to medical science, the hazard of road dust cries havoc. A report published in the News Today about road dust tells of the health perils. Healthcare has been the biggest casualty in the country. Ministry of Health, the Department of Environment (DoE), Bangladesh Poribesh Andolan (BAPA) and even the city fathers appear to be nonchalant in the imminent danger of road dust. Bangladesh Constitution was amended in 2011 to include a constitutional directive to protect the environment and natural resources for current and future generation./The pertinent question, therefore, is what then the authorities are doing to check the hazards of road dust that is polluting the environment? The answer is absolutely nix. According to experts, road dust recently has become the biggest source of pollution in the capital, especially during the dry season due to unplanned construction work. The air pollution from dust mixed with particles of cement, concrete crush, road stone crush used for asphalt ribbons and mega construction projects like flyovers, rail, road repairs, high rises, is destroying the city environment./The number of patients suffering from respiratory ailments like allergic cold, emphysema, bronchitis, asthma, obstinate cough etc has increased alarmingly because of dust pollution. The concentration of dust particles is on the constant rise. Dust generates wax in human ears and the number of ear-infection cases is up./Airborne dust from construction sites also causes ecological degradation including air and water pollution. Dust is also causing abnormal rise in pulmonary diseases and allergy among the city dwellers. Moreover, it contains harmful fly ash blowing from construction sites. Previously the municipal scavenging staff and sweepers would water the roads to remove the dust gathered on the roads. Unfortunately, this is not done now-a-days./The mayors should strictly see that roads are regularly kept clean of dust and dirt. It is sad that the DoE does not have any guideline to check dust. The construction firms, therefore, in performing their obligation to the citizens should take necessary measures to minimise dust pollution. The DoE must not sit idle to issue a meaningful guideline immediately to check dust pollution."
Creating awreness to prevent Cancer," World Cancer Day will be observed in Bangladesh on 4 February like elsewhere in the world. The World Health Organization with the cooperation of member states, health authority, works with the organizations like the International Union Against Cancr (UICC) on this day to promote ways to ease the global burden of cancer./The efforts focus on preventing cancer and raising awareness to prevent cancer and quality of life for cancer patients. WHO report 2012 reveals that cancer is on rise worldwide and more than 8 million deaths are responsible each year due to cancer. Facts also reveal that around 1 crore 40 lakhs people are added in the list of cancer patients annually./The Day provides an opportunity for governments, non-government organizations, and individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to a cancer-free societies and thus ensure better health for everybody. The theme of the World Cancer Day this year is We can. I can and gt; Cancer is a health problem that includes sickness, pain, grief, and misery. It poses significant economic burden on society. In addition to the direct medical costs of treating cancer-related illnesses, there are other indirect costs including lost of productivity due to absentism, low productity and loss of manpowr in the work-force. Other family members and or member of society cannot remain free from the burden of this health problem./As such, various efforts are taken to help promote the fight against different types of cancers. For example, the pink ribbon is a global symbol of breat cancer awareness, while the organge ribbin is associated with child cancert awareness./American Cancer Society sees daffodil as a symbol of hope that people share for a fuure where cancer is no longer a life-threatening disease. Food contamination and Cancer: Food items that we consume are contaminated in various ways. Food-grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, meat, milk, baker products, sweetmeats, ice creams, and soft drink are adultrated in various ways./As a result, harmful substances are entering to our body and destroying our vital organs -kidney, lover, brain, respiratory tract and cuses cancer of the body. Tobacco and Cancer: Scientfic study revels that there are 4,000 toxic substances in tobacco of which at least 30 are responsbile for cancer. Cigarettee and tobacco leaf are responsible for 60 percent of cancer and 80 percent of deaths are responsible for lung cancer due to smoking and use of tobacco leaf. The toxic of tobacco smoke entering in human body cause grave damage./There is no organ in the human body that cannot be free from these toxics. The other risk of factors of cancer that includes: use of alcohol, taking contaminated food, over-weight. Medical experts says that over-weight increases the risk factors of cancer like : colon, breast(menopuase women), ovary, kidney, liver, thyroid and blood cancer. Food habit is responsible for 30 percent of cancer. One need to take fruits and other healthy food free from contamination, Lack of physical exercise and hard work, passing luxury life are also contributory factors for cancer./Suffering from infectious disease for longer period like hepatiis B and hepatitis C, hormonal changes, some harmful chemicals, and unhealthy environment are also factors for cancer. Family history is responsible for 5 percent of cancer. In female breast cancer, colon, rectum, lung, ovary and cancer in stomach are responsible for life-style and food habit. Over-weight, not taking adequate amount of vegetables and fruits, lack of physical exercise and use of tobacco and jarda, use of alcohol are responsbile for 20 percent of cancer and 70 percent of lung cancer. Preventing cancer: Medical experts are of the opinion that one-third of cancer can be avoided if one can avoid factors responsible for cancer. Contamination-free food, avoiding alcohol, smoking, and tobacco, keeping body-weight normal, eating healthy and balanced diet, regular exercise, vaccine to prevent hepatitis B virus, avoid unhealthy environment and living in airpollution-free areas can contribute significantly to prevent cancer./Medical experts also say that early detection and proper treatment can significantly contribute preventing cancer. If age limit exceeds 50 years, all irrespective of gender should consult physicians and examine factors for colon cancer. Government of Bangladesh is wroking alongwith health partners to prevent deadly global health problem cancer. Alongwith government and WHO efforts, health personnel, NGOs, religious leaders, schoolteachers, and individuals may work to raise awareness to prevent cancer. The theme of the World Cancer Day is timely and appropriate. Working together, we can win over cancer for the benefit of the society and the people. M.A. Jabbar is a banker. He is also executive secretary of national anti-tobacco organization, ADHUNIK."
Perils of choking air in city," Air quality in the city of Dhaka has already become a health hazard. In the winter it has worsened affecting the health of dwellers, particularly the elder and children. They suffer from cold-related ailments and infection and lesions in throat./The harmful particulates in the air are dangerous for people. Dust aggravates the situation and adds to peril of people. ""They were digging the street beside your house. Sand was piled up on the other side. You are choked with dust when the wind blows. Layers of dust gather in your room if the windows are left open. The tree beside the street is like a metal sculpture."" It's how Department of Environment's Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) project Director SM Manzurul Hannan Khan describes the winter in Bangladesh's capital city, Dhaka. Not only in Dhaka, the level of harmful particles in the air increases in adjacent Gazipur and Narayanganj, and Chittagong, Barisal, Khulna and Rajshahi, making the air 'extremely unhealthy' on most days in the winter. Citizens, mostly children and elders, suffer from cold-related diseases and lesions in throats./Khan says air quality is worst in winter while the cities experience 'comparatively better' air during the rainy season. The CASE project calculated the amount of particulate matters in the air at 11 places in Bangladesh. The experts call air quality of an area 'good' when it earns less than 50 points in the Air Quality Index (AQI), a relative measure of the amount of air pollution./The standard varies by country. In Bangladesh the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants - Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone (O3). The other levels in AQI are Moderate (51-100), Caution (101-150), Unhealthy (151-200), Very Unhealthy (201-300), and Extremely Unhealthy (301-500). According to CASE data, the air was extremely unhealthy in Dhaka (403 points in AQI), Narayanganj (420), Gazipur (374), Chittagong (334), Rajshahi (347), and Barisal (402). The index was at 225 or very unhealthy level in Sylhet./The levels did not change on the following day, and not even by the end of the winter on Jan 18. The levels had been 'good' in all the cities on July 26 during the rainy season last year. Khan said there was no alternative to raising awareness against dark smoke emitted from vehicles and air pollution through construction. Geriatrics doctor Mahbuba Akter Arju said masks can be used to cut the amount of dust people inhale. Besides, spraying water on the streets will also help, she said. Dhaka South City Corporation official Abdullah Harun said water is being sprayed at some VIP points. Dhaka North official Tareque Bin Yusuf said they were yet to take any such step. ""The Department of Environment or other related authorities have not conveyed us anything,"" he said."
Dust daubs Dhaka," Road dust has become the biggest source of pollution in the capital city for various unplanned construction works, posing a severe health hazard to city dwellers. The city remains always covered with dust. The scavenging staff of the city corporations rarely clean the roads. Though sometimes it is seen that they work in the day time but their cleaning work further pollutes the air. The city has become an unlivable place due to dust and litters. According to the experts, the air pollution originating from construction work-related processes like concrete crushing, cement batching and road stone plants, is destroying the ecology and clean air. The city dwellers can hardly breath in fresh air./The city dwellers are exposed to dust pollution as the authorities concerned have taken no step to check. Dhaka city is a storehouse of air pollution where there is no guideline to check it. Dust has been contributing to rapid rise of lung diseases and allergy among the city dwellers. The dust contains fly-ash, which comes from construction sites, is very harmful to human health. Construction firms working in the capital do not take necessary measures to minimise dust. Although airborne dust has been emerging as a severe threat to the city dwellers, the Department of Environment (DoE) is yet to announce any guideline to check it. Although dust pollution is not limited to any specific area, some areas in the city are more dust pollution affected than others. Mohammadpur, Khilgaon, Hatkhola, Tejgaon, Tikatuli, Farmgate, Motijheel, Lalmatia, Rampura and Mohakhali are some of the worst affected areas. In recent years, the areas surrounding the under-construction Moghbazar-Mouchak flyover project are facing the worst kind of dust pollution. During a visit to the nearby areas, including Siddheshwari, Moghbazar, Malibagh, Mouchack and Banglamotor - a dismal scene of public suffering was noticed./Most passersby and commuters either wore face masks or covered their noses with their palms. Residents complained that not only they are having physical problems because of dust, their living condition is severely affected as well. Keeping their houses clean has become an almost impossible task. Dust is not only the flaky earthly substance, or dirt particles. There are many more elements that can be found in dust form in Dhaka's air./Dhaka's air contains smoke, soot, liquid chemical droplets and other miniscule particles that are so light that they can float, creating a hazy form. In Dhaka, dust originates from a variety of anthropogenic sources, such as brick kilns, open air industrial/household garbage burning, power plants, industrial processes, vehicles, fertilizer factories, sugar, paper, jute and textile mills, tanneries, garment, bread and biscuit factories, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, cement production and processing factories and other industrial settings inside or in the nearby areas of Dhaka. All of these sources produce enormous amount of smokes, fumes, gases and flakes which create miniscule aerial particles we perceive as dust. With rapid urbanisation, the demands for housing and other construction works are also increasing./A lot of old buildings are being demolished, and new buildings are being constructed all over the city. Demolition and construction of buildings produce a high amount of dust. During the construction of buildings, many house owners and concerned workers prefer to leave the raw materials like cement and sand uncovered on the open spaces near the construction site, which ultimately ends up being mixed in the air. People most at risk are children, the elderly, and people with respiratory or heart diseases, but people with healthy constitution are not immune to the effects either. Starting from nasal and eye irritation, a long list of diseases, some of which are fatal, can be attributed to dust pollution. Dust particles are so small that they pass through the nasal passage and travel to the deepest parts of the lungs and cause damage./Toxic and cancer-causing chemicals are too common and are often to be found in dust form as well. Other probable diseases include breathing difficulties, respiratory and pulmonary diseases, diminished lung function, weakened immune systems, pneumonia, asthma, emphysema, heart attacks and strokes."
Using smarter stoves," When it comes to cooking indoors over open fires, the harmful health effects can be equal to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. This indoor air pollution plagues nearly nine out of every 10 Bangladeshi households, which use wood and other biofuels to cook inside. Over time, exposure to smoke from indoor cooking leads to deadly diseases such as lung cancer, stroke, and heart disease. This is why it's the most deadly environmental problem in the world. In Bangladesh, such indoor air pollution is responsible for 10-15 percent of all deaths. It may seem obvious to say that we need to focus on cutting household air pollution. But such policies compete with many other potentially beneficial proposals for how to use scarce resources from the national budget or international stakeholders. So what are the very best policies?/This is what the Bangladesh Priorities - a cooperation with BRAC and dozens of the world's top economists - promises to help answer. Our research suggests two principal ways to help decrease deadly air pollution inside the home: People could either burn the same biofuels that most Bangladeshi households currently use, but with smarter cook stoves that emit much less pollution, or they could change to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which burns much more cleanly. The cheapest way to quality indoor air is to get widespread investment in an improved biomass cook stove./This is simply an enclosed stove, often with a chimney, that reduces heat loss, protects against the wind, and transfers heat to a cooking pot more efficiently than traditional stoves or open fires. It burns the fuel - often biomass - more effectively and hence with less pollution. In Bangladesh, the cost of such a stove with two burners and a chimney that will last three years is about Tk. 1,000 per year./This is both to cover the aggregate that needs replacement every third year, as well as some maintenance. And almost a third of the cost goes to promoting awareness of the opportunity in the first place. But the benefits are many. If all 30 million households switched to improved cook stoves, it would save more than 33,000 lives each year. Each life will live on average another 28 years, which is worth about Tk. 79 billion or Tk. 2,600 per household each year. Moreover, each family will get slightly fewer sick days, worth another Tk. 260. But the families would also save 15 minutes per day in cooking time, because the improved cook stoves are faster, and because less fuel is needed, it will reduce fuel collection time by half each day. In total, that benefit is worth another Tk. 2,000. For each Tk. 1,000 spent on a better cook stove, a family will get almost Tk. 5,000 in health and time savings benefits: every taka spent will do Tk. 5 of good./This is an important step to improve household air quality. But it still leaves most of the problem in place - we will only save 33,000 of 150,000 deaths each year. That is why we could consider a more thorough option. LPG burns very clean - almost like an electric stove. Adoption of these stoves would produce much higher benefits: it would save 91,000 lives, a total value of Tk. 218 billion, or Tk. 7,300 per household. It would also avoid some Tk. 700 of disease per household, speed up cooking by 40 minutes, and save all fuel collection time, at a net worth of Tk. 5,200. But, the cost of LPG is also significantly higher. It would cost about Tk. 10,000 each year, plus Tk. 2,000 in cooking fuel costs. In total, you would pay about Tk. 12,000 for about Tk.13,200 in benefits./So spending on LPG stoves would not be a loss. This shows that the most expensive option is not necessarily the best option. Cheaper options, despite helping less, can be a much better way to help everyone. In the long term, however, the more expensive options can be solutions. Many countries at similar income levels as Bangladesh have adopted modern cooking fuels such as LPG at substantially higher rates. But there are challenges to implementing smarter stoves. With some prior efforts, it has proven difficult to get households to adopt new stoves./And widespread adoption is crucial given the community-based nature of fighting air pollution. If not everyone in a community adopt improved cook stoves, there would be more local air pollution leading to fewer benefits. Well-targeted information campaigns about the benefits of cleaner cook stoves could help spread the message about their benefits, and projects should also tailor stoves to customers' preferences. And, ideally, households would be allowed to pay for stoves over the course of multiple installments, making them more affordable. Last week you saw how poverty policies can help do Tk. 2 of good for each taka spent. Making cook stoves cleaner can help fight household air pollution with about Tk. 5 of good for every taka spent. Are these some of the best investments for Bangladesh?"
Alarm bell rings for Dhaka," Special Correspondent An alarming note is being sounded, for pretty long now, that none of the rivers around Dhaka does contain the minimum level of dissolved oxygen (DO) required for life forms to survive. In other words, they are turning dead. In the death throes are Buriganga Turag, Shitalakkhya, Balu and Bangshi./Specially the first four are considered lifelines of the capital city. Without oxygen water is not possible and without water life gets extinct-the exactitude is evident now in many planets, including the moon. The Department of Environment (DoE) conducted a three-month study between January and March 2013 on the levels of DO in these river waters. The findings were alarming. The chemical analysis of various samples showed that in January, the levels of DO in the Buriganga, Turag and Bangshi were 0.38, 0.59 and 0.0 milligram per litre respectively. According to the Environment Protection Act (Amendment) 2010, the minimum requisite level of DO for any water body to sustain aquatic species, including fishes, is 5 mg/l./The standard is minimum 6 mg/l for water being eligible for treatment as drinking water. The anatomy of the aquatic environs of the city indicates that the water on which life and livelihood here sustain is passing through a vicious transformation, turning it into a veritable liquid like gel. Living beings cannot sustain in this zero-oxygen water and the city-dwellers cannot drink it safely even after treatment. Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa) leader Iqbal Habib said due to excessive presence of harmful Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) in the Buriganga river, authorities at the capital's Sayedabad Water Treatment Plant are forced to increase use of chlorine every day to make the water drinkable. However, as yet, the city residents cannot drink direct from WASA pipelines./A World Bank study says the four major rivers near Dhaka receive 1.5 million cubic metres of waste water every day from 7,000 industrial units in surrounding areas and another 0.5 million cubic metres from other sources. Unabated encroachment that prevents the free flow of water, the dumping of medicinal waste and waste of river passengers have compounded the problem, making the water unusable for humans and livestock, too./Unfortunately, all these bad things - encroachment, dumping of industrial waste and other abuses - occur in full knowledge of the authorities,"" said Prof Abdullah Abu Saeed, an eminent campaigner for 'Save Buriganga, Save Lives' civil-society movement. ""The water of the Buriganga is now so polluted that all fish have died, and increasing filth and human waste have turned it like a black gel. Even rowing across the river is now difficult for it smells so badly,"" he told reporters. ""The pollutants have eaten up all oxygen in the Buriganga and we call it biologically dead. It is like a septic tank,"" says another campaigner./It is stated by the greens that there is no fish or aquatic life in this river apart from zero-oxygen-survival kind of organisms. This is the scene on the surface-water front. Groundwater is also being contaminated with seeping toxic substances, such as chemicals like cadmium and chromium, and other elements such as mercury carried by the industrial waste. Such contamination of both surface water and groundwater is posing a serious health crisis. Serious diseases are on the rise. Water creates and sustains life. Scientists say life perished on many planets as sources of water over there dried up over zillions of years. Comes thereafter air-life stops if the breathing in of air stops. And concern grows over Dhaka's air quality, too. Noise and dust pollution also alarms experts. The air of Dhaka city is rated one of the worst in the world. The concentration of suspended particles in the air is many times higher than normal even by Bangladeshi standard./This air, which the city- dwellers and commuters breathe, contains lead in concentrations reportedly almost ten times higher than the government safety standard set by the Department of Environment (DOE). About 50 tonnes of lead is emitted into Dhaka city's air annually and the emission reaches its highest level in dry season (November-January), revealed a study conducted by scientists of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC)./The density of lead in the air of Dhaka city in dry season reaches 463 monograms, the highest in the world. Air pollution has become a matter of great concern for all. But progress in preventing such environmental pollution is not tangible despite campaigns and discursive drives. There are laws in place like the Environment Conservation Act and the Environment Conservation Rules. There is a separate ministry and also are there government departments and agencies. Their efforts prove not much effective so far while the situation keeps going from bad to worse. Surveys revealed basically two main culprits for air pollution in Bangladesh: industrial and vehicular emissions. Diesel-run vehicles account for more than 80 per cent of the air pollution in Dhaka as most of them fail to comply with the approved emission standard. On both these two accounts, the situation in the city is taking a terrible turn. Everything in the country is becoming Dhaka-centric for highly centralized administration, governance and even politico-electoral arrangements these days./The results are now human jam coupled with traffic jam. With a population boom in the capital, transport of variegated modes chocked up all thoroughfares. To rub salt into the wound, veritable dust cloud from construction sites and dug-up roads add to the human and transport fumes and sounds to create pernicious smog in the air and a brain-tormenting ambience all around. The pollutants mentioned above are all unavoidable accompaniments of increased economic activity for livelihood in the present state of affairs, no doubt./But how do you imagine of breathing a little fresh air here? Inhaling such air, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) findings and medical investigations, seriously affects the respiratory tract and causes irritation, headache, asthma, high blood pressure, heart ailments and even cancer. If this trend of air pollution continued, those living in major cities, including the capital, will become exposed to these diseases and health complications. So remedy brooks no further delay. Take a lesson from how other cities in Asia, including next-door Delhi, did it with the exercise of good governance and coordinated management initiatives./In New Delhi, the authorities in an attempt to reduce air pollution prohibited initially 20-year-old vehicles from plying on city streets in late 1990s. They started phasing out 17-year-olds from the end of 1998. Finally came the elimination of 15-year-old vehicles in 1999. Besides, registration of new auto-rickshaws with front engines was banned from 1996 and registration of old defence service and government-auctioned vehicles was banned from 1998. Traffic management saw more innovations now. Of late, concern grows over what happens if a major earthquake struck this city. A series of quakes in regional countries sending shocks and aftershocks into Bangladesh and the Ecuador disaster stoked up worries. Overhead bundles of electric lines and ineptly installed gas pipelines connecting industries, offices and homes are coming up as a major cause of concern. ""Dhaka city risks turning into a volcano for gas explosion at households in the event of a major earthquake as pipelines are not set scientifically and there is no recheck for years,"" architect Mobassher Hossain said at a TV talk show./As such, remediation is seen as a major remedy for these fault-lines in the jerry-built Dhaka metropolis and also in other cities. Retrofitting the vulnerable installations and supply lines should see a jumpstart. Also, experts say, it's incumbent upon the government to ensure that no buildings are constructed, henceforth, sans abiding by the national building code and quake-resistant technologies and materials."
Graphic health warnings for tobacco control," WHO and its member countries will observe World No Tobacco Day on 31 May like all the previous years to draw attention of all concerned and take action by the policy makers, health personnel, NGOs, civil society and in fact, every individual from their respective places. The day is an opportunity to recall the health hazards and economic losses of tobacco use and take action to address the same in an appropriate manner./WHO selects a theme every year for the day. The theme of the World No Tobacco Day for 2016 is Get Ready for Plain Packaging that highlights about the health risks associated with tobacco use and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption calling the member countries to get ready for plain packaging of tobacco products./As per Article 11 and 13 of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), Plain packaging is a key method to reduces the attractiveness of tobacco products, restricts use of tobacco packaging as a form of tobacco advertising and promotion, limits misleading packaging and labelling by the tobacco companies and increases the effectiveness of health warnings. According to Article 11 of the FCTC, the use of Graphic Health Warning (GHW) on tobacco packs is obligatory by the WHO member countries./The use GHW on tobacco packs remind the tobacco users every time about the harmful effects of tobacco when they use it and help them to refrain from this deadly habit. Example shows that the GHW has played significant role in reducing tobacco use in many countries of the globe./This was introduced first in Canada in 2001 and so far, over 77 countries have introduced GHW on tobacco packets. Data reveals that 90% GHW is used in Nepal, being the largest space, India 85%, Thailand has alloted 85%, Sri Lanka uses 80% and in Indonesia 40% of all forms tobacco packs contains graphical health warnings. We are aware that government of Bangladesh has made the 2005 anti-tobacco law more smarter and effective by an amendment which is a milestone in the history of tobacco control programme in the country. Section 10 of the amended law directed the tobacco companies for printing the graphical health warnings on top of both sides of tobacco packets, cover, and box covering at least 50 percent of the total area of each./It also says that if the section of the law is violated, the punishment contains rigorous imprisonment less than six months or monetary fine less than taka lwo lac. If the violations are occured second time, the punishment will be double gradually./Tobacco companies were given a 12-month deadline to obey the rules since activation of the law in 2015, which ended on 19 March 2016. Although Bangladesh government is relentlessly working for making the law fruitful and effective, but companies are active to thwart its efforts in many ways and stand on the way against implementation of the same./As per law, the tobacco companies were obligated to follow the government instructions and ensure the use of GHW at least 50 percent of both sides on tobacco packs as mentioned above, but most of them are not yet following the rules rather reluctant and continue to ignore the government instructions. As such, different anti-tobacco organizations and health foundation namely National Heart Foundation, Progga, Work for Better Bangladesh, Pratyasa, ADHUNIK, Manobik, Ubinig, Tabinaj, Anti tobacco media Alliance, Ahsania Mission and United Forum Against Tobacco and many other organizations raised voice against the tobacco companies./The anti-tobacco organizations also arranged human chain in different places of the country calling them to obey law or face tough situation. Simultaneously the anti-tobacco organizations extended helping hands to government and assured allout cooperation in its endeavour for implementation of the GHW by the tobacco companies./Facts about tobacco epidemic- In a situation where the global tobacco epidemic kills nearly 6 million poeple each year of which more than 600000 are non-smokers dying from breathing second-hand smoke, the epidemic will kill more than 8 million people every year by 2030 and more than 80% of these preventable deaths will be among people living in low and middle-income countries./Not only the smokers, but also tobacco causes harms to non-smokers: A non-smoker cannot be safe so long, there are smokers around. Non-smokers are vulnerable to the deadly habit of the smokers' smoking, which is called second-hand smoke without any fault of the non-smokers. They happen to inhale the air polluted by tobacco smokers and they run the same risk as the smokers. WHO facts reveal that there are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke of which at least 250 are know to be hrmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory disease, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places. Over 40 percent of children have at least one smoking parent./Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care, and hinder economic development. As such, this year's World No Tobacco Day theme -Get Ready for Plain Packaging is very timely and appropriate for tobacco control for the socio-economic and health benefits of the people. Situation in the country- In Bangladesh, 43% of adults use some form of tobacco. Smokeless tobacco is used by 28% of women and 26% of men, whereas 45% of men and 1.5% of women smoke cigarettes./Nearly one lac people die every year from tobacco related diseases and 3,82,000 people were suffering from diseases and disabilities due to use of tobacco. Economic losses of tobacco is also alarming, as data reveals that every year 1 percent of GDP is spent for cigarette and 0.4 percent of the same is spent on purchase of bidi. It is estimated that the country produces 8000 crore-stick cigarette and 5000 crore-stick bidi every year and cultivable land for crop production is diminising due to tobacco production and for longer period of tobacco cultivation, land fertility is at stake./The situation becomes aggravated when tobacco cultivation on the both side of bank of rivers and thereby mixing of tobacco chemicals with water during rainy season causes water pollution and seriously effect the water resources. Tobacco preparing cost is also alarming as for burning one ton of tobacco leaf, it is estimated that 5 ton of energy wood is burnt which is certainly a great loss to the economy. How to overcome the burden of tobacco hazards- The use of Graphic Health Warngins is a strong weapon for tobacco control for all. Article 11 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) urges upon the member states for introducing the Graphic Health Warnings on tobacco packs. It was proved most effective in many parts of the globe./Therefore, GHW should be introduced at the earnest way. Facts reveal that in December 2012, Australia became the first country to fully implement plain packaging. In 2015 Ireland, the United Kingdom of Great Britan and Northern Ireland and France all passed laws to implement plain packaging from May 2016. Most of the member countries are in advanced stages of considering adoption of plain packaging laws./As multiple approaches are essential to eradicate tobacco, in addition to GHW, there should be extensive application of taxation on all forms of tobacco alongwith graphic health warnings. Tobacco taxes are the most effective way to reduce its use, especially among young and poor people.WHO facts reveal that a tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10 percent helps decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 percent in high-income countries and by upto 8 percent in low-and middle-income countries. Therefore, taxation on tobacco should be encouraged and applied extensively on all forms of tobacco and tobacco products. It is worth to mention that tax structure on cigarettes in Bangladesh is based on 4 stages, the lowest being 40% and the highest 60%./The supplementary duty/tax on bidis ranges between 20% and 25% depending on whether it has filter or not. There should be a tax increase upto 200 percent on low-grade cigarettes and bidis, which will help increase government revenue and decrease demand particularly among the poor people. iii. Adequate steps should be taken to stop tobacco cultivation and supply chain be stopped. This should be materialized with priority basis and by providing loan to farmers on easy terms. iv. Smoking be prohibitted at all workplaces, factories, and industries and support center for the non-smokers including smokers who desire to quit smoking may be established in factores and industries. Study among the tobacco users indicates that most of them are aware of the dangers of tobacco and want to quit the deadly habit. As nicotine exists in tobacco, it becomes difficult on the part of the smokers to quit. In this respect counselling, cooperation from the near and dear ones, medication and various awareness measures can help a smoker to quit the habit./Bangladesh has played key role in implementing WHO strategies and policies relating to its tobacco control programme and is committed to eradicate tobacco from the society for health and socio-economic benefits of the people. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare along with other Ministries are working with the available resources in this respect. National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) under the Ministry of Health is playing important role in this respect. We have the support and strength of the head of the government./This has been reflected when the hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said at the South Asian Speakers' Summit that tobacco use would be eradicated by 2040, which refers that tobacco use will be brought below 5 percent and ultimately could be eliminated totally from the country. The use of Grapphic Health Warnings is a great weapon and can contribute significantly towards elimination of tobacco from the society./The World No Tobacco Day theme this year has created obligations for the tobacco companies and, on the other, opportunites for the policy-makers, health personnel, civil society and NGOs to work unitedly for a tobacco-free environment. Working together, we can achieve the goal. - M.A.Jabbar is executive secretary of ADHUNIK, national anti-tobacco organization of Bangladesh."
Checking air pollution brooks no delay," Fear or panic has become, as though, a constant companion of people's life recently thanks to multiple visible factors. But air pollution is an invisible danger larking in cities and elsewhere. Although the environment scientists and experts are gripped by pollution panic, government apathy to this crisis is alarming. The villain of the piece is the hazardous air pollution scenario; but the policymakers are the least bothered about it. An English daily has revealed that two years have elapsed, but a draft national Air Quality Index (AQI), sent to the environment and forests ministry, is yet to get its nod./The draft contained information about rising and health endangering pollution levels in major cities. We do not know how long the foot-dragging will continue, but in the meanwhile pollution can be extremely damaging to public health. Moreover, it is alleged that the policymakers do not have adequate knowledge about air pollution, according to a report./But ignorance cannot be bliss about a serious issue like air pollution and public health and it cannot be sidetracked for long. Expertise can be hired if necessary in view of the exigencies. We get startled to think when we hear an important official grousing that the air pollution issue does not get priority. The AQI had been prepared long ago; but it could not be announced for lack of political willingness. There was a bar imposed on the announcement of the AQI, said the official. It sounds illogical and irrelevant when it is learnt from the report that top government officials and political leaders fear that announcement of the AQI will expose the existing air pollution peril and subsequently discourage foreigners from visiting Bangladesh. But will this incoherent suppression of fact do any good to the country in a super-information age? The average concentration levels of the most critical air pollutant is particulate matter. Other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides have also exceeded the limit values of local standards./A study says air pollution causes about 15000 premature deaths in Bangladesh annually. If we can check air pollution, we can reduce the number of premature deaths and cut the cost of treatment of air pollution related diseases. It is learnt that an inter-ministerial meeting involving various stakeholders will be held after Eid-ul-Azha to discuss the air pollution issue and finalise a national standard of it. We expect that the meeting will give clearance to the air quality index draft submitted to the ministry which is of prime importance."
Nasrul for efficient use of energy from family," State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid Tuesday stressed the need for efficient use of fuel from family level to save energy. ""The government's initiative for availability of efficient energy equipment would be continued to mobilize consumers,"" he said while inaugurating a campaign programme for increasing use of modern stoves as the chief guest at Keraniganj upazila ground outskirt of the city./The Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) and Global Alliance for Clean Cook Stoves (GACC) jointly organised the campaign programme for modern stoves. The state minister said the modern stoves are environmentally friendly, as it consumed low fuel and low smoke, adding, ""The SREDA would take necessary measures to create public awareness in this regard."" ""We have to remember that we should keep our garbage in certain places, as the government has undertaken an initiative to generate electricity from garbage,"" Nasrul Hamid added. He, however, said the future energy would come from renewable energy./According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the conventional ovens emit toxic fume, which is one of the top five health risks./Each year around 50,000 people die due to room air pollution. It is necessary to implement the government's plan to install smoke free kitchens in the country by 2030, the state minister said. Among others, SREDA chairman Anwarul Islam Sikder, Keraniganj Upazila Chairman Shaheen Ahmed, a member of SREDA Zubair Siddiqui, Country Representative of GACC, Bangladesh Asna Tawfiq spoke in the function."
City air poisonous," The capital city Dhaka has become an unlivable place due to air pollution. The city is too dirty for a healthy living. Virtually the city management has been collapsed and there are no authorities to check the massive pollution. In recent years the problem is even more obvious in city like Dhaka, one of the fastest growing mega cities of the world, due to the unplanned urbanisation as well as expanding industrialisation. Study reveals that the unacceptable level of pollution of Dhaka city will lead to an unbearable livable condition within the next 10 years./Thus, Bangladesh has been ranked 169th out of 178 countries with worst urban air according to the Environmental Performance Index. People in Dhaka already face several problems arising from air pollution. Impact on human health and deterioration of ecosystem are common problems of air pollution in a local margin./Problems in respiratory tract, irritation, asthma, heart ailments, high blood pressure, hypertension, eye irritation, throat irritation, persistent cough, asthma, nose blockage, renal damage, are caused by breathing the unhealthy air. In fact according to The World Health Organization (WHO), vehicular air pollution is a major cause of respiratory distress of inhabitants living in urban areas of Bangladesh. Its extended impact on human health is bringing other major complications that are quite noticeable in recent time./It is also responsible for climate change due to its unstoppable emission of greenhouse gases that are causing enhanced greenhouse effect, acid rain etc. IPCC expresses the effectiveness of different Greenhouse gases such as CO2, NO2, CH4, CFCS, water vapour that are emitting from sources like fossil fuel burning, coal burning, transportation, land use change (deforestation), mining, landfills, industrial chemical production, electricity production, refrigerator, air conditioner, timber burning, fire extinguishers, in terms of participating in green house effects that consequently contributes to Climate change. Nevertheless, major air pollutants like u Page 15 col. 1 City air poisonous From Page 1 col. 2 CFCs are acting as major culprit while participating in the depletion of Ozone layer that constitute important global environmental problems. Air pollution occurs both outdoors and indoors and is caused by human activities and natural mechanisms./Although air quality degradation because of air pollution is a global problem that threatens humanity's wellbeing overall, it is largely associated with environmental injustice. There are a variety of potential causes for air pollution, including both natural and human-induced mechanisms. Natural causes of air pollution include volcanic activity, forest fires etc. But with huge populated urban area like Dhaka city, human induced causes are more dominant for participating in air pollution. vehicular emission, industrial emission (brick kilns, fertilizer factories, sugar, paper, jute and textile mills, spinning mills, tanneries, garment, bread and biscuit factories, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, cement production and processing factories, metal workshops, wooden dust from saw mills), biomass burning, open waste burning, burning coal or other fossil fuels for meeting energy demands are the major causes of air pollution./With the increasing rate of urbanisation, the number of vehicles is also increasing to meet up transportation demands of city dwellers. Diesel, petrol, CNG, octane running transportations like old large vehicles like trucks, Buses, poorly maintained CNGs, private cars, motorbikes are polluting the city by emitting gases and smokes. DoE (Department of Environment) expresses the effectiveness of Dust, particulate matter, smokes, CO2, NO2, CH4, and CFCS, which are emitting from the above mentioned sources and participating in the unwanted deterioration of environment. Study reveals that the average ambient concentration of air pollutants in Dhaka city is exceeding the limits of air pollutants set by the Department of Environment (DoE)./Properly designed laws, regulations enforcement by DoE (Department of Environment) and BRTA (Bangladesh Road Transport Authority), with the regular monitoring of the emission level of air pollutants, the problem can be minimised. Else initiatives like Pedestrian network improvement, improved non-motorised transportation introduction, and utilisation of low carbon transport can be prioritised to maintain the desired level of air emission. Hence, Social awareness about the consequences of environmental degradation caused by air pollution through mass media such as TV, radio and newspaper would also work as change agent."
Proper use of inhaler must to control asthma," Asthma patients must learn the proper way of using inhaler as the device has been proved to be the most effective means to control the disease, a leading chest disease expert told BSS. 'Inhaler is an effective way of treatment for asthma patients. Unfortunately, majority of asthma patients don't know the right use of it,' said Dr Shamim Ahmed, an associate professor of Pulmonology Department, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU)./He said asthma is a chronic disease that causes recurring wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The asthma medicine inside an inhaler goes straight into the airways of a sufferer's breathing system giving him or her relief./The obvious reason of coughing is coolness at night or early in the morning...but the exact cause for asthma is yet to be known,' he noted, adding in most cases the disease is mostly linked to hereditary and environmental factors including air pollution. Dr Shamim said the disease has genetic factors too and it travels from parents to children and thereafter. But there are some other causes, including respiratory infections, childhood viral infections in particular, that may affect the lining of the airways making them more exposed to triggers causing asthma./Air pollution is the prime cause of asthma in cities. But close proximity to animals as well as use of pesticides in agriculture and other biodegradable chemicals are also held responsible for asthma among the people,' he added. Dr Shamim explained that existence of atopic diseases like allergic rhinitis, eczema and allergic conjunctivitis were found to be significant risk factors responsible for development of asthma in both rural and urban areas. 'But, the prevalence of asthma is more in urban areas than the rural sites,' he added. Dr Shamim said generally it is not a curable disease, but carefulness in everyday life can effectively control it in larger cases. 'However, the best treatment still remains the inhaled steroids, while long-term oral steroids could create serious side-effects like malfunctioning of adrenal glands,' he added. He said it is not possible to avoid the contact of asthma triggers, but wearing safety masks regularly can diminish the chances of developing this disease. Since asthma is a chronic disease, he added, it should be managed at home, except the severe cases./If home management is done intelligently and skillfully, most asthmatic patients can lead a normal life. Dr Shamim also said avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing asthma infection. He mentioned that around 70-80 lakh people are suffering from asthma in the country and the number of patients are gradually increasing due to lack of knowledge about the disease and its management. In this context, he underscored the need for creating mass awareness to check the growing number of asthma patients."
Protect kids from pollution," Pollution here, there and everywhere makes our life insufferable. There seems to be no escape from the ubiquitous presence of pollution, particularly in the capital city. Media reports reveal an appallingly alarming state of pollution of various nature jeopardizing especially the health of children. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), seventeen lakh children under five die every year across the globe thanks to the unhealthy or polluted environment. In the state of Global Air Report 2017 released last month, Dhaka ranked the second city in the world with the worst air pollution which claims 122,400 lives in Bangladesh per year and majority of them are children. According to WHO findings, in Bangladesh, the death of 179 children under five in every one lakh people is attributed to environmental pollution./This means the number of such deaths is 2.8 lakh a year. This reflects how sad and bad is the impact of environment pollution on our children's health polluting their future. In Bangladesh, compared to other countries, the outdoor air pollution level is much higher owing to construction work all around and ever-increasing number of vehicles. Fossil fuel use is a big contributor to indoor air pollution. The authorities must be in the know of the simple fact that a polluted environment is a deadly one - particularly for young children under five as their developing organs and immune systems, smaller bodies and airways make them vulnerable to dirty air, water and food./While their survival is at stake, the authorities choose to pass over this aspect of health challenge to children. Experience tells us that the same patients facing respiratory troubles in Bangladesh get better when they stay abroad. Air, sound, food and water pollution is the leading environmental villain of the piece for death of children. The rich can afford to send their children abroad for healing; but the poor man's children march towards grave every second to the minute because of severe pollution here. Infants and pre-schoolers when exposed to indoor and outdoor pollution, air pollution by passive smoking, have an increased risk of pneumonia and chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, heart disease, stroke and cancer./Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them. The common causes of death - diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria - are preventable by basic services such as access to safe water, sanitation and clean cooking fuels. When pollution has come to such a pretty pass, it is high time the government gives more attention to child health before any large scale disaster strikes."
Indoor air pollution major cause of COPD in rural Bangladesh," Indoor air pollution caused by the use of unhygienic fuels in kitchens without a proper ventilation has been billed as one of the prime reasons for high prevalence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in rural Bangladesh. ""Our rural women usually cook indoor using an open-fire traditional cooking stove at a small kitchen with biomass fuel, like wood, cow dung and charcoal, without or insufficient ventilation that expose them hugely to COPD,"" Dr Shamim Ahmed, an associate professor of Pulmonology Department of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), told BSS Saturday. Referring to a study on ""Indoor Biomass Fuel Smoke Exposure as a Risk factor for COPD for Women of Rural Bangladesh"", he said, one in five rural women are suffering from COPD in a stage of life for neglecting health issues./ The study, published in a medical journal of ""Chattagram Maa-O-Shishu Hospital Medical Collage"" last year, was carried out among 250 women over 40-year of age under random sampling. ""Though smoking is the most common cause of COPD all over the world, air pollution is playing a similar role in Bangladesh in terms of COPD,"" Dr Ahmed said. The physician suggested using kerosene stoves for cooking at a properly ventilated kitchen to avoid suffering from COPD. ""Side by side, we should avoid use of tobacco, exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood to be freed from the disease,"" he said. Noting that most cases of COPD can be prevented by reducing use of tobacco and improving indoor and outdoor air quality, Dr Ahmed urged people quitting smoking to get rid of the COPD, an obstructive lung disease, as 20 percent smokers, especially above 40 years, are likely to attack with COPD while the rate is 50 percent for those who are lifelong smokers. /He also urged the authorities concerned to take necessary steps for creating mass awareness about reducing indoor air pollution across the country especially in rural areas. Dr Ahmed said the most common symptoms of COPD are sputum production, shortness of breath, wheezing or a whistling or squeaky sound when one breathes, chest tightness and a productive cough. ""Severe COPD can cause other symptoms, such as swelling ankles, feet or legs, weight loss and lower muscle endurance,"" he added. COPD treatments include stop smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators and steroids, long-term oxygen therapy and lung transplantation, he added."
Pollution linked to one in six deaths," Pollution has been linked to nine million deaths worldwide in 2015, a report in The Lancet has found. Almost all of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, where pollution could account for up to a quarter of deaths./Bangladesh and Somalia were the worst affected. Air pollution had the biggest impact, accounting for two-thirds of deaths from pollution. Brunei and Sweden had the lowest numbers of pollution-related deaths. Most of these deaths were caused by non-infectious diseases linked to pollution, such as heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. 'Pollution is much more than an environmental challenge - it is a profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing,' said the study's author, Prof Philip Landrigan, of the Icahn School of Medicine, at Mount Sinai in New York./The biggest risk factor, air pollution, contributed to 6.5 million premature deaths. This included pollution from outdoor sources, such as gases, and in households, such as burning wood or charcoal indoors. The next largest risk factor, water pollution, accounted for 1.8 million deaths, while pollution in the workplace was linked to 800,000 deaths globally./About 92% of these deaths occurred in poorer countries, with the greatest impact felt in places undergoing rapid economic development such as India, which had the fifth highest level of pollution deaths, and China, which had the 16th. In the UK, about 8% or 50,000 deaths are estimated to be linked to pollution. This puts the UK in 55th place out of the 188 countries measured, placing them behind the US and many European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark. Dr Penny Woods, of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'Air pollution is reaching crisis point worldwide, and the UK is faring worse than many countries in Western Europe and the US./'A contributing factor could be our dependence on diesel vehicles, notorious for pumping out a higher amount of poisonous particles and gases. 'These hit people with a lung condition, children and the elderly hardest.' In the United States, more than 5.8% - or 155,000 - deaths could be linked to pollution. The authors said air pollution affected the poor disproportionately, including those in poor countries as well as poor people in wealthy countries. Study author Karti Sandilya, from Pure Earth, a non-governmental organisation, said: 'Pollution, poverty, poor health, and social injustice are deeply intertwined."
Shut illegal brick kilns," The news that half of the brick kilns in the country run illegally, published recently in an English Daily, demands fast and serious attention of those who are in the hot seat of administration. Some 50 per cent of 9,700 brick kilns running in the country do not have any No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Department of Environment (DoE)./These unauthorised brick kilns are causing environmental pollution, damaging agricultural land and posing health hazards. Air pollution caused by these brick kilns invites a lot of diseases and people are smarting from serious maladies. These illegal brick kilns are operating under the very nose of the authorities and doing positive harms to the ecology. But the problem has not been addressed properly and now the public worries have intensified because of the nonchalance of the authorities. Several studies reveal that brick kilns in the country produce about 25 billion bricks annually, consuming five million tonnes of coal and three million tonnes of wood, resulting in the emission of 15 million tonnes of carbon into the air./The non-modernised brick kilns are posing threat to the environment as they are responsible for polluting the air quality to such an extent that is extremely unhealthy and dangerous for human body as it directly affects lungs. Most of the brick kilns based on the drum chimney method are being operated illegally in the country since the departments concerned lack accountability and monitoring. It is, however, possible to halt such activities if officials concerned properly discharge their duties, experts opine. It has been suggested once and again for taking steps to relocate all the brick kilns set up adjacent to the capital to other sites, but to no avail. If this is not done, the air pollution in Dhaka will turn into a situation like that of New Delhi's before long./The owners of unauthorised brick kilns are using drum chimneys or fixed chimneys in the absence of any effective drives. Sporadic mobile courts conducted by the DoE alone are not enough to combat the crooked brick kiln owners. It augurs well that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Bangladesh Bank have taken an initiative to provide soft loans to the owners of brick kilns to help them install green technology instead of using drum chimneys for baking bricks. Green-based modern technology must be used in brick kilns to save the country from air pollution. Unlicensed brick kilns must be shut down and the owners of such brick kilns should be dealt with seriously."
Air pollution choking city," News Report Thousands of people in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, are dying prematurely because of air pollution. An estimated 15,000 premature deaths, as well as several million cases of pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illness are attributed to poor air quality in Dhaka, according to the Air Quality Management Project (AQMP), funded by the government and the World Bank. According to the Department of Environment (DoE), old, poorly serviced vehicles, brick kilns (there are currently about 1,000 in and around Dhaka), dust from roads and construction sites, and toxic fumes from industrial sites are major sources of air pollution./Every year Bangladesh loses about $6.5 billion, which is about 3.4 percent of 2015 Gross Domestic Product (GDP), due to pollution and environmental degradation in urban areas, says a new World Bank report. The report titled 'Enhancing Opportunities for Clean and Resilient Growth in Urban Bangladesh: Country Environmental Analysis 2018' was released on Sunday. To achieve the upper-middle income status, the report says, Bangladesh must act now to tackle environmental degradation and pollution, especially in its cities. Globally, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by pollution and environmental risks. Pollution has reached an alarming level; in 2015, it caused about 80,000 deaths in cities, it said. Across Bangladesh, 28 percent of all deaths are from diseases caused by pollution, compared to a 16 percent global average./""Bangladesh pays a high price from environment degradation and pollution in its urban areas. This puts its strong growth at risk,"" said Rajashree Paralkar, World Bank Acting Country Director for Bangladesh. ""The country must act to put in place the right policies and institutions for green growth and ensure its industries adopt clean technologies,"" he said. Pollution and environmental degradation, including wetland encroachment and unregulated disposal of hazardous wastes, especially harm women, children and the poor. Nearly 1 million people in Bangladesh, mostly poor, are at risk of lead contamination. This can lead to IQ loss and neurological damage, especially for children, and can increase the risk of miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. In greater Dhaka, the sites contaminated by heavy metals are mostly in poorer neighborhoods. The report focuses on three areas: cost of environmental degradation, clean and resilient cities, and institutions for clean industrial growth. It suggests that the country requires effective policies, a sound legal framework, and stronger institutions at the national and local levels. The country also needs to scale up green financing, promote clean technologies, improve hazardous waste management, and raise awareness for environmental protection. Unplanned urbanization and industrialization are affecting both big and small cities."
"Cold, cloudy weather 'could increase your risk of having heart attack'"," Cold, cloudy weather could increase your risk of having a heart attack, according to a new study. In the largest study of its kind, scientists examined data from more than 274,000 patients across Sweden who had heart attacks between 1998 and 2013 for which contemporary weather data was available./The study found that the incidence of heart attacks increased with lower air temperature, lower atmospheric air pressure, higher wind velocity and shorter sunshine duration./The most pronounced association was observed for air temperature. David Erlinge, professor of cardiology at Lund University in Sweden and leader of the study, said: ""This is by far the largest study of weather and heart attacks. We are very interested in the triggers of heart attacks, because if you know those triggers you may be able to protect yourself."" The incidence of heart attacks was higher on days with air temperatures below freezing, with rates declining significantly when temperatures rose to greater than 3-4C./The association with air temperature also held true for different types of heart attack, including the most common type, which is caused by the blockage of a major coronary artery, an important blood vessel supplying the heart./The scientists speculate that cold weather could cause narrowing of arteries, putting extra pressure on the heart. ""Cold and windy weather leads to a contraction of blood vessels in the skin to conserve energy and temperature,"" said Erlinge. ""That increases the workload of the heart, increasing the risk of a heart attack."" Other possible explanations are changes in behaviour during colder weather - alterations to diet or exercise habits, for example - or the increase in respiratory infections such as flu during winter, which have been associated with increased heart attack risk. ""Cold, windy weather also increases emotional stress, which is also coupled to the incidence of heart attack,"" added Erlinge. In studying the association of various weather parameters with heart attack risk, Erlinge and his team also took into account national data on air pollution, which has recently been linked to changes in heart structure. ""We looked at data on air pollution in the three major Swedish cities every day during the 16 years,"" said Erlinge. ""Air pollution did not change the results reported in our study."" Chris Gale, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Leeds, who was not involved in the study, said: ""In the UK there are in excess of 100,000 heart attacks per year, so heart attacks are a major public health and population burden and anything that can be done to alleviate this has got to be good."" On the results of the study, Gale said: ""There are public health implications of this - for example, being mindful of when we are going to have a cold patch of weather so we are prepared in terms of our health and wellbeing, making sure we are wrapped up and warm. ""Clearly if the climate is changing such that we are getting more extremes of temperature, including colder weather snaps, then this could impact adversely on heart health."" Previous studies have reported increases in deaths from heart disease during winter, and recent research has linked the incidence of heart attacks to colder temperatures and snow. In the new paper, published in Jama Cardiology, the authors caution that it remains unknown whether reducing cold exposure by staying indoors and/or wearing warm clothes could reduce the risk of heart attack, and that this would need further investigation."
Dust pollution threatening civic life," About 90 percent dwellers in the capital city are affected by serious dust pollution, causing spread of various respiratory diseases. Dust pollution is also hitting the economy hard seriously harming the environment apart from causing public sufferings and health hazards. Speaking at a human chain programme, the Green activists on Saturday said the intensity of dust pollution rises usually during winter due to road digging and delayed disposal of wastes, causing respiratory, allergy and skin diseases. Poribesh Bachao Andolan (Poba) and Nagorik Odhikar Sangrakkhan Forum along with some other organisations jointly organised the programme in front of the Department of Fine Arts of Dhaka University in the city' Shahbagh area on Saturday./The Green activists said around 40 percent of patients in the child wards of different hospitals get admitted with respiratory diseases during winter due to serious dust pollution. They demanded the government take quick steps to check dust pollution and action against those responsible for it./The green activists also put forwarded a 12-point recommendation, including removing the construction materials and excavated soil from the roadside quickly after repair works of the roads, cleaning the roads and footpaths regularly, ban on keeping construction materials at open places or beside the roads, taking effective steps against air pollution by different factories and creating awareness among the city dwellers about the dust pollution and its adverse impacts."
Text of Budget Speech," In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful Bangladesh On A Pathway To Prosperity Time is Ours, Time for Bangladesh Madam Speaker 01. I seek your kind permission to place before this august House the proposed budget for FY 2019-20 and the supplementary budget for FY 2018-19. Chapter 1 Madam Speaker Bangladesh is now well poised to celebrate the golden jubilee of our glorious independence and the 100th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which is a rare occasion in our national history. We are committed to the nation to realize fully the Vision 2021 and implement the agenda for 2030 for building a happy and prosperous future for the nation, and thus materialize the Father of the Nation's cherished dream of establishing Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal), which is the fundamental premise of our current election manifesto too. Madam Speaker First of all, I pay my profound tribute and deepest gratitude to the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the man with colourful political personality, the possessor of a magical voice, the greatest Bengalee of all times and the architect of independent Bangladesh; I remember with profound respect all the martyrs of the fateful night of August 1975. /I also pay tribute to the four most competent comrades of the Father of the Nation who were killed in jail, thirty lakh martyrs in the war of liberation, all the valiant freedom fighters and two lakh women who were brutally persecuted during the war. I pray to the Almighty Allah for the salvation of their souls. Madam Speaker At this auspicious moment for the nation, on behalf of our people, I would like to humbly dedicate, through you, the proposed national budget for FY2019-20 to the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and to those who stood by him in response to his clarion call for independence. Madam Speaker I feel myself proud and most fortunate for getting the opportunity to present this budget for the first time before the august House. I express my profound gratitude to the Almighty Allah. I again pay my tribute to the Father of the Nation who imbued with the national consciousness embedded in him the vision of a prosperous Bangladesh. I would not have got the opportunity to present today's budget before this august House had he not freed our beloved motherland. Alongside, I convey my gratitude to our beloved leader Jananetri Sheikh Hasina, the worthy successor of the Father of the Nation, the most successful and widely acclaimed statesman in the country after the Father of the Nation. Had she not reposed trust on me and given me the portfolio of the Finance Ministry, I would have never got this rare opportunity to present the national budget for FY 2019-20 before this august House. And, my life would have remained unfulfilled. Hon'ble Prime Minister, for you, I have a lot of respect, a lot of gratitude. May the Almighty Allah bless you. May your life dedicated to the cause of our people be strewn with many successes. Hon'ble Prime Minister, I am committed to repay all my debt to you and to the Father of the Nation, by working for our beloved motherland with full dedication. /Madam Speaker I would like to inform the countrymen that the proposed national budget for FY2019-20 has been structured around the spectacular achievements of our government during the last 10 years, which surpass even the fairy tales. While recounting all these successes achieved under the leadership of our successful Prime Minister is a huge task; I would like to highlight some of the major successes before the nation, especially to the young generation through this august House. You are aware that all our successes during the last 10 years did not begin only in 2008; rather the seeds of development of the country were sown in 1972 under the leadership of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. After the glorious liberation war, the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu took up the task of transforming this war-ravaged country into the 'Golden Bengal'. Unfortunately the antiliberation forces temporarily halted that effort in 1975 by killing Bangabandhu, his family, and the jailed four national leaders in the worst killing spree in the history of Bangladesh. Jananetri Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of the Father of the Nation, came back to her own people on 17th May 1981 spending long six years in exile with endless miseries after 1975./The people of the country became leaderless after the brutal murder of Bangabandhu. Her return from exile was, therefore, a great source of jubilation for the people. Indeed, this was a great boon for the nation. Following a series of struggles for long 15 years, Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took up the task of revitalizing the nation after winning the National Elections in 1996. Madam Speaker Under the leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister the country witnessed many revolutionary changes during the period from 1996 to 2001./The economy was also growing during this time. Inflation went down to 1.9 percent, the lowest in the history of Bangladesh, GDP growth rose to 5 percent, and power generation increased from 1,600 to 4,300 megawatts. Incentive system was introduced for farmers for the first time in the history of the country./The country achieved self-sufficiency in food by raising foodgrains production to 2 crore 68 lakh metric tons. Community clinics were established throughout the country in nrural area to provide healthcare to the doorsteps of the people, telephone service was made cheap and easily available for the people. Unfortunately, the people could not enjoy uninterrupted delivery of these basic services. Progress in Bangladesh was again halted in 2002. After Jananetri Sheikh Hasina's assumption of office following the 2008 elections, Bangladesh again began to rise from the ashes like the phoenix bird in Greek mythology./The whole world was then reeling with the 2009 recession. Even the developed world lost an average of onefourth of employment, the capital market and their economies were in total disarray. Bearing in mind the daunting challenge of global meltdown, Hon'ble Prime Minister declared the charter for change - 'Vision 2021', wherein she set a number of ambitious targets. These include, among others, cent percent boys and girls will go to school by 2021. Electricity will be available for every household in the country. Healthcare will be taken to the reach of all people. Poverty will be reduced to a great extent. Bangladesh will be made digital, and will be elevated to the status of a Middle Income Country. Madam Speaker Hon'ble Prime Minister has fulfilled her pledges to the nation. Almost cent percent boys and girls in the country go to school, the rate of drop-outs has also reduced. Electricity has reached almost every household long before 2021. Community clinics have been established across the country./The poverty line has dropped from 40 percent in 2005 to 21 percent. Extreme poverty dropped from 25 percent to 11 percent. Inflation has been kept at a tolerable level despite the sustained high growth rates in our economy. We have been able to attract the attention of the world community by achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) surpassing the performance of other countries. We have elevated ourself from the status of a poor, least developed country to that of a lower middle income country. We share the glory of achieving the same level of development with countries like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. Madam Speaker I would like to inform the fellow countrymen about the outstanding achievements of our government during the last ten years in some basic areas of macroeconomic management by comparing our achievements with that of the previous government, achieved during their tenure in FY 2005-06. Please allow me to present first the performance of our importexport trade: Our imports in FY2005-06 was US$ 14.7 billion, which has risen now to US$ 58.9 billion. Our exports in FY2005-06 was US$ 10.5 billion, which grew 3.0 times to reach US$ 37 billion in FY2017-18. Remittance receipts: Our remittance receipts in FY 2005-06 was US$ 4.9 billion, which grew 3 times to reach US$ 15 billion in 2018. Foreign exchange reserve: Foreign exchange reserve stood at US$ 3.5 billion in FY2005-06, which by now grew 9 times to reach US$ 33 billion. Investment: Investment is one of the determinants of economic growth. In FY2005-06, our investment was 26 percent of GDP. In FY2018-19, it rose to 31.5 percent of the GDP. Private sector investment grew from US$ 14.8 billion to US$ 70.8 billion. Debt-GDP ratio: The debt to GDP ratio was 44 percent in FY2005-06, which has declined to 32 percent, which is a proof of the strength of our economy and our self-dependence. Health sector: The health sector has also witnessed remarkable progress. Infant mortality (per 1,000 live births) has gone down from 45 to 24./The number of medical colleges has increased from 46 to 111. Life expectancy at birth was 65 years in 2006, which is currently 72.8 years. In almost all the indicators in the social sector, Bangladesh has fared much better than other South Asian countries. Education sector: The literacy rate was 53.7 percent in 2006, which is currently 72.9 percent. Cent percent enrollment in primary education has been achieved./The drop-out rate has gone down from 50 percent to 18 percent./The rate of people receiving technical education was 2 percent, which has now risen to 17 percent./The number of universities has increased from 80 to 148. Our achievements in the social sector are presented in Table 1 of Annexure A. Power sector: The power generation capacity was 4,385 megawatts in 2005, which has now increased to 21,629 megawatts. When we began our journey in 2009, the amount of power in the national grid was 3,200 megawatts, against which the generation today is 12,893 megawatts./The share of the population enjoying electricity connection was 47 percent, which has now gone up to 93 percent. Gas supply was 1,443 million cubic feet, which has now increased to 2,746 million cubic feet per day.. Digital Bangladesh: 5,000 digital centers have been established in all the unions and municipal areas in the country. About 23,500 km optical fibre cable was installed throughout the country./The number of internet users has crossed 9 crore. Tele-density has crossed 93 percent. Twenty eight High Tech Parks are being established in the country. Bangladesh became the 57th satellite member country last year by launching its first satellite Bangabandhu Satellite-1 successfully into the space. This achievement has taken Bangladesh to a newer height in the global arena. National revenue: National revenue earning in FY2005-06 was Tk. 42,000 crore, which has increased to Tk. 3,16,000 crore. Revenue has seen seven times growth. Growth in GDP: The size of our GDP was US$ 72 billion in FY2005-06, which has now increased 4.5 times to US$ 302.4 billion. Per Capita Income: Per capita income in Bangladesh in FY200506 was around US$ 543, which has grown 3.5 times and now stands at US$ 1,909. Our achievements in the economic sector in the last 10 years are provided in Table 2 of Annexure A. Madam Speaker, Hollis B. Chenary, an American Professor of Economics, commented in 1973 that Bangladesh's per capita income will take 125 years to reach US$ 900. But we did not take 125 years. /It reached US$ 928 in 2011; that is, in only 40 years of independence. And it has become double in the next 8 years to reach US$ 1,909 by 2019. According to a recent estimate by the World Bank, in terms of growth in per capita income, Bangladesh remained among the top countries in the world during the last five years. Size and volume of the budget: The size of our budget in FY2005-06 was Tk. 64,000 crore, and the size of the proposed budget for FY2019-20 is Tk. 5,23,190 crore, which is eight times higher than that in FY2005-06. Madam Speaker Bangladesh played the role of a trailblazer in many respects. Once we were used as an example to explain the differences and gaps between a developed country and the poorest country. We used to be labelled as a backward country with abject poverty frequented by floods, cyclone and other natural calamities. By the grace of the Almighty Allah, Madam Speaker, we have turned around. According to the latest GDP ranking based on PPP published by the IMF, Bangladesh is now the 30th largest economies in the world. In South Asia, Bangladesh is now the second largest economy after India. Even the World Bank agrees, the way a small country with a large population of 16 crore and within a limited span of time has spearheaded development is now a wonder to the people of the world. Ban Ki Moon, ex-Secretary General of the United Nations, commented, 'Bangladesh can, Bangladesh is a Role Model in the area of economics'. /Kaushik Basu, ex-Chief Economist of the World Bank, said, 'Today's Bangladesh is wholly a tale of success'. Jim Yong Kim, exPresident of the World Bank, said, 'The progress in Bangladesh is exemplary for the entire world'. Asian Development Bank observed, 'Bangladesh is an example for other Asian countries'. Implementation of verdicts of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu murder case, and the cases on war crimes and crimes against humanity signaled the end of the long-prevailing culture of impunities; the nation has become free from the liability. Bangladesh's visible success in tackling militancy has been praised internationally. Madam Speaker After working tirelessly for the last 10 years, Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, garnering the support of the people of all strata, has brought Bangladesh to this level. We are now enjoying a respectable position in the world arena only due to her dynamic, intelligent and effective leadership./The United Nations, it's different organizations and various international organizations have conferred Hon'ble Prime Minister with prestigious awards for her commendable role in economic and social development. Madam Speaker, in one word, Bangladesh is known today to the whole world by the Prime Minister's name. She is now a world leader. A survey conducted by Fortune, the magazine of the Time Corporation in the United States, has placed Hon'ble Prime Minister among the top ten world leaders. Time, the New York-based famous weekly, has included our Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in its 2018 list of 100 most influential world leaders, along with US President Donald Trump and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Hon'ble Prime Minister, we the countrymen are grateful to you for taking Bangladesh to such a great height. Chapter II The Supplementary Budget Madam Speaker At this stage, I am going to present the Supplementary Budget for the current FY2018-19 and the proposed Budget Framework of the FY 2019-20./The Supplementary Budget for the current FY2018-19 The targets for revenue earning and expenditure of the current fiscal year 2018-19 was determined on the assumption that there will be impending reforms in the structure of manpower and work procedures in the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and the nation's economy will continue to grow./The amount of revenue collected upto March, 2019 of the current fiscal year was 54.90 percent of the original annual target. At the same time, government expenditure was 44.40 percent of the annual allocation. Revised Revenue Income: The target of revenue collection for FY 2018-19 was set at Tk. 3,39,280 crore. After reviewing the revenue collection in July-March of the current fiscal year, the target was reduced by Tk. 22,668 crore, and re-fixed at Tk. 3,16,612 crore. 35. Revised Expenditure: The total government expenditure in the current fiscal year was estimated at Tk. 4,64,573 crore. In the revised budget, the expenditure was reduced by Tk 22,032 crore, and re-fixed at Tk 4,42,541 crore./The size of the annual development program has been reduced by 6,000 crore taka, from the original allocation of Tk. 1,73,000 crore, and set at Tk. 1,67,000 crore. On the other hand, the estimation of other expenditures, including operating expenditure, was reduced by Tk. 16,032 crore. Revised Budget Deficit and its Financing: The budget deficit for the current fiscal year was estimated at Tk. 1,25,293 crore. However, the deficit in the revised budget has been set at Tk.1,25,929 crore, which is 5.0 percent of GDP. Against the original budget deficit, the estimation for external financing was Tk. 54,067 crore, which has been reduced to Tk. 47,184 crore in the revised budget. From domestic sources, the revised estimation of financing from savings instruments and other sources is Tk. 47,850 crore. Chapter III Proposed Budget Structure of FY 2019-20 Madam Speaker The budget of FY2019-20 is for all citizens of Bangladesh. No area is left out, neither the Hill Tracts nor the plain lands; neither from northsouth nor from east-west. This budget has been prepared keeping in mind the need of farmers, blacksmiths, potters, fishermen, businessmen, bedes, various tribes, third genders, teachers, doctors, engineers and all professionals. Sufficient allocation has been made to satisfy the needs of all Ministries or Divisions. Madam Speaker I will now present an estimate of the proposed income and expenditure of the next fiscal year 2019-20, which has been presented in details in the Table-4 of Annexure-A. I will first speak on our national revenue and annual probable income receipts./The basic principle of tax revenue collection by our government is boosting revenue mobilization not by increasing the tax rate but by widening the tax net and coverage. To do that, we will establish revenue offices in every Upazilas and Growth Centers in the country. These will have necessary manpower and other logistics to facilitate revenue collection. I would like to inform the august House that we have not included any component in the budget of FY2019-20 that may cause a price spiral for essential commodities. There is a slur on our revenue performance that the ratio of our national revenue collection to GDP is lower than that of other countries. From now on, we are determined to raise the ratio from its current 10 percent to 14 percent in next two years. A culture has been established in our revenue domain for a long time; that is, those who pay taxes to the government, only continue to do so every year. Others, despite having taxable income, continue to evade payment of taxes. We also want to get out of this bad culture. All eligible taxpayers will be brought under the tax net. Madam Speaker There are 4 crore people in our country who are included in the middle income group. However, the number of taxpayers is only 21-22 lakh. /We will take the number to one crore at the earliest possible time InshaAllah. And as part of the ongoing process, efforts to bring the rest of the citizens under the tax net will continue. I observe from long experience that our citizens are willing to pay tax, but we fail to collect it for various reasons. Inshallah we will now pay a special attention to that. Madam Speaker You will be happy to know that we are going to implement our long-awaited Value Added Tax Act, 2012 from the coming fiscal year (2019-20). To ensure effective implementation of this Act, we will provide all types of logistical support including necessary manpower. Further, a Joint Working Group will be constituted comprising officials from the government and the private sector, which will oversee the implementation of the law. Madam Speaker In this budget, we are proposing massive reforms in the revenue administration. All tax laws (income tax, VAT and customs) will be formulated in a simplified and transparent manner so that these are easily comprehensible to all./The policy decision of our government is that we are against imposing tax as a burden on taxpayers in any way. Our policy in tax collection will somewhat follow a statement by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the Finance Minister in the court of King Louis (XIV) of France: 'The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest [number] of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing."" We will gradually transform all types of tax rates into fully business-friendly ones. We believe we will be able to take our tax revenue collection to the optimum level when we will be able to prevent all types of mismanagement, corruption and misuse in the tax revenue management. For that purpose, the revenue management will be fully automated. We will also ensure transparency in bonded warehouse management and stop any clearance of goods through mis-declaration. Therefore, we are taking measures so that all the imported and exported goods must go through scanning machines. We will also thoroughly examine whether goods are imported through over-invoicing or under-invoicing. For this purpose, a Special Wing will be established. Special efforts will be made to enhance the efficiency and skills of the employees at the NBR. With all these measures, our revenue collection will be enhanced and money laundering or similar activities, of which we hear often times, will be stopped. Consignments intercepted due to offenses of overinvoicing or underinvoicing will be confiscated and punishments will be meted out to the wrongdoers. To effectively implement these measures, necessary legal reforms will be made. Tax exemptions to different sectors will be avoided as much as possible. We will also avoid issuing SROs unless there is an emergency. /This will bring transparency in revenue management, and enhance confidence among businessmen about the government. Depending on these planned tax management steps, total revenue collection has been estimated to be Tk. 3,77,810 crore in the FY2019-20. Out of this, Tk. 3,25,660 crore will be collected through the National Board of Revenue. Tax revenue from non-NBR sources have been estimated at Tk. 14,500 crore. Besides, non-tax revenue is estimated at Tk. 37,710 crore. Madam Speaker In the FY2019-20, the size of the budget of the total expenditure is estimated to be Tk. 5,23,190 crore, which is 18.1 percent of GDP. Total allocation for operating and other expenditures is Tk. 3,20,469 crore, and allocation for the annual development program is Tk. 2,02,721 crore. Regional parity, human resource development, infrastructural development and quality of expenditure have been given priority in the allocation for the annual development program./The allocation of the annual development program for the coming FY is presented in Table 5 of Annexure A. I propose to allocate, from the annual development programme, 27.4 percent for human resource (education, health and related others), 21.5 percent for the overall agriculture sector (agriculture, rural development, water resources, and related others), 13.8 percent for power and energy sector, 26 percent for communication (roads, rails, bridges, and related other communications), and 11.3 percent for other sectors./The overall budget deficit will be Tk. 1,45,380 crore, which is 5.0 percent of GDP. It is to be noted that we had the same ratio last year. In financing the deficit, Tk. 68,016 crore will come from external sources and Tk. 77,363 crore from domestic sources. Amongst the financing from domestic sources, Tk. 47,364 crore will come from the banking system and Tk. 30,000 crore from savings certificates and other non-bank sources. Madam Speaker Overall expenditure structure: I will now present the overall expenditure structure (Development and Operating) of the proposed budget. As per the allocation of business among ministries/divisions, we have categorized various activities into three main groups, namely: social infrastructure, physical infrastructure, and general services. /Allocation proposed for the social infrastructure sector in the proposed budget is Tk 1,43,429 crore, which is 27.41 percent of total allocation, in which allocation for human resource (education, health and other related sectors) will be Tk 1,29,056 crore. Allocaction proposed for the physical infrastructure sector will be Tk. 1,64,603 crore or 31.46 percent, in which Tk. 66,234 crore will go to overall agricultural and rural development, Tk. 61,360 crore to overall communications, and Tk. 28,051 crore to power and energy. Total Tk. 1,23,641 crore has been proposed for general services, which is 23.63 percent of total allocation. Tk. 33,202 crore is proposed for public-private partnerships (PPP), financial assistance to different industries, subsidies and equity investments in nationalized corporations, banks, and financial institutions, which is 6.35 percent of total allocation. Tk. 57,070 crore for interest payment, which is 10.91 percent of total allocation. Tk. 1,245 crore for net lending and other expenses, which is 0.24 percent of total allocation. Chapter IV A Journey towards a Prosperous Future Sectoral Strategies, Action Plans and Resource Mobilization Madam Speaker At this stage, I would like to dwell upon our important policystrategies, work plans and budget allocation for the medium-term including that for the next fiscal year. Through this budget, we will make efforts to implement the pledges made in our Election Manifesto of 2018 and achieve Sustainable Development Goals and their targets. /Next year will be the terminal year of our 7th Five Year Plan; hence its implementation will get priority in this budget. Given the resource availability, we are actively considering those expenditure programmes that fulfill the basic needs of the people. Medium-Term Policy Strategy Our GDP grew consistently at a very high rate in the last decade. We expect a GDP growth of 8.13 percent in FY2018-19. Our contmmitment is to achieve a growth rate of 10 percent by FY2023-24, and maintain that rate until 2041 so that we can lay a solid foundation for becoming a high income country by that time. To achieve this objective, GDP growth rate has been projected at 8.2 percent for FY2019-20./The inflation rate during this year is forecasted at 5.5 percent. Alongside, our goal will be to enhance the competitiveness of all our business sectors, including agriculture, industry, commerce, exports, real estate and services sectors./The purpose is to reduce poverty, generate employment, and attract foreign investment. Bringing the marginal people into the mainstream of development, special measures will be adopted for small and medium enterprises, and steps will be taken to reduce income inequality./The main source of our growth is the strong domestic demand. Our main attention will be on increased domestic demand through consumption and investment, and increased external demand by enhancing exports. Growth in remittances will continue to be our focus in the medium term as well. We also aim to build a modern transportation system through government investment, and ensure power and energy security. To accelerate GDP growth and generate employment we need enhanced growth in the industrial sector. This objective will be achieved by establishing Economic Zones across the country. However, in order to ensure sustained and balanced growth, development of the services sector, especially tourism and real estate sub-sectors, and the agriculture sector will also be given priority. Madam Speaker The main thrust of our budget is to create an investment-friendly environment for the private sector, expand export trade, ensure businessfriendly tax management, bring about required reforms in the financial sector, and increase public sector investment to take our GDP growth to a higher trajectory. Furthermore, we are aiming to achieve the double digit growth as quickly as possible through timely implementation of all nationally important infrastructure projects including mega projects such as the Padma Bridge, Padma Rail Link Project, Dohajari-Cox's Bazar rail line, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, Rampal Power Plant, Payra Sea Port, Matarbari Power Plant at Moheshkhali, and Dhaka Metro Rail, etc. Madam Speaker, our government's principal commitment is not only to achieve growth, but also to ensure sustainable and inclusive development. /Our objective is to bring a qualitative change in the lives of the people through poverty alleviation and reduction in inequality. To meet this objective, we will attach more importance to expanding the coverage of the social protection programme, creating employment opportunities in home and abroadt, providing microcredit and imparting efficiency enhancement trainings. Following the practice of every year, I have presented this year, along with the budget speech, a 'Medium-Term Macroeconomic Policy-Statement (MTMPS)' which contains details of our medium-term policies and strategies. In the next section, I will present sector-based specific action plans. Action Plans and Resource Allocation Education, Health and Human Resource Development I would like to begin with our education system and let me share a good news for the Ministry of Education. Bringing dynamism in education through new enlistment of MPOs Madam Speaker You are aware, the MPO (Monthly Pay Order) enlistment in the Ministry of Education remained suspended for a long time. Upon request from the Ministry of Education and under the special directive of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, necessary funds have been earmarked in the budget for this year for enlistment of new schools in the MPO list. I, on behalf of the people of Bangladesh and on your behalf, extend sincere thanks to our Hon'ble Prime Minister. /Madam Speaker While giving my reflection on education, I would like to present a memorable example from Japan. Japan was totally a backward country in education and science before the Meiji restoration during the later part of the 18th century. Emperor Meiji urged on acquiring western education and technological knowledge and sent the Japanese students, even the prince, to western countries, including the United States. He realized that in Japan there was a dearth of teachers, not of students. He therefore brought several thousand teachers, trained in different technologies, from the western world to upgrade and update the Japanese education system. By dint of such pragmatic and farsighted policy, Japan not only became equal to the western world, it also achieved the glory of becoming the first country which achieved 100 percent literacy. Our Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has also laid the highest importance on education. /With the aim of creating skilled human resource, targets have been set for the overall improvement of education, reducing discrimination in education, achieving quality, excellence, and expansion of education. We do not have any scarcity of students now; but there is a dearth of suitable and trained teachers. In all areas of education beginning with the primary level, we want to engage our competent and trained teachers. Much of our future depends on how we manage our education system. It is now the demand of the time to ensure selection of competent teachers in all areas of education, provide them with training, and ensure selection of appropriate and timely academic subjects. Our government will take necessary measures from this year to ensure their implementation. Madam Speaker The world is witnessing a transition from the Third Industrial Revolution to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We will have to prepare ourselves to remain at par with the rest of the world. Otherwise, our future will be at stake. /Therefore, our classrooms will have to be subject-specific where Nano Technology, Bio-technology, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Material Science, Internet of Things, Quantum Computing, Block Chain Technology and other similar technologies will be taught. Receiving education in these subjects is now the demand of the time. We have no shortage of students. We lack trained teachers. In order to teach these subjects, we may, as Emperor Meiji of Japan did, have to bring in teachers from abroad, if necessary, in order to meet present day demand. We would like to start these activities from this year, and therefore, adequate budget has been allocated for the education sector in FY2019-20. Madam Speaker Quality education, not the numbers, is the Priority of Coming Days As we kept on laying emphasis on increasing the student enrollment, Bangladesh achieved a great success in enrolling students both at primary and secondary levels maintaining gender parity. Now, the main challenge for us is to improve the quality of education and expand primary education. Various measures have been adopted to ensure quality and universal primary education. Included among them are- nationalization of 26,193 private primary schools, enactment of the Non-Formal Education Act, distribution of stipends through mobile banking, improvement of infrastructures in the newly nationalized and existing primary schools, distribution of free text books, supplying computers and multimedia to schools, and improvement of various education related infrastructures./The Fourth Primary Education Development Project (PEDP-4) is ongoing for the expansion and quality enhancement of primary education. Stipends and school-feeding programmes will continue so as to ensure that education of primary school students is not hampered./The government will build infrastructures for schools, conduct basic literacy program throughout the country to build a fully literate Bangladesh, and expand digital primary education through the use of ICT./The capacity of primary school teachers will be enhanced by providing practical and modern trainings home and abroad to meet the standard of modern education. To increase the involvement of private institutions including local elites in the school feeding program and expansion and coordinated implementation of the overall program, a process is underway to formulate the National School Feeding Policy will be formulated in FY2019-20. A pilot project titled 'Digital Primary Education' will be undertaken to facilitate qualitative improvement in education by enhancing the capacity of primary education together with the use of ICT. Under the project, interactive classrooms will be established in 503 model primary schools./The following programmes will continue in FY2019-20 to ensure the ongoing development of primary and mass education, such as construction of classrooms in schools on the basis of prioritized requirements; demanddriven repair and refurbishment of schools; construction of wash-blocks and tube wells in schools; providing budget for implementation of school level improvement plan (SLIP) and upazila primary education plan (UPEP) in all government primary schools; recruitment of teachers; providing Dip-in-Ed and subject-specific trainings to teachers; supplying comptuers and ICT equipment to schools, offices and training institutes; distribution of free text books; and the stipend programme. I propose to allocate a total of Tk. 24,040 crore for the primary education sector, which was Tk. 20,521 crore in the budget for current FY2018-19. /Madam Speaker Science and Technology-based Secondary and Higher Education The government has undertaken various programmes for the expansion of quality secondary education, among which trainings for secondary school teachers, construction of classrooms in academic institutions in underdeveloped areas, providing stipends among poor and meritorious students, etc., are the important ones. To facilitate the qualitative improvement in secondary education, a five year Secondary Education Development Programme will be implemented. Under this programme, providing education service for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics will be given priority. A total of 2 lakh 67 thousand secondary school teachers have already been provided with trainings during the last two fiscal years, and 1 lakh 3 thousand secondary school teachers and 3 lakh 13 thousand ICT teachers will be given trainings in the current fiscal year. As many as 580 classrooms were built in the schools in underdeveloped areas, and the process of building another 350 classrooms in the current fiscal year is ongoing./The government has introduced e-books, established upazila ICT training and resource centers, transformed 1 private school in each upazila into a model school, and established multimedia classrooms in 32,667 schools. We are actively engaged in removing disparity and ensuring qualitative excellence in the education sector. Tuition fee up to degree (pass) and equivalent students is being provided from the Prime Ministers Education Assistance Trust Fund to ensure education for the poor and meritorious students who are otherwise deprived of education. Stipends in this sector are provided to 2 lakh 21 thousand students in FY2018-19. Besides, 18 crore 13 lakh free text books are being distributed to 1 crore 25 lakh students at the secondary level. Enhanced Salary and Baishakhi Bonus for Teachers To enhance financial benefits and facilities for teachers, an annual increment of 5 percent on the basic salary is being provided from July 2018 to teachers/ employees of MPO-enlisted non-government schools under the Secondary and Higher Education Division. Besides, a Baishakhi Bonus amounting to 20 percent of the basic salary is being provided from the FY2018-19./The introduction of the online system for enrollment, registration, changing institutions, and publication of the results as part of the innovative program in education management have largely reduced harassment. From FY2018-19, special grants for academic institutions, teachers and students are being provided through the online system, and payments are made through mobile banking. Construction of Secondary Educational Infrastructure and Supply of Education Materials The government has allocated Tk. 9,000 crore in FY2019-20 for development projects in the secondary and higher education sector, which is 54 percent higher than that in FY 2018-19. /Construction of physical infrastructure in 1,500 non-government colleges, 3,000 non-government schools under the Secondary and Higher Education Division will be completed by June 2019. Steps have been taken to construct 48,947 multimedia classrooms, 200 language-cum-ICT labs, 1,000 science labs, 2,120 smart classrooms and 46 hostels, and supply of furniture, office materials and ICT equipment in 26,200 educational institutions throughout the country. ICT training and resource centers have been established in 125 upazilas in the country, and the process for establishing the same in another 160 upazilas is underway. Stipends and other assistance amounting to Tk. 883.54 crore was provided in FY2017-18 to about 41 lakh 44 thousand students from Class VI to Degree (pass) levels, of which 75 percent were female students. An amount of Tk. 1,900 crore was allocated in FY2018-19 against 42 projects to develop physical infrastructure and other facilities at the public universities in the country. Of these, development projects for 18 universities will be completed in FY2019-20. Besides, based on the promise of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina, 5 new universities have been established as part of the program for setting up new public universities. /I propose to allocate a total of Tk. 29,624 crore for the secondary and higher education sector, which was Tk. 25,866 crore in the current fiscal year. Madam Speaker Employment-friendly Technical and Vocational Education Steps have been taken to expand technical and vocational education to meet the growing demand for technical manpower. In addition, the government has also undertaken measures to diversify the technical and vocational education programmes. To reduce discrimination in technical and vocational education, stipends are being provided to students from the Dakhil, Technical and Ebtadayee levels. Again, the government is providing one time grants as allowances to the poor and meritorious students and hapless teachers, distributing free textbooks, and providing special trainings to teachers of English and Mathematics. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been included as a textbook subject from Class VI to expand technical education and improve its quality. /With a view to establishing one technical school at each upazila to create skilled manpower in Bangladesh, construction of technical schools in 100 upazilas at a cost of Tk. 2, 281.69 crore in the preliminary phase is underway. Necessary budget has been allocated to develop land survey education in Bangladesh, construct polytechnic institutes in 23 districts, and implement projects to enhance the capacity of 64 technical schools and colleges under the Directorate of Technical Education. Besides, polytechnic institutes for women are being established in 4 divisional towns (Sylhet, Barishal Mymenshing and Rangpur). Madrasa Education The government has taken numerous steps for the development and modernization of madrasa education. Infrastructures of Madrasas will be developed and multimedia will be set up in classrooms. Free text books are being distributed at Dakhil and Ebtedaayee levels to remove discrimination in education. A total of 1,800 new madrasas are being established in the country. I propose to allocate Tk. 7,454 crore in FY 2019-20 for technical and madrasa education, which was Tk. 5,758 crore in FY2018-19. It is worth mentioning here that currently 28 ministries and divisions are implementing programs related to education and training./The allocation for this purpose in FY 2019-20 is Tk. 87,620 crore, which is 3.04 percent of GDP and 16.75 percent of total budget allocations. Health and Family Welfare Madam Speaker The government has been working with dedication and sincerity to develop a healthy and energetic population by ensuring quality health services, nutrition, affordable and quality family planning. Following the government interventions, the maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate, child (under-5 years) mortality rate, malnutrition, stunting rate, lowweight rate, etc., are constantly reducing, and the average life expectancy rate is increasing./The Fourth Health, Population and Nutritional Sector Programme (4th HPNSP) is being implemented in the health service sector at an estimated cost of Tk. 1,15,486 crore over a period from January 2017 to June 2022. Nested on 29 operational plans, the programme is providing health and family planning services and improved medical education throughout the country. It is worth to note that 84 percent of the HPNSP programme is being financed by the government. Ensuring Health Service The projects undertaken by the government to ensure health service include modernization and expansion of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, establishment of nephrology units and kidney dialysis centers in government medical college hospitals and all district headquarters hospitals, and establishment of cancer treatment units in all medical college hospitals at the divisional level. Besides, steps have been taken to establish medical college hospitals at Hobiganj, Nilphamari, Netrokona, Magura and Naogaon districts. /Alongside, steps have been taken to undertake projects to construct hostels with modern facilities, establish medical waste treatment, and create child cardiac units in each divisional hospital. Improving Maternal and Child Healh Various priority programmes have been undertaken to improve maternal and child health. Of them, the main activities related to the improvement of maternal health include providing training to physicians on emergency maternity services, providing 'community based skilled birth attendant' training to field level health workers, providing safe MR service, providing coordinated medical treatment to pregnant mothers, encouraging the receipt of institutionalized child delivery services, expanding maternal health voucher schemes, and advance identification of cervical and breast cancer. On the other hand, to expand the neo-natal medical service, Special Care Newborn Units (SCANU) have been established in 10 district hospitals and 61 upazila hospitals./The government has undertaken steps to recruit as many as 9,792 medical officers to address the growing needs among citizens for health services. Expansion of Health Services to the Grassroot Level Bangladesh has achieved notable success in the health sector by providing free health services to different strata of people starting with those from the grassroots. Community clinic is the first service center to provide primary health services to the rural people. Currently, 13 thousand 779 community clinics are operational in the country, in each of which about 40 service recipients are getting services every day and 80 percent of them are women and children. About 4 thousand community clinics throughout the country are providing normal delivery service. Besides, the 'Health Protection Programme' is currently underway as a pilot project in Kalihati, Ghatail and Madhupur upazilas in Tangail to lessen the financial burden of the poor people. /Incentive to Encourage Expansion of the Pharmaceutical Sector As part of the government's effort to facilitate the development of the pharmaceutical sector, a cash incentive at the rate of 20 percent is being provided to encourage exports from the producers of pharmaceutical raw materials and laboratory reagents. Construction of a Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Industrial Park is underway at Gazaria in Munshiganj. Again, unani, ayurvedic and homeopathic medical services are also being provided alongside allopathic medical services, and relevant guidelines and pharmacopeia have been prepared. A separate testing laboratory for traditional medicine is being established to ensure quality and standards of traditional medicines (unani, ayurvedic, homeopathic and herbal) produced in the country. To ensure protection of mental health of citizens, provide universal mental health service, and ensure overall welfare, the Mental Health Act, 2018 has been passed in Parliament abolishing the Lunacy Act of 1912. Among other approved laws, Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act, 1918, and Community Clinic Health Assistance Act, 2018 are worth noting. /Besides, the drafting of the 'Health Services Protection Act, 2019' by repealing the Medical Practice and Private Clinics and Laboratories (Regulation) Ordinance of 1982 (amended in 1984) is currently underway. Modernizing Medical Education System The government will construct a 1,000-bed super specialized ward and a one-point check up center, introduce afternoon health services, and construct a cancer building to modernize the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. A world class bone-marrow transplant unit will be established at the University, together with vertical expansion of OPD Bhaban-1 and OPD-Bhaban-2 to enhance the scope of services for general patients. Besides, drafting of the law on alternative medicine systems, the law on the establishment and operation of private medical colleges and dental colleges, and the law on Bangladesh paramedical education board are also progressing. /Health Services for Autistic and People with Special Needs The government attaches priority to the medical treatment and other social benefits for the autistic people and people with special needs. They will be made fit to work by providing specialized trainings in activities they are adept in and can perform. Employment of Midwives and Nurses for Family Welfare To fulfil the promise by the Hon'ble Prime Minister, 3,000 posts for midwives have been created with a view to reducing the maternal mortality rate. 5,100 senior staff nurses were recruited in 2018. Three nursing colleges and five nursing hostels for boys will be established in FY2019-20 to expand nursing education. Madam Speaker Advancement in Health Education Under the directives of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, the government has undertaken a plan to establish a medical university in each division in the country to improve the quality of health education. Of these, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet Medical Universities have already started functioning./The government has undertaken various activities including offers for fellowships and donations to modernize the medical system through the use of new inventions in science and high end technology./The number of medical colleges in the country and the number of seats in the MBBS course have seen a notable increase during the last 10 years./The number of medical colleges has risen from 46 in 2006 to 111 at the moment. Similarly, the number of seats in the MBBS course has increased from 2,050 in 2006 to 10,300 in 2018. Expansion of Science-based Medical Care The government has taken initiatives to develop and expand science-based medical care system. For example, 3 nuclear medical physics institutes with ultramodern laboratory facilities have been established to promote cancer treatment management. 5 Institutes of Tissue Banking and Biomaterial Research with ultramodern laboratory facilities have been established to enable processing for use in animal/human tissue rehabilitation surgery treatment. Fifty two designated reference institutes for chemical measurement have been established to enable world class measurement and calibration in the country./The government has established an Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Science, a Newborn Screening Central Laboratory in Dhaka, and a Nuclear Medicine Centre and a Sterile Insect Unit in Cox's Bazar to diagnose the hypothyroid disease among the newborn babies. Besides, research and medical care facilities in nuclear medicine centres at Mitford (Dhaka), Comilla, Faridpur, Bogura, Barishal, Khulna, Mymensing and Rangpur have been expanded and modernized./The government plans to establish a mobile laboratory, a scientific and technological information and research center and an applied industrial research laboratory in the BCSIR and a BSCIR research centre in Gopalganj. In FY2019-20, Institutes of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) will be established at the campuses of 8 medical college hospitals in the country. Besides, and capacity of the existing 6 INMASs will be enhanced./The laboratory facility in the Institute of Electronics will be developed and modernized; a Standard Laboratory will be established for the purpose of radiotherapy, diagnostic radiology, neutron calibration and control of standards. International Recognition for Achievements in HR Development The benefits of various activities undertaken by the government in education, health and human resource development sectors are now visible as in different social indicators Bangladesh has made major advancements./The average life expectancy in Bangladesh is now 72.8 years. On the other hand, infant mortality of less than 5 years per thousand live births has gone down to 31, infant mortality rate of less than 1 year has gone down to 24, and maternal mortality rate per thousand is now only 1.72 persons. This remarkable success of the government has been duly reflected in the new Human Capital Index 2018 of the World Bank, where Bangladesh has secured 106th position out of a total of 157 countries surveyed. To keep this momentum, we will continue our activities in FY 2019-20. I propose to allocate Tk. 25,732 crore for the Health Services Division, and the Health Education and Family Welfare Division, which was Tk. 22,336 crore in FY2018-19. It is worth mentioning that currently 12 ministries and divisions are implementing programs related to health and family welfare./The allocation for this purpose in FY 2019-20 is Tk. 29,464 crore, which is 1.02 percent of GDP and 5.63 percent of total budget allocations. Employment Generation Madam Speaker While the government has taken up seriously the issue of entry of a huge number of active population in the labour market, in one hand, there is the reduction in demand for workers due to the adoption of modern technology, on the other./The government has taken various steps to resolve this dilemma. A three-year programme has been taken up to increase the job creation rate in the industrial sector through improvement of business and investment environment, ensure protection of workers, and reform the legal and regulatory framework, and policy--strategies to make them conducive for the entry of the backward population into the job market in larger numbers. As many as 10 laws/rules, policies-strategies were either formulated or amended in this financial year./The government will facilitate qualitative employment for the growing population by effecting reforms in the rest of the laws/rules and policies/strategies within the next 2 years. I propose to allocate Tk. 100 crore for the training and employment of specific group of people./The government will strive to eliminate unemployment by 2030 by generating employment for 3 crore people. Demographic dividend: Power of Youths and Prosperity for Bangladesh We will have to exploit the full potential of the demographic dividend that is available for Bangladesh. Acting under the slogan of 'Power of Youth: Prosperity for Bangladesh', the government is taking necessary steps to transform youths, one-third of the total population in the country, into well-organized, disciplined and productive forces. To create jobs for the unemployed youths and generate self-employment opportunity, skill development trainings in different subjects are being provided to youths through 111 formal training centres across the country, and 498 training centres at the upazila level. Extensive employment opportunity will be created in the Economic Zones. Tk. 100 crore will be allocated in the coming budget to provide start-up capital to promote all types of startup enterprizes among youths. Madam Speaker Skill Development The government has been working sincerely for human resource development by enhancing the skills of our growing population. /Steps have been taken to train 15 lakh people. Skill development contributes to the increase in labour productivity. This leads to the rise in labour wage, which in turn contributes to poverty reduction. Alongside, there is an ongoing special programme to create 1 lakh skilled and professional drivers for the transport sector. Under the Prime Minister's Office, there is a National Skills Development Authority (NSDA) to undertake various skills development activities of the government in a coordinated manner. There is also a 'National Human Resource Development Fund' to finance the activities for the development of human resources. Overseas Employment: Promising Destination for Bangladeshi Workforce Considering the fact that 'a huge workforce is entering the job market every year', sincere efforts have been made to expand overseas labour market alongside the domestic market. Overseas employment in Malaysia and South Korea has increased significantly owing to our successful diplomatic efforts. We have been striving to develop skills of our workers to make them competent for foreign labour markets. As a result of our time bound plans and their proper implementation, the rate of overseas employment has increased which in turn enhanced our image and also played a role in increasing the remittances./The 'Free Malaysia Today' report in 2018 on skilled foreign workers in the Malaysian labour market revealed that Bangladeshis holds 37 percent of foreign workforce in Malaysia in the category of managerial posts. To explore new and prospective labour markets, the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment has already completed a survey titled 'Demand Analysis of Employment of Bangladeshi Migrant Workers in the International Labour Matket' on labour markets in 53 countries./The survey has made recommendations for enhancing the scope of overseas employment. Moreover, we have reformed the legal framework by formulating the Overseas Employment and Immigration Management Rules, 2017 and the Wage Earners Welfare Board Act, 2018 to regulate migration costs, ensure transparency and accountability of legitimate recruiting agents and ensure safe migration. Increase in Foreign Remittance To mitigate the burden of increased expenses in sending foreign remittances and to encourage bringing in foreign remittance through legal channels, an incentive at the rate of two (2) percent on money remitted by expatriate Bangladeshi will be provided from this financial year. For this purpose, I propose to allocate Tk. 3,060 crore in this year. This will significantly increase the remittance flow through legal channels and discourage the 'hundi' business./The expatriate Bangladeshi workers and their families often face financial losses and risks due to accidents and various other cause as there are no insurance facilities available to them. Preparations have been taken to bring the expatriate workers under the insurance scheme, which will be implemented shortly. Madam Speaker Safe Workplace, Workers Welfare and Labor Inspection Apps The government has given special emphasis on ensuring the appropriate workplace in mills and factories. With this aim in view a database containing useful information of 4,808 ready-made garment factories has been created. Preparation of a database containing information of another 27,000 factories is underway. A complete Inspection Checklist, based on labor law and labor rules in Bangladesh, has been formulated, which will enable labor inspectors to ensure compliance while inspecting factories and establishments at the field level. Compliance of 8,261 factories and establishments has been ensured from FY2015-16 to February 2019. Further, with a view to improving health, safety and workplace environment for garment workers a toll free hot line has been introduced through which workers can make complaints, free of costs, on different issues. 106. To promote a worker-friendly atmosphere in mills and factories, a piece of legislation called Bangladesh Labour Act (Amendment), 2018 has been enacted in line with standards of International Labour Organization (ILO). /In addition, the government promulgated the EPZ Labour Ordinance 2019, which introduced provisions for the recruitment of workers in industries, owner-worker relationships, determination of the minimum wage rate, payment of wages, compensation for injuries to workers due to accidents during working hours, introduction of provisions on health, safety, etc. of workers, formation of Workers' Welfare Associations, and formation of the EPZ Workers' Welfare Association. Besides, the Labour Inspection Management Application (LIMA) has been implemented nationwide by the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments under the Ministry of Labour and Employment to ensure a safe workplace, sound work atmosphere and high living standards for workers. This web portal offers the scopes for online trade union registration, publication of inspection reports, and submission of opinions by workers. In order to facilitate the employment of female workers 4,706 day-care centers have been set up in different factories till February 2019 under the supervision of the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments. 107./The present government has been working relentlessly to ensure economic growth through industrialization as well as safeguard the overall welfare of workers. As of February 2019, a total of 2,262 'Safety Committees' have been formed under the Bangladesh Labour Rules, 2015 in different factories to ensure a safe workplace. Minimum wage rates for workers of all categories employed in a total of 31 factories and establishments were re-fixed during FY2008-2009 to FY 2017-18. In December 2018 of the current fiscal year, minimum wages were fixed in 8 industrial sectors including ready-made garments./The 'Bangladesh Labour Welfare Foundation Fund', formed to ensure the welfare of workers employed in both formal and non-formal sectors, have provided assistance amounting to Tk. 28.05 crore to a total of 6,052 workers from FY2012-13 till date. A sum of Tk. 57.05 crore has been provided to 2,981 workers employed in 100-percent export oriented garment industries from the aforementioned fund from FY2016-17 till date. Physical Infrastructure Power and Energy Madam Speaker Power is the Pathway to Prosperity Bearing in mind the slogan of Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for ensuing electricity in all households, the government has set targets to generate 24,000 megawatts by 2021, 40,000 megawatts by 2030, and 60,000 megawatts by 2041 respectively. To meet the demand of electricity in short, medium and in long term, the projects for generation, distribution and transmission are in different phases of implementation./The benefits of these initiatives are already visible. Currently, the power generation capacity has increased to 21,169 megawatts, and we have succeeded to provide access to electricity to approximately 93 percent of population. Besides, projects for construction of 53 power plants with capacity to generate 14,202 megawatts of electricity are underway. Alongside signing contracts for the establishment of 18 new power plants with a capacity to generate 5,801 megawatts of electricity is in progress (LOI and NOA has been given). It is expected that the plants will begin to function shortly. Moreover, invitation for tender for 7 power plants with a capacity to generate 1410 megawatts of electricity is in process. Plans have been taken to establish 17 power plants with a capacity to generate 19,650 megawatts of electricity in the near future. Besides, there are plans to generate extra electricity through BMRE of the existing old power plants. Madam Speaker Enhancement of Energy Security and Energy Efficiency In order to ensure energy security and sustainable energy supply system, we have plans to reduce the use of fuel to 15 percent by 2021 and to 20 percent by 2030. Fuel diversification has been adopted as a strategy to reduce dependency on natural gas for electricity generation and for energy security./The present government has implemented various projects to set up coal based power plants as an alternative for natural gas. Some mega projects are being implemented at Paira, Moheshkhali and Materbari classifying these areas as power hub. We selected these areas considering the land availability, transport facilities and load centers./The mega projects that are worth mentioning include 1,320 megawatts Maitree Super Critical Thermal Power Plant, Rampal, 1200 MW Ultra Super Critical Coal Project, Materbari and Payra 1320 MW Thermal Power Plant Project. Steps have been taken to establish 10,000 megawatts coal based power plant at Moheshkhali through Joint Investment. Besides the natural gas and coal based power plants, setting up of a nuclear power plant at Rooppur with a power generation capasity of 2,400 megawatts is in progress. In order to import Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), an alternative to indigenous natural gas, to ensure energy security in the country, two Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) with a daily capacity of 1000 million cubic feet have been installed, which currently adds around 650 million cubic feet LNG daily to the national grid. Power system master plan 2016 is targeting about 9000 MW installed capacity by 2041. Under this long term plan Bangladesh government is working with neighbouring countries for regional and subregional cooperation. As a result, power is being imported from India since 2013. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed between Bangladesh and Nepal for bilateral cross border trade of electricity and negotiation is going on to import 500 MWs of electricity from an IPP./The signing of an MOU between Bangladesh, India and Bhutan to import hydro power from Bhutan is underway. Renewable Energy and Energy Savings System There are targets to generate 10 percent of the total electricity from renewable sources by 2020. In order to promote electricity generation at the roof-tops of private buildings using solar home system, a 'Net Metering Guideline' has been prepared. Steps have been taken to install solar sytem panels at the rooftops of all educational institutions. Expansion of Power Transmission and Distribution System Our government has taken a series of actions in the last two terms to improve the transmission infrustructures and to support the additional generation capacity of the nation. As a result, the total transmission line has now increased to 11 thousand 493 circuit kilometers and the distribution line to 5 lakh 8 thousand kilometers. To ensure uninterrupted power supply, the government has been implementing a plan to install 28,000 circuit km. transmission lines and 6 lakh 60 thousand km distribution line through different projects by 2030. By next year, each upazila of the country will have 100 percent access to electricity. /Oil and Gas Exploration Program and Expansion of the Distribution System We have undertaken short, medium and long term plans to explore and extract unexplored gas and oil in land and sea areas. By now, the excavation work of 24 oil wells has been completed by BAPEX. After gaining new maritime boundary from India and Myanmar, Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) have been signed with international oil companies for 4 offshore blocks to explore oil and gas in the sea areas of Bangladesh. To accelerate oil and gas exploration and extraction, new bidding rounds will commence after the approval of the model PSC for both offshore and onshore. I propose an allocation of Tk. 28,051 crore for the Power Division and the Energy and Mineral Resources Division in FY2019-20, which was Tk. 26,502 crore in FY2018-19. Communication Infrastructure Madam Speaker A modern, safe and environment-friendly transportation and communication infrastructure is required to sustain economic development, and achieve a higher growth for the country. Bangladesh ranked 103 out of 140 countries in The Global Competitiveness Index, 2018 published by the World Economic Forum. Making a massive investment in the communication infrastructure sector is extremely important if we are to ensure our current advancement towards higher growth. /Considering communication infrastructure, especially the railway, as one of the priority sectors, the government has taken up and is implementing numerous projects. Development of Sustainable and Safe Roads and Highways To transform our country into a developed one by 2041, we have taken steps to develop and repair roads and highways, build new roads, construct flyovers/overpasses and bridges/culverts. Steps have been taken to gradually upgrade all national highways into four lanes or above in order to modernize the road transport system. In this respect, 509 km national highway has been upgraded into four lanes while upgradation of another 507 km highways is ongoing. Narrow and damaged bridges and culverts are being rebuilt. Rehabilitation, development and repairs of zone-based district highways are ongoing. SASEC Road Connectivity projects 1 and 2 are being implemented in order to be connected with the global transport network so as to reap the benefits of globalization. Steps will be taken to replace the risky bailey bridges with concrete bridges. Construction of Bridges-Tunnels and Establishment of an Uninterrupted Communication Network To establish an integrated and uninterrupted communication network in Bangladesh, we are implementing the Padma Bridge, the Tunnel under the Karnaphuli riverbed, the Dhaka Elevated Expressway from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to Kutubkhali of DhakaChattogram highway, and many other mega projects. About 2 km structure of the Padma Bridge, being constructed entirely with our own resources, has now become visible, and the overall physical progress of the project is 67 percent./The 2nd Kanchpur, 2nd Gomoti and 2nd Meghna Bridge have been opened for traffic after completing their construction ahead of the stipulated time. Hon'ble Prime Minister has opened these bridges for traffic. Development of an Integrated and Modern Urban Transport System To develop internal road networks in the Dhaka metropolitan area, reduce traffic congestion at the entry and exit points of Dhaka, and establish a planned and integrated modern public transport system in Dhaka and the adjacent areas, we are implementing the Revised Strategic Transport Plan (2015-35). Under this plan, the construction of the first Metro Rail in Bangladesh, MRT Line-6 from Uttara to Motijheel is in progress. Alongside, the implementation of Bus Rapid Transit or BRT from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to Gazipur is underway. Modern IT-based Safe Road Transport System Steps to build a safe, environment-friendly and modern IT based road transport and control systems are underway. We have identified 121black spots in national highway and taken preventive steps. /A plan has been taken up to install directional sign-signal and kilometer posts in 8,100 spots. Steps have been taken to build a separate lane for slow moving vehicles. As part of enhancement of road safety, measures have been taken to create a pool of skilled drivers. Apart from this, mass awareness programs, namely seminar, sticker and leaflet distribution activities are going on. Four automated vehicle inspection centres have been set up in Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Khulna divisions. This service will be expanded gradually to district headquarters. And meanwhile steps have been taken to set up vehicle inspection centres in 17 districts. Electronic toll collection system has been introduced at the Meghna Bridge. Madam Speaker Development of Passenger- friendly Railway System The present government is attaching a top priority to the railway sector in order to make railway an economical, safe and environmentfriendly mode of transport. For the overall development of railway, the government has undertaken a 30-year master plan spanning from 2016 to 2045 at a cost of Tk. 5,53,662 crore. As many as 230 projects have been identified under this plan for implementation by 2045. I express my firm belief that implementation of the projects undertaken to develop the railway transportation system will ease the public transport, largely reduce transport costs, expand business and commerce, create new employment opportunity and improve the socio-economic condition of the people. Activities, such as expansion of the railway service, construction of new railway lines and rehabilitation of rail tracks, conversion of rail line into Dual Gauge, opening of new rail stations and reopening of closed stations, launching of new trains, improving the quality of railway services and procurement of train coaches are underway. Steps have been taken to construct 1,110.50 km dual gauge double rail track (km) and 52 new rail track (km), procure 100 locomotives, construct 2 ICDs, procure locomotive simulators, construct 3 major bridges, procure 1,120 passenger coaches, modernize/construct 3 railway workshops, and modernize the signaling system under various development projects./The introduction of e-ticketing has not only eased railway travel for passengers, but also made it possible for them to easily learn the location of trains./The feasibility study to construct Dhaka-Chattogram high speed trains is in progress. Development of Trade-friendly Waterways and Port Considering the significance of infrastructure related to sea-riverland ports, and their efficient operational system in expanding international and domestic trade, the government is implementing a massive work plan to conduct capital dredging of our rivers, and to develop standards and modernize our ports. Dredging activities are in progress to restore navigability of 10 thousand kilometer long river ways. Alongside the river ways, development of necessary infrastructure and facilities at sea ports are also in progress. A plan for construction of the Bay-Terminal at the Chattogrm port at a cost of Tk. 17,000 crore has been undertaken./The handling capacity of the Chattogram port will be enhanced in the next financial year from 2.8 million TEUs to 3 million TEUs. Projects are being implemented to build necessary infrastructure and facilities at the Pyara sea port. Development and Expansion of Airports To facilitate fast and standard international and domestic aviation, the government has taken various steps for the infrastructural development at airports and ensuring easy and safe air travel for passengers. Construction of the third terminal at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport is in progress to enhance its passenger handling capacity to 12 million. Besides this, the work for expanding the runways and enhancing capacity of the Cox's Bazar Airport and the Osmani Airport is underway with a view to upgrading them to international standards./The feasibility study to improve the Syedpur Airport to the international level has been completed. Works for the site selection and feasibility study on the construction of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib International Airport is in progress. 124. I propose to allocate Tk. 61,455 crore for the communication infrastructure sector in the next FY2019-20, which was Tk. 53,081 crore in the current FY2018-19. Madam Speaker Bangladesh Delta Plan: Water Resource Management and Tackling Climate Change Bangladesh has been placed at the 6th position among the countries vulnerable to natural disasters due to climate change. Therefore, the government has formulated an adaptive, long-term, integrated and macro-level mega plan 'Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100' with the vision of 'achieving a safe, climate change resilient and prosperous delta'./The main objectives of the plan is to ensure sustainable use of water resources and prevent natural disasters. 126. Implementation of this mega plan will require a huge investment of 2.5 percent of total GDP of which 2.0 percent would have be met from public sector and the rest 0.5 percent from the private sector. 35 percent of the total investment will be spent in flood control, preventing river erosion, river excavation, dredging, river training and navigation. In the first phase, a total of 80 projects have been proposed under the Delta plan, whose implementation will begin in phases. Flood, Drought, River Erosion and Land Reclamation Steps have been taken for managing water resource, land use, and mitigating effects of the environment and climate change by re-excavating small rivers, canals and wetlands in 64 districts and assimilation of Climate Smart Integrated Coastal Resource Database (CSICRD). /We have undertaken various plans to increase navigability of rivers, dredging of 510 km of rivers by 2022 to prevent river erosion and ensure supply of water during the lean season, digging and reexcavation of 4,883 km of irrigation canals, construction and repair of 200 irrigation structures to extend irrigation facilities, construction of 3 barrages and rubber dams, construction of 250 km flood protection and coastal embankment to reduce flood, salinity and water logging, renovation of 1,040 km flood protection embankment and coastal embankment, construction and renovation of 590 flood protection and drainage infrastructure, excavation and re-excavation of 1,325 km drainage canals, and conservation work of 195 km border river banks and 6 cross-dams. 128. A 20-year Haor Development Master Plan and Database has been prepared for development of Haor areas. Under this, steps have been taken in the haor areas to develop infrastructure, re-excavate rivers, canals, and haors, and fostering socio-econmic development of the people of the concerned areas. 129. In recent times, human habitations, schools, government and private installations, business enterprizes, bazars, etc. are being devastated by river erosion, and people in the affected areas are losing everything. /To facilitate rehabilitation of the people affected by river erosion, I propose to allocate Tk. 100 crore in the budget. Water Resources Management of Cross-Border Rivers In view of the Framework Agreement on Cooperation for Development signed between Bangladesh and India in 2011 for water resource management and development of cross-border rivers through sub-regional cooperation, we have undertaken a plan to form an organization based on Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basins, such as the River Basin Organisation/River Basin Commission. Agriculture sector: Agricultural Development, Prosperous Country Madam Speaker Before I speak on the Agriculture Sector, I would like to present to you a quote from our Father of Nation, which is relevant to this sector./The Father of Nation Bangabandhu said- 'When people have food to their hearts' content, have a respectable life in this independent country, only then souls of thousands of martyrs will be satisfied'. Madam Speaker You know. Agriculture is vital to our national economy; 40.62 percent of total labour force is employed in this sector. Despite a gradual reduction in cultivable land, the average growth of agriculture sector stood at 3.7 percent over the last 10 years owing to sincere efforts from the government and relentless hard work of the farmers. Today, Bangladesh has secured the fourth position in rice production and the third position in vegetable production. In addition, we are in the 7th position in mango production and 8th in potato production. 133. We will continue successful interventions, such as agricultural subsidies, other agricultural input incentives and support cards including those for fertilizers and seeds, support for agricultural rehabilitation, agriculture credit at easy terms, etc. For agricultural development, a 20 percent cash incentive for exports of agricultural products is being provided in addition to general investment made for agricultural development, and a 20 percent rebate on electricity bills is provided for the electricity use in irrigation pumps./The number of farmers holding agricultural support cards now is 2 crore 8 lakh 13 thousand 477. 134. As many as 15 new varieties of different crops and 10 climateresilient technology have been innovated in the current fiscal year. A total of 329 high yielding variety of different crops tolerant to salinity and water submergence have been innovated since 2009. Activities for innovation of crop varieties tolerant to flood, drought, salinity and high temperature by conducting applied research will get priority in the next fiscal year in order to adapt to adverse effects of climate change. Besides, extension of crop diversification, popularizing organic pest management activities and mechanization of farming will be reinforced. Research activities to develop diversified jute products will continue. 135. Providing subsidies to control the price of fertilisers in agriculture has been in practice for many years, and this has contributed to the price stability of agriculture produce through the reduction in costs of production. A total of Tk. 5,201 crore was spent for this sector in FY201718./The present government has kept the sales price of fertilisers unchanged in the domestic market with a view to proteting farmers' interests even though the import price of major chemical fertilisers increased at times, which has indirectly assisted in checking consumer price inflation./The sales price for chemical fertilisers will be kept unchanged in the next fiscal year irrespective of their imuport costs, and incentives for the agriculture sector will continue. 136. Mechanization of harvesting and the follow up activities will be encouraged and subsidies will be provided to farmers to buy machinery for this purpose. Madam Speaker Fisheries and Livestock 137. Madam Speaker, you know, we secured the fourth position in the world in sweet water fish production. After the determination of Bangladesh's sea area in the Bay of Bengal, the government has developed a Plan of Action to develop the marine resources./Considering the importance of marine sea resources, the government has enforced a 65 day fishing ban this year in the sea area. However, it provided 65 kg rice to 4 lakh 15 thousand fishermen during this time as food support. 138. Bangladesh is almost self-sufficient in livestock, especially cattle and goat, production. According to a report published in 2017 by the Food and Agricultural Agency of the United Nations, Bangladesh secured the fourth position in the production of goat meat. Research are being carried out jointly by local and international institutions for fisheries and livestock development. We have formulated a plan of action for: (i) innovation of four livestock related technologies and their transfer through research and extension of effective models for the cure of foot-and-mouth disease and PPR diseases, (ii) extension of dole (airtight storage) system for preservation of fodder, (iii) completion of 35 research projects in different subjects, (iv) setting up laboratories in three regional centres, and (v) providing training in FY2019-20. 139./The government has taken strong steps to ensure food security. Apart from introducing the Food Safety Act, 2013, we have formulated 6 sets of regulations and 2 sets of rules for implementation of the law. In addition, a new food and nutrition policy is being formulated. Combatting Climate Change and Protection of Environment 140. To ensure sustainable development through the protection of environment, containing pollution, protection of bio-diversity and tackling the adverse impact of climate, government has formulated the 'National Environment Policy 2018'. It has allocated tasks among different ministries/divisions and departments to ensure their implementation. Steps have been taken to conduct research for projection of sea level rise in coastal areas of Bangladesh and its impact on agriculture, water resources and infrastructure./The government has enacted Brick Making and Kiln Establishment (Control) Act, 2019 to reduce air pollution. Steps will be taken in the coming days for the protection of Halda river including declaration of the river as an Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), and introduction of eco-tourism in various protected areas./The allocation for climate financing was 5.37 percent of the development budget in FY201415, which has risen to 8.26 percent (0.75 percent of GDP) in FY2018-19. I am presenting in this august House the Climate Budget Report for 25 ministries for FY2019-20. Local Government and Rural Development Madam Speaker 141. Immediately after independence, the Father of Nation Bangabandh Sheikh Rahman shared his vision about the local go overnance and rural development. This has been enshrined in Article 16 of the Constitution of People's Republic of Bangladesh./The Article articulates how the local government system would work. It reads as follows: 'The State shall adopt effective measures to bring about a radical transformation in the rural areas through the promotion of an agricultural revolution, the provision of rural electrification, the development of cottage and other industries, and the improvement of education, communications and public health, in those areas, so as progressively to remove the disparity in the standards of living between the urban and the rural areas' Following the path shown by the Father of the Nation, a number of initiatives have been implemented under the leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister. These have brought a sea change in the local governance system, and made the rural economy vibrant. Activities in all sectors - both agricultural and non-agricultural - have been multiplied. My Village, My Town 142./The present government has focused on rural development by setting up the slogan- 'Village will be Town'. Following the concept of 'My Village My Town' as described in the Election Manifesto, 2018, we will ensure establishment of agricultural machinery service centers and workshops, generation of productive employment, manufacturing of light machinery, and credit facility for marketing at the village level retaining all the rural characteristics. Civic amenities and facilities of the town will be made available in the villages. These include- modern transport infrastructures, creation of opportunities for modern health care and education, ensuring safe drinking water and sanitation, increasing electricity and fuel supply, and computers and high speed internet access. We will make necessary allocation for the relevant ministries. /My House My Farm 143. At present 60 lakh poor families are organized through 1 lakh 1 thousand 42 village co-operative societies under the project of 'My House, My Farm (Amar Bari Amar Khamar)', a dream venture of Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to alleviate poverty permanently by 2020. Around 95 thousand 386 co-operatives have been organized until March, 2019, under which the total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries is 2 crore 12 lakh 33 thousand. 144. There is a target for construction of 5,500 km new roads and 30,500 metre bridge/culvert, maintenance of 13,000 km pucca road and 3,700 metre bridge/culvert, development of 190 growth center/markets, construction/expansion of 64 Upazila Complex building and 130 cyclone shelter along with different development activities in rural areas in FY2019-20. Furthermore, steps have been taken for the construction of roads/footpaths, drainage, expansion of sewerage facilities, repair of roads, construction of bus/truck terminal, community centre, setting up of dustbin and waste management and construction of flyovers in important sites to reduce traffic jam in urban areas. /Alongside, Bangladesh has been efficiently doing massive work of providing health and other emergency services including provisioning of residential facilities, supply of drinking water, installation of sanitary latrines and building roads for more than 10 lakh Rohingya population who took refuge from Myanmar for more than two years. Moreover, implementation of a modern innovative housing program, namely 'Palli Janapad', is in progress along with the construction of roads, bridges and culverts, growth centres, hat-bazars, cyclone centres, the development of swamps, construction of sources of clean water and of drains, expansion of sewerage facilities, etc. in rural areas across the country as well as in three Hill districts. 145. I propose to allocate Tk. 66,234 crore for the agriculture and rural development sector in FY 2019-20, which was Tk. 59,677 crore in the current fiscal year 2018-19. Industrialization and Trade Madam Speaker Science-technology based Industry in Knowledge Society 146./The government has been emphasizing on labour intensive small and medium enterprizes (SMEs) development strategies to generate greater employment opportunities and develop entrepreneurship. Heavy and basic industries are getting importance as well, as these will contribute to the growth of multi-dimensional backward and forward linkage industries./The agroprocessing sector will be given priority in the provision of special facilities. Science-technology based industries in a knowledge society will be encouraged./The contribution of the industrial sector rose to 31.31 percent in the GDP of FY 2018-19. Madam Speaker Secured Position in World Trade 147. To encourage the export sector, all kinds of support will be provided and all obstacles will be removed so that the sector can remain competitive. All types of facilities will be provided for those products that have high export potential. Our ICT, leather, medicine, furniture, jewellery, especially jems and stone cutting, could be important sectors. 148. In FY2017-18, Bangladesh earned US$ 41 billion by exporting 744 products and services to 202 countries. Responding to the persuasive efforts from Bangladesh, the WTO extended the pharmaceutical patent waiver rights for LDCs upto 1 January 2033, which has opened up a new horizon for export of Bangladeshi pharmaceutical products. /Under the WTO, the duration of waiver on Preferential Market Access given to developing countries for LDCs' services has been extended to 2030. Services exports from Bangladesh has increased significantly in recent years, and it is expected that the benefits of LDC services waiver will lead to a further increase in our exports. Madam Speaker Leather and Footwear Industries 149. You know, we are now in the 8th position in the world in footwear exports. In future, more incentives will be provided by the government to facilitate further advancement of this potential sector. In the meantime, a Social and Environmental Compliance Handbook of Leather, Leathergoods and Footwear Industry has been formulated. Giving priority to the leather sector, the government will take all the steps that are necessary for the development of the sector. Exports of leather and leather products will be increased manifold, by ensuring environment-friendly waste treatment. 150. On the other hand, to ensure safety of citizens, all chemical warehouses are being transferred temporarily from the residential areas in the Dhaka city to Shampur and Keraniganj of Dhaka. In future, this temporary chemical village will be shifted permanently to Shirajdikhan in Munshiganj. Golden Future of Golden Fibre 151./The Jute Act, 2017 and the National Jute Policy, 2018 have been formulated to resolve the problems that exist in the jute sector. With assistance from the government, scientists have cracked genome of jute, and invented golden bag as an alternative to polyethene bag. Steps have been taken to enhance the use of golden bags made of jute. 152. In FY2018-19, export incentives have been offered against 35 categories of products. Export incentives provided in FY2008-09 amounted to Tk. 1,500 crore, which stood at Tk. 4,481 crore in FY201718, and these incentives have contributed to the efforts of enhancing export earnings. Fast Growing Textile Industry Madam Speaker 153. You know, we have acquired the 2nd position in the world in exporting of ready-made garments. In the current context of international trade, it is considered as a growing and promising sector. Keeping this in mind, our government has kept on providing all types of facilities to this sector including the existing incentives. /Currently, four sectors of readymade garments are receiving export incentives at 4 percent. I propose to provide an export incentive of 1 percent in the next fiscal year to the rest of the sectors of ready-made garments. An allocation of additional Tk. 2,825 crore will be made in the budget for FY2019-20 for this purpose. Promising Eco-Tourism 154. Bangladesh has many tourist spots, including the world's largest unbroken sandy sea beach at Cox's Bazar, which are yet to be fully introduced to the world. Work on establishing an Exclusive Tourist Zone is underway at Sabrang, Cox's Bazar, for foreign tourists. All the potential tourist spots in the country will be gradually made suitable for both local and foreign tourists. Madam Speaker Blue economy - the new horizon of opportunities 155. Through the conquest of the sea in the historic judgement by the International for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), under the dynamic leadership of the Prime Minister, Bangladesh received exclusive rights to 1 lakh 18 thousand 813 sq. km of sea from neighboring Myanmar and India, which is almost equivalent to the size of Bangladesh. There are more than 13 heavy mineral resources in the coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal which are very valuable. In addition, there are 475 species of fish, and 36 species of prawn, and sea algae, etc. By utilizing these resources, it is possible to increase our GDP by two percent./The proposed strategies for proper utilization of this resources with immense potential are- quick completion of multi-dimensional survey of marine resources; increase of coastal ships and modernization of sea ports and their capacity enhancement; intensify fishing in both deep-sea and shallow coastal waters; introduction of sea eco-tourism and boat tourism in the private sector; and keeping sea coasts and sea ports pollution-free. Digital Bangladesh: Achievements and Prospects Madam Speaker 156. Establishing 'Digital Bangladesh' is one of the key commitments of the Government. Work on necessary infrastructural development and extensive expansion of the information communication technologies has been undertaken with a view to providing easy public service to the doorsteps of the people in the country. Broadband internet access facilities have been extended up to the union level. Already all districts and divisions in the country have been brought under the 4G network, and mobile networks have been established in inaccessible upazilas./The government is taking necessary preparations to quickly rollout fifth generation (5G) mobile services. 157. Around 18 thousand 434 government offices under the ministries, divisions, directorates, districts and upazilas have been connected through an integrated network. About 28 high-tech parks/ software technology parks are being set up in the country. Meanwhile, work on three high-tech parks has been completed./The setting up of 'Bangabandhu High-tech City on 355 acres of land in Kaliakoir of Gazipur is progressing well./The government has set up the National Data Center (Tier-3 Certified). Steps have been taken to ensure all types of information security across the country to avoid security risks for the nationwide information technology network. Bangabandhu Satellite-1 in the space 158./The successful launch of Bangabandhu Satellite-1 in the space, draped in red-green flag colour, has been completed. Bangabandu Satellite-1 has eased the expansion of broadcast-based services in the remote areas. It has also ended our dependency on global telecommunications services. There has been a lot of improvement in the case of communications for defense and disaster management. Strong Management Information System (MIS) in Government Offices 159. We are giving priority to increasing the contribution of the ICT sector in the GDP to ensure that the high growth trend remain integrated and sustainable in the future. Steps have been taken to ensure all types of information security across the country to avoid security risks for the nationwide information technology network. A strong Management Information System (MIS) will be set up in all government offices to facilitate collection and collation of updated data, and exchange of information, as per requirements of international organizations, among various activities and services of the government. Madam Speaker Development of ICT-based Skilled Human Resource: We Are in the Era of Fourth Industrial Revolution 160./The whole world is poised to enter into the age of the Fourth Industrial revolution, which relies on the fullest use of digital technology./The fourth industrial revolution is going to make massive changes in industrial production, business, employment, administration, and on all fronts. We cannot afford to lag behind. We will have to march forward keeping pace with the world. ICT-based human resource will be the driving force in our dream of attaining higher economic growth. To consolidate the growth trend in the coming days, the ICT sector's contribution to GDP will have to be increased. If we can increase productivity through ICT, our GDP growth will reach two-digit figure soon. Therefore, our dependence on ICT will have to increase further in the coming days. Blockchain: Internet of Value 161. Blockchain technology is becoming an inseparable and secure medium of global information exchanges. In addition to financial transactions, its application has also begun in the areas of business, commerce, intellectual property, healthcare, preservation and sharing of proprietary data. Time has come for Bangladesh to adopt the blockchain technology to keep pace with the new trend. We will use the blockchain technology next year on an experimental basis. Innovations 162. Effective application of innovation, i.e. new work or activity, has created a new wave of global change in the field of technology, business, management, etc. To nurture a culture of innovation in Bangladesh, the government will work in the future, especially with the youth to harness their creative talents. And necessary budget allocation will be made for this sector. Research and Development 163. Scientific research and development (R and D) is one of the prerequisites for increasing productivity and maintaining long-term economic growth. Opportunities will be created to encourage research and development activities in the country. In the next FY2019-20, we are proposing to allocate an additional Tk 50 crore for the research and development sector. Digital Land Management 164. Quarrels, affrays, and litigations in rural parts of Bangladesh mostly originate from land disputes./The only way to get rid of this situation is to automate the land management. Online delivery of reports, e-mutation and e-settlement activities have already been started. Digital land data banks and land zoning activities have also been taken. Necessary budget allocation will be made for this purpose. Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Act, 2017 has been enacted to ensure satisfactory compensation to landowners for acquiring land for public interest. Digital land survey is in progress for modernization of land use. Work is underway to automate the land related services delivery system throughout the country to simplify the delivery of land related services. Poverty Reduction and Social Safety Net Programmes Ensuring Equal Opportunity through Elimination of Poverty and Discrimination Madam Speaker 165. According to Article 19 (6) of the Constitution, it is an obligation of the State to eliminate social and economic inequality among humans, to ensure equitable distribution of resources among citizens and to attain an equal level of economic development throughout the Republic./The Father of the Nation Bangabandhu started the struggle for independence from this urge to free the people from poverty and exploitation./The Prime Minister, the worthy successor of the Father of the Nation, has been continuing that struggle to emancipate people from poverty. She sincerely believes that poverty is our main enemy. 166. In the last decade, Bangladesh has made significant progress in poverty reduction through a coordinated approach efforts of various initiatives including the overall government development programmes, private investment, and social security programmes./The poverty rate was 40.0 percent in 2005, which has been brought down to 21.8 percent in 2018./The government has declared to reduce poverty to 12.30 percent and the extreme poverty rate to 4.50 percent by 2023-24. Social Safety Net Programmes 167./The National Social Security Strategy Paper 2015 has been formulated for reducing poverty and discrimination. Action Plan 20162011 for its implementation has been approved. We are increasing the allocation for the social safety net sector every year to ameliorate the condition of the poor. By now, nearly a quarter of the families in the country has been covered under the social safety net programmes. As per our Election Manifesto, 2018, budget allocation in this sector will be doubled in the next five years./The government has allocated Tk. 74,367 crore in the sector, which is 14.21 percent of total budget and 2.58 percent of GDP in FY2019-20. In the revised budget of FY2018-19, the allocation was Tk. 64,404 crore. We are also implementing various programmes for the marginal communities besides helping the people with disabilities. Madam Speaker 168. We are presenting before this August House a set of proposals to widen the remit of social safety net programmes in FY2019-20:  State honorarium for the valiant freedom fighters to be increased from Tk. 10,000 to Tk. 12,000;  The number of recipients of adult allowances to be increased from 40 lakh to 44 lakh;  The number of recipients of allowances for widows and victims of domestic violence to be increased from 14 lakh to 17 lakh;  The number of beneficiaries of allowances for all insolvent persons with disabilities to be increased from 10 lakh to 15.45 lakh;  The number of recipients of stipends for disabled students to be increased from 90 thousand to one lakh; and the rate of stipends to be increased from Tk. 700 to Tk. 750 for primary students, from Tk. 750 to Tk. 800 for secondary students, and from Tk. 850 to Tk. 900 for higher secondary students;  To bring all third gender people under the net, the number of beneficiaries of Third Gender Livelihood Development programmes to be increased to 6 thousand;  Additional 20 thousand beneficiaries from the gypsies and disadvantaged communities to be included in the current list of 64 thousand persons; The number of beneficiaries of the financial assistance programme for patients suffering from cancer, kidney, liver cirrhosis, paralyzed due to stroke and congenital heart diseases to be increased from 15 thousand to 30 thousand;  The number of beneficiaries of livelihood development programmes for tea-garden workers to be increased from 40 thousand to 50 thousand;  The number of beneficiaries of maternity allowances for poor mothers to be increased from 7 lakh to 7 lakh 70 thousand;  The number of beneficiaries under lactating mothers' assistance programmes to be increased from 2 lakh 50 thousand to 2 lakh 75 thousand. 169. Priority is given for ensuring the selection of genuine beneficiaries to enhance the effectiveness of social safety net programmes. For this purpose, steps have been taken to establish MIS for all programmes and database for all beneficiaries. Payments are being made directly from the government to the beneficiaries through the G2P system. Development of Disabled People 170. We are providing disability allowances, stipends for disable students, disability support services and financial assistance to schools for disable students, as well as increasing budget allocation./The National Disability Development Foundation has been providing various types of services for the empowerment and economic development of the backward, deprived, helpless, autistic and disabled people of the country. These include- small loans and grants-in-aid, establishment of Mobile One Stop Therapy Service, organizing Disability Job Fairs in remote areas, and skills development training. A separate plan will be made, and separate budget will be allocated to engage the disabled people in businesses and productive activities. Interest-free Microcredit for Poverty Reduction 171. In 1974, the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for the first time started the rural social service programme for the purpose of reducing poverty of the disadvantaged and backward population in the rural areas. Through the Department of Social Services, families of the extreme poor people in villages have been receiving interest-free microcredit in the range of Tk. 5,000 to Tk. 30,000 under four microcredit programmes, namely- rural social services (RSS) activities, rural maternity center (RMC) activities, rehabilitation of the people affected by the burn injuries and disabled people and urban society development activities. About 50 percent of people involved in these activities are women. In the budget estimation for FY2019-2020, I propose to allocate Tk 64.5 crore for this purpose. Madam Speaker Welfare of Freedom Fighters 172./The government is working relentlessly to preserve the memory of the liberation war and the welfare of the freedom fighters. In order to ensure the overall welfare of the freedom fighters, state honorariums are being given to freedom fighters and their successors./The amount of this allowance has been increased many times in the last ten years. Besides, two festival bonuses, Glorious Victory Day allowance, and Bengali New Year allowance are also being provided. Their allowances are now being sent electronically to their bank accounts. A piece of legislation titled Bangladesh Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust Act, 2018 has been enacted to ensure the welfare of the freedom fighters. Besides, to provide housing facilities to the freedom fighters, single-storied buildings are being constructed for 15,000 destitute freedom fighters in the country, either in their own land or through settlement in Khas lands, if necessary. Empowerment of Women and Focus on Children 173. Bangladesh is rapidly progressing in terms women's involvement in political empowerment, education and economic affairs. Bangladesh has secured the top position in South Asia in reducing gender disparity. Bangladesh is very much ahead in reducing gender disparity in the Muslim world, and even among the developed countries such as te United States and China. In accordance with Articles 19, 27, 28 and 29 of the Constitution, we are committed to establish equal rights and dignity of women and men, and ensure participation of women in all spheres of national lives./The government has taken appropriate programmes to ensure education, health, employment, and women empowerment. At the same time, the government will strengthen programmes to mitigate and prevent violence against women and also undertake effective measures to create a gender-friendly environment in all spheres of lives./The gender budget, containing budget allocation for women in 44 ministries/divisions in FY2019-20, is submitted herewith. Increasing investment for children is a priority of the government./The allocation for the children in the last fiscal year was Tk. 65,600 crore. For the next fiscal year, Tk. 80,200 crore will be allocated, which is 15.33 percent of the national budget. Planned Urbanization and Housing Madam Speaker 174. Bearing in mind the slogan of Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 'Housing for all, there will be no homeless', and the SDG targets, the government has launched various programmes for planned urbanization, which will continue. 175./The real estate sector in our country has remained almost stagnant for a long time./The main reason behind its slow expansion is the existence of an exorbitant level of stamp duty and registration fee. As a result, the government is losing revenue, and the volume of un-disclosed income is also rising. We will take steps to bring down these fees at a reasonable level. This will facilitate the expansion of the real estate sector on the one hand, and augment our revenue collection on the other. There is a plan to build 60 thousand flats under the PPP system in Purbachal new city of Dhaka. About 39 km of canals has been excavated in Hatirjheel, Gulshan, Banani, Uttara, Kuril and Purbachal areas to reduce waterlogging and enhance beautification of the Dhaka city, and there is a plan to excavate another 55 km of canals in the future. Besides, there is another plan to reserve 62 percent of the 9,125 acres of area in the flood-flow zones of the Turag River as reservoirs, and to build compact townships in the remaining areas. /Sports, Culture and Religion Madam Speaker 176. Our government is playing an important role in the development of nationwide infrastructures for sports and culture to organise different types of competitions and events at national and district/ upazila levels. Talented players in various sports are being hunted and provided with long-term training. In the budget for FY2019-20, I propose to make a special allocation of Tk. 20 crore to Bangladesh Football Federation for the development of football in the country. 177. Steps have been taken for modernization, digitization and automation of the broadcasting system of Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar. We have also taken steps to launch nationwide digital terrestrial broadcasting and establish Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Film City. To provide support to the insolvent journalists, we allocate resources to the Journalist Welfare Trust from the budget. 178. In the coming fiscal year, the country will celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Massive preparations are now afoot involving people from all walks of life to celebrate the day at both home and abroad. For this, adequate budget will be allocated for the next fiscal year. 179. We have formulated our National Hajj-Umrah Policy 2019 in alignment with the e-Haj system of Saudi Arabia. As a result, Hajj pilgrims can now complete pre-registration and registration through hassle-free online system in 2019./The Hajj calendar was prepared for the first time in 2018 following which the performance of Hajj was conducted. At the same time, the inter-ministerial committee has, for the first time, hired accommodation in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrims. Meanwhile, constructions of 560 model mosques and Islamic cultural centers for the development of religious education and promotion of Islamic culture are underway in all districts and upazilas of Bangladesh. Alongside, funds are being channelled to the Hindu, Buddhist and Christian Religious Welfare Trust for the development of monasteries/temples/churches/cremation grounds, and for providing financial assistance to the residential monks and the destitutes. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Madam Speaker 180. You are aware, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in the historic UN Summit in 2015 to implement them over a period from 2015 to 2030, in continuation of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). /Bangladesh's performance in achieving various goals and indicators of MDGs has been remarkable. We are fully committed to achieve similar success in implementing the SDGs. Meanwhile, 82 percent of SDGs has been incorporated in the 7th Five Year Plan, which is currently being implemented. SDGs Action Plans for ministries and divisions have been formulated under which various ministries and divisions are adopting projects/programmes. Regular monitoring of SDGs implementation is being conducted and the 'Sustainable Development Goals: Bangladesh Progress Report 2018' has been prepared covering all the goals and targets. For localization of SDGs, about 40 priority indicators have been approved for implementation at the district and upazila levels. In the priority list, targets, such as reducing the rate of poverty below 10 percent and extreme poverty below 3 percent by 2030 have been included. 181. We will need a huge amount of financial resources till 2030 to implement SDGs./The role of the private sector, in addition to the government, will be crucial to meet this resource gap. Besides, the government is also emphasizing implementation of PPP project as an alternative source of financing. Providing Shelter and Humanitarian Assistance to Displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar 182./The displaced Rohingya refugees, who escaped from Myanmar to save their lives from torture, oppression and ethnic cleansing, have been given shelter in Bangladesh as a humanitarian gesture. Bangladesh has been providing all necessary physical support services, including food, housing, health and other emergency services, to over 1.1 million Rohingyas. Following the directions of Hon'ble Prime Minister, bilateral discussions have been continuing to ensure safe, dignified and permanent repatriation of Rohingyas to their homeland. Chapter V Reform and Good Governance Madam Speaker 183. Reform is a continuous process. In the past, we took and implemented a range of reform initiatives to improve the profile of governance. In continuation of these initiatives, I would like to highlight some of the important reforms initiatives undertaken by our Government. Improvement of Investment Climate Establishment of 100 Economic Zones to Generate one crore Employment 184. Establishment of 100 Economic Zones accross the country is in progress for employment generation through increased investment. Almost one crore new jobs will be created in these Economic Zones. /Construction work of 'Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Industrial Area' the largest, planned and modern industrial area on 30,000 acres of land at Mirsharai, Sonagazi and Shitakunda Upazila is progressing in full swing. Investment proposals worth US$ 15.1 billion has been received so far for these Economic Zones. Public Private Partnership 185. As an alternative of public financing, we will encourage approval and implementation of projects under the Public Private Partnership initiative for infrastructure construction. Rules for Viability Gap for PPP Project, 2018 and Rules for PPP Technical Assistance Financing, 2018 have been issued for simplification of the government's financial involvement process. A policy has been formulated for implementation of PPP projects under G2G agreement. Implementation of 3 PPP projects is underway at a cost of US$ 2.7 billion. At present, 61 projects have been selected for implementation under PPP model. /A good number of projects are also in the pipeline. Improvement of Ease of Doing Business Index 186. Rapid industrialization and employment generation will be possible, if we can reduce the cost of starting business. To attain this objective, reform activities have been strengthened to improve in the Ease of Doing Business Index of Bangladesh within two digits. Amendment of Companies Act, 1994 has been initiated for improvement of business environment. Various registration fees applicable for companies have already been significantly reduced. There will be no fee for companies having capital of less than Tk. 50,000. 187. One Stop Service (OSS) has been introduced so that investors can get different kinds of investment related services easily and quickly. Provision of investment related services as One Stop in 64 districts will be monitored, and investment related services will be gradually provided to all districts through One Stop Service. Reforms in Financial Sector Setting up financial institutions on strong base 188./The government has initiated and implemented various activities for the reform and development of banking, capital market, insurance and other financial sectors. Madam Speaker 189. We did not observe any mentionable reform initiative in some areas, especially in the banking sector from the beginning. There was no exit route for the loan recipient if he/she fails to repay the bank loan. This time around, we have arranged an exit for the loan recipient through effective insolvency and bankruptcy laws. We have heard for long about establishing a Bank Commission for bringing discipline in the banking and financial sector. We would discuss with all concerned in this matter and do the needful. 190. We have observed that, no mentionable instruments were used in our financial sector. This has led banks to give long term loans by collecting short term deposits. This creates a mismatch. It may turn out to be critical sometimes. We will take necessary measures to remove such kind of mismatch. We will encourage instruments like Wage Earners' Bond, venture capital, treasury bond including a vibrant bond market. We are also thinking the following reforms: - We will increase capital (authorized and paid up) of banks gradually. - Bank Company Act will be amended so that our bank management, all components of revenue management (VAT, Customs and Income Tax) can function as usual, without facing any conflict with other laws. - Bank Company Act will be amended so that amalgamation, merger and absorption of banks can be legally processed, if required. - Stern measures will be taken against the willful defaulters of bank loans - We have been working to bring down the interest rates of bank loans to single digits with a view to making our industries and businesses more competitive. - Necessary ammendmends will be brought to the Bank Company Act to modernize the functions of holding companies and subsidiary companies. Good Governance in Capital Market Madam Speaker 191. You know, a strong capital market is required for any strong economy. If an economy is strong, it means that its capital market is also strong. As we want a strong economy, we would like to see the existence of a strong, vibrant and well-functioning capital market. Capital market is the ideal platform to collect fund for long term industrial investment. However, there is a trend in Bangladesh to provide long term bank loans from short term deposits, which is not evident in other countries. It creates mismatch./The banks and loan recipients become the loser eventually. We will take effective measures to encourage investors to collect long term fund/finance from the capital market. Under the supervision of Bangladesh Bank, an amount of Tk. 856 crore has already been released under the incentive scheme, which shall be reused on a revolving basis for the protection of small investors' interest. Training will be provided to potential investors for clear understanding on share market before their investment in the market. Vigilance has been strengthened to ensure compliance of the capital market. We shall offer numerous incentives for the capital market in coming years. Dividend income from the listed companies shall be tax-free upto Tk. 50,000. Double taxation on dividend from listed companies will also be removed. Special incentives will continue for encouraging investment in the capital market. 192. If a financially solvent company wants to merge/amalgamate with the financially sick company, we will create the scope for that. We believe that if this can be done even allowing for investment allowance, if needed, through negotiation, it will lead to a strong capital market. Through the process, the depth and stability of the capital market will be enhanced. Reforms for maintaining discipline in the financial sector 193. /Necessary reform initiatives have been taken so that the loan recipients can repay their loan in time, for establishing improved loan culture in the country. Central database for large credit (CDLC) has been established for close monitoring of large loans and strengthening the monitoring system of banks and financial institutions. Instruction has been given to keep the weighted average spread of interest rates limited within 4 percent except for credit cards and consumer loans. Insurance for encountering risk 194. Loss of crops due to natural calamities is quite frequent in our country. In order to save the farmers from the financial loss caused by this, a pilot project for 'crop insurance' will be introduced. In addition, insurance of properties generated from large projects will be covered by the local insurance companies. Measures will be taken to arrange group insurance with more than one company, if necessary. Insurance for 'loss of profit' will also be introduced. Accident insurance for factory workers will be implemented. 195./The government is planning to introduce livestock insurance, small insurance for poor women and health insurance for government employees and common people. Digitization of the insurance sector and its high rate of penetration have been planned. I believe, the use of life insurance is not prevalent in our country; popularization of life insurance may contribute to our economy to a great extent. Public Financial Management (PFM) Madam Speaker Application of IBAS++ Software Developed by Local Experts 196. Our public financial management system has been elevated to international standard from current fiscal year through the introduction of new Budget and Accounting Classification System (BACS). In addition to civil administration, we are going to apply IBAS++ (Integrated Budget and Accounting System), a fully automated system developed by our local experts, in defense and railway budget and accounting process. Radical Transformation of Project Fund Release Process 197. Project fund release process has been simplified. Project Director (PD) has been fully authorized to utilize project fund including 4th installment without seeking approval from any authority. /As a result, 1-2 months time will now be saved in the fund release process of any project. Thus, the pace of implementation of development projects will be accelerated. Payment of Social Safety Allowances through G2P 198. Social safety net MIS has been established in the Finance Division for bringing transparency and improving efficiency of social safety net payments. With this MIS, selection process of beneficiaries has now become easier after verification of information from the National ID server. By using this MIS, payments from the government exchequer to the beneficiary's bank or mobile bank account are now being processed through the G2P method. All cash transfers will be gradually brought under this G2P payment procedure. Digitalization of Savings Scheme 199. Real time information is available now on sale, profit and encashment of national savings schemes from the 'National Savings Scheme Online Management System', introduced with the initiative of the Finance Division for modernizing the management system of national savings schemes transactions. Maximum purchase limit of savings scheme can now be easily controlled and monitored through NID linked digitized system. Payment of the principal amount and profit of the client can now be automatically made through EFT. It will ensure discipline in public financial management, and interest payment for this purpose will be reduced gradually. (4) Reform of Pension Payment of Pension through EFT 200./The process of pension payment through EFT has started to reduce the hassle of pensioners in getting their pension. System has been introduced so that pensioners can automatically get their pension in their bank or mobile account without any physical presence in any accounts office or any bank. Payment of pension in pensioner's bank accounts through EFT has already been made to 27,000 pensioners. All pensioners will be brought under this system in the next fiscal year. Bringing all Government Employees under Group Insurance Scheme 201. Although there is a group insurance system for government employees but in reality it is not an insurance. With the assistance of Jiban Bima Corporation, the existing system will be reformed and converted into an integrated insurance system for bringing all government employees under the insurance coverage. Introduction of Universal Pension Scheme 202. Government pensioners are only a small fraction of the total population in the country. A 'Universal Pension Authority' will be formed soon for gradual introduction of the universal pension for everyone including all employed in formal and informal sectors of the economy. Public Administration for Public Service Madam Speaker People Friendly and Efficient Public Administration 203. Provision of quick service for implementing the commitments made in the Election Manifesto of 2018, training and improvement of efficiency, institutional reforms and strengthening as well as bringing field administration within the scope of information technology have been identified as priorities./The Public Service Act, 2018 has been passed by the Parliament. Public servants are now promoted and posted on the basis of merit and efficiency. Governance Innovation Unit 204. Under the Prime Minister's Fellowship program, Masters, PhD and other fellowship programs in renowned universities of the world (such as, Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard) has begun for creating government's own expert panel on SDG goals. Transparency and Accountability in Government's Service Delivery 205. Online Grievance Redress System (GRS) has been introduced in all Ministries and Divisions of the government for improving quality of service delivery, strengthening good governance and ensuring accountability of the public administration. Decisions in government offices are now taken through e-filing system for providing speedy services to the citizens at a low cost. House Building Loan for Government Employees 206. Provision of House Building Loan through the Banking System Policy, 2018 has been formulated with the intension of increasing house building loans of government employees to a realistic level. In this case, state owned banks and Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation will operate the loan as implementing agencies. I believe, with the introduction of this system, government employees would be more enthusiastic, and will further their efforts to establish good governance at all levels of administration. Use of ICT in Case Management Digitization of Judicial Management 207. Steps have been taken, to bring all courts of the country within the ICT network through e-judiciary process to accelerate the disposal of cases. In addition, a cyber tribunal has been established in Dhaka for ensuring speedy and effective judgment of the offences committed under the Information and Communication Technology Act. Establishment of 7 more tribunals in 7 divisional towns is underway. Renovation and construction work of 4 chambers in the Appellate Division and 30 chambers including ejlash will be completed for enhancing the capacity of the Appellate Division. All activities of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts will be brought under the automated networking system. Present status, hearing date, result and complete judgment of all trial cases in the jurisdiction of sub-ordinate courts will be published in the website regularly. Prevention of Corruption 'Bandha hole durnity, unnayoney ashbe goti' (Stop corruption, accelerate development) 208. Our government has adopted a policy of 'zero tolerance' against corruption./The number of divisional offices has been increased to 8 from 6, and the number of integrated district offices has been increased to 36 from 22 for increasing administrative capacity of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). An Intelligence Unit has been established and 1 platoon armed police has been attached with the ACC for speeding up the activities of the commission. An web based software will be made for proper monitoring of all activities of the commission starting from lodgement of complaint, investigation, filing and follow up of corruption cases. For effective use of this software 200 officers will be trained. Chapter VI Revenue Collection Activities Madam Speaker 209. A large part of our total budget expenditure is financed from the internal resources collected by the National Board of Revenue (NBR). Generally, the internal revenue collection target is made on the basis of the size of the budget. There are mainly three sources of revenue: NBR- Tax, Non-NBR Tax and Non-Tax Revenue. About 85 percent of our revenue is collected by the NBR./The growth trend of NBR tax collection in the last decade was quite good. In FY2017-18, the growth rate of NBR tax revenue was 20.24 percent. Table 1 of Annexure-B provides a set of statistics of revenue collection during the last 10 years. Though the tax to GDP ratio is comparatively low, the growth in revenue collection is continuing. 210. Our goal is to increase revenue collection in line with GDP growth. We have taken many reform initiatives in the field of direct and indirect taxes with a view to increasing revenue collection. A large number of taxpayers will be brought under the tax net by conducting survey, bringing administrative reforms, making TIN compulsory for receiving different utility services, encouraging TIN holders to submit their tax returns. To ensure efficient and effective tax administration, NBR is in the process of automating and digitizing all operations of Income Tax, VAT and Customs departments. We are expecting the number of our income taxpayers will be more than one crore by the next few years. Income tax department has taken a number of initiatives to create a taxpayers'-friendly environment for building taxpayers trust in the revenue department. 211./The implementation of the Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012, which was supposed to start in FY2017-2018, but was postponed for two years in response to the request from the business community. This act will be implemented in this year./The NBR has already reached a consensus informally with the business community. For smooth implementation of the new VAT Act, proposal is being placed in the Parliament for updating the Act by rearranging VAT rates. Our government is implementing VAT Online project with a view to making the VAT system completely automated./The NBR is working to set up Electronic Fiscal Device (EFD) in every business organization to make VAT collection more transparent. NBR is now in the process of procuring these EFD machines. 212./The existing Customs Act 2019 is in English. While contemporary issues of the Customs Department are updated every year through Finance Acts, it was felt that the Act should be in Bangla. Following the international best practices and the kind instruction of Hon'ble Prime Minister, the Customs Act, 2019 in Bangla has been prepared, and the process for placing it before Parliament is finalized. This law will replace the existing Customs Act, 1969. Meanwhile the process of formulating the new Income Tax Act following the international best practices has begun. I hope that this new law will be placed before the Parliament next year. 213. Use of information and communication technology began in the Customs Department a long ago with the introduction of ASYCUDA. As part of the ongoing reforms, steps have been taken to introduce legal provisions concerning scanning of imports and exports. Steps have been taken to set up latest scanning systems in all customs ports and customs stations. Likewise developed countries, the National Single Window (NSW) project has been undertaken to connect all the stakeholders associated with import-export to the customs software. It will provide the facilities of One Stop Service in all activities related to imports and exports./The current law has been amended with a view to introducing Authorized Economic Operator (AEO), Risk Management, and Advance Passenger Information System (API) to facilitate the clearance of goods and quick handling of passengers. Furthermore, provisions to establish the process of customs assessment of import consignments before their arrival at the port as in developed countries, known as Pre-Arrival Processing (PAP), and creation of a Special Functional Unit under the NBR have been included in the law. These will contribute to improving the business and passenger facilities and reducing tax evasion. Chapter VII Income Tax, Value Added Tax and Import-Export Duty Madam Speaker 214. NBR officials work relentlessly to achieve the revenue target set by the government every year. NBR tax revenue is basically collected from Income Tax, Value Added Tax (VAT) and Import  and  Export Duty. Except Income Tax, the other two are indirect taxes. Supplementary duty and regulatory duty are also collected as indirect taxes. I am now submitting revenue proposals one after another. Direct Tax: Income Tax 215. Income tax is considered as an effective taxation system because it ensures social justice and equity through redistribution of income./The income tax system in Bangladesh will be made more effective to ensure the reduction of income inequality so that the benefit of economic growth and development can be distributed to all the citizens equally. We have set a target of collecting 50 percent of total NBR tax revenue from income tax by FY2021-22. By now we have made some headway in collecting income tax. Even a decade back, the contribution of income tax was only 20 percent of total NBR tax revenue; the contribution has increased to 35 percent during the tenure of our government. 216. Our main principle is to collect more income tax by broadening the tax base without increasing the tax rate. For this purpose, we have taken an initiative to bring new taxpayers under the tax net instead of burdening the existing taxpayers with more tax. During the last ten years of our government, a large number of peoples are eligible to pay income tax; thanks to the unprecedented economic growth and development that took place in our country. /To bring these people into the tax net, expansion of income tax department is necessary. Effective initiatives have already been taken to expand the Income Tax department. With this expansion program, tax offices will be set up in every upazila in Bangladesh. At the field level, the number of Taxes Zone will be increased to 63 from existing 31. For making the tax administration more goal-oriented, job-oriented and taxpayers-friendly, the tax intelligence, investigation and enforcement unit; digital tax management unit; tax deduction management unit; tax information unit; international tax unit; taxpayer service, public relations and infrastructure unit; and tax dispute resolution unit will be set up. I hope, with successful implementation of these initiatives, revenue on average will grow by 25 percent in the coming years, and the Tax-GDP ratio will increase to 15 percent by 2021. 217. To achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and fulfill the dream of raising the status of Bangladesh to a developed nation by 2041, we have to scale up revenue collection, in particular, income tax collection significantly. However, we have to ensure that revenue augmentation efforts do not affect adversely our businesses and investments. /We believe that, increase in investment will result in increased business, increased production, increased exports, more employment, increased income, increased profit of business, and accumulate more capital for entrepreneurs, which in turn will be reinvested. This virtuous cycle will result in more income of the taxpayers and more tax revenue. Our principle is to increase revenue collection by strengthening and accelerating this virtuous cycle. We need to generate a large amount of revenue for the development and progress of our country. We will collect this revenue in such a manner so that the taxpayers are not unnecessarily harassed, and their business is not hampered. We want to promote voluntary and spontaneous payment of taxes by ensuring a taxpayers-friendly atmosphere. Now I am presenting the key proposal relating to direct taxes - Madam Speaker Tax Exemption Threshold and Tax Rates 218. General tax exemption threshold of income of taxpayers, other than company, for the last few years was Tk. 2,50,000/-./The threshold for female taxpayers was Tk. 3,00,000/-. In addition, this threshold is higher for other special classes of taxpayers./The criteria for keeping the threshold unchanged for the last few years have remained same this year as well. In developed countries, tax exemption threshold of income is generally less than 25 percent of per capita income. Some countries even do not have any threshold limit. In developing countries, it is mostly equal to or below per capita income. In Bangladesh, the tax exemption threshold is almost 1.5 times above the per capita income. Moreover, any increase in the tax exemption threshold will push a significant number of taxpayers out of the tax net, which will eventually erode the tax base./The tax rates for all types of taxpayers except company have remained unchanged during the last few years./The taxpayers got habituated with this rate of tax. Considering all these, I propose that the tax exempted income threshold and tax rate for all taxpayers except for company will remain unchanged for the next year. Tax rates for non-company taxpayers have been shown in Table 2 of Annexure-B. 219. Existing minimum tax for a taxpayer, except company taxpayer, residing in Dhaka North City Corporation, Dhaka South City Corporation and Chittagong City Corporation, any other city corporation, and other areas is Tk. 5,000, Tk. 4,000, and Tk. 3,000 respectively. I propose to maintain this structure of minimum tax for the next year as well. Company Tax Rate 220. Currently multiple corporate tax rates are in existence for different corporate sectors. For publicly traded company, tax rate in Bangladesh is 25 percent and for publicly non-traded company tax rate is 35 percent. Besides, a good number of corporate sectors are enjoying reduced tax rates and tax exemptions. When these facts are taken into consideration, we find the effective corporate tax rate in Bangladesh is below 5 percent. In addition, the tax rate for banks and financial institutions was reduced by 2.5 percent from last year, which resulted in significant reduction of tax collection from this sector. Considering the facts, I propose to continue with the existing corporate tax rate structure for the next year./The proposed tax rate for company taxpayers has been presented in Table 3 of Annexure-B,. Nonetheless, in view of reality, I propose to raise the minimum tax for mobile companies to 2% of their turnover from 0.75%. Madam Speaker Equity and Fairness 221. Surcharge. At present, wealth tax law does not exist in Bangladesh. Instead of paying wealth tax, wealthy individual taxpayers in Bangladesh pay surcharge at certain rates based on their income tax. This provision of surcharge has been in force for the last few years. We have observed that a large number of wealthy people show little income in their tax returns despite they possess huge amount of wealths. Consequently, they pay an insignificant amount of surcharge because their revealed little income. Considering all these facts, I propose an individual taxpayer having a net wealth of Tk. 50 crore or above shall pay higher of 0.1% of net wealth or 30% of his income tax payable as surcharge. Currently surcharge applies to taxpayers having net wealth above Tk. 2.25 crore. I propose to raise the limit of surcharge to Tk. 3 crore. Details on these are presented in Table 4 of Annexure-B. 222. I propose a minimum surcharge amounting to Tk. 3,000, where net wealth of an individual exceeds Tk. 3 crore and a minimum surcharge amounting to Tk. 5,000 for individuals who have net wealth exceeding Tk. 10 crore. In addition, 2.5 percent surcharge on the profit of the business of the manufacturers of cigarette, bidi, zarda, gul and other tobacco products will remain unchanged. Facilitating business and growth 223./The income generated through production of goods and services in Economic Zones and High-Tech Parks has been given tax exemption facilities at different rates for 10 years. With a view to driving up more investment and create more employment, I propose a new provision in the income tax law, to accept investment in Economic Zone and High-Tech Parks, without any question on the sources of invested fund, by the income tax department, if the taxpayer pays 10 percent income tax on such invested amount. At present, Income Tax department does not raise any question about the sources of fund invested in the purchase or construction of any apartment or flat, and building if tax is paid at certain rates on such investments. Taxpayers are not availing this opportunity due to the higher tax rates. I propose to decrease existing tax rates to encourage the taxpayers for voluntary disclosure of purchase or construction of any apartment or flat, and building in their tax returns. I hope that taxpayers will avail this opportunity and will voluntarily reveal their undisclosed investment on purchase or construction of apartment or flat, and building in their tax files to include them into the tax net. 224. Under the existing law, 21 industrial sectors and 19 physical infrastructure development sectors have been enjoying tax holidays on the basis of geographical locations at different rates for different periods of time. This benefit will expire on 30 June of this year. /With a view to promoting business and investment, augmenting export and creating employments, I propose the facilities of tax holiday to continue and also to include some potential manufacturing sectors such as agricultural machinery; furniture; home appliance - rice cooker, blender, washing machine etc.; mobile handset; toys; leather and leathergoods; LED television; plastic recycling. Madam Speaker 225. Many people think that the tax deduction rates at source on the bill of contractors and suppliers are high. We have examined this issue and considering all aspects, I propose to decrease the maximum tax deduction rate at source on the bill of contractors and suppliers from 7% to 5%. Details on these are presented in Table 5 of Annexure-B. 226. A taxpayer has to pay tax in advance if the taxpayer's last assessed income is above Tk. 4 lakh. I propose to raise this to Tk. 6 lakh. On the other hand, currently small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are not required to pay income tax if the yearly turnover of the business is up to Tk. 36 lakh. To promote SMEs, I propose to raise this yearly turnover limit to Tk. 50 lakh. In the existing law, income derived from the export of handicrafts is also exempted from tax. This exemption will expire on June 30, this year. To promote this sector, I propose to extend this exemption facility for the next five years. 227./The tax rate for readymade garments is 12%./The rate is 10% if there is green building certification. Besides, for textile sector tax rate is 15%. These sectors are enjoying reduced rates of taxes for a long period of time. This advantage will expire by 30 June of this year. Considering the contribution of these sectors to our economy, particularly in boosting export and generating employment opportunities, I propose to continue this provision of reduced rate of taxes for these sectors. Social Welfare 228. Our government is doing its best to protect the interest of the physically challenged people. We want to reflect this principle in taxation as well. Study shows 10 percent of our population has some sort of disability. Considering this fact, I am proposing a 5 percent rebate on total tax of a tax payer if the taxpayer employs at least 10 percent of total work force from physically challenged people. 229. For ensuring services to the persons with disability, imposition of 5 percent additional tax on a medical service provider who fails to ensure special accessibility for physically challenged persons was introduced last year. This year, I propose to extend its scope by imposing the application of this provision on schools, colleges, universities and NGOs. However, this provision shall come into force from the assessment year 2020-21 for schools, colleges, universities and NGOs so that they have enough time for the installation of necessary facilities for this purpose. Incentives for the share market 230. /Investors expect cash dividends from their investment in the shares of a company. From that point of view cash dividend play an important role in increasing the value of the share and also strengthening the share market. But we observed that the companies are generally distributing stock dividend instead of cash dividend. As a result, investors are deprived of their well deserved return. In order to encourage the distribution of cash dividend, I propose imposition of 15 percent tax on stock dividend distributed to the shareholders by any listed company. 231. It is also observed that, some companies retain or reserve the net profit instead of distributing dividend to the investors. For this reason, investors are deprived of getting dividend from their investment and this in turn is adversely affecting our share market. For the sake of smooth operation of capital market this tendency has to be addressed. Therefore, I propose imposition of 15 percent additional tax on so much of retained earnings and reserves as it exceeds 50 percent of the paid up capital of the company. 232. At present, dividend up to Tk. 25,000 received from the publicly traded company is exempted from tax. With a view to incentivizing the small investors and strengthening the capital market I propose to enhance this limit up to Tk. 50,000. However, this exemption will only be applicable for the individual taxpayers. 233. A provision was made in the income tax ordinance last year to avoid the multilayer taxation on dividend income. However, the application of the provision was limited only to the resident companies. To promote foreign investment, I propose to extend the application of this provision to the non-resident companies as well. Madam Speaker International Best Practice 234./The volume and the nature of cross border transactions have significantly increased in the wake of progression of economic globalization, import and export, investment and business. Therefore, the issue of transfer pricing is becoming more and more significant in the collection of tax./The provisions of transfer pricing have already been incorporated in the Income Tax Ordinance. To operationalize the provisions of transfer pricing, I propose that companies shall, in their income tax returns, declare whether they have any international transactions, and if they have any, they shall submit the details of such transactions. 235. Currently, many non-resident taxpayers are doing business through permanent establishments. Home countries of many of such non-resident taxpayers have double taxation avoidance treaties with Bangladesh. According to the treaties, Bangladesh has the right to tax the business income of a non-resident taxpayer earned through a permanent establishment in Bangladesh. At present most of the non-resident taxpayers are not submitting their return of income even though they are earning business income through permanent establishments. I am proposing to insert a provision of submitting the return of income for the non-resident taxpayers who are doing business in Bangladesh through permanent establishments. Value Added Tax Madam Speaker 236. Value Added Tax (VAT) is a modern indirect tax system. It is the single highest contributor to the NBR tax revenue. Reform initiatives, positive mindset of the taxpayers and hard work of the NBR officials have contributed to this achievement. Considering the growth of the national economy, demand, interest of the business community and the consumers I am now placing before this august House the VAT related proposals for creating taxpayer-friendly, revenue-friendly and development-friendly tax structure: Madam Speaker 237./The new Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012 has been formulated in line with the international best practices. It will make a significant improvement in the 'ease of doing business' index. Now, I am presenting some of the salient features of the new law: a) Taxpayers will have the opportunity to get online service for VAT and Turnover Tax registration, tax payment, return submission, refund etc; b) The existing price declaration system before the supply of goods will be abolished./The taxpayers will pay VAT on the basis of fair market price; c) Currently there is a provision to maintain sufficient balance in the Account Current Register while supplying the goods. However, according to the new law, there is no such provision and the businessmen will be able to pay tax at the end of the month through the VAT returns; d) Wherever 15 percent VAT is applicable, the input tax credit can be obtained through the VAT return; e) Return will be treated as the application of refund. Madam Speaker 238. As a gesture of our respect to the demands of our investors and business community, I am now proposing few reforms and simplifications in the new law to make it more time-befitting and business-friendly: a) Exempt the small and marginal traders with an annual turnover up to Tk. 50 lakh to keep them out of the VAT net; b) Encourage the small and medium sector (SMEs) by giving opportunity to pay turnover tax at 4 percent rate in the case of annual turnover from Tk. 50 lakh to Tk. 3 crore; c) The VAT registration threshold has been increased to Tk. 3 crore from Tk. 80 lakh; d) There are 3 schedules in the existing law. Exempted goods are listed in the first schedule, exempted services are listed in the second schedule and goods on which supplementary duty is leviable are listed in the third schedule. /Whereas, under the new law, exempted goods and services are listed in the first schedule, goods on which supplementary duty is leviable are listed in the second schedule and goods and services on which either reduced rate of VAT is applicable or specific tax is imposed are listed in the third schedule; e) Along with the standard VAT rate of 15 percent, there will be reduced rates of 5 percent , 7.5 percent and 10 percent for specific goods and services; f) Considering the possibility of inflation, specific taxes have been fixed for some specific products and services; g) The VAT rate has been fixed at 5 percent for the local traders; h) As a special measure, considering the sensitivity of the product, the rate of VAT at the trading stage of pharmaceutical and petroleum products shall be 2.4 percent and 2 percent respectively; i) As the new law is online-based, it will be mandatory for the shop owners and business entity to keep records of VAT challan/invoice during sales/supply through Electronic Fiscal device (EFD) and Sales Data Controller (SDC); j) To make the new law easy, simple and more business-friendly, several amendments, corrections and additions to the Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012 have been proposed; k) In line with the changes in the law, some necessary amendments and modifications of the Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Rules, 2016 have also been proposed. Madam Speaker 239. I am proposing to continue the existing VAT exemption facility in the case of government's priority and fast track projects, such as the Bangladesh Economic Zone (BEZA) and the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. In addition, I am also proposing to continue existing VAT and supplementary duty exemptions given to the heavy industries like automobiles, refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, motorcycles, mobile industries, etc. for the growth and development of heavy domestic industry and export sector. Madam Speaker 240./The government is following the principle of increasing the VAT net, reducing the exemptions gradually, keeping inflation under control and developing the local industry. For the sake of public interest and for the development of our local industry now I am placing a few proposals before this august House for VAT exemptions for FY2019-20, which are as follows: a) Considering the interest of poor and marginalized people, I am proposing to provide VAT exemption on the production and supply of bread, hand-made biscuits and hand-made cakes up to the value of Tk. 150 per kg; b) For incentivizing the agricultural sector, I am proposing to give exemptions on the local supply of agricultural machineries such as Power ripper, Power tiller operated seeder, Combined harvester, Low lift pump, Rotary tiller etc.; c) Providing VAT exemption on the rent of a business showroom run by women entrepreneurs; d) Providing VAT exemption on suppliers and electricity in Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park; e) Providing VAT exemption on the supply of natural gas, suppliers and electricity in the case of investment in Bangladesh Economic Zone (BEZA); f) VAT exemption for the investors of Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects on the procurement of services from construction firm, consultancy and supervisory firm and legal advisor; g) VAT exemption for Rooppur nuclear power plant project on the procurement of services from freight forwarders, clearing and forwarding agencies, insurance companies, suppliers and banking services. Madam Speaker 241. I am proposing to impose VAT on the products such as plastic and aluminum items, soybean oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil etc. which have been enjoying the exemption benefit for a long time. /I am also proposing to impose VAT on astrologists, marriage media services and on supply of entertainment programmes, serials, drama, telefilms etc to be broadcasted in the television channels and online media like YouTube and Facebook. In addition, I am also proposing to impose VAT at the import stage on telecom equipment as they have been enjoying exemptions for a long time. Madam Speaker 242. To reduce the use of non-essential commodities and to protect the interest of the domestic industry I am proposing to impose supplementary duty on the following products and services: (a) In order to improve the traffic congestion situation and develop the public sector transport system, 10 percent supplementary duty on issuance or renewal of all kinds of vehicles registration, route permit, fitness certificates, ownership certificate etc. except for passenger buses, trucks, lorries, three wheeler, ambulances and school buses may be imposed; (b) Chartered aircrafts and helicopters have become popular means of transportation among the very rich people. /Therefore, I am proposing to increase the existing supplementary duty from 20 (twenty) percent to 25 ( twenty five) percent on this service; (c) Imposition of 5 percent supplementary duty on ice-cream; (d) To increase the supplementary duty from 5 percent to 10 percent of the services provided through mobile phone SIM / RIM card. 243. Considering the health-risk and harmful effects of tobacco products and to maintain compliance with global anti-smoking policy, we are committed to reduce the use of tobacco and maximize revenue collection from this sector: (a) I am proposing to fix the price of every 10 sticks of low segment cigarette at Tk. 37 and the supplementary duty rate at 55 percent. I am also proposing to fix the price of every 10 sticks of the medium segment cigarette at Tk. 63 and the supplementary duty rate to 65 percent while fixing the price of every 10 sticks of high segment and premium segment cigarette at Tk. 93 and Tk. 123 respectively and keep the supplementary duty rate to existing 65 percent. (b) I am proposing to fix the price of 25 sticks of non-filter bidi at Tk. 14 and supplementary duty rate at 35 percent and to fix the price of 20 sticks filter bidi at Tk. 17 and supplementary duty rate at 40 percent. (c) Smokeless tobacco like Zarda and Gul are another two healthhazardous items like cigarette and bidi./The detrimental impacts on health from consuming these items are even greater since these items are directly consumed. In order to reduce the consumption of smokeless tobacco products, I am proposing to fix the minimum retail price at Tk. 30 per 10 grams from zarda and Tk. 15 per 10 grams for gul and fix the supplementary duty rate at 50 percent. Import-Export Duty-Taxes Madam Speaker 244. In addition to collect correct revenue, simplification of trade is also very important. In accordance with the previous steps taken by the present government for the sake of continuing growth of our domestic economy, we have invited budget proposals from all stakeholders for liberalization and more rationalization of duty-tax structure for strengthening the worldwide ongoing trade liberalization and the role of local industry in our economy. With a meticulous scrutiny of 2,125 proposals received from different stakeholders and evaluation of these suggestions, I am placing the proposals through you before this august parliament for the protection of local industry, trade and consumers interest. Madam Speaker 245. /Following factors have been reviewed in considering the proposals received from the stakeholders regarding import duty, regulatory duty, supplementary duty and Value Added Tax:  Assist the investors and businessmen for creating investment friendly environment;  To provide incentives for export oriented backward  and  forward linkage industries;  To provide policy support for the development of ICT sector;  To maintain consumer's right and to keep the price of the essential goods at reasonable level;  To develop and protect local industries in agriculture, health, leather, textile, fishery and livestock;  To rationalize tariff structure by following the principle of equity and justice;  To formulate policy for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and to increase internal revenue collection;  To upgrade Bangladesh's position in Ease of Doing Business index;  To prevent smuggling, mis-declaration and misuse of bond facilities. Madam Speaker 246. I propose existing 06 (six) slabs of Customs Duty (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%), 3% Regulatory Duty on goods having highest import duty, and existing 12 (twelve) slabs of Supplementary Duty (10%, 20%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, and 500%) on import stage to continue in FY2019-20. Besides, existing 0% import duty will remain unchanged for importing essential goods like lentils, wheat, onion, edible oil, fertilizer, seed, raw cotton and raw materials for some industries. /Existing 0% rate will also remain same for importing life savings drugs and medical equipment. However, for the protection of local farmers, existing highest rate of customs duty at 25% and recently imposed 25% regulatory duty will remain unchanged on rice import. 247. Now, I would like to present sector-wise elaborated proposals in this august Parliament: (A) Agriculture sector: Madam Speaker 248. Agricultural sector is a priority sector in Bangladesh. Zero rates are proposed to be unchanged for the prime ingredients of agricultural sector, especially for fertilizer, seeds, insecticides. Concessionary rate of duty will be continued for agricultural equipment and spareparts. 249. Fish, Poultry and Dairy: Fish, Poultry and Dairy is one of the most important subsectors of agriculture. Government has been providing some tax benefits and incentives to this sector for the last few years. To ensure sustainable development in this sector, I propose these tax incentives and exemptions should continue and extend this benefit to some new raw materials and equipment. (B) Industrial sector: Madam Speaker 250. Industry is now the second largest sector in terms of contribution to the GDP. This contribution of the industrial sector is increasing day by day. Moreover, this sector is highly contributing to employment generation and investment. Our present development strategies comprise of the following elements: driving up industrial investment, maximizing utilization of the installed capacity of the existing industries, making export-oriented industries more competitive through its diversified expansion. /Considering these aspects, our proposals of import duties and taxes on industrial sector are (Table-7 of Annexure-B): (1) Milk Powder: At present, milk powder is importable on a concessionary Customs Duty (CD) rate which is 5%. To protect local dairy industry, I propose to increase this 5% CD to 10% on milk powder import. (2) Sugar: I propose to increase existing specific duty from Tk. 2000.00/MT to Tk. 3000.00/MT on import of raw sugar. For refined sugar the specific duty will be increased from Tk. 4,500.00/MT to Tk. 6,000.00/MT. Regulatory duty will be 30% instead of 20% for both refined and raw sugar import. (3) Medicine: The quality of medicine produced in Bangladesh is internationally acclaimed. It is one of the highly prospective export sectors in Bangladesh. We have a steep growth in medicine exports and that has been possible as the sector gets necessary facilities and required protection from the government. Exemptions and concessionary rate of duties of some pharmaceutical raw materials including that of cancer medicines, have been proposed. Moreover, I propose to decrease regulatory duty from 20% to 10% on import of liquid Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide for making these lifesaving gases available to the poor patients at low cost. (4) Other Industries: To protect domestic industries, I propose to increase regulatory duty on Maize (corn) starch, Manioc (Cassava) starch and gypsum board import. /I also propose to increase supplementary duty on import of particle board and domestic electrical articles. Moreover, I also propose to allow import of some essential raw materials of lift, refrigerator, compressor, air conditioner, electric motor, mold and footwear industries at a concessionary rate. (5) Export Duty: Rice bran is the prime raw material of rice bran oil. As there is a huge demand from local rice bran industries, I propose to increase export duty of rice bran from 10% to 25% to discourage exports. I also propose to withdraw existing 10% export duty on unmanufactured tobacco and to decrease existing export duty of building bricks from 25% to 15%. (C) Tranpsort sector: Madam Speaker 251. Motorcycle: In the transport sector, motorcycle manufacturing and assembling is a rapidly growing industry in Bangladesh./The government is facilitating motorcycle manufacturing sector since FY2017-18 by allowing concessionary duties on raw material import. I propose to continue this concessionary duty benefits and inclusion of 3 new raw materials in the concessionary list. To protect domestic tyre  and  tube industry, I propose to increase regulatory duty from 3 percent to 5 percent on the importation of 16-inch tyre, motorcycle tyre and tube used in CNG baby taxi and light vehicles (Table-8 of Annexure-B). (C) ICT sector: 252. Most of the products of ICT sector have been enjoying a reduced rate of duties and taxes since 1996. As a result, ICT sector developed significantly by this time. One of the main elements of the ICT sector is cellular phone which is enjoying concessionary duty benefits on import of some raw materials and parts. Some (5-6) local manufacturers have already started manufacturing and assembling cell phones in Bangladesh. 10 percet customs duty is applicable on import of smart and feature phone. As smart phone is used by affluent people, I propose to increase customs duty of smart phone to 25 percent. However, customs duty of feature phone will remain unchanged as it is used by relatively poor people (Table-9 of Annexure-B). /Madam Speaker 253. Lightning has become a natural disaster to us. A number of people have been killed and many important electrical equipment have been destroyed because of lightening. To prevent these damages, I propose to reduce the duty of lightning arrester from 10 percent to 5 percent. 254. We have experienced some fire incidents of huge scale recently. At present, only VAT registered industries can import firefighting equipment at a concessionary rate. To combat the rise of fire incidents, this facility should be extended to all and I propose to allow this facility to all VAT registered service oriented organizations like hotels, hospitals, educational institutions, etc. I also propose to include a few more fire fighting equipment in the concessionary list (Table-10 of Annexure-B). Madam Speaker 255. I propose necessary amendments in Customs Act, 1969 for introducing automated customs risk management system in accordance with international best practices, for ensuring national and international security and trade facilitation. /In addition, for implementation of automated customs risk management system, I propose to establish a separate Customs Risk Management Department (CRMD) under NBR. 256. According to Customs Act, 1969, duty-tax is not leviable where value and total duty tax is less than BDT 2000.00 of an import consignment. In order to make this provision effective, I propose to form a de minimis rule to expedite import of samples with a simplified process. 257. To prevent gold smuggling, a reduction of duty of gold under Passenger (non-tourist) and Baggage (import) Rules-2016 and for commercial import, from BDT 3000.00/11.664 gm to BDT 2000.00/11.664 gm has been proposed (Table-11 of Annexure-B). Madam Speaker 258. Amendments in First Schedule of the Customs Act: We have observed that there are mistakes and inconsistencies in the existing structure of the tariff headings and H.S Code. In order to simplify international trade process, I propose to rationalize the inconsistent duty rates, creation of new H.S Code where necessary, deletion of wrong one and correction of H.S Codes and notifications. (Table-12 of Annexure- B). 259. To combat under-invoicing, reduce consumption of luxury and socially undesirable goods and to protect goods produced by local industries minimum value and tariff value of some high duty imported goods have been restructured. Madam Speaker 260./The economic progress and development of Bangladesh are visible now. Bangladesh has become a role model for economic development. Revenue administration has to play a vital role to expedite this development. We expect more vigorous efforts in revenue mobilization if the reforms initiatives undertaken by the National Board of Revenue are implemented effectively./The economy will reach a new height and Bangladesh will be a middle-income country by 2021 and a developed one by 2041. Conclusion Madam Speaker 261./The present government led by Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has expanded the horizon of our dream and at the same time enhanced the capacity to translate it into reality. Assuming the responsibility of office in 2009, the present government declared the Vision 2021 to establish Bangladesh as a poverty-free, prosperous middle income country./The government's enviable capacity to realize this socioeconomic vision within the quickest possible time has already been proven. Through the implementation of the planned and inclusive development strategies of the government, the country has achieved a sustained and high rate of growth with an unprecedented speed./The positive changes in all sectors of the economy are quite visible. In tandem, the rural economy has also become vibrant. No disparity exists between north-south and east-west region of the country. 262. As a sequel of the Vision 2021, the present government brings before the nation a new Perspective Plan 'Vision 2041'. We are determined to elevate Bangladesh from the status of a middle income country, and become a peaceful, happy and prosperous developed country by 2041. 263. In our long enduring journey towards development, we have come to a stage from where, if we look back, we will come across those hurdles and obstacles that came in the way. We have to go a long way still which is fraught with so many challenges. Madam Speaker, you are aware, a nation's journey towards the future can never be easy and linear. /However, we have enormous vigour to stand tall against all odds. Even amidst any deep crisis, we, the Bangalees time and again found out the way forward. Under the leadership of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the brave heroes of this soil gifted us this country. We got a dream of establishing Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal) from the Father of the Nation who invigorated the nation to rebuild the war-ravaged economy and began the ardouous journey with an amazing vision. Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina following the footsteps left behind by the Father of the Nation is taking us to the newer heights of achievements. Madam Speaker 264. We are still unrelenting in materializing the dream of establishing Sonar Bangla which will continue from one generation to another. This journey will be inspired by our national flag with red and green, our symbol of pride. Our future generation, our youth, the children of our liberation war heroes shall put the nation in the highest seat of glory and dignity among the nations of the world. Madam Speaker 265./The Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman since the emergence of Bangladesh, has been our constant source of inspiration and will remain so forever. He will be shining among us as the sun. Bangladesh will move forward following his dream. As people in thousands came forward in response to his clarion call, so will they do in the future - at all times. They will come forward to repay what they owe to their parents, kith and kin and build Sonar Bangla what the Father of the Naiton dreamt of and hoist atop our flag with red and green, which symbolizes our integrity, solidarity and sovereignty. Salamun alal mursalin, o al hamdulillahe rabbil alameen. Madam speaker, thank you very much. Jai Bangla Jai Bangabandhu Long Live Bangladesh"
Dhaka stands behind all," Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka has been ranked worst in the Air Quality Index (AQI). Dhaka had a score of 245 at 08:25am on Thursday, indicating that the air quality was ""very unhealthy."" A numerical value between 201 and 300 indicates that the general public will be noticeably affected, and that sensitive groups are set to experience reduced endurance in several activities. Also, the score between 201 and 300 is classified as very harmful by the AQI. In the index, Dubai, Kuwait City and Kuala Lumpur occupied the next three slots with scores of 166, 166 and 163 respectively. A score between 201 and 300 is classified as 'very unhealthy'./The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, tells people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. Greenpeace and AirVisual, who monitor global air quality, recently presented a report based on last year's data collected from public monitoring sources. According to its study, Bangladesh has the most polluted air in the world and Dhaka is the second most polluted capital city./'At a country level, weighted by population, Bangladesh emerges as the most polluted country,"" said the 2018 World Air Quality Report. According to the report, air pollution will cause around 7 million premature deaths globally next year and have a major economic impact. Bangladesh, one of the most densely-populated countries in the world, has been struggling with air pollution for long. Dhaka, the country's capital, often finds its place among the most polluted cities in global indices. Brick kilns and vehicles run on fuel with higher level of sulfur have been identified as the major sources of air pollution in the country. According to the report, four of the five most polluted countries in the world are in South Asia. Bangladesh is followed by Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Bahrain./The quality of air in Iceland, Finland and Australia are among the healthiest, the report shows./The report focuses on PM2.5 as a measurement of air pollution. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (ambient airborne particles) which measure up to 2.5 microns in size, and has a range of chemical makeup and sources. Due to its small size PM2.5 is able to penetrate deep into the human respiratory system and from there to the entire body, causing a wide range of short- and long-term health effects, the report said. In a statement, Yeb Sano, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said, ""Air pollution steals our livelihoods and our futures, but we can change that./'In addition to human lives lost, there is an estimated global cost of $225 billion in lost labour, and trillions in medical costs. This has enormous impacts on our health and on our wallet"". David Boyd, a special expert on human rights and the environment, insisted that air pollution was a ""silent, sometimes invisible, prolific killer"" which affected women and girls more than men./'Air pollutants are everywhere, largely caused by burning fossil fuels for electricity, transportation and heating, as well as from industrial activities, poor waste management and agricultural practices,"" he said./'Every hour, 800 people are dying, many after years of suffering, from cancer, respiratory illnesses or heart disease directly caused by breathing polluted air,"" he said, before highlighting that effective measures could have prevented those deaths. According to the DoE and the World Bank, brick kilns make up 56 percent of the country's air pollution./The government had enacted a law in 2018 to make these kilns environment friendly, but a recent report indicated that of the 7,772 brick kilns in the country, 2,123 have not converted to the required modern and environment-friendly technology."
What to achieve by Odd-Even rule?," The Supreme Court on Monday panned the Delhi government over its toxic air and questioned the capability of the Odd-Even road rationing scheme in combating air pollution, reports the Statesman./'What are you achieving by odd and even? Are you preventing the running of taxis? Have you any figure on the impact of odd and even?"" the court asked and directed the state government to submit data on its impact./'People have to travel. You are not stopping travel. What do you achieve by stopping cars?"" asked Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta, who are hearing a plea by the pollution control body Environment Pollution Control Authority or EPCA on stubble burning in neighbouring states like Punjab and Haryana./The Odd-Even rule came into force in the national capital Monday morning at 8 am and will continue till 8 pm./The 12-hour scheme will continue till November 15./The state government has implemented the scheme in a bid to reduce air pollution. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said 15 lakh vehicles will be off Delhi's roads today./'In Delhi, 30 lakh cars are out on the roads every day. Today, 15 lakh cars will not be on the roads./The smoke from 15 lakh cars will be reduced… As per reports from across Delhi, nearly 100 per cent compliance is being noted,"" the Chief Minister told reporters./The Supreme Court noted that it has been pointed out that the use of two and three wheelers was causing more harm and that there is no use of implementing the odd-even scheme in such a situation. When the government defended that fewer cars would mean less pollution, the top court retorted, ""More autos are plying, that's more pollution""./'We need to go from single-use transport to mass-use vehicles,"" the court observed./The Supreme Court further observed that burning of waste in Delhi is a major concern. Earlier, the top court had lashed out at Punjab and Haryana governments over stubble burning saying, ""States are responsible. Must be made answerable under the law of torts… They are only interested in electioneering. They have no responsibility towards their own people""./'Everybody is interested in gimmicks and elections,"" Justice Mishra added as reasons for air pollution were bundled out./The 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) value on Monday morning was 437. On Sunday, unprecedented air pollution hovered over 625 AQI across Delhi and hit the 999-mark in parts of the national capital like Bawana./The capital woke up to thick layers of smog and near zero visibility that forced diversion of many flights to Delhi airport on Sunday."
"After monsoon mud, dust pollutes Dhaka's air"," It is a common phenomenon in the capital city that its dwellers have to wade through mud during the monsoon while they have to suffer dust pollution in the dry season. As winter sets in, the quality of air in Dhaka now poses major health risks to citizens with pollution reaching severe levels./The presence of particulate matter in the air has multiplied beyond the tolerable limit. A lack of coordination between different departments of the government is further hampering efforts to control air pollution. Particle pollution, also called particulate matter or PM, is a mixture of hazardous solid and liquid particles in the air that can lead to serious health hazards./The particles vary in sizes, ranging from 2.5 (PM2.5) to 10 (PM10) micrometres in diameter, and their prevalence in an area is used to determine the quality of air. An Air Quality Index or AQI rating of 0-50 represents 'good' quality of air while 51-100 is considered 'moderate' and 101-150 is deemed 'dangerous'. But the air quality is classified as 'unhealthy' when the PM levels reach 150-200, 'very unhealthy' at 201-300 and 'hazardous' at 301-500./The Clean Air and Sustainable Environment or 'ÇASE' project measures the ultra-micro PM2.5 at 11 points within the jurisdiction of the city corporations. According to the DoE, the quality of the air deteriorated to 'unhealthy' levels at the start of November. Unplanned construction, smoke emissions from vehicles and the banking of bricks are the major causes of air pollution ahead of winter every year, said Air Quality Management Project Director Ziaul Haque./The risk of various diseases is aggravated by the deteriorating air quality during winter, according to experts. Rising pollution levels increase the risk of respiratory diseases, said Prof ABM Abdullah, dean of the Department of Medicine at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University./'We are now experiencing dry weather. Apart from respiratory diseases, people are also susceptible to skin conditions while the elderly could experience body aches and headaches. Children and elderly people are particularly vulnerable to air pollution,"" he said The steps taken by the two city corporations to combat pollution have added to the frustration of citizens. Dhaka South City Corporation has no water supply of its own. It relies on Dhaka WASA for the water which it sprays on different roads under its jurisdiction. But the DSCC has not been able to continue these efforts this year as Dhaka WASA stopped supplying water for the purpose./The government's initiative to prevent air pollution has been labelled 'inadequate' by the Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon./The main source of air pollution is the dust stirred up by construction activities and vehicles plying the roads, including the transportation of soil and sand. Spraying water alone will not improve the situation as the amount of dust increases during the dry season when there is also a shortage of water. Dust generated by construction projects such as the metro rail, among others, permeates the air in addition to the plumes of smoke emitted by nearby brick kilns./The level of pollution in the capital remains alarming, particularly in the absence of any visible initiative by the government to alleviate the sufferings of people./The AQI was below 200 until October this year but it shot past 200 in recent days due to lack of rain and increased construction work. Most roads in the capital, major commercial and residential hubs such as Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Motijheel, Paltan, Uttara and Old Dhaka are covered with dust. Amid the ongoing construction of a road stretching from Mirpur 14 to Bhashantek, residents have to toil through mud during the rainy season and dust when its dry."
Most motor vehicles emit black smoke," Halt them all is a binding order now issued by a court for government authorities to stop environment-polluting superannuated motor vehicles from running in Dhaka's streets./The ban on the life-expired and unfit buses, minibuses, trucks and other automotives is part of a package prescription for healing the environmental and hygienic health of the capital, Dhaka, which comes at a time when its air quality and living conditions are being rated by international agencies as among the worst. In a further step, a bench of the High Court Monday also summoned the top executive of the environment department to explain why the designated remedial measures couldn't be taken despite a foreign-aided project in place./The court of Justice FRM Nazmul Ahasan and Justice KM Kamrul Kader ordered the authorities to seize the vehicles emitting black smoke. Under its order the government also has to fix the economic life of different cars or vehicles as per section 36 of the Road Transport Act 2018 and restrict the plying of those vehicles which have no economic life to run on roads in the capital. In an earlier submission during a court hearing, BRTA lawyer Barrister Moyeen Firozee had submitted a Bangladesh Road Transport Authority or BRTA report stating that there are around 40,18,000 registered vehicles in the country and 14,42,860 of those run in Dhaka. Among the total, 458,369 were registered but did not have any fitness clearance across the country. Transport operations in the capital in particular, including outmoded buses-minibuses, untrained drivers and rash driving-resulting in fatal accidents-transport fitness and route certification, signaling, illegal toll and so, have been topics of discussion in myriad forums for long. Discussants point out that most passenger transports like buses and minibuses plying the city thoroughfares are outworn but painted like new outwardly to get fitness certificate and route permit. These vehicles spew black smoke into the air. Under a much-talked-about new transport law, crackdowns on ramshackle vehicles were launched but there were pauses, somehow./'How these wrinkled, skin-excoriated buses run in this city wherein all high-ups live remains a riddle,"" says architect and rights campaigner Mubasshar Hussein time and again. They mention numerous projects, panels and decisions to show a ready solution to Dhaka's transport system: immediately form the envisaged six companies of bus operators from private sector and the state-run one, BRTC. Chase out all the polluting old buses that are painted new but spew toxic black smoke into the air to cause common harm to all-rulers, regulators, transporters and the commoners alike. Pick the buses which have life from the private transport operators and the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation or BRTC fleets and operate those under the long-planned route-franchise basis. Issuing a nine-point order of dos to cut air pollution in Dhaka, the High Court subpoenaed the director-general of the Department of Environment (DoE) to appear before it on February 2 to explain why this problem cannot be contained./The HC issued the order on a writ filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh (HRPB)./The bench also ordered the authorities to submit a progress report on compliance with the directives on March 1. Advocate Manzill Murshid stood for the petitioner while deputy attorney-general ABM Abdullah Al Mahmud Bashar represented the state and Sayeed Ahmed Reza for the two city corporations in Dhaka. Under directives the authorities should ensure the use of covers on trucks or other vehicles that transport sand or soil through the city./'At places where construction work is going on contractors should cover the works to prevent the spread of dust,"" the court order says, indicating lot many such works including those under major transport-infrastructure projects. As per its previous order, the HC ordered the authorities concerned to sprinkle water on streets that were left out./The government has been instructed to ensure complete road construction or excavation work or carpeting by complying with laws and rules. There were conducted drives to demolish brick kilns around that spew toxic smokes that affect the city's air and environment. But reports say many are still in operation. In this regard, the DoE was asked to shut down in next two months the rest of the illegal brick fields which are operating without licence. Appropriate steps should be taken to stop the burning of tyres and recycling of vehicles' batteries without approval from the DoE, the court said, as there have been reports that transport fuel is being produced by burning old tyres . As a further cleanup measure, the HC asked the authorities concerned to take steps to ensure that all the market owners or shopkeepers keep their garbage in bags and the city corporations remove those after the shops or markets are closed./'The court wanted to know how the DoE spent the Tk 300-crore budget of a World Bank project to conserve the environment, the role DoE played in improving the environment and how people are getting benefited from it,"" said the deputy attorney- general after the orders were passed./The HRPB filed the writ petition attaching a report published in different newspapers on January 21 last year on air pollution in Dhaka. Reports also have it that garbage littering roadsides and open urination at street corners and on open spaces under flyovers are contributors to environmental pollution. Scenes under the flyovers in the capital could be much seemly but for an alleged lack of care and unfinished post-project works, all agree but to no effect yet. Local people, pedestrians and analysts in different forums say public urination and the dumping of garbage on open spaces under the flyovers--the filth spilling over onto adjacent streets at some places-are a common sight. Local people complain that patches of the flyover areas and roadsides are sometimes washed by water passed by wayfarers to urgent nature's call. Urbanisation experts say this nuisance is created for insufficiency of public toilets in the capital city, where a huge influx of rural people continues in search of fortune. Witnesses say major portions of maximum spaces under flyovers are also filled with heaps of garbage dumped from under-flyover stores, and houses, which not only stains the looks of the neat and clean and well-maintained flyovers but also pollutes the environment."
"Clean, safe Dhaka in Tabith's target"," BNP-backed Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) mayoral candidate Tabith Awal on Monday vowed a clean, safe and sustainable world-class Dhaka if he was elected in the upcoming city polls. He also promised to work on in light of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals-2030 with a focus on combating mosquito menace, traffic congestion and pollution, improving public transport and waste management./The BNP mayoral aspirant formally rolled out the 19-point manifesto at a press conference at Emmanuelle's Banquet Hall, Gulshan. Tabith said he will take steps to ensure the rights and security of citizens if he is elected the DNCC mayor. He said the incumbent government and mayors have failed to handle the mosquito issue./'If elected, I'll carry out mosquito repellent activities throughout the year. Dengue is now a manageable problem, the city corporation didn't take such an initiative, and the diseases spread badly due to their negligence. I'll initiate the dengue preventive activities from February 1, if I elected mayor,"" Tabith promised./The BNP candidate said he will work for reducing traffic jam and take effective steps to stop air pollution in the city. Dhaka ranked third on the list of cities with worst air./The capital city has been grappling with air pollution for years. As part of his plan to free Dhaka from pollution, the BNP candidate said he would take steps for increasing the greeneries in the DNCC. Apart from launching the 'vertical garden' project, Tabith said he has also a plan to start a city-friendly agricultural system./'Certificates will be given to eco-friendly buildings."" He also promised to control noise pollution as per the court's directives. Tabith, the candidate of Sheaf of Paddy, also assured that he would take steps to relocate the chemical factories to a place outside Dhaka to check the fire incidents. He said all city wastes will be removed in between 12am and 5pm while recycling centers will be established./The BNP mayoral runner said has also a plan to construct a 'modern slaughter house' for slaughtering cattle. For the development of the transport management, Tabith said he will take effective steps to ensure coordination among police, BRTA and other relevant organisations. Besides, he said, the routes in Dhaka will be redesigned alongside introducing electric and hydrogen powered buses and safe buses during night time. He also outlined various other plans to construct 'common utility bypass and tunnel, footover bridges and parking system. In his manifesto, Tabith pledged to introduce 'remote and virtual' medical services and 'mobile medical units and form a special women cell' for women and children with disabilities as part of his plans to improve the healthcare system. He also worked plans to set up a ward-based recreation centres for the city dwellers and modernise children's' parks. Tabith urged the voters to elect him the DNCC mayor so that he can implement his plans./'I promise I won't compromise with the issues of city dwellers civic rights and facilities. I won't betray or deceive the city dwellers."" Asked whether it will be possible to implement the manifesto even if he is elected, given that he belongs to the opposition party, Tabith said: ""It'll be, if people remain by my side."" His other pledges include making Dhaka friendlier to women, children and physically-challenged people, ensuring security, safe water and food, improving disaster management, preventing crimes and corruption. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, standing committee members Gayeshwar Chandra Roy and Nazrul Islam Khan, vice-chairmen Mohammad Shahjahan and Abdul Awal Mintoo, Kalyan Party Chairman Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal President ASM Abdur Rob, Nagorik Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna and Gonoshasthya Kendra founder Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury were, among others, present."
Dhaka seems unprepared for oncoming dual combats," February is the prophetic month when an entomological survey by consultants had alerted Dhaka's authorities to possible outbreak of dengue-and the virus made an onset the very next month for early rain. They got caught unawares./The fogger weapons using traditional insecticides to kill mosquitoes by both the city corporations proved obsolete to fight the aggressive Aedes that spreads the viral disease. Time was killed in importing new mosquito repellents-and dengue patients spilled over hospitals, leaving around 200 of them dead, in the hiatus. Apart from dengue-chikungunya twin, now a far more ferocious virus threatens its invasion from its China endemic bastion to across the globe. Bangladesh, up till now, is claimed free from its incidence by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) under health ministry. But the country is already dealing with a few hundred people in quarantine, at home and in China. Anxieties are growing on both counts. A superpower like China is struggling to find a vaccine or cure so, goodness forbids, any exigency will be a daunting task for Bangladesh, experts believe./'Yes, there is cause for concern and we ought to get well-prepared,"" said medicine specialist Prof Dr Abdullah about coronavirus./'It'll be serious-dengue infection of a person for a second time or subsequent attacks may prove fatal for vulnerable people,"" he said about possible resurgence of dengue. Experts and campaigners ring alarm about the dirt and dust fouling Dhaka's air and garbage littering roadsides and downside spaces of flyovers. Construction sites of mega-projects, rotting canals and water-bodies are billed breeding grounds of mosquitoes. But, at this crucial hour, the two city corporations in Dhaka's north and south themselves looked in a weak state for transition in the administration./The two incoming mayors have to wait a long time now to take their seats through swearing-in ceremonies. Experts suggest round-the-year mosquito-eradication and cleanup drives as dengue remains a persistent threat to public health, beginning early and lasting to the last of last year. A missed forewarning based on a February survey led to an outbreak of the viral disease borne by Aedes mosquito so early-following the advance raining since March./'Whether it's possible to bring dengue fully under control cannot be said, but the prevalence of the virus may come down to a tolerable level by the middle of this month (Sep),"" said a physician. Also, the city is plagued with traffic chaos and other problems to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Dhaka ranked the sixth among cities with the worst air quality on Tuesday morning for the second consecutive day. It had a score of 197 at 08:09am in the Air Quality Index (AQI)./The air was classified as quite unhealthy. When the AQI score is between 151 and 200, everyone may experience health effects while members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health hazards. Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar, India's Delhi and Pakistan's Lahore occupied the top three positions in the list of cities with the worst air with AQI scores of 263, 261, and 236 respectively./The city-dwellers are extremely concerned as air pollution is worsening with every passing day./The ubiquitous pollution has taken an alarming turn. People with exposure to air polluting particulates stand the risks of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and even lung cancer and disorder in urinary tract or bladder./The adolescent children, elderly people and pregnant women are much more susceptible to air pollution./The city has frequently made it to the list of world cities with the worst air quality./The two new mayors of the city corporations promised in their election manifestos to turn Dhaka into a smart megacity. People expect that the new mayors will take immediate steps on checking air pollution as it is a public health emergency./The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. Last month, the High Court issued a nine-point directive to bring down air pollution level in Dhaka and ordered the Department of Environment (DoE) to conduct mobile court drives twice a week to take legal action against those responsible for air pollution in the capital./The court also directed the Public Administration Ministry to appoint five executive magistrates for DoE within one month for conducting mobile courts."
Brick kilns still polluting Dhaka's air," Flouting the High Court's (HC) ban, scores of illegal brick kilns in Dhaka and its surrounding areas, are still being operated by a section of greedy men under the very nose of the administration. Illegal brick kilns in Keraniganj, Savar, Narayanganj, Munshiganj, Gazipur and Manikganj emitting black smoke which is responsible for polluting the capital city's air. Dhaka ranked worst in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday. /Air pollution has become a perennial problem for the city. Brick kilns have been identified as the leading cause of air pollution in the city. In an attempt to reduce the air pollution, about 430 illegal brick kilns in operation around Dhaka were shut down; nevertheless, dozens of such kilns are still operating. As many as 250 brick kilns are still operating without clearance certificates from the Department of Environment (DoE) in Keraniganj alone. Sources said there are 300 brick kilns in Keraniganj and adjacent areas including Rajendrapur, Doleshwar, Jajira and Mollahat. Among them, 250 are operating illegally. Unlimited burning of firewood in the brick kilns is causing air pollution which is now a major concern for the residents of Dhaka and nearby areas. Sources said the brick kilns are affecting the environment and the health of the locals, particularly the young and the old. Many of them are suffering from respiratory problems. Moreover, a number of brick kilns set up on arable land in Rajendrapur, Doleshwar, Jajira and Mollahat area in Keraniganj are also destroying the fertile topsoil. In Rajendrapur, there are 15 brick kilns along the boundary walls of the Keraniganj Jail./The jail authorities said they wrote to the authorities concerned 12 times but the situation did not change. Farmers and locals alleged that Konda Union Parishad Chairman Faruk Chowdhury is the president of the Birck Kiln Owners' Association and the illegal kilns are being operated under his management. Amit Debnath, Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) of Keraniganj, said, ""The drive against illegal brick kilns is underway and we provided necessary help to DoE with executive magistrate and police for conducting drive."" Sources said that in the last six months, the mobile courts fined Tk several lakhs and demolished four illegal brick kilns."
COVID-19: Air pollution raises risks," Fear or panic has become, as though, a constant companion of people's life now amid the aggression of coronavirus. We get further startled to know that past air-pollution exposure has made people much more vulnerable to COVID-19 and is now contributing to the death-toll and the enormous pressure on healthcare systems from the disease. A report, run by a national daily on May 6, reveals that Bangladesh is extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 as thousands of people are already suffering from chronic diseases because of their past exposure to air pollution./The report is based on the study conducted by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). In Bangladesh, air pollution is responsible for about 11 percent of the disease burden from diabetes, 16 percent of lung cancer, and 15 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 10 percent of deaths from ischemic heart disease and 6 percent from stroke, according to data of the global Burden of Disease study. It can be well assumed from the research that the COVID-19 pandemic would be worsened due to high level of air pollution, opined experts. Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by air pollution with the life expectancy in the country reduced by almost two years due to the impacts of pollution exposure on health. Dhaka was ranked as the second most polluted capital city in the world, after New Delhi with average pollution levels more than eight times as high as the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline and six times the country's national standards./The danger remains as serious as before to public health and people with exposure to air polluting particles stand the risks of developing cardiovascular, respiratory diseases and even lung cancer./The coronavirus further compounds the diseases./The authorities concerned must, therefore, act right now before it is too late to combat bad air peril."
Air pollution causes 7mln premature deaths: UN Chief," Highlighting the dangers posed by air pollution, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said air pollution causes an estimated seven million premature deaths every year. In a message, he urged all to build a better future with blue skies for all, marking the first International Day of Clean Air, reports UN News./The first International Day of Clean Air for blue skies is being observed around the world on Monday, following the recognition by the United Nations General Assembly of the importance of clean air for the health and day-to-day lives of people. Globally, nine out of every ten people breathe unclean air, and air pollution causes an estimated seven million premature deaths every year, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries./'Air pollution contributes to heart disease, strokes, lung cancer and other respiratory diseases; [it] also threatens the economy, food security and the environment,' Guterres said./'As we recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the world needs to pay far greater attention to air pollution, which also increases the risks associated with COVID-19,' he said. This year, while the lockdowns associated with the global pandemic led to dramatic falls in emissions - providing a glimpse of cleaner air in many cities - emissions are already rising again, in some places surpassing pre-COVID levels./'We need dramatic and systemic change. Reinforced environmental standards, policies and laws that prevent emissions of air pollutants are needed more than ever,' stressed Guterres. Climate action and clean air Addressing climate change can also cut back air pollution./'Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees will help reduce air pollution, death and disease,' said the Secretary-General, calling on countries to end subsidies for fossil fuels as well as use post- COVID recovery packages to support the transition to healthy and sustainable jobs./'I call on governments still providing finance for fossil fuel-related projects in developing countries to shift that support towards clean energy and sustainable transport.' 'At the international level,' he added, 'countries need to cooperate to help each other transition to clean technologies.' The International Day The International Day of Clean Air for blue skies, to be commemorated on September 7 annually, was established in 2019 by the UN General Assembly, which recognised the importance of clean air as well as the threat of air pollution on human health and ecosystems, particular its disproportionate impact on women, children and older persons./The resolution emphasised 'the need to strengthen international cooperation at the global, regional and subregional levels in various areas related to improving air quality, including the collection and utilisation of data, joint research and development, and the sharing of best practices.' The International Day aims to raise awareness clean air is important for health, productivity, the economy and the environment; demonstrate the close link of air quality to other environmental and developmental challenges such as climate change; promote solutions that improve air quality by sharing actionable knowledge best practices, innovations, and success stories; and bring together diverse actors for concerted national, regional and international approaches for effective air quality management. Commemorations Around the world, UN agencies, governments, civil society organizations and NGOs organized several events - many virtual due to the coronavirus pandemic - to commemorate the International Day and spur action. These include discussions and webinars, musical performances, documentary screenings, exhibitions, and donating plants and trees. Individuals too can play a part: by cycling to work, not burning trash (it causes air pollution), and pressuring local authorities to improve green spaces in cities, everyone can contribute to making the air cleaner and skies bluer."
Why environmental justice is an anti-colonial struggle," Michael Wilson-Becerril Wildfires rage in Salinas, California on August 17, 2020 [File: AP/Noah Berger] In the mesmerising context of a global pandemic, a Black-led mass uprising against systemic racism, a 'heated' election in the United States, and an ever-heating planet, it is increasingly clear that structural violence and environmental collapse are mutually reinforcing crises. /The closely dated murders of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minnesota, of Breonna Taylor by white police officers in Kentucky, of Ahmaud Arbery by a retired cop with white supremacist ties and his son in Georgia, and of Tony McDade by a white police officer in Florida, all coalesced to reignite the US civil rights movement. This popular uprising has drastically shifted society at large, as evidenced by public opinion polls which show society- wide support for them, and by the movement's long list of policy and action achievements thus far. However, the even longer list of Black people killed, or almost killed, by white racists has only continued growing since the protests began. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has caused the deaths of nearly one million people worldwide. In the US, the country with the highest levels of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, demographic data shows that the brunt of this burden is being born disproportionately by Black and Indigenous people, as well as non- Black communities of colour, and women in particular. This pandemic has exposed fundamental differences in how society protects life, from unequal access to services and medical attention, to unequal application of criminal justice and law, and beyond. Consider the intensifying problem of environmental pollution. A study from the University of Exeter, published in June 2020, found that half of the world's population is exposed to air pollution, which is increasing. Even before the pandemic, it was estimated that nine million people died a year because of air pollution. You might have guessed that the spread of pollution also has a disproportionate impact on communities of colour, a well- known and documented phenomenon known as 'environmental racism'. And of course, as if to neatly complete the vicious cycle, air pollution makes people more vulnerable to the effects of contracting COVID-19. /These problems feed each other. As the effects of climate change intensify, the spread of pathogens and viruses will only become more likely. For example, the World Bank estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion humans will be reckoning with malaria outbreaks. Likewise, industrial agricultural practices, like the vast monoculture plantations that are replacing tropical rainforests at an alarming pace, reducing biodiversity and therefore, making the spread of diseases more likely. In other words, the risk of new, more frequent, and deadlier pandemics is also growing. And the planet keeps on warming. Currently, one out of every four species faces extinction, and before the end of this century, Earth might be uninhabitable by large mammals like humans. However, well in advance of that, the indirect escalation towards our extinction will itself be difficult and painful. Accelerating waves of mass extinctions, soil erosion, droughts, famines, wildfires, infectious diseases adding to already-strained infrastructure, and mounting social instability overall will - or rather, is already and will growingly - make life very volatile, even for the most privileged. Scientific studies about these multiplying crises have only been wrong in understating their urgency: their projections have been met much faster than scientists expected. Greenland's ice- sheet, for example, is melting at four times the rate once estimated by scientists. At the same time, progress on curbing carbon emissions has been slower than projected. Humans have put half of the carbon currently in the atmosphere in only the past 30 years, a period when humanity had already been alerted about climate change. Despite important steps in the right direction and significant policy victories at the local, state, and international level, the US federal government has become a particularly staunch obstacle to climate justice. /The Trump administration has continuously responded to the environmental crisis by denying the problem exists, framing it by using racist slogans, such as 'Chinese hoax'. It has pushed forward with extractive projects like the Dakota Access Pipeline and rolled back environmental regulation domestically and internationally. Furthermore, the federal government has militarised the country's approach to the interlinked crises of climate change, refugee exoduses, and street protests. However, militarisation is a key source of these problems. Open wars and covert interventions are motivated by the plunder of resources like hydrocarbons, and peer- reviewed research shows the US military alone has a larger carbon footprint than 100 countries combined. /The source of the problem cannot also act as an antidote. /The exploitation of nature is itself a sexist and racist problem, not divorced from structural conditions that treat, and threaten, humans differently according to patriarchal and white supremacist norms of domination. As Black and Indigenous eco- feminist thought has highlighted for years, 'women are the first environment'. /The detrimental and multigenerational effects of colonialism and its living legacies - including Indigenous genocide, Black enslavement, erasure, displacement, and extractivism - have particularly harmful effects on women and girls in terms of their health, their immediate risk of physical assault, and their long- term socioeconomic wellbeing. Violence against Black and Indigenous women is a strategic aspect of colonialism, meant to destroy cultures and thus gain access to their land and other resources. In short, these crises-within-crises are all connected. This year has made clear, perhaps now more than ever, that systemic oppression and environmental collapse are inextricably linked. /The present juncture is decisive. We are the last generation with the power to stop this. How will we proceed? Only when society values Black lives can we truly confront the current system of economic and environmental exploitation that is deeply rooted in racism, sexism, and colonialism. Only when society values characteristics gendered as feminine, such as nurturing, sharing, and caring for each other - instead of traits viewed as masculine, like aggression, accumulation, and competition - can we finally develop the social structures needed to preserve life on Earth, including an economy based on social needs and not individual greed. Only when society values people of colour will we understand that all life is interdependent, and then truly devote ourselves to defending our shared existence, rather than 'fending for our own' while letting others perish. Only when we are ready to sacrifice our relative privileges, pay reparations, and return the stolen native land can we make way for Black and Indigenous environmental stewardship, especially that of Black and Indigenous women. People who have been safeguarded from most forms of oppression might feel a vested interest in a hyper-militarised, white supremacist, capitalist system, but that same system is poised to destroy us all. Our only hope for a peaceful future, or for any future at all, rests on an urgent and profound social transformation that is specifically guided by anti-racist, anti- patriarchal, and decolonial commitments. For these reasons, one cannot understate the revolutionary potential of this massive uprising. Black and Indigenous resistance to racist terror is as old as enslavement and colonialism. This year, as perhaps never before, millions of people have taken to the streets to demonstrate for a better way forward, confronting injustice and turning discomfort into action. It is up to all of us whether we will fulfil this potential, or whether this experience will simply become another wave in a long cycle of abuse, indignation, and resignation that has led us here and has ultimately normalised the problem. /The people leading this movement have presented us with a unique moment in history - what historians call a point of bifurcation. We have right now the potential to denormalise a violent reality and take a turn towards a different world. This year has often been dizzying, but it is also true that the distinction between the disastrous future we are headed towards and the future we desperately need has never been sharper. Our focus and commitment are more important than ever. Aljazeera online. Michael Wilson-Becerril, PhD, writes for the REFORM Alliance. His manuscript on resistance to extractivism in Latin America is under advance-contract from Vanderbilt University Press and slated for publication next year."
Dhaka ranks worst in air quality index," Dhaka, one the most polluted cities in the world, ranked worst in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Sunday morning. It had a score of 188 at 10:24am. /The air was classified as 'unhealthy'. When the AQI value is between 151 and 200, everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Pakistan's Lahore and India's Delhi occupied the second and third spots in the list with scores of 178 and 176 respectively. /The AQI, an index for reporting the daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants - Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone. World's most polluted country Bangladesh topped the list of the world's most polluted countries in 2019 for PM2.5 exposure, according to an IQAir AirVisual report. /The 2019 World Air Quality Report is based on data from the world's largest centralised platform for real-time air quality data, combining efforts from thousands of initiatives run by citizens, communities, companies, non-profit organisations and governments. It includes only PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) data as acquired from ground-based air quality monitoring stations with high data availability. To track outdoor air quality, the report focused on the concentrations of two pollutants in particular: fine particle air pollution (particulate matter measuring less than 2.5 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter, or PM2.5) and ozone found near ground level (tropospheric ozone). This assessment also tracked exposure to household air pollution from burning fuels such as coal, wood, or biomass for cooking. Air pollution consistently ranks among the top risk factors for death and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been recognized as increasing a person's chances of developing heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections, and cancer, according to the report. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. Over 80 percent living in urban areas which monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle- income countries most at risk, WHO estimated."
