Pollution from brick kilns: Attention needed,"Bangladesh, Dec. 26 -- Shafiqul Alam/Brick kilns in Bangladesh, mostly are of the conventional type, Fixed Chimney Kiln, use all kinds of combustible materials including, tires as fuel, but the predominant fuel is coal and firewood with some furnace oil to start and rejuvenate the flame. The air pollution from these kilns is not only due to the type of fuel used, but also due to the thermal inefficiencies of the kilns. This causes emissions like SOx, CO, particulate matters, and volatile organic compounds that deteriorate air quality. Another significant factor is that brick kilns are usually clustered around big cities in various parts of Bangladesh. Therefore, the parts of the city in the immediate vicinity of the brick-fields have severe air pollution problems./People living around the brickfields suffer from asthma and inflammation of the eyes. Most brick kilns are set up without environmental impact assessment and even there is no environmental management framework during the operation. Though the government made it mandatory for the brickfield owners to extend chimney height from 30 feet to 120 feet to reduce air pollution, only a few owners paid heed. Again, only half of around 8,000 brick kilns in the country are registered with the Department of Environment and others neither bother to abide by government rules nor have any initiative to make their businesses environment friendly, as reported by a local daily./List of the advantages of Fixed Chimney Kilns:/l The bricks produced, though inferior, are capable of fully satisfying the demand/l Highly cost-effective production. In a poor country this is a significant issue/l Employs migrant people/l Besides coal all combustible materials like firewood, discarded tires etc are used/l Technology is extremely simple and adaptable/l Pay back period is less/With such a long list of advantages, it is not surprising that the FCK has been the kiln of choice. Unfortunately, all the advantages of the FCK stand null and void due to one devastating disadvantage and that is severe pollution. The major and absolutely critical technical issue confronting the brick kiln industry in Bangladesh is that the existing systems are not being able to reduce air pollution from the predominant technology./Though FCK technology is truly traditional, it has survived because of its simplicity, but it was a technology appropriate for the time when the environment had sufficient absorptive capacity. Twenty to thirty years back, there were only few hundred of these scattered all over the country. With growing demand for urban construction these started mushrooming in clusters around the large cities. The problem has now grown to the level where the absorptive capacity of the local environment is greatly exceeded./According to many, clay mining for bricks is destroying agricultural lands. This point is however, hotly contested by the brick kiln owners and many others. Even though clay is readily available, certain groups of people have expressed great concern about the destruction of agricultural land to procure clay. The crucial point they make is the depletion of top soil. FCK owners, without following any guideline, use top soil, which may render valuable agricultural lands barren./Presently, the country is going through a natural gas supply constraint. The prognosis for the future is also not very bright because not much exploration has taken place in the last five years and the shortfall in electricity generation has reached alarming proportions. Naturally, new power projects are on the priority list for receiving gas. In such a scenario, it would be futile to pursue supply of gas to the traditional brickfields. It is worth pointing out that in the mid-nineties the gas utility service severed gas connections to several hundred traditional kilns in an arbitrary manner, because the gas grid could not cope with the extra seasonal load. Since then, the use of natural gas in traditional brickfields, for all practical purpose, has remained suspended./Traditional Kiln provides seasonal jobs to the migratory workers with a minimum of salary in an unhygienic working condition. A significant number of children are also involved in this seasonal brick making sector without following the labour law./Alternative technologies and practices are:/a. Hybrid Hoffman Kiln (HHK)/b. Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln (VSBK)/c. Improved zig zag kiln/All the above technologies can reduce particulate and other emissions from the thousands of brick kilns operating in Bangladesh. One unit of HHK can replace 7.5 units of traditional FCK with a 50 per cent emission reduction from the long-established level. Several HHKs are already operational in the country as part of IIDFC-World Bank initiated CDM project to improve kiln efficiency in the brick making industry in Bangladesh. Besides, lower level of pollution, HHKs can be operated round the year ensuring permanent job opportunities to the brick workers in a better working environment which would lead to a sustainable development./According to an estimate by the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, one brick needs 430 grams of wood fuel for it to be burned. The DOE estimates that every 100,000 bricks need 430 MT of wood fuel. Of the total wood fuel burned annually in the country, 22.03 per cent are in the brickfields (SEHD, 1998). Moreover, brickfields are one of the key contributors of deforestation because they use huge amounts of wood fuel. According to the Environment Conservation Act 1995 (ECA) and Environment Conservation Rules, 1997, brick industry is Orange B category industry, which is not environment-friendly./The informal brick making sector in Bangladesh stands at a crossroads today, due to the effects caused by black smoke containing a highly polluting mix along with fly ash. Government should push the technology such as, HHK to improve energy efficiency significantly and lessen pollution drastically. Again, owners of the FCKs, without having 120 feet chimney or in which firewood and tires are used, should be heavily penalised./The writer, an Engineer, can be reached at e-mail: /<a href=""mailto:shafiq@iidfc.com"">shafiq@iidfc.com</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Most worrying prospects of an utter breakdown await Dhaka residents,"Bangladesh, Jan. 6 -- Country's capital city, Dhaka, faces the most worrying prospects of an utter breakdown, within a decade, due to unplanned urbanisation, absence of civic facilities, and excessive population. At present, approximately 15 million people live in the city, and a large number of people will be migrating to the city in coming years, seeking employment opportunities to lead a better life./Reports published in the media this week said the people migrating to Dhaka from other parts of the country with dreams of a better life are increasing at a rate of 6.0 per cent per year and the rate of growth of population, belonging to such families, is also contributing to the increased city population. This is creating a significant pressure on the city./Despite development and other related issues taking the centre-stage, the concern over demographic explosion appears to have receded to the background. But the air of nonchalance, notwithstanding, the population bomb, is ticking away all the same as before. The average rate of population growth in the city is now 3.0 per cent against 7.0 per cent growth in city slums. This is also contributing to 1.4 per cent average growth rate of population over the country. About 40 per cent of city-dwellers live in slums and the rate is expected to rise in the future./There was a time when the authorities used to hang advertisements for population control all over the city in billboards and posters. Television channels and radio stations used to broadcast these as well. These are now seen nowhere. Is it then assumed that the nation is less concerned about the hyper increase in population today? The question is now creeping in everybody's mind whether we have knowingly abandoned it or not./City's environment is already threatened as a consequence of excessive population. Pollution is increasing and water supply and sanitation facilities in Dhaka might collapse under the fierce pressure of city-dwellers. If population growth continues unabated, a decade from now, it will be hard to walk on the city streets. The unhindered growth of population in Dhaka is set to increase social inequality significantly over the course of the next decade. It will bring about tremendous problems in areas of provision of basic services including heath, education and food. About 60 per cent of total city-dwellers, who are from lower and lower-middle class, will be deprived of those services./Dhaka city has become one of the world's truly hopeless urban cases. Fleeing droughts, floods, and starvation, people have been streaming into the city from the countryside, making it distressingly sick. The capital city is now bursting with people of all categories looking for jobs. In recent times, agitation by garment workers, street fights among rival groups of students on tender dropping, and traffic congestion at every road intersection have brought the city to a standstill./Apart from people living on jobs in government and private agencies, at least 2.0 million people working in different garment factories and other industries in and around the city find it extremely difficult to get a shelter in the confines of the city. The way poor income people living in slum areas of different parts of the city beggars' description. Unhygienic condition leaves scores of them to suffer from many chronic diseases./The situation in Dhaka city is becoming alarming day by day. Joblessness, oversized population, noxious emissions and toxic effluents from smoke belching vehicles have made city life choking. Conscious citizenry have been focusing on human factors responsible for deterioration of environmental quality in the city life. These are: population growth incompatible with development of resources, lack of adequate environmental considerations, poor management of waste generated through the production-generation process./Environmentalists have expressed concern about the environmental degradation of Dhaka city that evidently manifests its decline. Dhaka's air pollution scenario through vehicle emission, despite changeover to CNG-driven vehicles, is still the worst. Dhaka's sky is no longer blue, it is grey. Health experts claim that the air in this rapidly growing city will soon become impossible to breathe. Dhaka city dwellers are, thus, being subjected to slow murder. The city's vehicle population has almost increased ten times since 1992 as a result of the successive governments' failure to introduce mass transport. Some 80 per cent of the vehicles are three wheelers, small buses of the old days and cars which spew more than half the major pollutants./One of the major threats to the city due to declining groundwater levels is land subsidence, which can be triggered by earthquakes of greater magnitudes. Recently, a series of earthquakes of magnitudes ranging from 4.0 to 5.2 on the Richter scale jolted Dhaka and other parts of the country. Although no damage to the infrastructure of the city was reported but there is a great potential of collapse of infrastructures and also of land subsidence associated with earthquakes, particularly in areas of greater groundwater-storage depletion./Unfortunately, there is a sense of resigned acceptance about Dhaka's demise. People don't have faith in the city corporation's ability to combat the capital's problems. Unless the citizens take a unified stand, Dhaka's decline will continue. The mayor of the city cannot claim that he has been able to bring about any reform in any sector during the last few years, be it carpeting the pot-holed roads or creating parking lots or cleaning the streets./Unless migration from the countryside is checked, Dhaka will turn into a city of ruins, where people will risk losing their living environment. Without political commitment and its implementation, reform of any kind is, indeed, virtually impossible to achieve. To arrest the 'decline of Dhaka,' the country needs political will, public advocacy and civic pressure to create sustained awareness through the media.

Making the metropolitan city liveable,"Bangladesh, March 6 -- According to a recent survey carried out by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), a prestigious research wing of the London-based weekly Economist, Dhaka was placed at 139th position out of 140 countries surveyed and identified as the second worst city to live in. The criteria of the standings were based on the factors like stability, healthcare, environment and culture, education and infrastructure./Out of 100 points at stake Bangladesh could earn only 38.7 points just beating Harare marginally at 37.5. Karachi and Colombo are other two Asian cities that make the last 10. Last year, Dhaka held the same position. Canadian city of Vancouver scored 98 points out of 100 to secure the top position as most liveable city in the world. Melbourne has been voted as second most liveable city./Indeed, the people migrating to the city from other parts of the country with dreams of a better life are increasing at a rate of 6.0 per cent per year and the rate of growth of population, belonging to such families, is also contributing to the increased city population.

In an integrated system, with waterways and metro-rail, the need for roads will not be that great. Still it is estimated that the road surface in Dhaka should be more than 15 per cent. Before the work for metro-rail gets started, the main task facing the relevant authorities is to build the already proposed link roads and by-pass roads. The major defect in the transport network is the absence of link roads between eastern and western part of Dhaka. And the by-pass roads that are in the pipeline must be implemented very rapidly./Only way to make the city livable is to make outskirts of Dhaka and other towns the epicenters of growth, create employment opportunities through setting up of more SMEs, opening of educational institutions, medicare facilities, entertainment outlets like parks, cultural rendezvous of different denominations. Decentralization of the administration has been long over due with self-contained zones of habitats so that people do not have to travel long distances. Dhaka's civic governance should be radically improved by bringing into being a unified city authority. Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Budget and the environment,"Bangladesh, April 21 -- Enayet Rasul Bhuiyan/Environmental concern has certainly heightened in Bangladesh. When Bangladesh was born, environmental concern was almost non existent. The country had only started urbanising in that period and urban pollution of different forms witnessed today in Dhaka and other major cities of the country were unknown in that period. Industrialisation was at nascent stages and the degrading effects of industrial wastes on the soil, the water and the air were also relatively unknown quantities. But today, the environmental problems are among the worst threats to the country./The poor air quality of Dhaka city is a source of anxiety and suffering for its residents. The sources of fresh water such as rivers degraded by the untreated industrial and other toxic wastes and effluents is another very big source of environmental worry. Then the country is also facing many other environmental worries, including the lack of crop rotation that reduces soil fertility and the excess lifting of underground water that has led to heavy arsenic presence in such water and land subsidence./It would make one long list if one counts one by one the environmental hazards in Bangladesh. Its biodiversity is threatened from deforestation resulting mainly from population growth and other factors like aridity and desertification caused by the interference in the flow of rivers that flow to it from the neighbouring country. Its wildlife including the world famous Royal Bengal Tigers are dwindling from the threat of salinity and excessive human encroachments affecting their main abode - the Sunderbans mangrove forests. Bangladesh at one time was famous for having over four hundred species of sweet water fishes. Only about sixty or seventy such species have survived human greed and the rest have become extinct or nearly so./In this way, it should be possible to go on counting the environmental ills to show why the environment should be near the top of the agenda of the government in this country for action. Even hospitals and clinics in Dhaka city dispose off their highly hazardous medical garbage most carelessly and the conventional garbage landfills are located next to densely populated residential areas; heavy polluting tanneries seen right in the midst of densely populated urban areas. Indeed, one can go on and on to highlight the many faces of environmental decline in this country./Therefore, it is no wonder that the economists and the environmentalists have been drawing attention to the very pressing need for much better environmental regulation to control the adverse environmental drift. They have recommended levying of pollution tax or green tax on the polluters so that the latter feel actively discouraged from their polluting activities. The proposers of such taxation measures in support of the environment are of the view that the same will rein in the polluters. Apart from the pollution taxes there have been recommendations also for other measures such as reduction of duty for the import of environment friendly equipment and automotive vehicles and substantially increased duty for the import of unfriendly ones./The proposed fiscal measures to promote environment friendly actions and behaviour may sound somewhat novel in the context of Bangladesh. But their appropriateness or usefulness can be hardly doubted. They are a part of life in countries where environmental concerns are high. For instance, in Singapore, a penalty in the financial sense could be imposed even for shredding bits of paper on a road which might be considered as a trivial or no offence in our country./The point is environment is no longer looked at in isolation in those countries. Economics also is not seen divorced from pollution. Economists today are prove to discussing these day. The terms and concepts such as social costs and benefits of economic activities, the externalities (whether positive or negative of any economic activity) on third parties, the costs of environmental clean up, etc. They are for allocative efficiency in the use of resources to produce goods and services that would maximise social benefits and reduce the social costs./For example, the ugly black fume belching three-wheelers in Dhaka city were heavy polluters but their operators argued that they engaged in economic activities by transporting and employing people. The drivers of the three wheelers would lose their work and income as their vehicles were phased out and that would add to unemployment and misery./But this argument was untenable because, with allocative efficiency, we can have both non polluting versions of these three wheelers such as the new scooters that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) while also achieving the environmental objective of non air pollution./The polluting three wheelers were engaged in some form of economic activity all right but those were also causing a negative externality in the process such as air pollution. Apart from the unpleasantness of air pollution to the victims, such a negative externality also exacted a heavy price in the form of shortened lives from illnesses caused by air pollution and the amounts expended in higher medical costs to treat such diseases. Thus, the need for allocative efficiency or prudent use of resources in this sector could be met by investing on non polluting three wheelers which contribute to economic activities minus their negative social or economic costs./The purpose of so much textual verbiage here is to drive home the point that time has arrived for our planners to start thinking hard about efficiency in the allocation of resources and nothing can be better than the national budget to put such principles into practice. And the next national budget is around the corner, a suitable time to start giving due attention to these matters./Physical arm twisting and blunt enforcement measures or lack of the same so far have yielded little result against certain environmental problems. But the fiscal measures that have been proposed stand a better chance of succeeding by creating adequate disincentives for the polluters to wind up their polluting activities in view of the penal taxes or the inability to bear the heavy import costs of the polluting agents./Not only in respect of these proposals the budget makers need to redraw their strategy. They ought to give the highest priority to the principle of allocative efficiency in all spheres of the budget to more and more channel resources to activities that would lead to economic growth but not at the cost of the environment.

The growing threat from pesticides,"Bangladesh, June 2 -- Enayet Rasul Bhuiyan/The environmental impact of pesticides is often greater than what is intended by those who use them. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non target species - air, water, bottom sediments, and food . Pesticide contaminates land and water when it escapes from production sites and storage tanks, when it runs off from fields, when it is discarded, when it is sprayed aerially, and when it is sprayed into water to kill algae./Pesticides can contribute to air pollution. Pesticide drift occurs when those suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides that are applied to crops are volatile and may be blown by winds into nearby areas, potentially posing a threat to wildlife./In the United States pesticides were found to pollute every stream and over 90% of wells sampled in a study by the US Geological Survey. Pesticide residues have also been found in rain and groundwater. Studies by the UK government showed that pesticide concentrations exceeded those allowable for drinking water in some samples of river water and groundwater./Many of the chemicals used in pesticides are persistent soil contaminants, whose impact may endure for decades and adversely affect soil conservation. The use of pesticides decreases the general biodiversity in the soil. Not using the chemicals results in higher soil quality./Pesticides inflict extremely widespread damage to biota, and many countries have acted to discourage pesticide usage through their biodiversity action plans. Animals may be poisoned by pesticide residues that remain on food after spraying, for example when wild animals enter sprayed fields or nearby areas shortly after spraying ./Pesticides can enter the human body through inhalation of aerosols, dust and vapor that contain pesticides; through oral exposure by consuming food and water; and through dermal exposure - direct contact of pesticides with skin. When pesticides are sprayed onto food crops, especially fruits and vegetables, they secrete into soils and groundwater which can end up in drinking water, and pesticide spray can drift and pollute the air. Exposure to pesticides can range from mild skin irritation to birth defects, tumors, genetic changes, blood and nerve disorders, endocrine disruption, and even coma or death./In recent decades, the indiscriminate use of agricultural pesticides has created very serious health and environmental problems in many developing countries. One to five million farm workers are estimated to suffer pesticide poisoning every year according to WHO, UNEP and at least 20,000 die./Researchers at the Institute of Development Policy Analysis in Bangladesh found banned and suspect pesticides among the 12,000 tonnes imported into the country last year - a three-fold increase over the last decade . Suppliers continue to sell many chemical and also 12 particularly controversial pesticides dubbed the ""dirty dozen"" by activists campaigning worldwide to stop their manufacture. But gullible and illiterate farmers are persuaded by glib sales talk at promotional camps, and through incentive schemes, to buy new unregistered formulations that promise to protect crops against pest attacks and disease/In a recent survey of 820 boro (winter rice), potato, bean, eggplant, cabbage, sugarcane and mango farmers in Bangladesh, more than 47 per cent of farmers were found to use more pesticides than needed to protect their crops./With only four per cent of farmers formally trained in pesticide use or handling, and over 87 per cent freely admitting that they used little or no protective measures while applying pesticides, overuse is potentially a very threatening problem to farmers' health as well as the environment in this country. Thus, in Bangladesh there is an urgent need to actively promote safer pesticide use and hygienic practices among people who handle these substances./Research findings also highlight the need for policymakers to design effective, targeted outreach programmes that address pesticide risk, safe handling, and protection. The approach should ideally be participatory, with a view to addressing the most dangerous information gaps. Another important finding from Bangladesh is that specific crops and geographic locations experience more overuse than others. For the most measurable results, interventions should focus on these crops and regions./Information on how pesticides affects health is quite limited in Bangladesh. Farmers in Bangladesh are often unable to distinguish the symptoms of pesticide poisoning from other health problems. This suggests that regular medical checkups and blood tests should be conducted for those who handle highly or moderately toxic pesticides. Also, farmers should be encouraged to switch to lower-hazard pesticides and use protective gear to reduce individual health risks./Even when individual farmers are careful, pervasive contamination from others' pesticide use and persistent pesticide residues in local water, air and soil may pose significant health risks. Collective measures, therefore, can be an important complement to individual actions./Chemically polluted runoff from fields has contaminated surface and ground water, damaged fisheries, and destroyed freshwater ecosystems in Bangladesh. A significant part of such contamination is the result of unregulated pesticide use./But a great deal of positive changes can occur with Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and conventional techniques. IPM comprises a range of approaches, from carefully targeted use of chemical pesticides to biological techniques that use natural parasites and predators to control pests./Results from Bangladesh suggest that the productivity of IPM rice farming is not significantly different from the productivity of conventional farming. Since IPM reduces pesticide costs with no accompanying loss in production, it seems to be more profitable than conventional rice farming./Interview results also suggest substantial health and ecological benefits. However, collective adoption of these methods is a must. Neighbours' continued reliance on chemicals to kill pests will also kill helpful parasites and predators, as well as exposing IPM farmers and local ecosystems to chemical spillovers from adjoining fields.

Control per capita exhaust,"Bangladesh, June 9 -- The capital has recently been named the world's most, (not just 'one of the most') polluted city. Whether this unenviable position is deserved or not may need further survey but the fact remains that Dhaka's air is so heavily laden with pollutants that its ten million or so citizens are virtually suffocating, as if trapped in some kind of gas chamber. The situation seems to be getting worse, not better, even though it is known that prolonged exposure to heavily polluted air, be it indoors or outdoors, can cause morbid illnesses, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer. Much of the noxious gases and suspended particulates, needless to say, are generated by vehicular and industrial exhaust, construction work, waste dumping, incineration and similar activities. Some years ago, an Air Quality Monitoring Project (AQMP) said the annual average particulate matter in Dhaka's air was rising again, after a short respite in 2003-2004 when CNG-driven vehicles phased-out two-stroke engines from Dhaka./Fine suspended particulate matter (PM) in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic metre, should be no more than 2.5 mcm, for health's sake. Highly polluted cities, however, are permitted an interim target of 70 mcm. But the capital is said to have about three times that amount. After the two-stroke ban, fine particulates had come down by fifty per cent - from 266 mcm in 2003 to 147 mcm in 2004. But by 2008, AQMP measurements found that it had gone up - to 191.83 mcm. As for solid particles (PM -10), it was 330 mcm in 2003 and 238 in 2004. It may be much higher now, given the fact that the most dilapidated vehicles are seen to ply the streets in the name of public transport spewing black exhaust with impunity. The rise of diesel run buses and trucks and the large number of terribly unfit vehicles on the capital's roads seem to be beyond control. These spew out more carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur than new, reconditioned and well-maintained combustion engines. Why such condemned vehicles keep coming back on the roads to do brisk business is a mystery./Some years ago the environment ministry had tried to enforce the use of catalytic converters in all motor vehicles, supposedly to convert the poisonous exhaust into relatively harmless gas. But that was a non-starter because the catalyst itself had a short life span and vehicle owners would hardly be counted upon to replace it even if it ceased doing the job. Cost concerns and general apathy would have defeated the purpose. The very nature of motor vehicles being that toxic fumes will escape, the decision makers should try instead to control per capita exhaust. Logically, a good quality fifty-seater bus, or better, a sturdy double-decker, pollutes less than a four-seater car./Therefore, it would make most sense to put a respectable, adequate and efficient public transport system in place. At the same time, private cars should be discouraged, if not banned, from plying during peak hours. Many advanced cities have opted for this action both to manage traffic congestion and to keep car exhaust down. In addition, revamping the existing railway lines and constructing a sensible circular rail service for greater Dhaka's commuters, at the earliest, would be the most doable thing, if the burden of air pollution - and the hassle of commuting - is to be brought down to a tolerable level.

Air pollution in city reaches alarming level,"Bangladesh, June 19 -- Shahiduzzaman Khan/Air pollution has reached alarming proportions in the city which has become virtually unliveable. Urban air here is thick with fumes; water either in the rivers, ponds or tube-wells, is polluted, and the land is poisoned. Unchecked dumping of waste, a lot of it toxic, noxious emissions from vehicles and the pesticides used in farmlands are the main culprits./Air pollution in the capital has taken an alarming turn, posing serious health hazards for city dwellers. Things get worse in dry season as air, thick with particulates, becomes a prevalent cause of chest and respiratory diseases. According to the Department of Environment (DoE), the density of airborne particulate matter (PM) has reached 247 micrograms per cubic metre (mcm) in Dhaka which is nearly five times the acceptable level of 50 PM per mcm set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of Bangladesh./Airborne particulates are considered more harmful when they are 10 micrometres or smaller in diameter and in Dhaka the density of PM which is 2.5 micrometers or smaller has been found to be 9.0 times higher than the NAAQS recommendation. Ambient air in the city becomes extremely polluted between October and March every year when rain is scarce and when thousands of brick kilns become operational, burning used automobile and rickshaw tyres, low grade coal and in many cases fuel-wood./World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines of 2005 however recommend a maximum acceptable PM level of 20mcm compared to Bangladesh standard of 50. Cities with 70mcm are considered highly polluted. Airborne lead is the worst of the harmful PMs./Although there is no definite study, doctors suggest exposure to such a volume of air pollution may cause premature deaths and also various diseases including pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illnesses. Air pollution has also an adverse effect on all other life forms including plants. Cost of maintaining building structures in the urban areas also rises significantly due to such air pollution. The number of patients with different chest and respiratory diseases in the hospitals and clinics is on the rise./If this trend of air pollution continues, those living in Dhaka metropolis, will soon become exposed to these ailments and also other complications. The mental faculty of children will be adversely affected by lead pollution, which can also affect the central nervous system and cause renal damage and hypertension./In addition to brick kilns, old buses, fleets of trucks and thousands of other poorly serviced vehicles contribute highly to the pollution. Moreover, dust from roads and construction sites and toxic fumes from industrial sites turn the air quality scenario even worse./Industrial wastes are responsible for 60 per cent of the surface water pollution in and around Dhaka city while domestic wastes contribute rest of the pollution. At present, underground water is extracted exploring 300 metres deep. Dhaka's aquifer system should be saved, as the underground water table is falling fast. A World Bank report in 2007 found that there are 7000 small and large industrial units in and around Dhaka city. But now the number has crossed 10,000./According to WHO guidelines, blood lead level above 10 microgram per deciliter is considered as lead poisoning. A recent survey found lead concentration in urban children to be 5.8 to 21.6 microgram per deciliter and urban slum children's lead level ranged from 9.6 to 38.9 microgram per deciliter, three times more than the acceptable level./Sadly true, laws exist to book a polluter, but law enforcers shy away from using the laws in most cases because of an unholy alliance with the vehicle drivers. In most cases, polluting vehicles drive away emitting noxious fumes in the presence of the law enforcement personnel without being held up or booked. Old and dilapidated vehicles disappear from the roads during special drive by the law enforcers only to return after the drive comes to an end./It may be recalled here that New Delhi in an attempt to reduce air pollution prohibited initially 20 year old vehicles from plying on city streets in late 1990s. They started phasing out 17 year old vehicles from the end of 1998. It was followed by elimination of 15 year old vehicles in 1999. Besides registration of new auto-rickshaws with front engines remains banned from 1996 and registration of old defence service and government auctioned vehicles remains banned from 1998. All these steps of the New Delhi authorities have created some favourable impacts in reducing air pollution and in the process have been improving the air quality./More than 0.32 million motor vehicles ply the roads in Dhaka. Diesel-run vehicles account for more than 80 per cent of the air pollution as most of them fail to comply with the emission standard. In the past, attempts to prohibit plying of old vehicles in Dhaka city streets failed either for political reasons or in the face of resistance by transport owners and their employees. But if the neighbouring countries can improve air quality of their cities by banning use of old vehicles and also relocating some of their polluting industries, authorities in Bangladesh can also do the same./It is thus time to phase out black smoke emitting vehicles from city roads as our right to live in healthy environment largely depends on it. Good governance helped curb air pollution in cities like Bangkok, Kolkata, Kathmandu and Lahore while weak administration caused the increase of air pollution in Dhaka and Karachi. It is possible to reduce air pollution in Dhaka provided there are sincere efforts of the government and the citizens./Indeed, Bangladesh is one of the few countries that face extreme hazards due to environmental degradation and resource depletion. The degradation of the environment has been highlighted in various forums because of its universal potential for chaos and disorder. Environmental problems faced by Bangladesh are far too many though largely caused by factors, which are teleological because of its geographical position./The ecological hazards of pollution and resource depletion pose a potentially catastrophic threat to Bangladesh. The government should take the environmental threats seriously, and create public awareness and undertake action-oriented programmes./<a href=""mailto:szkhan@dhaka.net"">szkhan@dhaka.net</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Health care to bear the brunt of climate change,"Source, Oct. 27 -- WHO/B M Sajjad Hossain/Day by day climatic changes will be a greater cause for the disruption of the ecosystem's services which support human health and livelihood. Due to economic retreat, for the developing countries, it will be really difficult to recover the impacts on health care done by climate change. It will also help to increase the malnutrition problem and consequent disorders with special implications for the child growth and their proper development. Nonetheless, the whole natural system will be affected; even the rainfall patterns can be expected to lead to an increased burden of diarrhoeal diseases and to the altered spatial distribution of some infectious disease vectors too. World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the modest anthropogenic climate change had occurred since 1970 and claims 150000 lives annually which continued till 2000./The current and emerging climate change-related health risks are more in Asia and the Pacific region. Here, heat stress, water-and food-borne diseases (i.e. cholera, diarrhoea) are associated with extreme weather events like heat waves, storms, floods and flash floods and droughts. The vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria may be spread out here and there. Even the climate change will help to raise the pollutions level too. That is way, the respiratory diseases will be more ordinary due to air pollution and food production will decrease due to water pollution. So day to day, the water security, malnutrition and psychosocial concerns will be the important issues to be considered deeply./Most of these risks and diseases are not new, even the health sector is already tackling these problems, but the capacity to cope with potentially increasing levels of these risks and diseases is very much limited, and particularly in under developed countries like Bangladesh./Due to increase in temperature, some serious problems like malnutrition, diarrhoea and malaria is estimated to kill 3.7 million, 1.9 million and 0.9 million people respectively per year all around the world. Even warmer temperatures will have adverse effects on food production, water availability and the spread of disease vectors./Changes in climate are likely to lengthen the transmission season of important vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria and to alter their geographic range, potentially reaching regions that lack either population immunity or a strong public health infrastructure. WHO found that already climate change effects have decreased the status of the natural apparatus on human body and destroyed wildlife. Human-induced climate change significantly amplifies the likelihood of heat waves as well as increasing the possibility of heat strokes, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. More variable precipitation patterns are likely to compromise the supply of fresh water, increasing risks of water-borne diseases like cholera, and outbreaks of diarrhoea./Nonetheless rising temperatures and variable precipitation are likely to decrease the production of staple foods in many of the poorest regions which leads to increase in the risks of malnutrition, especially for the children and pregnant woman. Rising sea levels increase the risk of coastal flooding, and may lead to displacements of thousands of people living in coastal areas. The most vulnerable areas in South-east Asian (SEA) countries are the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta in Bangladesh, small islands of other countries as well as the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean./The government estimates that crops in more than 1.6 million acres of land were damaged in the year 2008. Nonetheless over 462,815 livestock are confirmed killed, which represents loss of critical household assets, with an associated loss to wealth and income, as well as a loss in milk production for own consumption. Extensive damage to roads and public buildings was also reported, including 1,355 educational institutions destroyed and another 7,847 partially damaged in that year too. Loss of livelihood will increase psychosocial stress in the affected populations./The measurement of the impact of climate change on health can only be very approximate. However, WHO's quantitative assessment concluded that the effects of climate change since the mid-1970s may have caused at least 160,000 additional deaths annually after 2000. Globally but specially the low income countries where malnutrition is widespread, the level of education is poor and with weak infrastructures, will have the most difficulty in adapting to climate change and related health hazards./The government has to develop and implement national action plans for health that are integrated into existing national plans on adaptation and mitigation to climate change. So national and regional climate forecasting information, including climate change projections, should be fully utilised and facilitated the development of community-based resource management. The costs and benefits of different interventions should be determined too; where the international organisations like WHO may help by providing specific climate change-related technical guidance for vulnerability and adaptation assessments and surveillance systems. This process may be a helpful method for identifying risks to vulnerable groups, quantifying the burden of disease from climate change, and quantifying costs and benefits of health adaptation measures to ensure comparability across the SEA countries./Rich and developed countries, those who are mostly responsible for the harming to the natural eco-system and its services, may come forward with technical and financial support to build a strong national action plans on mitigation and adaptation, including conducting research on the health impacts of climate change. They may also provide training programes on methodologies and assist in the assessment and management of health risks due to climate change. So it is time for the Bangladesh government to make the plan properly and work accordingly for the health sector development; that is why, it will be able to tackle the imminent problems due to climate change./The writer is a columnist and development researcher.

Air pollution needs attention,"Bangladesh, Nov. 1 -- The dry months in the cities can very well be dubbed the cruelest, given the fact that the burden of air-borne pollutants becomes heavier, as is palpable now, together with the incidence of increased respiratory diseases among young and old. This deserves serious and sustained attention, at least during the long season when the blessed cleansing property of the rains is on hold. Both Dhaka and Chittagong are so laden with pollutants as to turn them into virtual gas chambers, particularly when the air becomes cooler and traps all kinds of dusts, soots and fumes into heavy smog. The authorities concerned are seen simply taking a few perfunctory steps now and then, measuring air quality and condemning polluting vehicles. But, at the end of the day, neither policy nor behaviour change is noticeable long enough, that might help clean up the air./The number of motor vehicles continue to grow, and even condemned ones keep surfacing, spewing poisonous exhaust and getting, unfortunately, the culture-specific, no-emission rickshaw outlawed in many areas. Vehicular and industrial exhaust, construction work, waste dumping, incineration activities and the like all together compound the urban burden of suspended particulates in the dry, rainless period. One Air Quality Monitoring Project (AQMP), conducted some years ago, confirmed the same. Following the phase-out of two-stroke engines from Dhaka in the early part of this decade, there seemed to be a short respite, but these days it seems to be back to square one. According to WHO, fine suspended particulate matter (PM), measured in micrograms per cubic metre, should not be more than 2.5 mcm. But highly polluted cities have been allowed an 'interim target' of 70 mcm. Dhaka's load was found to be three times that amount!/After the two-stroke ban, fine particulates had come down by fifty per cent - from 266 mcm in 2003 to 147 mcm in 2004. But by 2008, AQMP measurements found that it had gone up again - to 191.83 mcm. As for solid particles (PM -10), it was 330 mcm in 2003 and 238 in 2004, reaching 291 mcm in 2008. Much of this is blamed on the rise of diesel run buses and trucks, the generators that keep burning fuel due to load-shedding, and the large number of unfit and dilapidated vehicles that refuse to retire from the capital's roads, spewing out much more carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur than new, reconditioned and well-maintained combustion engines do./Decision makers must focus more seriously on controlling per capita exhaust. Apart from commissioning good quality buses that can carry more commuters per trip, circular shuttle train services deserve to be put in place as soon as possible. Few would need to use private vehicles if these were run efficiently enough. Many enlightened cities the world over have long been encouraging walking and cycling, in addition to the option of using the least-polluting transport systems - to manage traffic congestion, save time and money and keep motor pollution down. High time attitude towards the rickshaw were revised and space created for it to ply without fear of the baton. Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Lifestyles and diseases,"Bangladesh, Jan. 24 -- Farzana Haque/A World Health Organization (WHO) report has estimated that 44 per cent of all deaths annually in Bangladesh are linked to chronic diseases and this increasing trend has been explained as a result of changing lifestyles related to food intake, less physical activity and growing tobacco use and air pollution./The forces of globalisation over the last few decades have made our markets and economies more interdependent, virtually linking the population of Bangladesh with people all over the world through easy modes of cultural exchange, such as: Internet, movies, tourism, education, etc. All of this together changed people's perceptions and attitudes. The open markets cater to our new needs - products like fried chicken, pizza, burger, sugary soft-drinks, etc./Local brands of western-style fast-food establishments are being popularised through rigorous marketing, promotion and advertising. The intake of risky food items with little nutritional value is therefore increasing. In this respect, people's perception of being 'smart' plays a critical role. For example: a person is regarded smart if he/ she chooses a burger over some homemade food items. These junk foods are keeping people away from eating a proper balanced diet; instead people consume large amounts of fat and calories./Another impact of globalisation is the proliferation of computers, televisions, video games and various other forms of electronic entertainment leading children, adolescents and even adults to spend more and more time in front of the TV, computers and playing video games rather than going for physical activities. Consequently, more and more of them are suffering from obesity, which results in many forms of chronic diseases./Furthermore, not sleeping at night has become a regular feature for many of the young generation as they remain busy browsing the Internet and social networking sites, movies, video games, etc. This tendency is taking a grave toll on their health, causing different types of sicknesses related to lack of sleep. Thus chronic diseases have emerged as a major health hazard for the people of Bangladesh. Massive information, education and communication campaigns should be carried out to raise awareness about the possible grave outcomes of such lifestyles.

33 unlicensed brick kilns run in Khagrachhari,"Bangladesh, Feb. 9 -- At least 33 brick kilns are operating unlawfully in Khagrachhari defying the government ban posing a serious threat to environment as well as human health./Locals alleged a section of unscrupulous traders in collusion with local influential people as well as some dishonest officials of the local administration and forest department were running their business in violation of the law./According to the Khagrachhari district administration sources, there are 33 brick kilns in the district. Of them, five in Dighinala upazila, two in Panchhari upazila, eleven in Matiranga upazila, three in Mohalchhari upazila, two are in Manikchhari upazila, four in Ramgorh upazila and six in Sadar upazila./None of the fields got clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE)./Suinuprue Chowdhury, owner of the Mowaprue Brick Field in Mohalchhari upazila, said, ""We have to offer kickbacks to a section of officials for running this business.""/Habibur Rahman Selim, another kiln owner in Matiranga upazila echoing the same, said, ""Though reports were published on illegal brick kilns in the district, it did not make any difference for us.""/General secretary of 'Paribesh Banchao Forum' Abu Taher Muhammad said, ""The actual number of brickfields in the district is higher than the figure available with the district administration.""/""A kiln uses at least 0.30 to 0.32 million maunds of firewood for producing bricks about eight times a year,"" he said adding that they also use a huge quantity of earth, mostly topsoil that reduces fertility of cultivable land in the hilly area./The kiln owners use firewood destroying unclassified state forest and reserve forest. Moreover, the short chimneys cause serious air pollution in the area, he further said./Divisional forest officer of Khagrachhari, AKM Jahirul Alam said the yields from crops and fruit-bearing trees declined remarkably in the district due to the adverse impact of the brick kilns./People living around the brick kilns are often found to be sick with diseases like asthma and swelling eye./When asked about the involvement of his officials, he said, ""We'll take action, if anyone is found guilty.""/Anisul Hoque Bhuiyan, deputy commissioner of Khagracchari, denying any association of his officials said, ""We will soon operate our mobile courts to take legal action in this regard.""

Dhaka's air pollution is killing,"Bangladesh, Feb. 23 -- Many projects and programmes, avowedly to 'protect' or 'conserve' the environment, are given a great deal of publicity from time to time. This includes pledges to clean up the air in the cities, particularly the capital, which is so laden with pollutants as to turn densely populated Dhaka into a virtual gas chamber. Dwellers here breathe at their peril as the toxic air, in the dry, rainless season specially, compounds the burden of various cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Yet the number of motor vehicles continue to grow, clogging roads and poisoning people while squeezing out cyclists and pedestrians and the much maligned, but environment-friendly rickshaw. Curiously, despite the government's ban on very old, highly polluting vehicles in the city, unscrupulous individuals and so-called companies are seen too often, brazenly putting the most un-roadworthy junks on duty which go on spewing black exhaust with abandon./Vehicular and industrial exhaust, construction work, waste dumping, incineration activities and the like, have been pushing up the urban concentration of suspended particulates so high as to be literally tangible. One Air Quality Monitoring Project (AQMP), a few years ago, had claimed the same, although there was a short respite, following the phase-out of two-stroke engines from Dhaka in the early part of this decade. Fine suspended particulate matter (PM), measured in micrograms per cubic metre, should not be more than 2.5 mcm, according to WHO. Highly polluted cities, however, have been allowed an 'interim target' of 70 mcm but Dhaka's load is said to be three time that quantity./The ban on the two-stroke scooter rickshaws not very long ago has been credited with bringing down the load of fine particulates by at least fifty percent - from 266 mcm in 2003 to 147 mcm in 2004. But by 2008, AQMP measurements found that it had gone up again - to 191.83 mcm. As for solid particles (PM -10), it was 330 mcm in 2003 and 238 in 2004, reaching 291 mcm in 2008. Figures for the recent years are not available. Much of the pollution is blamed on the rise of diesel-run buses and trucks and the large number of unfit and dilapidated vehicles that refuse to retire from the capital's roads. These give out more carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur than new, reconditioned and well-maintained combustion engines. But the fact is, the number of motor vehicles on the roads has been going up by leaps and bounds./Decision makers need to focus more seriously on controlling per capita exhaust. The commissioning of good quality transport that can carry more commuters per trip is a step in the right direction but it is not enough. A respectable, adequate and efficient public transport system in the capital should include a circular shuttle train service as soon as possible. If these minimum services are put in place private car owners would be encouraged to opt for public transport more often than not. Advanced cities across the world have been managing traffic congestion and keeping car exhaust down with such well thought-out mass transport systems. Attention must also be given to the design and standard of the vehicles plying the roads so that passengers can sit, as well as stand, if need be - comfortably and securely enough - and with bars to hold on to and with enough leg space between seats. The conduct of the drivers and helpers also need to be 'standardised' through proper training, lest uncouth behaviour discourage dignified commuters.

"Brick kilns: Pollution, advance technologies and carbon credits","Bangladesh, March 31 -- Apart from the problems like poverty, population control etcetera, environmental pollution seems to be a black cloud on the horizon. Environmental problem needs to be addressed with high priority, if we want to keep the country livable for the posterity. Not that Bangladesh is highly industrialised or there is no law regarding pollution control, but use of polluting technology as well as lax enforcement of law is fuelling pollution./During the nineties air pollution in Dhaka reached an alarming proportion. The then government banned two stroke polluting three wheelers in 1993 and introduced compressed natural gas (CNG) run auto-rickshaws and the resultant was a drastic improvement in the city's air quality. Nevertheless, air quality in the city, as the time passes, is deteriorating. The city, of late, has been termed as the second most polluted city in the world and thanks to the significant number of polluting brick kilns, around the city, which are emitting black smoke from chimneys./Despite the existence of laws, thousands of brick kilns, most of which are coal based fixed chimney kilns (FCK), are using from wood to even tires to burn bricks, thereby polluting air severely. Many brick kilns, according to reports, have been operating just without approval of the concerned authorities. The existing law stipulates that no brickfield can be set up within three kilometers of a residential or a forest area; however, the law is more on paper./Although environmentally and socially harmful, backdated and money-spinning FCK has been the technology of choice in the country. The number of brick kilns in the country, according to some estimates, is some 6000 and of which approximately 90 per cent are FCK. While according to UNDP-GEF study, more than 1000 brick kilns are operational in the vicinity of Dhaka and again, most of them are conventional FCKs./Special traits (all aspects) of FCK technology are: cheap and simple technology; green brick making is a manual process; no permanent roof is constructed over the baking area and this is why heat loss is significant while more coal is needed that means the technology is highly energy inefficient; environmentally damaging as black smoke from the kiln is released to the atmosphere through chimney; operational only during the dry season and as such job at this type of kiln is temporary; final product (brick) is not of high quality; investment is less than a billion; most of the FCKs are constructed on rented lands; working condition is poor; and child labour is very much common in the FCKs and the like./Despite having so many problems, the primitive FCK technology is dominating the country's brick sector and acting as a life support to our construction industry. Again, with the ever increasing trend of urbanisation, the demand of bricks for all forms of construction works has been increasing at a fast rate. However, all, including developers and land owners, more often than not, search for cheap bricks even not bothering about quality./Against the backdrop of so many problems associated with FCK technology, cleaner technologies, like hybrid Hoffman kiln (HHK), tunnel kiln and vertical shaft kiln (VSK), are available in the country now. Special traits of the advanced technologies (HHK and Tunnel kiln) are: use almost 50 per cent less coal than FCK; semi-automatic technology; permanent roof is constructed over the baking area resulting in reducing heat loss; no chimney is used; smoke from the kiln is not released to the atmosphere rather that is used for drying green bricks; environmentally friendly; operational throughout the year; permanent job opportunity; final product is of high quality; safety gears are provided; hygienic working condition; and production capacity is more and so and so forth./Apart from these, one unit of HHK can replace 7.5 units of FCK while one unit of Tunnel Kiln, which has the capacity to produce up to 300,000 bricks per day, can replace more FCKs. This would save arable land as brick kiln is one of the principal agents of topsoil degradation. Brick kilns are destroying large areas of lands every year as bricks are made by collecting soils from a depth of few millimeters in agricultural land./Not only HHKs or Tunnel kilns are environmentally and socially beneficial, it can also help earn significant amount of foreign credit through carbon trading. Two tunnel kilns each having a capacity of producing 300,000 bricks per day can be bundled into one, or 10 HHKs each having a capacity of producing 50,000 bricks per day can be put into one bundle and then following all the process of a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) cycle, CDM project developer can earn carbon credit. By this way, a part of the huge investment of advanced technologies (HHK and Tunnel Kiln) can be met by earning carbon credit./Many predicted that Bangladesh would be severely affected in the event of climate change which is due to the emission of the industrialised countries and we expect a reasonable compensation for that. But do we really care for environment?/Yet, the time is not over. More than 8.0 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be minimised if brick sector is completely transformed. It would ensure multiple benefits-- sustainable environment, social well-being, carbon credit, better life and the like.

"MPs lobbying for removing duty, tax on bidi industry","Bangladesh, May 5 -- Some of the county's lawmakers have intensified lobbying to convince the tax authorities for not imposing new tax as well as for withdrawing existing duty on bidi industry in the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2012-13, ignoring harmful impact of the tobacco item on public health./A total of 10 Members of Parliament (MPs) have recently sent DO letters to Finance Minister A M A Muhith, requesting him to withdraw excise duty and advance income tax (AIT) on the industry./Members of parliamentary standing committees on power, energy and mineral resources, education and Chittagong Hill Tracts - Dr. Md Abdul Kader Khan, Md Ziaur Rahman and Md Shah Alam - respectively placed letters to the finance minister./Other MPs, requesting in this regard, include Kazi Faruk Kader, Ranjit Kumar Das, A A Maruf Saklan, Mahejabin Morshed, Shafiqul Azam Khan, Abdul Mannan, Afazuddin Ahmed and Nur Jahan Begum./In the DO letters, the MPs requested the NBR to waive 6.0 per cent AIT and excise duty on bidi industry to save millions of poor workers, connected with it./They also requested to consider the industry as cottage industry, as women workers are working in it./Meanwhile, experts have expressed different opinions regarding waiver of tax on bidi industry. They said all kinds of tobacco products should be taxed highly for the sake of public health./Dr Abdus Samad, an ENT specialist and additional director of SAHIC (Society for Assistance to Hearing Impaired Children), said 10 sticks of tobacco contain 25 milligrams (mg) of nicotine that can kill a person./Some 6.0 per cent of the nicotine, released during smoking, is absorbed in blood, while the rest causes air pollution. Around 85 per cent of lung cancer is caused by smoking./Price hike of tobacco products, checking tobacco production, imposing social control, and using religious sentiment are necessary to reduce use of tobacco items, he added./Besides, they said according to a recent study, closure of the country's bidi industry will not affect majority of the industry owners./Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK) conducted the study on 'Bidi in Myths and Reality.'/The study found that 65 per cent of the local bidi industry owners have diversified their business to other areas./It also found that the industry owners are financially and politically influential enough to protect their industry from various steps that might have been taken against it./""Most of the bidi factory owners are not only known as businessmen, but they also have strong political and/or personal ties, particularly with local members of parliament (MPs),"" it said./The study has found poor wages of the bidi factory workers, their various health hazards, and involvement of child labourers in the industry./""Although the bidi workers struggle to survive, production of the item is still very profitable for the factory owners,"" it said.

Burning control rules ignored in Brahmanbaria brickfields,"BRAHMANBARIA, July 21 -- Price of bricks, the most essential house building material, has gone up here due to scarcity of coal./The brickfield owners are compelled to use wood in furnace, as they cannot buy coal at fair price. They claim alleged that to keep the price of brick stable they used wood which is available at a relatively cheaper price./Now, No-1 brick is being sold at Tk 6700.00 to Tk 7500.00 per thousand of brick. Tk 6200.00 to Tk 6500.00 for No-2 and No-3 has been selling at Tk 5700.00 to Tk 6000.00. Different brickfield owners sell bricks at different rates not complying with the market rate./Both the licensed and unlicensed brickfield owners have been running their business without VAT registration, income tax and commercial development tax. The government has fixed Tk 60000 as Value Added Tax (VAT) for each brickfield every year since 1992 as against Tk 10000 in 1991 and fixed Tk 10500 for one section, Tk 12000 for one and half section and Tk 18000 for two sections as land development tax./Besides, most of the brickfields have sprung up in areas close to human settlements, which is threatening public health. Now the number of brickfields in Brahmanbaria is eighty two or more./According to brick burning control ordinance of 1992 to 2001 (rectified) and 2004(amended), the owners are prohibited from using all kings of firewood in kilns. The law however allows use of coal in kilns and that a law breaker is liable to be fined Tk 50000 or sentenced to six months imprisonment if firewood including bamboo roots is used in brickfields./Brickfield owners procure firewood from rural areas with the help of the agents who also occasionally bring firewood from the government reserved forest located in Taliapara Raganandan forest under Habigonj district./While visiting some brickfields in Majlishpur, Shayampur, Chandura of Sadar Upazila and Chatalpar of Nasirnagar Upazila, it was observed that piles of firewood are stored for brick burning. Coal is found near some brickfields but the kilns are using only firewood./It is also mandatory according to the law to install a minimum 50 feet high chimney with filter in every kiln for emission of smokes but the owners care little about it./Lower chimney in kilns sends vaporous waste, dust carbon dioxide, sulphur-dioxide and lead and black smoke into the air polluting the environment and exposing the people to various diseases like respiratory problems. The heat generated in the furnace could have a devastating effect on the vegetation within a radius of several kilometers./A circular from ministry of land in 1990 said deputy commissioners could allow only infertile and fallow lands for setting up brickfields. But in most cases, the ministry's orders are overruled. Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Arresting decline of a worst livable city,"Bangladesh, Aug. 23 -- For the second year in a row, Dhaka has been adjudged the worst livable city of the world. Last week, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) of the prestigious London-based weekly announced livability ratings for 2012 around the world which puts Dhaka as the worst city among 140 ones./This livability rating puts formidable challenges before Dhaka on how to reverse the trend. The ranking considers that any city with a rating of 80 or more will have few, if any, challenges to living standards. Any city with a score of less than 50 will see most aspects of living severely restricted. Dhaka's rating is at the bottom (140) of the EIU ranking. The EIU scores each city on over 30 qualitative and quantitative factors, across five broad categories. The categories include: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure./The EIU rating further pinpoints how Dhaka city, the centre of commerce and culture in Bangladesh, faces a grim prospect of total collapse within a decade, due to unplanned urbanisation, absence of civic facilities, and excessive population. At present, approximately 15 million people live in the capital city, and a large number of people will be migrating to the city in coming years, seeking employment opportunities. The migration to Dhaka from other parts of the country is increasing at a rate of 6.0 per cent a year./Despite development and other related issues taking the centre-stage, the concern over demographic explosion seems to have receded to the background. But the air of nonchalance notwithstanding, the population bomb is ticking away all the same as before. The population growth rate in the city is now 3.0 per cent against 7.0 per cent growth in city slums, contributing to 1.4 per cent average growth rate over the country. About 40 per cent of city-dwellers live in slums and that rate will increase in future./City's environment is already threatened as a consequence of excessive population. Pollution will increase and water supply and sanitation facilities in Dhaka might collapse under the excessive pressure of city-dwellers. Unless migration is planned, Dhaka will turn into a city of ruins, where people will risk losing their living environment./Dhaka's air pollution scenario through vehicle emission, despite changeover to CNG-driven vehicles, is still the worst. Dhaka's sky is no longer blue, it is grey. Health experts claim that the air in this rapidly growing city will soon become impossible to breathe. Dhaka city dwellers are subjected to slow murder. The city's vehicle population has almost increased 10 times since 1992 as a result of the failure to introduce mass transport. Some 80 per cent of the vehicles are three wheelers, small buses of the old days and cars which spew more than half the major pollutants./Indeed, the situation relating to living conditions will become more precarious unless a plan is not immediately put in place to develop a smooth transport system and stop unplanned housing, said environmentalist groups. The city is beset with multiple problems. The common problems of Dhaka city are traffic jam, load shedding, water and sanitation, air pollution, accommodation crisis for its increasing population and many more. Most of them get media coverage from time to time. Regrettably, some get little attention when the problem is acute. Of them, accommodation problem has been severe over the past years as house rent has been doubled and in some cases tripled causing immense sufferings to the low and limited income people. Since the income of maximum people is not increasing keeping pace with ever-soaring price of essential commodities and house rent, it is getting difficult to survive for the poor city dwellers in the increasingly expensive Dhaka city. Hence, the number of slum dwellers bears the testimony to soaring house rent./There was a time when the authorities used to hang advertisements for population control all over the city in billboards and posters. Television channels and radio stations used to telecast or broadcast these as well. These are now seen nowhere. Is it then assumed that the nation is less concerned about the hyper increase in population today? The question is now creeping in everybody's mind whether it had been knowingly abandoned or not./The situation in Dhaka city is becoming alarming day by day. Joblessness, noxious emissions and toxic effluents from smoke belching vehicles have its life and living choking. Conscious citizenry have been focusing on human factors responsible for deterioration of environmental quality in the city life. One of the major threats to the city due to declining groundwater levels is land subsidence, which can be triggered by earthquakes of greater magnitudes. Recently, a series of earthquakes of magnitudes ranging from 4.0 to 5.2 on the Richter scale jolted Dhaka and other parts of the country. Although no damage to the infrastructure of the city was reported but there is a great potential of collapse of infrastructures and also of land subsidence associated with earthquakes./Only way to reverse the situation is to make outskirts of Dhaka and other towns the epicenters of growth, create employment opportunities, opening of educational institutions, medicare facilities, entertainment outlets like parks, cultural rendezvous of different denominations. Decentralisation of the administration has been long overdue with self-contained zones of habitats so that people do not have to travel long distances. Dhaka's civic governance should be radically improved by bringing into being a unified city authority./Without political commitment and its implementation, reform of any kind is, indeed, virtually impossible to achieve. To arrest the 'decline of Dhaka,' the country needs political will, public advocacy and civic pressure to create sustained awareness through the media./<a href=""mailto:szkhan@dhaka.net"">szkhan@dhaka.net</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Buriganga water: A poisonous mix of greed and corruption,"Dhaka, Sept. 18 -- Hundreds of years ago, the banks of the river Buriganga were a prime location for trade and tourism. It was the main waterway for trading and the main source of drinking water for the residents of Dhaka city./Now the Buriganga river is afflicted with multiple pollutions. It is nothing but a crematory. The chemical waste of mills and factories, sewerage, human waste, polluted water, rubbish, domestic wastes, medical wastes, birds and animals carcasses, polythene, oil and grease, along with all sorts of liquid and hard wastes of riverine vessels, are being discharged into the water of Buriganga mindlessly. Moreover, Dhaka city produces about 4,500 tonnes of solid waste every day and most of it is dumped into the Buriganga./According to the Department of Environment (DoE), 20,000 tonnes of tannery wastes are released into the river every day including some highly toxic materials. Nine industrial units in and around the capital city, Tongi, Tejgaon, Hazaribagh, Tarabo, Narayanganj, Savar, Gazipur, Dhaka Export Processing Zone and Ghorashal are the prime sources of river pollution. Most of the industrial units of these areas have no effluent treatment plants of their own./More than 60,000 cubic metres of toxic wastes including textile dye, paints, laundry waste water and chemicals are released into the main water bodies of Dhaka every day./On the other hand, appropriate system of removing waste of the river is absent. As a result, the collected garbage is piled on the bank of the Buriganga instead of burying it in the waste dumping grounds. The sun dries up the dirt and wind carries it back to the river. This filth is the host of many deadly diseases like diarrhoea, cholera etc. Nearly 4.0 million people of the city are exposed to the consequences of water pollution every day./Besides, huge amount of fruits, vegetables and fish are carried to Dhaka through Swarighat of the river. The rotten portion of these fish is thrown into the river without any concern for the growing level of pollution of the water river. The river is now seriously polluted from domestic and industrial wastes and the polythene contributes to the shallowness of the river. Thus, the Buriganga is dying gradually and has become an environmental nightmare./Water bodies act as kidney for the city through which it releases its daily waste. According to environmental scientists, a city must have 10 per cent water bodies of its landed area. They add that such water bodies absorb some amount of sound, air pollutions and contribute to the storage of the ground water. Evidences were found that Buriganga is recharging the ground water with its poisonous mix. Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Bangladesh at 41,"Bangladesh, Dec. 12 -- The gentleman is my childhood buddy. After the college, he went to East Europe for higher studies, then to Canada; got married to a Central American lady and he is now settled in New Zealand. In the past, whenever he visited Dhaka, he used to carry a large suitcase full of mineral water and another suitcase with liquid milk for his accompanying kids. He didn't believe, Bangladesh could produce anything good or more importantly fit for his kids. At times, I get in touch with him over social network and he has not changed his negative opinion about Bangladesh till date- on issues such as ever-widening differences between the government and the opposition, possible climate change impact on Bangladesh, Dhaka being one of the most unlivable city, air pollution, sound pollution and what not. I can tell you- he is never going to come back, rather he would tell all of us- 'it is high time to leave Bangladesh'./Not only my buddy; Bangladesh with 'weak governance' 'lack of political accountability', 'high corruption', 'not so good education quality', 'weak infrastructure' and 'capacity issues seen among civil bureaucracy and even the leading institutions' remains to be a 'paradox' to many in the west as well as far east. However, the other side of the coin is-the country recorded a GDP growth averaging almost 5.5 per cent per year for the last thirty years. Poverty has reduced by almost 10 per cent in 5 years ending in 2010. Despite natural calamities and loss of agricultural land to infrastructures, river bank erosion, industrialisationer, the country is almost self-sufficient in food and rather surplus with rice production. Child and maternal mortality has declined significantly and access to sanitation and drinking water showed marked improvement. More kids are going to the school, real wages in the rural Bangladesh has increased manifold and there are more money pouring in from non-resident Bangladeshi (NBRs) and exports./We were discussing among friends on our country's progress made so far. While many of my friends, gave credit to inward remittance, productivity improvement in agriculture, economic liberalization since the nineties, success of our apparel industry, some others attributed the success to the shift in global political and economic imperatives, change in the economic structure of our society, role of the development partners, significant role played by education and overseas travel as well as migration by more Bangladeshis, than one could anticipate. A few of them also listed reasons at such as lessons learned from famine in 1974, improvement in the communications infrastructure, especially increase of cell phone users./Most of the developed nations and international aid agencies barely had any interest in getting engaged in Bangladesh during the early seventies. However, Bangladesh managed to march on, despite natural disasters and political turbulence at frequent intervals. But as it progresses, one of its core productive sectors, agriculture, started to get overshadowed by industrialisation./In 1974, with a famine that lasted for ten months, food security became a high priority. After more than a decade, the cloud finally began to move away as food production started to gain momentum. Most of this success can be traced to the introduction of high-yielding modern varieties (MV) of rice. Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) has so far released fifty-seven MVs (53 inbred and 4 hybrids). The MVs developed in the 1980s and 1990s are suitable for varying ecosystems and have wide disease and insect resistance./In the meantime, readymade garments (RMG) industry started to emerge slowly yet noticeably and pushed industrialization to further dominate the country's GDP. From the '90s to 2010, industrial production occupied a new height at 30 per cent of GDP, whereas agricultural slipped to below 20 per cent./Enhanced access to education, especially primary education, greatly helped to achieve gender balance, impacting both social and economic activities. This, along with continuous reduction in poverty and improved health service, illustrated a changed landscape for Bangladesh./The 1974 famine also pushed people, especially in rural Bangladesh, to look for increasing their earnings; hence they started to look out for overseas job markets, especially in the Middle East. Today, more than 8.0 million Bangladeshis are working abroad and inward remittances, mostly from the blue collar workers, has become the mainstay of our economy, more importantly rural economy; rural economy receiving an average of USD 10 billion equivalent extra money annually through this channel./The wind of change all over certainly started moving things positively; starting from the change in public mindset to policy makers. For more than two decades after the liberation war, the female population was confined to household affairs. This huge workforce slowly but surely came to realize their potential in the early '90s. The trend became too important not to be overlooked by various international aid agencies or development partners, when 60-70 per cent of the female population gradually started to contribute towards national GDP. On the other hand, the agricultural sector also managed to maintain noticeable growth./We saw the spectacular rise of Bangladesh entrepreneurship during 1985 to 2010. Small and medium enterprises (SME) improved the situation to a great extent. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and microfinance institutions (MFIs) played a significant role in facilitating rural entrepreneurship. Report says there are almost 50 large business houses with USD 500 million- 1.0 billion turnover a year/Changed global development imperatives, including change in the mindset of the seniors at the development agencies, also helped Bangladesh to reshape its development agenda, continuously creating opportunity for private sector operators to get into the 'control panel'. Even the rise of the media (print and electronic, more importantly electronic ones) helped in shaping the people's mindset, transition to democracy and crises management, especially during the last decade or so. Almost 72 per cent of the populace have been brought under television coverage and they are now more integrated into what is happening around. FM Radio, Internet, online papers and social media are also on the rise, helping the society to march forward in an informed way. Bangladesh also managed to significantly improve her crisis management capability over the years./No matter, what few pessimists say; we need to move on, need to move faster than before to keep its over 150 million people fed. 7.0 to 8.0 per cent GDP growth necessitates massive investment in the manufacturing sector, and for that we need power, gas, roads, railways, bridges and other infrastructures. Whatever happening, we can't lose out on the inward remittance side; our domestic investment must continue to meet the rising domestic demand and expansion of the market. At the same time, government must not shy away from quality public spending and continue its search for newer avenues for increasing revenue earnings./We should be able to draw a balance between the agriculture, industry and manufacturing sectors without losing sight of the human capital development and ensuring the best from our employees through better industrial relations and encouraging environment. We also need to strengthen local government, civil administration and the judiciary. In order to get into the trajectory of a middle income country, the list should also include improving overall health and education infrastructure, and access to international funding sources to finance large infrastructures. And added to all these, we need a peaceful political transition and politics of tolerance and mutual respect. Long Live Bangladesh./(Mamun Rashid is a banker and economic analyst. /<a href=""mailto:E-mail:mrashid1961@gmail.com"">E-mail:mrashid1961@gmail.com</a>/) Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Environmental pollution rises in China,"Bangladesh, Jan. 15 -- Beijing was blanketed in a thick, foul-smelling layer of hazardous smog over the last weekend that pushed air quality readings well off the charts and prompted environmentalists to call it the worst air pollution on record in the city./The air quality in China's capital, home to an estimated 20m people, was consistently designated as hazardous by both the Chinese government and a monitoring station maintained by the US Embassy throughout the last weekend and people were advised not to go outside./At its worst last Saturday night the volume of toxic harmful particulates in the air was 36 times the level recommended as safe by World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines./China has relatively strict environmental and emission laws but it also has the worst environmental pollution on earth thanks to an almost complete lack of enforcement and the subordination of environmental concerns to the imperative for officials to register economic growth./State media said the toxic mixture of fog, coal fumes, car exhaust, construction dust and industrial emissions was likely to hang around for days thanks to atmospheric conditions that had trapped the smog over the city and stopped it from being blown elsewhere./Residents who went outside complained of sore throats, stinging eyes, chest pain, headaches and an apocalyptic atmosphere in which the tops of low rise buildings were barely discernible through the haze./At one hospital on the edge of Beijing the head nurse, who asked not to be named, told the FT that the respiratory ward was overflowing throughout the last weekend even though the hospital had doubled the size of its respiratory unit last year./""This is the worst level of air pollution on record in Beijing according to both the official Chinese government data and that published by the US embassy,"" said Zhou Rong, climate and air quality spokeswoman for Greenpeace in Beijing./She said the main source of the pollution was the intensive burning of coal in power plants and in people's homes across northern China as the region is gripped by a severe cold snap. Multinational companies and diplomatic missions based in Beijing consider the capital's shocking levels of air pollution one of the main obstacles in attracting high-quality expatriate personnel, especially those with young families, and some already provide industrial air filtering machines in the homes of employees./Pollution and food safety are also important issues identified by wealthy Chinese emigrants as reasons for them to leave the country./In recent years China's growing wealth has been accompanied by a rising awareness of the health hazards of environmental pollution, particularly among the middle class./Serious environmental degradation has become an increasing cause of unrest and protest in places where it has affected people's health and the Chinese government has often tried to obfuscate or conceal the extent of industrial pollution in the past./Environmental activists in Beijing won an important victory last year when the government agreed to monitor the levels of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, something the US Embassy in Beijing had already been doing for a number of years using its own equipment./These particulates are considered the most hazardous because they are small enough to enter the bloodstream and cause serious damage to lung tissue./At the last weekend, the government said the highest reading it recorded was 900 micrograms of these particles per square metre, compared with a scale that usually only goes up to 500 and classifies anything above 300 as ""severely polluted"" and ""hazardous""./A level below 50 is usually considered healthy.

Promoting the cause of green brick,"Bangladesh, March 15 -- Brick is a beautiful and durable material that lasts for a very long time. It is the first masonry material used in construction of roads, bridges, buildings and the like. There has been a big advancement in the global brick industry. Green bricks have arrived. Concerned authorities in Bangladesh also have started striving to promote the use of green bricks. But unfortunately, Bangladesh is still grappling with problems like illegal brick kilns, use of firewood for brick baking, brickfields on cropland and the loss of top soil and cutting of hills blamed on brick manufacturing./The Brickfield Owners' Association has claimed that the number of brick kilns may be around 8,000 in Bangladesh. But environmentalists say it would be no fewer than 15,000. These brick kilns set up in densely-populated areas are posing a threat to the natural environment, as a large number of them are not complying with the related laws. A large number of them lack the standard height as required by the related law while many others do not have the clearances from the Department of Environment (DoE)./The Brick Baking (Control) Act, 1989, amended in 2001, strictly prohibits establishment of brickfields within the vicinity of municipal and residential areas or on cultivable land. But bricks are being manufactured in these kilns by burning firewood and thus causing a big loss of revenue to the government. Furthermore, the smoke emitted from brick kilns causes respiratory problems and asthma in children and elderly people in nearby areas. Toxic smoke from brickfields is affecting fruit-bearing trees and forests./According to a UNDP survey, these brickfields cause air pollution, land degradation and deforestation. Some of the brickfields have been using topsoil for producing bricks leaving vast tracts of land infertile. Once topsoil is taken away from a piece of land, no crop can be grown there for several years./An order was issued on December 31 last to the effect of green brick manufacturing. Again a notification was circulated by the Department of Environment (DoE) Director General Monowar Islam, which said illegal brickfields must be closed or removed by June 30 next in the public interest./Bangladesh has adopted smokeless brick making technology introduced by the UN Development Programme. The innovative technology that is being used to replace the existing century-old system will make brick manufacturing more environment-friendly in Bangladesh. Green brick is already being manufactured in different areas of the country. This technology requires less human intervention than the traditional. Lower loss of firewood, less use of coal, low demand for clay, low human intervention etc. are the different good sides to green brick manufacturing. A study suggests that any green brick kiln producing 50,000 bricks daily need maximum 60 labourers. Different banks have already started providing loans for establishment of green brick kilns with a repayment period of five years./However, the government needs to sensitise the people by creating awareness against traditional kilns and make the technology simply available to the brick manufacturers. The media can come forward to encourage the people to use green bricks. Entrepreneurs should also be encouraged to make more investment in this particular area. On the other hand, banks should provide long-term loans and simplify the loan procedures and thus help promote the use of green bricks./<a href=""mailto:shahana_bilkis@yahoo.com"">shahana_bilkis@yahoo.com</a>/ Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Corporate Environmental Responsibility: Who cares?,"Bangladesh, Aug. 4 -- Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh like many other mega cities of the world sees a good number of development works every year but environmental havoc created due to such development projects gives a broad grin to the much talked theme on 'green living'./If anyone visits the on-going large construction of flyovers and other development projects in any part of the city or the country, he or she could see the onslaught of environmental havoc due to the air pollution caused by dust and mud./The chock-a-block Jatrabari-Gulistan flyover construction area is the best example where thousands of people face the worst experience while commuting through this area every day since the biggest project undertaken under the Public-Private Partnership began three years back./The Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) of the stakeholders involved with such project actually shows their 'rude feeling' on the theme, a part of the broader area of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)./""If the authority keeps the construction materials clean, wrap them with simple papers or sack-cloth or polythene papers, the environment remains less polluted, but who cares,"" said Md Zahirul Quayuum, a local inhabitant./Some 1.0 million people live in the surrounding areas of the flyover project and the environmental havoc rubbed salt into their wound./The CER of the stakeholders of the flyover project gives a broad grin to the theme when Communication Minister Obaidul Quader himself termed the project 'an embarrassment.'/""Though it's not a project under the communication ministry, it's an embarrassment for all of us, mainly because of the concerned officials refusing to get out of their hibernation,"" the minister said after a meeting held at the ministry's conference room recently./A significant part of the nine-kilometre flyover remains unfinished. The project has given rise to heavy traffic congestion, muddy and broken walkways and random bus stoppages in the surrounding areas./Similarly, a good initiative taken by a telecom company at Hatirjheel project in the capital is yet to reap the full benefit because of mindless construction works inside the newly-opened public space. Around 4,500 saplings of various categories are being planted at selected spots in Hatirjheel area but everyday a good number of trucks carry tonnnes of soil and thus hamper the afforestation drive inside the newly-built space considered as one of the finest and rarest civic facilities Dhaka dwellers have ever had./""Trucks carrying the soil and mud should be banned to ply inside the area and if necessary, wheels of the mud-carrying trucks should also be cleaned ahead of entering the paved roads,"" Nazrul Islam, an environment-conscious student of nearby East West University said./The 302-acre Hatirjheel project scheme offers an aesthetic public space including wetlands, eye-catching fancily illuminated stylish bridges, overpasses, walkways, gardening, plantation, leisure benches and viewing decks giving an exotic aura./The student who lives nearby the project area said everyday he counts at least five trucks carry the sticky earth inside the area and thus disgrace the 'enduring beauty space' opened only few weeks ago./When contacted, a project official told this correspondent that since it was the rainy season, the mud would be washed away naturally! He, however kept mum whether the wheels of the trucks could be cleaned after picking up the soil loads./Environment and Forests Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud, however recently said the government has initiated a 'massive campaign' along with policy initiative and formulation of a new law to reduce air pollution./""We are implementing a number of projects to control and prevent air pollution for protecting our environment,"" he told the 7th regional stakeholders meeting cum coordination meeting of Male Declaration on control and prevention of air pollution and its likely trans boundary effects for South Asia in a city hotel./The Minister said owners of the brick kilns have been asked to adopt new technology by the end of this year aiming to reduce air pollution./Brick kilns are responsible for 30 percent air pollution in the country, he said adding 60 percent energy of brick kilns will be saved, if brick burning is done using modern technology instead of traditional methods./According to a recent study, Brick kilns are the most dominant source of air pollution in the country while vehicular emissions have been identified as the second largest contributor to air pollution./There are about 5000 brick kilns in Bangladesh, which are largely responsible for air pollution, and increasing number of vehicles is creating concomitant pressure on air quality, it added./In Bangladesh, about 132,000 premature deaths are caused annually due to air pollution, experts said adding indoor air pollution is responsible for 70 percent premature deaths./According to the World Bank, up to 10 percent of respiratory infections and diseases in Bangladesh may be attributable to urban air pollution./In another example of giving a broad grin to CER, the BGMEA (Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association) Building in Dhaka threatened a network of lakes that form the natural drainage system of Dhaka city./The tower surrounded by water, accessible by a small bridge reflects the poor commitment of many of the garment owners' towards CER./It is a symbol of the power of Bangladesh's garment industry, the headquarters of the country's most powerful association of garment company owners. It is illegal, according to Bangladesh High Court which said that the land had been illegally obtained, the building had been erected without proper approvals. The High Court called the building ""a scam of abysmal proportions"" and ordered it demolished within 90 days./That was two years ago. The building still stands. The case is now in a legal limbo - more proof, according to critics, of the power of the BGMEA Members control the engine of the national economy - garment exports to the United States and Europe. Many serve in Parliament or own television stations and newspapers./""You can't put the fox in charge of the chickens,"" said Rizwana Hasan, an environmental lawyer. ""BGMEA has no regulatory authority under the laws of the country. It's a clubhouse of the garment industry.""/Environmentalists have long protested and argued that the building's location on a de facto island inside a city lake impedes the natural drainage network and contributes to flooding in the capital during the monsoon./Illegalities abounded, according to the High Court ruling: construction started before the group had won final approval on a building plan; the land transfer from a government agency violated national laws on usage of public land. Yet the group's leaders argue that the building's status has been validated at the highest level: two prime ministers led different inauguration ceremonies at the site./""It is not illegal,"" said Annisul Huq, a former BGMEA president. ""We have applied to the government for the land. The government has given us the land. Two prime ministers have opened it.""/For now, the case is stalled. The Supreme Court is supposed to hold a final hearing, but with elections coming, the government has shown little interest in confronting the country's most powerful industrial body which fetches around 75 per cent of Bangladesh's annual export earnings. It is unclear if a hearing will take place./""It has gone to the Supreme Court,"" Annisul Huq said. ""That could take forever. It is Bangladesh. We have full trust - as long as they give a verdict in our favour.""/Shah Md Ahsan Habib, a Professor and Director [Training] of Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM) while talking to this correspondent on CER said in Bangladesh, a very few corporate entities are found to have notable initiatives on the theme. As a sector, the initiatives of the banking sector are remarkable./""In Bangladesh, we have formulated a number of regulations and policy documents. However, enforcements of all these are very weak. So, weak enforcement of regulation and absence of appropriate incentive structure [both positive and negative] are the main obstacles on establishing CER,"" Mr Ahsan Habib said./Replying to a question on CER affect on industrial development, Mr Ahsan Habib said in the short run it may not but in the long run all sectors as a whole will be affected. Rather if we adopt clean technology in all sectors then some sectors and economy as a whole may be even negatively affected. Thus, we have to identify the right areas where we should focus our attention. However, for promoting exports in developed countries we are to follow some environmental standards. Otherwise, our trade may be affected./Some notable initiatives taken by companies, institutions/Bangladesh Bank (BB), the central bank of the country is upholding financing flows to output and employment generating SMEs, and to green initiatives like renewable (solar/biogas's based) energy generation, effluent treatment, adoption of energy efficient, emission minimizing in-house practices an processes in banks and financial institutions themselves./Bangladesh Bank has established a new department on Green Banking and Corporate Social Responsibility to take this socially and environmentally financing forward in line with global expectations./Md. Touhidul Alam Khan, Team Leader of Green Banking Unit of Bank Asia Limited said Bangladesh Bank issued a circular on 27th February, 2011 on Policy Guideline for Green Banking towards banks stating ""to adopt a comprehensive Green Banking Policy in a formal and structured manner in line with the global norms so as to protect environment degradation and ensure sustainable banking practices"". In line with the instructions of Bangladesh Bank, all banks are supposed to take initiatives to formulate its Green Banking Policy with an aim to inculcate practices towards optimum usage of natural resources and make every effort for environmentally friendly activities./As per circular of Bangladesh Bank, banks are to implement Green Banking guidelines under three phases: Phase I, Phase II and Phase III. Phase I and Phase II has been successfully completed and most of the banks are undergoing Phase III at this point of stage. In Phase III, banks and financial institutions are supposed to design and introduce innovative products and reporting to be performed in internationally acclaimed standard formats like GRI and Triple Bottom Line Reporting as part of their Phase III activities. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a non-profit organization that works towards a sustainable global economy by providing sustainability reporting guidance./By this time, some financial institutions including Bank Asia has already published Sustainable Report reportedly under GRI Guidelines to start the process initially as per Green Banking circular by Bangladesh Bank./Grameen Shakti reached its first landmark of one million Solar Home Systems (SHS) installation in the rural areas of the country on November 30, 2012./Grameen Shakti (GS) is the first in the world to install solar home systems in a million homes.

Should Dhaka go back to days of terrible air pollution?,"Bangladesh, Sept. 16 -- It was not long ago when Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, used to remain covered by a thick blanket of smog from early morning to midnight. Motor vehicles of all types, particularly two-stroke three wheelers and passenger buses, used to exhaust liquid fuel-burnt fumes contributing to severe pollution of air of the city. On the streets the pedestrians had to inhale a pungent smelling air all the time and the incidence of respiratory tract related diseases was very high then./Thousands of pedestrians and drivers of motor vehicles were seen wearing masks to avoid inhaling of polluted air. On occasions, the department of environment carried out drives to catch black fume-emitting motor vehicles and punish their owners and drivers./That situation does not exist anymore. Though the city's air is not totally pollution-free but it is far cleaner now. Not many people wear masks while traveling through city streets these days./The use of one particular fuel-- compressed natural gas (CNG) has largely contributed to a radical improvement in air quality of Dhaka city. A strong campaign launched by the government in the late eighties and early 90s to switch over to CNG use and soaring prices of fuel oils have motivated the operators of motor vehicles to use the green fuel extensively./The government had published advertisements in newspapers asking people to convert their motor vehicles into CNG-run ones and thus avoid air pollution and bring down their fuel bills. As part of the motivational campaign, the Rupantarito Parkritik Gas Prokolpo, a project of the Petrobangla, the state-owned petroleum corporation offered CNG conversion at an affordable rate, payable in instalments./This official approach led to the emergence of a large number of CNG conversion workshop in the private sector and more and more vehicles switched over to CNG use. This switchover has not only helped the vehicle owners save money but also helped the country to cut its fuel oil import bill./But of late the government has apparently changed its stance on the use of CNG by motor vehicle. It has hiked the CNG price by more then 300 per cent since 2007-08, much to the annoyance of the consumers. Moreover, the government leaders tend to demonstrate a sort of intolerance towards the owners of motor vehicles using CNG./The change of attitude of the government may be due to the frustration emanating from the current dismal energy situation. In the late eighties and early 90s, the administration had an impression that the country was floating on gas. But when it became clear that the gas reserve would be exhausted within a few years unless new discoveries are made, the administration decided to modify its stance./But will the changed stance be helpful, in terms of consumers' welfare and pollution-free environment of Dhaka city? Certainly not./The cost of running motor vehicles, including those being used as public transports, would go up if CNG is made pricier or supply of CNG discontinued. When most cities across the world are trying to keep their air pollution-free, the discontinuation of CNG use by vehicles would not only lead to Dhaka's return to old days of severe air pollution but also make the situation even worse./For the last two decades, the number of motor vehicles in Dhaka city has increased manifold and if those are made to go back to the days of liquid fuel use, one can well imagine the extent of air pollution in Dhaka city. Given the maintenance level of passenger buses, trucks and other public transports, the air pollution in the event of their reverting to liquid fuel use could reach a nightmarish level./There is no denying that the diminishing prospect of finding new gas reserves has made policymakers worried about the country's energy situation. On the priority list of their gas use are power plants and fertilizer factories for obvious reasons. Industries and household consumption comes next. With the current supply situation, the government is finding it difficult to meet the demand from all these areas. If it wants to meet the demand of one particular sector fully, others remain gas-starved. That is the dilemma the government is now experiencing./Since natural gas, even if it is imported in condensed form, remains a cheap source of energy, the government should consider importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to save money and meet demands from various sectors./<a href=""mailto:zahidmar10@gmail.com"">zahidmar10@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

The brunt of a coal-fired power plant,"Bangladesh, Oct. 1 -- Bangladesh is a small country of 147,570 sqkm areas with a large population of 160 million, located on a vulnerable geographic plane. The density of population of the country is the highest in the world. The country has already been facing the dreadful effects of climate change and global warming in various shades and forms. Geologists, ecologists and social scientists are concerned about the likely affects of climatic and environmental degeneration that may have a serious toll on the over all socio-economic fabric of the country./In this critical and environmentally dangerous situation, building a coal-fired power plant at Rampal near the Sundarbans appears to be suicidal. The Sundarbans, one of the largest mangrove forests in the region, comprises 10,000 sqkm of which approximately 6000 sqkm is within Bangladesh territory. It is also home to a large variety of wild life including species that are facing extinction. There are plenty of water bodies, rivers mainly, snaking in and around the forest range which are a great source of aquatic resources. Experts are unanimous that the coal-fired power plant, if built as planned by the government, would cause a colossal disaster to the forest belt which is also regarded as a natural protection against floods and cyclonic storms./It is true, global energy demand is constantly rising, and given the limited options, coal remains relatively cheaper compared to oil and gas. While coal is a promising resource from an economic standpoint, it has significant environmental impact. For example, a large coal-powered plant producing 1000 megawatts of power can supply electricity to 1.6 million households. But at the same time, it also discharges about 6.0 million tons of carbon per year, equivalent to the emissions from 2.0 million automobiles. Besides carbon emission, there are other extremely serious emissions and discharges that can cause havoc to environment, human, animal and plant life./Fly ash, for example, is no mean threat. Fly ash is one of the residues generated in combustion and comprises the fine particles that rise with the flue gases. Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is generally collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify while suspended in the exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in sizes from 0.5 A micrometreto 100 A micrometre. Fly ashes are generally highly heterogeneous, consisting of a mixture of glassy particles. Fly ash contains trace concentrations of heavy metals and other substances that are known to be seriously detrimental to health./In 2004, the Clean Air Task Force commissioned a study to quantify the deaths and other health effects attributable to the fine particle pollution from coal-fired power plants. The report found that over 13,000 deaths each year are attributed to fine particle pollution from U.S. power plants. In addition, fine particle pollution is also responsible for several hundred thousand asthma attacks every year. Those who are most ruthlessly affected are the children and the elderly living in close proximity to the coal-fired power plants. There are stringent health effects caused by burning of coal. According to a report issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), effects of coal driven pollution are estimated to shorten 1,000,000 lives annually worldwide./Environmental impact of the coal-fired plant includes air pollution, atmospheric pollution as well as water pollution. Coal burning produces hundreds of millions of solid wastes such as fly ash, bottom ash, flue-gas sludge that contains mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic and other heavy metals. An average 170 pounds of mercury is made by one coal-fired power plant every year. When 1/70 of a teaspoon of mercury is put into a 50 acre lake, it can make the aquatic elements unsafe for human consumption. Generally, a large coal-fired plant generates 3,700,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually and this is one of the main causes of global warming. A single coal plant can create 10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide that may cause acid rain damaging forests, lakes, canals, ponds and surrounding houses. A medium size coal plant creates 720 tons of carbon monoxide that causes headaches and places stress on people with heart diseases./Generally a 500 megawatt coal-fired power plant draws 2.2 billion gallons of water from the nearby water reserves which is enough to support 250,000 people. Rampal plant with the capacity of 1,300 megawatts would consume at least 4.5 billion gallons of water which can support 600,000 people./When world leaders are planning and moving forward to switch over to renewable green energy from the old and traditional anti-environment energy sources, Bangladeshi policy-makers are moving backward to adopt old and traditional energy generation by building coal-fired power plant close to a forest belt. From facts and figures revealed by researchers and various organisations including the UN Bodies, it is more than clear that Bangladesh being the most populous country in the world can in no way undertake coal-fired power plant to generate energy. It appears that the policy-makers only considered the cost of energy produced from the coal-fired plant and did not consider its devastating effects on a wide ranging sphere of environmental, human and wildlife aspects./Human comfort is definitely less important than saving human lives from the death-trap. The concerned authorities should come forward and review the project in terms of cost-benefit ratio, social and environmental costs, health hazards, sustenance of the Sundarbans and other related matters, before taking a further move to go for the plant at Rampal. Reducing the cost of energy at the cost of irremediable sufferings of the people and damage to the country must not be justified as a rational proposition./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Environmental health risks in S Asia,"Bangladesh, Dec. 14 -- About one quarter of the diseases worldwide can be accredited to environmental causes, with 40 per cent of the sufferers being children under five. Among the ten most significant dangers to the developing countries with high mortality rate are unsafe water and sanitation and hygiene problems. Just about 80 per cent of each and every type of infectious diseases is caused by unclean water. Globally, 1.1 billion people lack access to safe water supply and 2.4 billion to adequate sanitation. In East Asia and the Pacific, 48 per cent of the population have access to improved hygiene while in South Asia, merely 37 per cent have such access. Inadequate water and insufficient hygiene lead to ill health and increase scarcity. Those who lack a reasonably priced and sufficient amount of irrigation supply are usually the poorest in a society./Over 200 million people in nine Asian countries, more often than not living in rural areas, are at risk of arsenicosis, cancer and eventual death from the long-term use of groundwater infected with arsenic. Arsenic toxicity has a pervasive effect on all systems in the body and long-term consequences on children, slowing their cognitive expansion and cerebral ability. There is no known medical cure for arsenicosis. The only sure way of preventing arsenicosis is to avoid drinking impure water. Furthermore, extreme fluoride in water causes dental and skeletal fluorosis./In the Asian and Pacific area, indoor air contamination poses the uppermost health risk. Contact to smoke from solid fuel like wood, dung, coal and agricultural remains increases the amount of contamination. Women and children are the most at risk. Indoor air pollution causes an accumulation of pollutants, such as coarse and fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, benzene, toluene and formaldehyde, in the bodies of those exposed to indoor air pollution. Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between indoor air toxic waste and respiratory infections, TB, cancers, low birth weight and greater infant and perinatal mortality. Lead emissions are also a serious problem in the region. Lead is found in rice, vegetables and drinking water, leading to high levels of lead in the blood./Apart from its instant toxic and carcinogenic effects, air contaminations affect the environment and health in other ways. Some air pollutants descend as acid rain. Acid rain causes ecological degradation which impacts ecosystems, increasing health hazards. Ozone depletion, associated with use of ozone-depleting chemicals, is expected to augment UV-B radiation, resultant in the oppression of immune systems and skin cancer. In South East Asia, 70 million people are seasonally affected by air pollution due to forest fire. A lot of agricultural practices leach pesticides, fertilisers and additional chemicals into air and water. A number of pesticides are associated with cancers, miscarriages and inborn malformations. Agrochemical poisoning and agro-machinery accidents cause diseases, injuries and death that are underreported./Small-scale farmers are especially vulnerable to the exposure to chemical fertilisers and pesticides that are widely used in the region, and to equipment-related hazards aggravated by sustained hard physical labour with old and poorly maintained gear./A lot of new infectious diseases have emerged because viruses have jumped the species fence from flora and fauna to humans. Undeveloped production systems, in particular intensive animal husbandry in densely populated areas, with livestock in close proximity to humans, are the perfect breeding ground for new diseases. SARS as well as avian influenza are fresh examples. These diseases affect not only humans, but also flora and fauna and vegetation. They also threaten food safety and livelihood. Thus, these diseases have themselves turned out to be drivers of environmental alteration./A notorious issue in foodstuff production is the use of genetically modified organisms. There is vigorous global debate on the large-scale use of genetically modified organisms in developed countries when their long-term penalty on human health has not been well-known. The sell of foodstuff from genetically modified crops has caused anxiety. Plastic is extensively used for wrapping food. Many plastics hold toxic chemicals, including biocides, colourings and flexibility-enhancing agents known as plasticisers. These substances could be released if ingested. Vast quantities of microscopic plastic fragments are building up in oceans. The accumulation of plastic wreckage in parts of the central Pacific Ocean is six times greater than that of resident plankton, the very foundation of the food chain. There is indication that plastic debris is being ingested by marine organisms and might go into the food chain./Haphazard waste disposal is a chief health danger. Non-biodegradable plastic waste constitutes a main part of waste. Plastic floats in water; it accumulates and absorbs toxic hydrophobic chemicals from other sources. Artificial waste also clogs sewerage systems, causing severe hygiene problems. In spite of some progresses made since the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste came into force, large amounts of hazardous waste, including electronic waste, are still exported to developing countries in the region. Recycling is often absent and the burning of plastic and dumping are ordinary. The region's poor are exposed to lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium, beryllium, cadmium and brominated flame retardants that are set free in these processes. The unsafe disposal of hazardous domestic medical and manufacturing waste poses severe health risk to people in the region. Governments in the region should pay serious attention to ecological health./Dr Mohammad Rajja is a medical doctor serving with Narayani Sub-Regional Hospital, Birgunj, Nepal.

Rising pollution in developing economies: Investing in low-carbon growth technologies,"Bangladesh, Jan. 24 -- Dhaka city at present is witnessing usual traffic congestions. It indicates that the routine life is back after prolonged political unrest coupled with blockades and strikes. Dhaka, one of the most populous cities of the world, is also infamous for its alarmingly high level of pollution. And a large part of Dhaka's population is involved in the process of marketing goods and services to meet the global market demand./The World Health Organisation (WHO) sources report that Dhaka has been among the most polluted cities compared to the air quality in other mega cities of the world. Especially during the November-March period of the year the air quality of the city deteriorates and reaches the alarmingly high level - at some places with the pollution level reaching up to 274 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic metres of air. The Department of Environment (DoE) officials say the allowable limit of particles is 2.5 micrograms of the matters to 65 micrograms and the allowable sizes of the particles are 10 micrograms to 150 micrograms as per the standards. Hospitals and medical practitioners get during this period of the year an increased number of complaints about respiratory problems including asthma and other bronchial diseases in the urban areas of the country. Experts blame vehicular emissions, emissions from brick kilns, construction activities, dry soil condition, low relative humidity, scanty rainfall and low northwesterly winds are the reasons for the deterioration of air quality in Dhaka during winter. In addition, re-suspension of road dusts from traffic, open burning of materials like leather and tyre, and industrial sources such as cement manufacturing and metal melting also contribute to increased dusts and air pollution in Dhaka and other major cities in Bangladesh. Experts suggest that the excessive pollution may cause premature birth and weaken the immunity system of small children. The air pollution also plays its role in increasing the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere and the global warming./Unfortunately, during the dry season of the year Dhaka is not alone facing the high level of air pollution. A number of Chinese cities were again hit by record-high levels of air pollution and as per the Guardian report published on January 20, the authorities in China advised their residents, especially children and the elderly people, to stay indoors to avoid the hazards due to the alarmingly high levels of air pollution there. In these cities pollution levels in the air have reached almost 20 times higher than the permissible limit by the WHO. As per the report, on January 17 morning, the levels of very fine (2.5-microgram size particulates) particulates reached around 500 micrograms per cubic metres in the Chinese capital Beijing. High levels of air pollution have become a regular phenomenon in Beijing and many other major cities of China during the winter inviting a prolonged dense layer of smog for days at a time. The Chinese government has announced that the air pollution problem has been taken very seriously and a plan to improve the air quality by 2017 has been undertaken with specific targets set for the pollution-hit cities./In a separate report the Guardian on the same day said, quoting a source of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that were warming the planet earth 'grew 2.2 per cent per year on an average between 2000 and 2010, compared with 1.3 per cent per year from 1970 to 2000.' And interestingly it was found by the scientists that the major drivers of the increased pollution were 'a sharp rise in economic growth and a steady growth in the world's population.' The further alarming information the IPCC reveals is that 'a growing share of carbon dioxide emission from fossil fuel combustion in developing countries is released in the production of goods and services exported.'/A UN draft report found that 'the world's richest countries is increasing outsourcing their carbon pollution to China and other rising economies' and the products manufactured in these countries have been satisfying the market demands of the developed countries. Thus more and more pollution comes from the developing countries compared to industries in the USA and Europe. Experts consider that the conventional ways of accounting for emissions typically based on national inventory sources of pollution therefore may not give the total picture of the emission growth trends. The World Resource Institute experts advocate the need for understanding the 'full life of all the goods and services that we are purchasing and selling.'/There is a growing debate on the impact of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries, especially in the countries of rising economies, due to the trends, changed lifestyles and increasing consumptions. The newly-accumulated wealth made a good section of the population rich in the countries like India, China, Brazil and South Africa. These newly rich people have been consuming more goods, buying new cars and maintaining 'elite' lifestyles. By doing so their contribution to pollution grows. The middle income countries are recording a gradual rise in emissions. However, their per capita pollution and greenhouse gas emission remain well below the emission rates in the USA and Europe./Various international conferences and climate negotiations are repeatedly calling for global initiatives to ensure investments in low carbon economies' development. But to attain such a goal significant investments are required in developing appropriate technology and converting the existing carbon-intensive production processes to low carbon, but sustainable, production processes. The Guardian on January 17 last reported that the global annual investment was currently about US$ 1.2 trillion. For producing non-carbon (renewable) energy sources approximately US$ 147 billion would be required to be invested a year./Therefore, the developed economies need to demonstrate their willingness to invest in low-carbon growth technology in the developing countries. But so far we see a tendency to outsource the production and carbon pollution to get an unhindered supply of goods and services from developing countries./The author is a mining engineer and writes on energy and environment issues./<a href=""mailto:mushfiq41@yahoo.com"">mushfiq41@yahoo.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Making Dhaka a liveable city,"Bangladesh, Jan. 26 -- A survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), a prestigious research wing of the London-based weekly Economist, has again described Dhaka as the most unliveable city in the world. Last year, the position went to Syria's capital Damascus./The survey was based on crime incidents, threats, health service, censorship, communications system, temperature and education of the cities of the world. The EIU published 100 indicators where Dhaka's rating point is 38.7. Port Moresby city of Papua New Guinea secured second position with 38.9 points, Lagos city of Nigeria third with 39, Harare of Zimbabwe fourth with 39.4, Algiers of Algeria 5th with 40.9 points, Karachi city of Pakistan 6th with 40.9, Tripoli of Libya 7th with 42.8 points, Douala city of Cameroon 8th with 43.3 points, Tehran city of Iran in 9th with 45.8 points and Abidjan of Ivory Coast became10th with 45.9 points in the rating./Indeed, Dhaka is set to become an unlivable city very soon unless a plan is immediately put in place to develop a smooth transport system and stop unplanned housing, said environmentalist groups. The city is beset with multiple problems. The common problems are traffic jam, load shedding, water and sanitation, air pollution, accommodation crisis of increasing population and many more. Most of them get media coverage from time to time. Regrettably, some get little attention when the problem is acute. Of them, accommodation problem has been severe over the past years as house rent has been doubled and in some cases tripled causing immense sufferings to the low and limited income people./Despite development and other related issues taking the centre stage, the concern over demographic explosion appears to have receded to the background. But the air of nonchalance, notwithstanding, the population bomb, is ticking away all the same as before. The average rate of population growth in the city is now 3.0 per cent against 7.0 per cent growth in city slums. This is also contributing to 1.4 per cent average growth rate of population over the country. About 40 per cent of city-dwellers live in slums and the rate is expected to rise in the future./City's environment is already threatened as a consequence of excessive population. Pollution is increasing and water supply and sanitation facilities in Dhaka might collapse under the relentless pressure of city-dwellers. If population growth continues unabated, a decade from now, it will be hard to walk on the city streets. The unhindered growth of population in Dhaka is set to increase social inequality significantly over the course of the next decade. It will bring about tremendous problems in areas of provision of basic services including heath, education and food./Dhaka city has become one of the world's truly hopeless urban cases. Fleeing droughts, floods, and starvation, people have been streaming into the city from the countryside, making it distressingly sick. The capital city is now bursting with people of all categories looking for jobs. In recent times, agitation by garment workers, and traffic congestion at every road intersection brought the city to a standstill./Apart from people living on jobs in government and private agencies, at least 2.0 million people working in different garment factories and other industries in and around the city find it extremely difficult to get a shelter in the confines of the city. The way low-income people live in slum areas of different parts of the city beggars description. Unhygienic condition leaves scores of them to suffer from many chronic diseases./The situation in Dhaka city is becoming alarming day by day. Joblessness, oversized population, noxious emissions and toxic effluents from smoke-belching vehicles have made city life choking. Conscious citizenry have been focusing on human factors responsible for deterioration of environmental quality in the city life. These are: population growth incompatible with development of resources, lack of adequate environmental considerations, poor management of waste generated through the production-generation process./Environmentalists have expressed concern about the environmental degradation of Dhaka city that evidently manifests its decline. Air pollution caused by vehicle emission, despite changeover to CNG-driven vehicles, is still the worst. Dhaka's sky is no longer blue, it is grey. Health experts claim that the air in the city will soon become impossible to breathe. Dhaka city dwellers are, thus, being subjected to slow murder./One of the major threats to the city due to declining groundwater levels is land subsidence, which can be triggered by earthquakes of greater magnitudes. Recently, a series of earthquakes of magnitudes ranging from 4.0 to 5.2 on the Richter scale jolted Dhaka and other parts of the country. Although no damage to the infrastructure of the city was reported but there is a great potential of collapse of infrastructures and also of land subsidence associated with earthquakes, particularly in areas of greater groundwater-storage depletion./Unless migration from the countryside is checked, Dhaka will turn into a city of ruins, where people will risk losing their living environment. Without strong political commitment, reform of any kind is, indeed, virtually impossible. A sustained awareness campaign through the media and public advocacy should be started to arrest the 'decline of Dhaka'./Before the work for metro-rail gets started, the main task facing the relevant authorities is to build the already proposed link roads and by-pass roads. The major defect in the transport network is the absence of link roads between eastern and western part of Dhaka. The by-pass roads that are in the pipeline must be implemented very rapidly./Only way to reverse the situation is to make outskirts of Dhaka and other towns the epicentres of growth, create employment opportunities by way of SMEs (small and medium enterprises), opening of educational institutions, healthcare facilities, entertainment outlets like parks, cultural rendezvous of different denominations, etc. Decentralisation of the administration, with self-contained zones of habitats so that people don't have to travel long distances, has been long overdue. Dhaka's civic governance should be radically improved by bringing the city under a unified authority./<a href=""mailto:szkhan@dhaka.net"">szkhan@dhaka.net</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Working towards sustainable development,"Bangladesh, Feb. 6 -- The Rana Plaza tragedy at Savar in Dhaka last year that had claimed lives of about 1,200 garment workers had sent a shock wave across the world. While the buyers in Europe, Australia, Canada and the U.S. were considering the possibility of sourcing their ready-made garments from Bangladesh on a larger scale, the industrial disaster tainted the image of the country. They raised questions about the working conditions here. It is true that in most cases the working conditions are horrible. The factories, especially in the apparel sector, lack sufficient space, light and fire safety, supply of drinking water, foods and medical facilities for the employees. However, corporate entities are these days thinking of ways and means to address the negative aspects and thus ensure sustainable development to stay in the race in the free market era./Sustainable development means development of business as well as development of socio-economic condition of a country, where people and environment get the top priority to the benefit of future generations in the long run./According to the 1987 Brundtland Report, the interconnectedness of culture, economy and environment are at the forefront of sustainable development as we know it today. The World Summit on Sustainable Development took place in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002 and in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2012 for raising awareness about sustainable development. It has three pillars: economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social inclusion, which covers all sectors of development from cities facing rapid urbanisation to agriculture, infrastructure, energy development and use, water availability, transportation, etc./Yet the idea of sustainable development is a relatively new one in our country. The concept came to national prominence very recently, although it first came to the fore at the United Nations Conference on Human Environment in 1972 that recognised that the rapidly expanding human population would have to survive off a finite pool of resources. Without careful management, resources such as food, energy and water could exhaust leading to obvious global crises. After a long time, we are now realising the essence of the conference in the wake of scarcity of natural resources to meet the demand of the increasing population./The sustainable development lies in the sort of sustainability of business and other economic activities where people engage themselves to earn their bread and butter. The entrepreneurs in our country are taking steps to ensure sustainability in their business by providing medical facilities, education and raising awareness of employees about environmental threats and climate changes./The steps towards sustainable development are encouraging in some aspects, but in some cases frustrating also in our country. The entrepreneurs often ignore social safety of employees for the sake of making lofty profit from the business. The greed for profit blinds them, which ultimately spells a disaster for the business. So, in order to ensure sustainability of business, they should ensure physical fitness of employees, offer health facilities and also ensure congenial working condition and ecological balance that are pre-conditions for the development. Since sustainable development has made a lasting impact on businesses around the world, there is still much to do./ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS: While the country has made progress in reducing poverty over the past decades, less progress has been made in managing the environmental sustainability. Pollution, overexploitation of fish stocks, biodiversity loss, overuse of water and land threaten our development efforts./The country's population has grown larger, crossing the 160 billion mark and while the country's gross domestic product (GDP) has nearly doubled from the level a decade ago, the proportional consumption is increasing as well. As a result, agriculture has intensified leading to agrochemical pollution, soil exhaustion and deforestation. The demand for food has also prompted water withdrawals that have tripled over the last 50 years. Addressing these environmental threats is not that easy. But the following steps may help lessen their impacts to some extent./Enhancing livelihoods through promoting sustainable management of ecosystems and natural resources./Preventing and reducing environmental health risks through reducing people's exposure to indoor and urban air pollution, waterborne diseases, and toxic chemicals, and/Reducing people's vulnerability to environmental hazards./CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS: Different international agencies have extended their helping hands to combat environmental threats and minimise the climate change impacts. The World Bank's approach to improving the quality of growth has been supporting policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks for sustainable environmental management. This support includes facilitating partnership to address environmentally sensitive issues and agreeing on benchmarks for environmental management./Natural and man-made environmental resources - fresh water, clean air, forests, grasslands, marine resources and agro-ecosystems provide sustenance and a foundation for social and economic development. The need to safeguard these resources crosses all borders. Today, the World Bank is one of the key promoters and financiers of environmental upgrading in developing countries including Bangladesh./SUSTAINABLE ENERGY: As millions of people of the country still lack access to electricity, it remains a major factor in equitable development and prosperity of the national economy. The World Energy Congress 2013 took a look at the global energy trends, after the Montreal Congress in 2010, to cover a broad range of energy issues and find solutions to the world energy challenges. The delegates attending the congress discussed how policymakers, industry people and key decision-makers in the energy sector must work together to form a more sustainable platform for future energy development./The renewable energy that witnessed substantial growth in the last decade encompasses the wind energy turbines and the hydropower. These are the areas where we need to work for developing sustainable energy. The wind energy turbines installed globally now can generate 3.5 per cent of the world electricity demand, which is encouraging and Bangladesh may follow the suit to resolve the energy crisis./SUSTAINABLE HOUSEHOLDS: Not only climate and environmental threats, problems with the family of an employee can also hamper productivity of the industry and thus deter the development of a country, especially in the third world. Everyday thousands of people lose their jobs, fall victim to crime, or are hit by natural hazards. To meet these challenges, people need to have sufficient resources and to be closely connected to their employers and their communities./In practice, many developing countries may be able to provide only a minimum level of benefits to only a targeted population with a view to helping them and bringing them under a social safety net. That is true in particular for countries where the old-age dependence ratio is growing fast. To ensure their long-run sustainability, the government should make sure that policies are fiscally sustainable, not ambitious./To confront risks and pursue opportunities, people should acquire knowledge and invest in their protection. The quality of their risk management depends on their access to information, markets, public services, and infrastructure, as well as the level of risk sharing within the community./Over the past two decades, economic growth has lifted millions of people out of poverty and has raised their income levels, but too often it has come at the expense of the environment and the poor. We should take measures to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. Sustainable development recognises that growth must be both inclusive and environmentally sound reducing poverty and ensuring shared prosperity for today's population and continue to meet the needs of future generations./These days corporate entities are undertaking corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes so that they could stay in the competitive commodity market. It would definitely contribute to socio-economic development of the country. It is also necessary to ensure political stability in the country to spur the economic growth. It is also necessary to make sure all our development efforts are fruitful. Otherwise, achieving the sustainable development will be a far cry./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Liveability at stake,"Bangladesh, March 20 -- At a dialogue on Emerging Global Trends in Urban Thinking in the city this week, speakers said there is no need for any government to raise the gross domestic product (GDP) growth, rather it's the people of the country who will raise GDP on their own for survival./GDP should not be the yardstick of progress rather liveability should be the indicator such as how people are progressing socially or the habits of dealing with hygiene, they said. Liveability means equitable access to resources, public transportation, quality of life, standard of living or general well-being of the people./Liveability does not necessarily depend on economic affordability but on environmental and social consciousness. Revival of nature, not subjugation of it, should be the way of urbanisation and economic development, they viewed./Such observations really deserve appreciation in the context of Bangladesh as there is an increasing trend here to measure the country's progress on the basis of GDP. In fact, as the experts viewed, progress will be visible when there will be equity and everyone abides by the law. In fact, Dhaka has been losing liveability because there is no rule of law. 'Predators' are the ultimate winners, they said./So many development plans were taken up for the city, but none was implemented true to their potential due to unexplained reasons. Day by day, city land was gobbled up, almost all the rivers and canals were otherwise filled and public places grabbed by powerful quarters in violation of master plans as the custodians were turned into 'predators'./Working hour worth Tk 200 billion and fuel worth Tk 120 billion are lost annually due to the widespread traffic snarls in the city. Although there is little space available in the country, streams of people are moving here in search of jobs and shelter. As there is no plan whatsoever to address the issue, endless migration is taking place without any hindrance./Apart from people living on jobs in government and private agencies, at least 2.0 million people working in different garment factories and other industries in and around the city find it extremely difficult to get a shelter in the confines of the city. The way low-income people live in slum areas of different parts of the city beggars description. Unhygienic condition leaves scores of them to suffer from many infectious diseases./The role of the regulators should otherwise be proper to save Dhaka from devastation. Also establishment of rule of law and political commitment is necessary for healthy urbanisation. Growth centres are being set up indiscriminately throughout the country due to dearth of proper planning. The municipalities are approving the town plans although they are not capable of doing these./The detailed area plan (DAP) could not be implemented in the first place due to pressure from the realtors and the powerful lobby as many of their projects could be affected. Although it was feasible, the metro rail project was not approved in due course. The cost of traffic jam could compensate the cost of the underground rail in one year's time. But no initiative was taken to build it./Experts say double-decker buses replacing innumerable small buses and cars can help significantly relieve traffic problems to increase urban liveability particularly in Dhaka. More and more double-decker buses with a single-decker at its tail reserved for women is another way of dealing with the situation./The number of private cars must be reduced to make way for optimum use of the road for public movement. At least 75 registered private cars add to Dhaka's traffic every day. Civic amenities like a public square for city dwellers at the old airport can significantly improve liveability, while a hawkers' plaza could resolve the traffic chaos at Farmgate. A liveable city must have open public places to build community ownership of the city./It may be mentioned here that a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), a prestigious research wing of the London-based weekly Economist, described Dhaka as the most unliveable city in the world. Last year, the position went to Syria's capital Damascus./City's environment is already threatened as a consequence of excessive population. Pollution is increasing and water supply and sanitation facilities in Dhaka might collapse under the relentless pressure of city-dwellers. If population growth continues unabated, a decade from now, it will be hard to walk on the city streets. The unhindered growth of population in Dhaka is set to increase social inequality significantly over the course of the next decade. It will bring about tremendous problems in areas of provision of basic services including heath, education and food./Environmentalists have expressed concern about the environmental degradation of Dhaka city that evidently manifests its decline. Air pollution caused by vehicle emission, despite changeover to CNG-driven vehicles, is still the worst. Dhaka's sky is no longer blue, it is grey. Health experts say that the air in the city will soon become impossible to breathe. Dhaka city dwellers are, thus, being subjected to slow murder./One of the major threats to the city due to declining groundwater levels is land subsidence, which can be triggered by earthquakes of greater magnitudes. Recently, a series of earthquakes of magnitudes ranging from 4.0 to 5.2 on the Richter scale jolted Dhaka and other parts of the country. Although no damage to the infrastructure of the city was reported there is a great potential of collapse of infrastructures and also of land subsidence associated with earthquakes, particularly in areas of greater groundwater-storage depletion./Only way to reverse the trend is to make outskirts of Dhaka and other towns the epicentres of growth, create employment opportunities by way of SMEs (small and medium enterprises), opening of educational institutions, healthcare facilities, entertainment outlets like parks, cultural rendezvous of different denominations, etc./Decentralisation of the administration, with self-contained zones of habitats so that people don't have to travel long distances, has otherwise been long overdue. Dhaka's civic governance does need to be radically improved by bringing the city under a unified authority./<a href=""mailto:szkhan@dhaka.net"">szkhan@dhaka.net</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Worst urban air quality grips Bangladesh,"Dhaka, May 11 -- It is disconcerting to note that Bangladesh was ranked fourth among 91 countries with worst urban air quality in the latest air pollution monitoring report of the World Health Organisation (WHO)./Reports in the media last week say three Bangladesh cities were also put among the top 25 cities with poorest air. The 2014 version of the Ambient Air Pollution (AAP) database consists mainly of urban air quality data of 1600 cities from 91 countries./According to the reports, Pakistan was shown as the worst country in the category with Qatar and Afghanistan ranking second and third. Iran, Egypt, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, India and Bahrain take the other spots in the worst ten./In the city-wise assessment, Narayanganj was marked as the 17th city with worst air quality whereas Gazipur and Dhaka were ranked 21st and 23rd respectively. In the report, six of the top 10 cities with highest air pollution were from neighbouring India with Delhi taking the first spot./The report says that almost 90 per cent of people living in the cities are exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. Outdoor air pollution killed 3.7 million people in 2012 and the WHO says it is now the world's largest single environmental health risk. The report also states only 12 per cent of people are living in cities that conform to the WHO air quality guideline levels. The report was more extensive than a similar database released by the WHO in 2011./The report on Bangladesh was prepared on the basis of the monthly air quality monitoring data of 2013 of the Department of Environment (DoE), Bangladesh. The DoE has set up air quality monitoring stations in eight cities including Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Rajshahi, Chittagong, Khulna and Sylhet./Though Narayanganj has the highest level of gaseous pollutants, the report shows the air of the northern metropolis Rajshahi contains the highest level of dust particles. Among the gaseous pollutants which the DoE measures are carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and ozone (O3), methane and non-methane pollutants./Meantime, air pollution in the capital city Dhaka has gone higher than Mexico City and Mumbai killing thousands prematurely each year. According to the DoE, the density of airborne particulate matter (PM) reaches 463 micrograms per cubic meter (mcm) in the city during December-March period -- the highest level in the world. Mexico City and Mumbai follow Dhaka with 383 and 360mcm respectively./An estimated 15,000 premature deaths, as well as several million cases of pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illness are attributed to poor air quality in Dhaka, according to the Air Quality Management Project (AQMP), funded by the government and the World Bank./Vehicular air pollution is a major cause of respiratory distress in urban Bangladesh. If pregnant mothers come across excessive pollution, it may cause premature death of their children. According to the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH), nearly seven million people in Bangladesh suffer from asthma; more than half of them are children./Cases of children suffering from bronchitis and chronic cough have also shot up in recent years. Children breathe more air relative to their lung size than adults. They spend more time outdoors, often during midday and afternoons when pollution levels are generally highest. WHO air quality guidelines (2005) recommend a maximum acceptable PM level of 20mcm; cities with 70mcm are considered highly polluted. Airborne lead is the worst of the harmful PMs./By penetrating the lungs and entering the blood stream, lead may cause irreversible neurological damage as well as renal disease, cardiovascular effects, and reproductive toxicity. The phasing out of petrol-driven two-stroke auto-rickshaws in 2003 and their replacement with four-stroke versions, which use a much cleaner burning fuel (compressed natural gas), significantly decreased the volume of air contaminants. Yet, according to DoE sources, a sharp increase in the number of vehicles and construction sites in 2004-2008 led to a deterioration of Dhaka's air quality./Old, poorly serviced vehicles, dust from roads and construction sites, and toxic fumes from industrial sites are major sources of air pollution. Traffic congestion and smoke from brick kilns are also responsible for air pollution in Dhaka city. The ministry of environment and forests says that vehicles in Dhaka move 14kmph on an average, which is very slow and causes them to burn more fuel and contribute to air pollution. They say the average speed could come down to 4kmph by 2025 if things do not improve./Faulty vehicles, smoke from brick kilns, dust from construction sites and toxic fumes from industries are the main sources of particulate matter. Environment officials who conducted a pre-study before the joint assessment for CASE say around 60 per cent of city air pollution is caused by thousands of unfit and faulty vehicles, especially those that run on diesel. They say vehicles older than 20 years could not be taken off the city streets. These vehicles add to city traffic, congestion and air pollution./The density of airborne particulate matter is around 250 micrograms per cubic metre in Dhaka, which is five times the acceptable level of 50 set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of Bangladesh. Dhaka air consists of common pollutants, including particulate matter, sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ground-level ozone (O3), volatile organic compounds, hydrogen sulphide (H2S), sulphates and nitrates. Dhaka is surrounded by brick kilns which have been contributing its air pollution./The Clean Air and Sustainable Environment project has a brick kiln component which aims to usher in a new era in brick manufacturing in Bangladesh. Under the project, the DoE will work towards changing the institutional, legal and regulatory framework. To that effect, the project will provide technical support to the newly established Brick Advisory Committee in an effort to make the industry green./What is, otherwise, needed at this stage is that Bangladesh must do something to get rid of serious air pollution sweeping across the country. The adoption of cleaner technologies and their full implementation is expected to go a long way in reaching the desired destination./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Raising tobacco taxes to reduce consumption,"Bangladesh, May 31 -- The member-states of the World Health Organisation (WHO) launched the World No Tobacco Day in 1987 to draw global attention to the tobacco epidemic, and the preventable deaths and diseases it causes. In 1988, Resolution WHA42.19 was passed, calling for the observance of World No Tobacco Day every year on May 31./Since then, every year the Day is observed by the member-states with a specific theme. The Day provides an opportunity for governments, non-government organisations and individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to a tobacco-free environment and thus ensure better health./The theme of the World No Tobacco Day 2014 is: ""Raise taxes on tobacco""./Smoking is a health problem, the costs of which include sickness, pain, grief and misery. But tobacco use also imposes a significant economic burden on society. In addition to the direct medical costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses, there are other indirect costs including loss of productivity, fire damage and environmental harm from cigarette litter and destructive farming practices. The total burden caused by tobacco products more than outweighs any economic benefit from their manufacture and sale./WHO KEY FACTS ON TOBACCO: Facts reveal that tobacco kills nearly 6.0 million people each year. More than five million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use, while more than 6,00,000 are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. Unless urgent action is taken, the annual death toll could rise to more than eight million by 2030. Nearly 80 per cent of the world's one billion smokers live in low and middle-income countries. The fact further shows that consumption of tobacco products is increasing globally, although it is decreasing in some high-income and upper middle-income countries./Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care and hinder economic development. In some countries, children from poor households are frequently employed in tobacco farming to provide family income. These children are especially vulnerable to ""green tobacco sickness"", which is caused by the nicotine that is absorbed through the skin from the handling of wet tobacco leaves. There are more than 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, of which at least 250 are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer./YOU CANNOT BE SAFE SO LONG AS THERE ARE SMOKERS AROUND: It is now well accepted globally that you cannot be safe so long as there are smokers around. For whatever reason if you inhale the air polluted by a tobacco smoker, you run the same risk as the smoker for having the adverse effects of smoking on your health. This is called second-hand smoke. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places./THE POOR AND TOBACCO CONSUMPTION: It is the poorer and the poorest who tend to smoke the most. Globally, 84 per cent of smokers live in developing and traditional economy countries. At the country level, tobacco consumption varies by socio-economic groups. In many countries, at all levels of development and income, it is the poor who smoke the most and who bear most the economic and disease burden of tobacco use. A study on prevalence of smoking among men in Chennai (India) in 1997 shows that the highest rate exists among the illiterate people (64 per cent). This prevalence decreases by the number of years of schooling, and it decreases to about one fifty (21 per cent) among those with more than 12 years of schooling. A study in the United Kingdom (UK) shows that only 10 per cent of women and 12 per cent of men in the highest socio-economic group are smokers, while 35 per cent of women and 40 per cent of men in the lowest socio-economic group smoke./TOBACCO INCREASES POVERTY OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES: WHO facts reveal that tobacco and poverty create a vicious cycle. In most countries, tobacco use tends to be higher among the poor. Poor families, in turn, spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco. Money spent on tobacco cannot be spent on basic human needs such as food, shelter, education and health care. Tobacco can also worsen poverty among users and their families since tobacco users are at much higher risk of falling ill and dying prematurely of cancers, heart attacks, respiratory diseases or other tobacco-induced diseases, depriving their families of much needed income and imposing additional costs for health care./SPECIFIC GOALS OF WORLD NO TOBACCO DAY 2014: As mentioned above, a specific theme for the day provides an opportunity for governments, non-government organisations and individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to a tobacco-free environment and thus ensure better health. This year's theme underscores that governments should increase taxes on tobacco to such levels that help reduce tobacco consumption, and individuals and civil society organisations should work together to encourage their governments to increase taxes on tobacco to levels that reduce consumption. Enhanced tax on tobacco is an effective strategy to reduce consumption, and it saves lives of millions./TAXES DISCOURAGE TOBACCO USE: WHO study on tobacco shows that tobacco taxes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among the young and poorer people. A tax increase that raises tobacco prices by 10 per cent in fact decreases tobacco consumption by about 4.0 per cent in high-income countries, and up to 8.0 per cent in low and middle-income countries. Comprehensive tobacco control measures, especially those demand-reduction measures such as higher taxes, advertising and promotion bans, smoking bans in public places and helping those who wish to quit are effective in reducing tobacco usage, and consequently tobacco attributable deaths and diseases. From the income perspective, higher taxes will likely increase the share of income spent on tobacco, in a way creating big 'opportunity costs' on families' immediate needs such as education and health expenditures./When evaluated from a broader perspective, tobacco control is not only effective but also has positive impacts on the poor, society and the economy. That is because a substantial portion of the world's tobacco consumers are poor, and the poor suffer more from the burden of tobacco-attributable diseases and deaths. Given the higher price sensitivity among the poor, as taxes increases, it is more likely that the poor will quit or reduce the quantity of tobacco consumption. Consequently, a tax increase can be blessing as it becomes an incentive for poorer populations to stop using tobacco. Moreover, reducing tobacco consumption will help create a long-term benefit. In the mid- to long-run, as smokers gain their health, better health will improve the social and economic development of countries./TOBACCO CONTROL ACT: The Government of Bangladesh passed the smoking and tobacco products usage control law in 2005, and made it effective in the same year. Subsequently, an amendment was made in 2013 to make the law more effective. The amended law bans smoking in public places including transports and kept provision of a fine of Tk 300 which was Tk 50 earlier. According to the new law, leaves, roots, branches and other parts of tobacco or such plants would be treated as intoxicants. Moreover, cigarettes and bidi, tobacco powder (gool), aromatic tobacco (jorda), processed tobacco (khoini) and white leaves of tobacco will be considered as tobacco products. The amended law bans sales to minors and use of 'light', 'mild', 'slim' etc; and use of misconceptions on the pack has been banned./The members of parliament should work together for tobacco taxation for various categories of tobacco products in such a higher and proportionate rate so that tobacco users, particularly the young and poorer sections of society, are compelled to quit or at least reduce tobacco consumption which in turn can help create big 'opportunity costs' on families' immediate needs such as education and health expenditures. As we know, the tobacco industry is a powerful giant, only individual efforts will not work. We must work together for a tobacco-free society. We have the strength of law. Along with the government and WHO efforts, health personnel, public representatives, social workers, NGOs, health workers, religious leaders, school teachers and individuals may work to raise awareness about the dangers of tobacco and smoking./The theme of World No Tobacco Day this year is very timely and appropriate and it should be utilised in a befitting manner. Working together, we shall certainly win over the tobacco industry and thus keep our environment free of tobacco hazards for the health and welfare of the people./The author writes on health and environment issues, and is executive secretary of ADHUNIK, a national anti-tobacco organisation of Bangladesh./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Climate change to eat up BDs 2pc GDP by 2050 : ADB study,"Bangladesh, Aug. 20 -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Tuesday Bangladesh could suffer an annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) loss of 2.0 per cent by 2050 and 9.0 per cent by 2100 simply due to the impacts of climate change./It, however, said if global mitigation actions, including reductions in human emissions of greenhouse gases, are successfully implemented, those losses could be limited to just over 2.0 per cent by 2100./The Manila-based ADB conducted a study styled 'Assessing the costs of climate change and adaptation in South Asia'. The Dhaka office of the ADB released the findings at a press conference held at a city hotel./The study widely covered Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka and assessed impacts of climate change and its consequences./The report predicted the six South Asian countries will see an average economic loss of around 1.8 per cent of their collective annual GDP by 2050, rising sharply to 8.8 per cent by 2100 if the world continues on its current fossil fuel-intensive path./Without changes to current global behaviour, Bangladesh would see annual economic costs equivalent to 2.0 per cent of its GDP by 2050, widening to 9.4 per cent by 2100, it said./""Rapid urban growth has also caused other environmental problems resulting from industrial activity and waste generation, which must be tackled,"" said Bindu Lohani, ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development./""The human and financial toll could be even higher if the damage from floods, droughts, and other extreme weather events is included,"" Mr Lohani said while presenting the study said./While the needs and investments required for adaptation will depend on global efforts, early investment can help mitigate large economic damages in later decades, he said./He said vast crop losses, disappearing arable land, displaced communities, poisoned groundwater -- this is not a horror tale -- but a very real possibility in future unless current destructive global resource use patterns are changed./""The expected rise in frequency and severity of extreme climate events call for wide-ranging action including stepped-up safety net programmes for the poor, who are most at risk.""/The study said a one-metre rise will cause permanent inundation to nearly 1.0 per cent of the land area in Bangladesh, while affected people will be as high as 36 per cent./The temperature is projected to rise from 0.9 to 1.9 degree Celsius by 2030, from 1.6 to 2.5 degree Celsius by 2050 and from 2.9 to 4.2 degree Celsius by 2080./The study said a temperature increase of 4.0 degree Celsius would cause significant decrease in production of some 28 per cent of rice and 68 per cent of wheat./The Khulna division with the largest area will be permanently affected by a 1.0-metre sea level rise while Dhaka could see up to 14 per cent of its territory temporarily inundated, and its large population facing the greatest risks./More extreme weather events will also damage forests, wetlands, and the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, which provides income and nutrition to millions of people and a cushion against rural poverty./South Asia will need to spend at least $73 billion, or an average of 0.86 per cent of its GDP, every year between now and 2100 to adapt to the negative impacts./Annual rice production could increase by as much as 16 per cent in Nepal's hills and mountains by 2080, but drop as much as 23 per cent in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Sri Lanka by that time./A one-metre rise in sea levels, inundating coastlines, would affect 95 million people and another 100 million when there will be storm surges./On the other hand, if countries act together to keep the rise in global temperatures below 2.5 degree C, the cost of the region shielding itself from the worst of the impacts would be nearly halved to around US$40.6billion, or 0.48 per cent of GDP./The report did not provide detailed adaptation cost projections on a country or sector basis, although in the energy sector it noted that a rising gap between demand and supply could see Bangladesh facing an annual adaptation bill of over $89 million in the 2030s, rising to over $363 million in the 2050s./The report also detailed adaptive measures that the country could take to protect its sensitive agriculture sector, including introduction of drought, flood and saline-tolerant crops, crop and aquaculture diversification, more capture and use of surface water for irrigation, more flood- resistant infrastructure for riverbanks, raised earth beds for seasonal vegetable cultivation, and adoption of alternative livelihood options including community-based fisheries and duck rearing./The report read: ""Countries must respond individually and collectively to cope with rising sea levels, disrupted water, food, and energy supply and increased disease.""/By 2030, the researchers estimated, the cost of climate change and air pollution combined will rise to 3.2 per cent of global GDP, with the world's least developed countries will have to bear the brunt, suffering losses of up to 11 per cent of their GDP./Environment and Forests Minister Anwar Hossain Manju, who joined the programme as chief guest, said climate change calls for an urgent need for increased investment and multinational capacity, and stronger government and private sector policies, to manage the impending impacts and consequences of climate change./He said currently about $1.0bilion worth of climate funds are now operational in the country, including $350million from its own resources./Over the last 35 years, the government has invested over $10 million to make Bangladesh less vulnerable to natural disasters, he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

"Environmental pollution, climate change high on agenda","Bangladesh, Sept. 8 -- A World Bank report of 2011 showed that every year in the Dhaka City around 10,800 premature deaths along with several million cases of illness are being caused by air pollution./According to a Directorate General Health Services (DGHS) data until June 2009 there have been clinically confirmed 46,000 arsenicosis cases in Bangladesh. The number has risen to 62,000 now, experts said./It is estimated that 35 to 77 million of roughly 125 million inhabitants of Bangladesh have been drinking contaminated well water./These were revealed during a WHO media workshop at CIRDAP auditorium in the city Sunday on the upcoming 67th session of regional committee for WHO's South-East Asia Region in Dhaka from today (September 08) until September 12 and 32nd meeting of health ministers from September 09./Health ministers from 11 countries of WHO South-East Asia Region (WHO-SEAR) will meet for a four-day meeting which begins on September 9 to discuss key health issues facing the region. The countries are: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Korea, India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and East Timor./Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to inaugurate the meeting at Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in the city. WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan and Regional Director for South-East Asia Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh will be present along with WHO experts at both the meetings./In the media workshop, WHO public information and advocacy officer, SEARO, Ms Vismita Gupta Smith, WHO regional adviser, Occupational Health Dr Leslie Jayne Onyon and assistant professor, NIPSOM, Manzurul Haque Khan made three presentations./In his presentation, Manzurul Haque said in Bangladesh children and adolescents have high levels of exposure, and children under five particularly have serious exposure./Among adults, men have half the exposure of women (whose exposure is similar to that of children and adolescents). Elderly men have significantly lower exposure than elderly women./Exposure to air pollutants can lead to increased risk of diseases including respiratory infections, low birth weight, cataracts, and cardiovascular events and increased hospital visits or hospitalisation for respiratory or cardiovascular illnesses./He said household air pollution is mainly caused from kitchen and is severe in rural areas./Industrial and household waste, spillage from shallow boats, textiles, tanneries, pulp and paper mills are the main cause of water pollution for which dissolved oxygen reaches zero level. Fishes cannot live in this polluted water and the river is called a dead river where there is no oxygen, he added./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Air pollution harming brains of urban young,"Bangladesh, Sept. 12 -- Children living in cities are at an increased risk of developing brain inflammation and neuro-degenerative changes, including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, owing to air pollution. Researchers at the University of Montana found that when air particulate matter and their components such as metals are inhaled or swallowed, they pass through damaged barriers - including respiratory, gastro-intestinal and blood-brain barriers - and can result in long-lasting harmful effects. /Lead researcher Dr. Lilian Calderon-Garciduenas' findings are detailed in apaper titled 'Air pollution and children: Neural and tight-junction anti-bodies and combustion metals, the role of barrier breakdown and brain immunity in neuro-degeneration'. The team compared 58 serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from a control group living in a low-pollution city and matched them by age, gender, socioeconomic status, education and education levels achieved by their parents to 81 children living in Mexico City. 'We found that children living in Mexico City had significantly higher serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of auto-antibodies against key tight-juction and neural proteins, as well as combustion metals,' Calderon-Garciduenas said. 'We asked why a clinically healthy kid is making auto-antibodies against their own brain components?' Calderon-Garciduenas noted. That is indicative of damage to barriers that keep antigens away from the brain. The results of constant exposure to air pollution and damage to all barriers eventually result in significant consequences later in life, according to The Times of India./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Call for funds as campaigners lay out clean cooking vision,"New York, Nov. 20 -- A global campaign group has urged governments, donors and investors to cough up at least US$500 million to promote clean cooking, which they say can help cut millions of premature deaths./""Now it's time to turn up the flame and truly transform the way the world cooks,"" said Radha Muthiah, executive director with Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves./""We live in a world that is beset by problems that stubbornly resist solutions ... the solution is within our grasp and within our means,"" the ED said as she spoke at the opening session of Cookestoves Future Summit that began in this US city today./""The opportunity is real, the market is poised for scale and the imperative for action is now ours.""/Her call comes as the Alliance aims to enable 60 million households to adopt clean-cooking solutions by 2017./She noted open fires consume 500 million tonnes of firewood a year and/spew out 21 per cent of global black carbon emissions./In addition to the toll on health and the environment, she said, open fires used for cooking have a ""serious"" impact on the economic and social empowerment of women and girls./""Hours spent gathering fuel, feeding the fire and cooking food could be better spent on school, running a small business, raising children, or tending to crops,"" Ms Muthiah told the rare summit on a household concern./She outlined the vision of the Alliance over the next three years that includes promoting public-private partnership, innovation, and pursuing policy and regulatory reforms to support the sector./Kathy Calvin, president and CEO of UN Foundation, said household smokes have a direct impact on climate change and it must be halted to ensure safety of women and girls--and their future, too./""Clean-cooking stoves are life-changing and lifesaving solutions,"" she said. Around four million people, mostly women and children, die each year because of exposure to household smokes from traditional stoves./Speaking on a panel, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources Nasrul Hamid said Bangladesh will give a big push for use of liquefied petroleum gas in urban areas in the next three years toensure clean cooking. This is also imperative in view of fast-depleting natural gas./""For us, it's a big challenge to keep LPG prices lower,"" he said./To tackle the challenge, he said, the government considers lowering duty and offering private enterprises a 10-year tax break to encourage import and installation of LPG plants./Mr Hamid said Bangladesh has spent $6.5 million and will require investing another chunk of US$ 100 million to finance installation of 5 million clean cookestoves by 2017./Close to 90 per cent of Bangladeshi households rely on solid fuels to cook and the action plan of the government envisions making all kitchens smoke-free by 2030./An estimated 78,000 Bangladeshis die each year because of exposure to household air pollution./Organised by the UN-led Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, the summit has brought together public, private, and non-government leaders from around the world to speed up actions for clean-cooking solutions./The summit is being co-hosted by former US secretary of state Hilary Clinton, UK's parliamentary under secretary of state for international development Lyne Featherstone, administrator of USAID Dr. Razib Shah, Norwegian foreign minister Borge Brende, and minister of foreign affairs and regional integrations Hanna Tetteh./<a href=""mailto:azmanas1@gmail.com"">azmanas1@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

TB still a health problem; awareness key to its prevention,"Bangladesh, March 7 -- Tuberculosis (TB) is curable if the patients take drugs regularly as per doctor's advice under the supervision of health workers. But many people do not go to doctors in time and, if they go, they fail to complete the full course of treatment. It compounds the disease. Besides, many people are unaware that test and treatment of TB is carried out free of cost across the country. Timely action can ensure the healing./Let's take the case of an old woman, Marjina Begum (60), a resident of Durgapur village in Narail Sadar upazila. She fell in trouble in her old age as she suffered from fever and cold for a long time./Being informed of a Shastha Sebika of BRAC, she met the Sebika who took her cough to the Sadar upazila health complex where the woman was diagnosed as TB patient after the test. She took drugs given to her from the health complex with the supervision of the Sebika under the Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) system. The woman got cured after taking the drugs for six months./The woman is not alone. Many others also got good results by taking treatment under the DOTS system. Under the DOTS system, an observer watches the patient swallowing their drugs, which is essential for completion of treatment and recovery from TB. This ensures that the patient takes the right anti-TB drugs, in the right doses, at the right intervals and for the right period./Sebikas disseminate TB-specific and sensitive messages, identify suspected patients and refer suspected TB patients for sputum examinations to the health complex or laboratory services./According to the Narail health complex sources, 616 people were affected by TB in the district last year. Of them, 547 have been treated under DOTS system while 40 others died of the disease the same year./Overcrowded and unhygienic living condition and malnutrition mainly caused the TB infection in the district. Existing stigma surrounding TB complicated the problem. Hygienic situation and intake of nutrition can check the infection, said the health complex sources./If people get aware and maintain hygienic living condition and take necessary nutritious foods, they can be safe from TB infection. Campaign at all levels is needed to make people aware about the matter, said the sources./Dr Mohammad Ahmad Hossain, Line Director of National TB Control Programme (NTP), said even though TB is completely curable, a large number of people still continue to become ill and die of the disease. Many cases remain undiagnosed due to lack of awareness on the part of the patients regarding the diagnosis and treatment and facilities available./World Health Organization (WHO) ranked Bangladesh 6th among the world's 22 high-burden TB countries. It remains a major public health problem in Bangladesh./In Bangladesh, TB, an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and spread through air, is one of the leading causes of adult mortality and preventable deaths. TB is spread from person to person through airborne particles./Tuberculosis of the lungs or pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common form of TB and occurs in about 80% of cases. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis can affect any part of the body other than lungs./Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who cough up TB bacilli through coughing, sneezing and spitting are the main source of TB infection./The most important way to stop the spread of tuberculosis for TB patients is to cover the mouth and nose when coughing, and to take all the TB medicines exactly as prescribed by the physician, said Dr Hossain./Continuation of cold for more than three weeks or more is the main symptom of TB. Other symptoms of TB in lung are slight fever in the afternoon and its disappearance with sweat at night, feeling pain in upper part of chest or backside, loss of appetite and weight and difficulty in breathing./Anyone having those symptoms should go for checkup immediately and, if affected, should be brought under treatment. Examination of sputum and treatment of TB is available free of cost across the country. Sputum test is the most reliable for determining TB./According to NTP, if patients fail to complete full course of treatment, then this problem turns complex and there is very little chance of recovery even if he/she takes drugs regularly and adequately later. If it is not treated, TB can be fatal./TB is more prevalent among the malnourished population whose immunity is low. Besides, passive smoking, poor housing with over-crowded indoor and poor ventilation, indoor air pollution, living in a damp place, HIV infection and other socio-economic reasons are the risk factors for TB infection. Babies and the elderly are at a greater risk due to their ill-developed and declining immune system respectively, said NTP./TB is not a hereditary disease. It is not spread by shaking hands with someone, sharing food or drink, touching bed linens or toilet seats, sharing toothbrushes, sharing cutlery, bedding or clothes and kissing./If patients start taking drug, the disease cannot be spread two weeks after intake of drug. If drugs are taken properly, the patients get cured completely and then they can lead normal life and join work./People ill with TB can infect up to 10-15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. Without proper treatment, up to two-thirds of people ill with TB will die./According to NTP, 224 people (per one lakh population) are affected by TB while 51 people (per one lakh population) die of the disease every year across the country./Dr Mujibur Rahman, National Programme Consultant of NTP, said lack of awareness mainly caused the deaths in Bangladesh. Patients showed negligence in taking treatment, which caused the deaths. Sometimes, complications from other diseases also caused the deaths. Dr Mujib called upon all concerned to raise awareness for building a TB-free Bangladesh./""Mass media can play a significant role in helping TB control process by reporting on case detection and treatment adherence, combating stigma and discrimination, empowering people affected with TB and mobilizing political commitment and resource for TB""./BRAC TB, Malaria, WASH and DECC programmes Director Dr Akramul Islam said the success in controlling TB can be enhanced further by integrating policymakers, researchers, social workers, drug industry actors and the media in our concerted fight against the infection. He called for devising ways and means to face the emerging challenges in this field./It is expected that all concerned would work together to raise awareness to achieve the goal of the National TB Control Programme to eradicate the disease from Bangladesh./The writer, a freelance journalist, can be contacted at /<a href=""mailto:aktermomena@gmail.com"">aktermomena@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Going green with BB refinance,"Bangladesh, March 7 -- The Bangladesh Bank (BB) has taken a very good initiative for sustainable business development. Already 44 products have got their access to the refinance facility from the central bank. Three criteria are considered for the facility-solar power setup, green industry, workplace safety in the textile and apparel sector. Entrepreneurs will get the facility from different banks and non-bank financial institutions as nominated by the BB. Every bank will be assessed under the CAMEL rating system./The CAMEL is an international bank-rating system, based on which the bank supervisory authority rates institutions as per six fixed criteria. The CAMEL rating is an advanced version. The six factors are as follows: capital adequacy, asset quality, management efficiency, earnings record, liquidity position, and sensitivity to market. A total of 48 scheduled commercial banks including nine foreign ones are operating business in Bangladesh. Out of the total business, 56.5 per cent is handled by private commercial banks and the remaining 43.5 per cent is dealt with by nationalised commercial banks. Now let's delve deep into the three criteria of direct green financing by the BB:/SOLAR POWER: One of the most renewable energies in the world is solar power. The sun provides huge resource for generating clean and sustainable electricity without pollution or global warming. Unfortunately, the people in Bangladesh are not familiar with how to use it though they have an immense scope to utilise the sunlight properly./The amount of energy from the sun that falls on the Earth's surface is enormous. All the energies stored in Earth's reserves of coal, oil and natural gas is matched by the energy from sunshine. Outside the Earth's atmosphere, the sun's energy contains about 1,300 watts per square metre. About one-third of this light is reflected back into the space and a portion is absorbed by the atmosphere./The BB has drawn up the refinancing plan taking into consideration the environmental aspect to promote green industry and usher in a new era by helping different stakeholders use solar power as the best renewable energy. An individual, a group of beneficiaries or a cooperative society or organisation registered with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSCF) can get loan for a water treatment project. They will be allocated maximum Tk 30 million. The beneficiary will get ten years' time for repayment of the loan to the BB in installments. The interest rate is maximum 9 per cent-customary bank rate (5 per cent) + maximum 4 per cent. Another interest phase is maximum 11 per cent--customary bank rate (5 per cent) + maximum 6 per cent./Solar energy is a great supplementary system for power cuts. It is getting cheaper. It is a better alternative to an instant power supply (IPS) system and more efficient than an IPS. It can play an increasingly integral role in ending our national dependence on fossil fuels, combating the threat of global warming, and securing a future based on clean and sustainable energy. While the United States uses solar power randomly, its use in Bangladesh is not still extensive. Solar power is the best clean energy option in the country./GREEN INDUSTRY: Bangladesh has gone a long forward in becoming a leader in social and economic arenas, but with regard to green industry sustainability for a sound industrial atmosphere, we should focus on how to emerge as a centre of excellence. Social compliance has already been established as an industrial norm, but green industry sustainability is going to be a core component of sustainable process in industrial management in the days to come in Bangladesh. The entrepreneurs should think of eco-friendly factories in their business planning and put emphasis on addressing these issues in an appropriate manner./Most entrepreneurs think it needs a big amount of investment to set up a green industry. There is no doubt about it. But there is no alternative to green industry for sustainable development in the days ahead. Japan, China and India have already set up their green industries. Vietnam has taken necessary steps and is also working to that end. But Bangladesh is like an infant in this area./This is the first time the central bank of Bangladesh has taken a good initiative for promoting green industries. The concept of green industry is new in Bangladesh. With the elapse of time, establishment of green industries has become imperative for sustainable business development. For that reason, the BB has initiated the direct green finance. An individual, a group of beneficiaries or a cooperative society or organisation registered with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSCF) can get a loan of maximum Tk 200 billion for a green industry project. The beneficiaries will get six years' time for repayment of the loan to the BB in installments. The interest rate is maximum 9 per cent--customary bank rate (5 per cent) + maximum 4 per cent./Green building offers many benefits, both tangible and intangible. The most tangible benefits are the reduction in water and energy consumption right from the day of occupancy. Intangible benefits of a green factory include enhanced indoor air quality, good day lighting, health, wellbeing and safety of the workforce. The green industry sustainability is focused on social responsibility. If safety is ensured effectively in a business world, it will lead to fewer schedule interruptions and minimum production costs./The central bank has said that the green industry should be certified by the US Green Building Council (USGBC) or by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) until the government develops its own guideline and issue a directive regarding the matter. Green building can help reduce water use by 40 per cent, greenhouse gas emissions by 33-39 per cent, solid waste 70 per cent and energy use 24-50 per cent./Green factory building, according to the USGBC rating, addresses green features in the following categories for both new and existing buildings. Here the core values are as mentioned below:/Sustainable site: It helps rehabilitate contaminated sites where development is complicated by environmental contamination, reduce air pollution and land development impacts from personal automobile use, enhance the overall quality of life by providing amenities within and closer to the site and minimise disturbances to the factory building site so as to reduce long-term environmental impacts./Water efficiency: Green building helps minimise water use by installing efficient water fixtures, limit such landscapes which consume large quantities of water, design the landscape to ensure minimum consumption of water and reduce the demand for irrigation water through water-efficient management techniques./Energy and atmosphere: It helps avoid the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-based refrigerants and ozone layer depleting gases which negatively impact the environment and optimise energy efficiency and thus reduce environmental impacts from excessive energy consumption./Materials and resources: Green building ensures effective non-process waste management, minimises construction waste being sent to landfills, encourages use of products (materials other than plant machinery) which contain recycled materials to reduce environmental impacts associated with the use of virgin materials./Indoor environment: Green building minimises exposure of non-smokers to adverse health impacts arising out of passive-smoking and post-occupancy, provides better ventilation to ensure good indoor environment, ensures a better factory design that offsets major health risks associated with exposure to asbestos and ensures proper use of daylight./Innovation and design process: It helps identify the following in writing: intent of the proposed innovation credit, requirement of compliance and the design approach (strategies) used to meet the requirements./Four RMG manufacturers in Bangladesh are certified by the USGBC. They are: 1. ABA Group (platinum, USGBC standards), 2. Viyellatex Group (Platinum, USGBC standards), 3. Vintage Denim (Platinum, USGBC standards), and 4. Envoy Textile (certified USGBC standards). According to factory insiders, the initiative will enhance competitiveness of Bangladeshi products in the global market./Workplace safety: The BB has taken an initiative to ensure workplace safety for workers. The generalised system of preferences (GSP) facility in the US market has been suspended over the factory safety issue. Buyers from across the world are pressing for ensuring workplace safety in Bangladesh following the Tazreen Fashions fire and the Rana Plaza tragedy. For that reason, the BB has made it clear that those who are members of BKMEA, BGMEA and BTMA will get their access to loans from the central bank. The BB mentioned in a circular that each unit would get maximum Tk 10 million for ensuring workplace safety for workers. The BB has included retro-fitting, rebuilding and factory relocation in the workplace safety. A loan recipient will get five years' time to repay the loan in installments. The interest rate is maximum 9 per cent-customary bank rate (presently 5 per cent) + maximum 4 per cent. Entrepreneurs should take the BB refinance facility to establish green industries for sustainable business development./The writer is Assistant Secretary, BKMEA and presently working at the Institute of Apparels Research and Technology (iART), BKMEA /<a href=""mailto:harun.bkmea@gmail.com"">harun.bkmea@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

An unlivable city expanding fast,"Bangladesh, March 8 -- Dhaka city was ranked 211th among 230 cities assessed in an annual quality of living survey. The capital city of Bangladesh is, obviously, one of the worst ones to live in./Conducted by a global consulting firm recently, the survey assesses living conditions based on 10 categories, including political stability, economic environment, medical, education, transport, recreation, housing and natural environment./Despite concerns about economic growth, the cities of Western Europe continue to offer a stable environment for employees and employers. Vienna (1) is followed by Zurich (2), Munich (4), Dusseldorf (6), and Frankfurt (7)./Singapore (26) is the highest-ranking Asian city, whereas Dubai (74) ranks first across the Middle East and Africa. Good air quality, solid infrastructure, decent medical facilities, low crime and low health risks have contributed to Singapore maintaining its position at the top of the global ranking for quality of living for Asian assignees./Chinese cities of Xi'an and Chongqing (both ranked 142nd) are emerging as business destinations. Their main challenges to improving quality-of-living standards are clean water provision and air pollution. However, advances in the telecommunications and consumer sectors have had some positive offsetting effects on their ranking./Behind Singapore, the second highest-ranking city in Southeast Asia is Kuala Lumpur (84). In South Asia, Colombo (132) ranks highest and is followed by emerging Indian cities Hyderabad (138) and Pune (145). Considerable population increases in Mumbai and New Delhi in recent decades have increased existing problems, including access to clean water, air pollution, and traffic congestion./Pakistan's Islamabad (261) and Karachi (269) cities have the region's worst scores for personal security and social-political tensions. They are the hardest locations surveyed in Asia for expatriates to adapt to living and working in./Another survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) this year, Dhaka was also adjudged one of the world's worst cities to live in. It has continued to occupy more or less the same position as before, with its conditions of living perhaps worsening more than what it was before./On the other side, Melbourne was placed at the same envious position, in terms of ranking, at the top place now for three years in a row as the world's most liveable city. The EIU took a total of 140 cities for survey, following five relevant criteria./The rankings show how poor the situation is in Dhaka city. It is now an unliveable city expanding fast in an unplanned way, turning it into a jungle of human beings./Many say this is a city of nightmare as its odds and problems are widespread and crimes, rampant. Over the years, Dhaka has witnessed its population bulging further; its poverty and pollution conditions are also getting more complex and more challenging. At the same time, quality of housing, health and living has dismally gone down./In fact, the crux of the problems facing Dhaka is that people in increasing number are migrating from villages to the capital city in search of shelter, food, employment, business and other purposes./The pressure of the additional population in Dhaka is leading to a widening gap between demand for, and supply of, various types of facilities. Moreover, the 'strangers', in the nature of a floating population, in the city are also creating socio-economic problems and environmental imbalance, besides contributing to the aggravation of the law and order situation./Unscrupulous people, allegedly with overt or covert political support, have encroached on the rivers, lakes and water bodies. Shockingly, in spite of the High Court directive to clean the Buriganga and Turag and the large sum of money spent for this purpose, contamination remains as grave as ever./With about 300 factories throwing in toxic wastes and people emptying human excreta and rubbish in the open rivers, the surface water in Dhaka city has become extremely contaminated. As a result, 85 per cent of its demand for safe water supplies is met through underground water, causing the water table to drop by about 3.0 to 4.0 meters every year./The city is highly congested and overcrowded. One third of its population lives in slums. As many as 61 per cent of its dwellers live below poverty line and 30-40 per cent have no housing facility. Only 45 per cent get safe water supply. In the absence of parks, lakes and open spaces, the pollution of the environment continues on a massive scale./Dhaka's environmental situation is enormously dangerous, to say the least. An unlimited number of vehicles on the city roads, unplanned urbanisation and utterly mismanaged urban governance continue to aggravate its overall situation. Experts say many areas of this unplanned city may become unfit for habitation within two and a half decades./Security of life and property in the city is very poor. Although human life is rather cheap here, the cost of living is very high. Housing problem is acute. Compressed natural gas (CNG)-run auto-rickshaws and even taxicabs ply with the fare being fixed by the drivers at will./Footpaths are under the occupation of the hawkers and the 'booty' on account of such illegal occupation of space is, as reports in the media from time to time indicate, is shared by the local 'mastaans' (musclemen) exercising their political clout in the manner that suits them./Traffic snarl is a perennial problem in this capital city, especially on its busy important roads. Its crumbling sewer network can hardly cope with the increasing load of sewage generated daily./Often, water pipelines and sewer lines run parallel or one close to the other and in many places they break down. The result is that piped water gets contaminated which causes diarrhoea, typhoid and other/diseases./Because of poor drainage system in Dhaka city where most of its erstwhile canals are choked up or filled up with dumping of solid and construction wastes, water-logging remains persistent./Inadequate drainage sections, conventional drainage system with low capacity and gravity, natural siltation, absence of inlets and outlets, improper maintenance of existing drainage system and the disposal of solid waste into the drains are responsible for blockage in drainage system and for persistence of water-logging for long on many occasions, almost on a recurring basis./Unless a strong initiative is made jointly by the government and the private sector on an urgent basis, it will be very hard to arrest the decline of the city./<a href=""mailto:szkhan@dhaka.net"">szkhan@dhaka.net</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Social determinants of health,"Bangladesh, March 28 -- There are more than a few social determinants of the health of populations in the region. These encompass eight major ones discussed below. Other connected factors include stress, the nature of work, service status, as well as social support./Poor countries and poor people suffer from multiple deprivations that translate into high levels of ill health and disability. Poverty is an absolute barrier to good health. It impacts health by influencing each and every other solitary factors adversely. The poor are more vulnerable to disease owing to; in their lack of access to promotive, preventive and curative fitness care, nutritious food and financial resources. In addition, poor people are also more vulnerable to environmental threats to health, such as polluted air and water, which undermine the quality of their lives. Preventable and treatable diseases therefore take a massive toll on the poorest people. Over 2.3 million people, primarily in developing countries, die annually from eight vaccine-preventable diseases. An estimated 1.7 million people in growing countries die annually from disease linked to unsafe water and hygiene and poor hygiene. In many countries, the poor use tobacco burn rates are twice as high in the lowest income group when compared with the highest. The vicious sequence of ill health has a greater impact where deprived community is generally not enclosed by adequate health indemnity that protects their right of entry to health services./The impact of gender discrimination on health begins from the feotal stage with malnutrition in young pregnant women. The effects of malnutrition in babyhood and adolescence are chiefly devastating for girls. Girls who are malnourished during childhood are more likely to be malnourished as adolescents, to enter their first pregnancy malnourished, and to give birth to underweight babies whose learning capacities are stunted from nutritional deficiencies, thus perpetuating the sequence of hunger and poor healthiness. This effect is aggravated if the first pregnancy occurs for the duration of teenage years. Household food security, gender equity in access to food within households, gender-sensitive knowledge of nutrition and nutrition-related health practices and the child care that household members, both male and female, could provide, are crucial for overcoming childhood malnutrition, and ensuring that girls and women continue in the direction of be fairly and adequately nourished. Women are increasingly more prone to HIV infection than men. In earlier stages of the epidemic, the infection occurred predominantly among men. The numbers of HIV-positive women and men are now about equal. Smoking rates are lower among women than men. However, the tobacco industry is increasingly targeting women in mounting countries of the region where female roles include begun to change. Increased smoking among women is indicative of the triumph of such targeting, which fosters an association between smoking and imagery of setting free, slimness and sexual attraction. Generally, there are no sex differences in the prevalence of mental along with behavioral disorders. There is, however, a superior prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders among women. Women are inclined to experience considerable mental suffering because of reproductive health conditions in addition to problems. Here is also a strong association between mental disorders like gloominess, anxiety and stress-related syndromes with violence in the life of women./Teaching, especially girls' education, is key to addressing health disparities throughout the region. Education levels are low in South Asia, with the adult literacy rate at 57.6 per cent and the feminine literacy rate is only 40.8 per cent. Education is crucial if people are to obtain safer in addition to better employment; achieve greater levels of health literacy; understand the importance of sustainable food security in order to reduce malnutrition; take preventive health measures; and avoid high-risk behaviours. Adequate and appropriate teaching provides the tool for breaking out of the cycle of hunger and poverty. A girl having improved access to education is connected with better health for both women with their children./Due to declining fertility and increasing longevity, the Asian and Pacific region is experiencing a rapid increase in the proportion of the population aged 60 years and over. Much of the disease burden among older persons results from chronic NCDs that are difficult in addition to expensive to treat. Alzheimer's and senile dementia and such mental illnesses as gloominess occur predominantly in the ageing population. Cataract sightlessness is also more prevalent among older persons. On the other hand, the ageing inhabitants face increasing problems in accessing fitness services. Older persons are probable to exist most affected through the privatization of health services and the erosion of universal care from side to side publicly funded health systems, with an increased global emphasis on cost recovery. Most care for dependent older people is provided by relatives' members with scarce community-based resources and lacks quality assurance mechanisms and regulatory supplies in formal long-term care. The breakdown of family and community holds up systems associated with speedy urbanization and decreases in the ratio sandwiched between workers and elder dependants render the provision of aged care a challenge in much of the region where change is often abrupt and compensatory social services are weak. The advance of effective strategies has also been hampered by a lack of international policy focus on the well-being of older persons and the predominance of an unenthusiastic global instance of old age./Labour migration has grown rapidly and is increasingly important. Migration is occurring within country, across borders within the region. Inter-regional asylum seeker workers tend to be concentrated inside sectors of economic activity with little or no health safety or legal protection. They are particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses. Migrant workers often carry out jobs that entail higher risk, and are inadequately paid. Their status is impermanent and they encompass least recourse when illness, injury or other problems occur that necessitate medical attention. Most national health care devices do not cover up migrants, in particular unregistered ones./Inner migration from rural to urban areas and the urban transformation of rural settlements are important determinants of the high urban population development in less developed regions. The town population of the region is projected to increase dramatically. The urban poor suffer overfilling poor ventilation, lack of potable water, poor sanitation and inadequate nutrition. The infant mortality rate in a Manila slum was 2.8 times higher than that in non-squatter areas. In the slums of Dhaka, diarrhea was twice as prevalent as in rural Bangladesh. Anywhere to live is an important determinant of health that is linked through other determinants, such as poverty, urbanization and education. The housing atmosphere can impact health through its structure, provision for waste disposal, ventilation, covered air pollution, and the use of the home as a workplace and for the luggage compartment of dangerous chemicals. Throughout the region, construction activity and the volume of traffic have burgeoned, causing significantly higher noise levels, often without protection. Technological advancements in sound intensification systems are broadly used, with community announcement, broadcasts and melody organism part of the ever-present city noise./A lot of social groups are subjected to systematic stigmatization, favouritism and marginalization, which have a significant impact on their health status. Their access to health carrying weapons armed forces as well as the quality and suitability of services provided, and the amount that their views are respected in treatment options are affected by the attitudes and behavior of health service providers. For lots of access could also be clear-thinking from end to end care-givers. Stigmatization exerts a physically powerful influence on personal awareness of self-worth and the will to fight for one's right to be healthy. People living by resources of HIV/AIDS are often unable in the direction of obtain adequate health and other basic services. Similarly, many mentally ill people are rejected by their families, leading to their fetching homeless or outstanding abandoned in institutions. Women living with AIDS with women who are emotionally ill are likely to face greater obstacles; often their relations with their kids are forcibly severed./Populace with diverse disabilities has the same need for regular access to health services as non-disabled persons. However, they stand more challenges in securing that access due to bodily and in order barriers that occur from shame and bias./In situation of conflict and ecological disasters, morbidity and mortality related to injury, violence, accidents and destruction are common. The shock of displacement, sudden loss and physical trauma triggers mental health problems in the middle of many. Refugees typically experience high mortality following their displacement. Furthermore, health services may be disrupted, may restrict access exactly when the need for it escalates and conditions for disease e.g., diarrhea, cholera plus malaria outbreak have been created./Dr Mohammad Rajja is a medical doctor serving with Narayani Sub-Regional Hospital, Birgunj, Nepal.

Improving air quality,"Bangladesh, April 28 -- Newspapers in Bangladesh are never tired of reporting projects to be taken up for people's welfare. Such projects are always 'to be' but none knows when these will really be executed. In fact, the Dhakaites are sandwiched between 'to be' and 'not to be'. This is the irony./However, it should indeed be good news to hear that a $62.2 million Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) project will go a long way in improving air quality and safe traffic movement in Dhaka when it will be completed late next year. The World Bank (WB), the financier of the project, has found satisfactory progress in implementation of the project, which is targeted to be completed by mid-December, 2016./The project is seemingly making progress as some of its components like the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) feasibility study, installation of solar powered traffic signals in 62 high traffic intersections in Dhaka, construction of 15-foot over-bridges and reconstruction or repair of 60km sidewalks, drains and road improvements in Mohammadpur, Tejgaon and Khilgaon areas in Dhaka have been completed. Under the project, 11 Continuous Air Monitoring Stations (CAMS) in eight major cities has been built to keep track of the air pollution levels./The CAMS operate round the clock with expected data capture rate of 85 per cent. The Department of Environment is now preparing the daily Air Quality Index (AQI) based on the data generated from the CAMS./But the Dhakaites are yet to know who really follows data generated by CAMS to plan and implement other development projects. There must not be laxity on the part of the authorities in taking proper steps to improve air quality of cities in Bangladesh on a priority basis. An estimated seven million people die due to air pollution globally, with more than half of the deaths linked to indoor smoke from cooking stoves, according to a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO)./Pollution of air is now the single largest environmental health risk. The majority of the deaths associated with air pollution were due to heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. In the Southeast Asian region, the bulk of it, with 1.7 million premature deaths, was attributed to indoor air pollution. The sources for ambient pollution include diesel engines and industrial emissions. Sixty per cent of these deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases like stroke and heart disease./The WHO has already rated Bangladesh as the fourth among 91 countries with worst urban air quality. The DoE has set up air quality monitoring stations in eight cities, including Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Rajshahi, Chittagong, Khulna and Sylhet. Though Narayanganj has the highest level of gaseous pollutants, the air of the northern metropolis Rajshahi contains the highest level of dust particles. Among the gaseous pollutants which the DoE measures are carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and ozone (O3), methane and non-methane pollutants./Coordinated efforts of different concerned agencies are now badly needed to take pragmatic steps towards improving air quality of Dhaka, Rajshahi and other cities. Pollution, with the passage of every day, is rising in these cities alarmingly. Mere monitoring will not help; speedy actions to curb it brook no delay./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Give up tobacco for a safe and healthy life,"Bangladesh, May 30 -- Every year on May 31, World No Tobacco Day reminds us that tobacco causes health problems that include sickness, pain, grief, and misery due to various diseases and involves many medical costs for the treatment. In addition to medical costs, there are other indirect costs including loss of productivity, fire damage, and environmental harm etc. The day is observed every year in the member countries with a theme selected by the WHO. The theme of the World No Tobacco Day for 2015 is 'Stop illicit trade of tobacco'. World No Tobacco Day provides an opportunity to create attention and action for all the partner countries, non-government organizations, and individuals in every community to work together for a tobacco-free environment that can ensure better health./The global tobacco epidemic kills nearly 6 million poeple each year of which more than 600,000 are non-smokers dying from breathing second-hand smoke. Unless proper steps are taken, the epidemic will kill more than 8 million people every year by 2030 and more than 80% of these preventable deaths will be among people living in low and middle-income countries./In Bangladesh, 43% of adults use some form of tobacco. Smokeless tobacco is used by 28% of women and 26% of men, whereas 45% of men and 1.5% of women smoke cigarettes. Some 57,000 people die every year from tobacco related diseases and 382,000 people suffer from diseases and disabilities due to use of tobacco. At this scenario, as a member country, Bangladesh will also observe the day in a befittig manner to materialze the WHO strategies and policies for the health benefit of the people./Why innocent non-smokers will be vulnerable to the deadly habit of smoking: This is a question why at no fault of the non-smokers they will be vulnerable to the deadly habit of smoking. It is fact that non-smokers cannot be safe so long there are smokers around. In anyway if non-smokers happen to inhale the air polluted by tobacco smokers they run the same risk as the smokers do for having the adverse effect of smoking. This is called second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is the smoke that fills restaurants, offices or other compact spaces when people burn tobacco products such as cigarettes, bidis and water pipes. WHO facts reveal that there are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke of which at least 250 are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory disease, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death and in pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places. Over 40 per cent of children have at least one smoking parent. Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care, and hinder economic development. As such, steps have been taken by various governments to protect the rights of the non-smokers. In our country non-smokers' rights have been protected in the tobacco control law./Tobacco accelerates poverty: Tobacco and poverty create a vicious circle. Tobacco use is higher among the poor. Poor familires, in turn spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco. Money spent on tobacco deprives the family of basic human needs such as food, shelter, education, and health care. Tobacco accelerates poverty among users and their families since tobacco users are at much higher risk of falling ill and dying prematurely of cancers, heart attacks, respiratory diseases or other tobacco-induced diseases./Specific goals of the World No Tobacco Day 2015: Raise awareness on the harm to people's health caused by the illicit trade of tobacco products, show how health care gains and programmes, tobcco control policies like increased tax and prices, pictorial health warnings and other measures are undermined by the illicit trade in tobacco products, demonstrate how the tobacco industry is involved in the illicit trade of tobacco products, highlight how the illicit trade of tobacco products is a means of accumulating wealth for criminal groups to finance other organized crime activities including drugs, human and arms trafficking, as well as terrorism and hinder promote WHO framework convention on tobacco control./Taxes help reduce tobacco use: WHO studies show that tobacco taxes are the most effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among young people and poor people. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10 per cent decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 per cent in high-income countries and by up to 8 per cent in low-and middle-income countries. Tax structure on cigarettes in Bangladesh is based on 4 stages, the lowest being 40% and the highest 60%. The supplementary duty/tax on bidis ranges between 20% and 25% depending on whether it has filter or not. In the last budget, it was sought to impose 1 per cent health development surcharge on all imported and domestically produced tobacco products for utilizing the fund collected from this source on the treatment of the victims of tobacco related diseases. This was a praiseworthy step, but it has to be higher and effectively introduced for the health and welfare of the people./Revolutionary steps by the Government: Bangladesh Government is working seriously towards implementation of the tobacco control law, which resulted in passing of the Tobacco Control Amendment Bill by the Parliament in April 2013 over the many loopholes of previous law. This was an important step in the history of tobacco control movement in Bangladesh. The features of the law are: the scope of tobacco control measures have been extended to include smokeless tobacco products, graphic/pictorial health warnings, covering 50% of the surface, on both tobacco packet sides (also chewing tobacco and bidis) are included. The fine for smoking at public places or transports has been increased from 50 taka to 300 taka. Establishment of the National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) at the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is a milestone, which works for the proper implementation of the law, monitor tobacco control activities, research on tobacco control and do related activities/actions on tobacco control for the health and welfare of the people./Tobacco users need help to quit: WHO fact reveals that smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most of them want to quit the deadly habit. As nicotine exists in tobacco, it becomes difficult on the part of the smokers to quit. Nevertheless, counselling, cooperation from the near and dear ones, medication and various awareness measures can help a smoker to quit the habit./The history of tobaco control movement in Bangladesh is glorious. With the establishment of NTCC (National Tobacco Control Cell) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the movement got strong footing. WHO theme, ""Stop illicit trade of Tobacco"" on the day is an opportunity for all involved in tobacco control programme. Different NGOs, health personnel, policymakers, social workers, academic institutions, and individuals are working towards a tobacco-free environment. We have many achievements in this regard. Nevertheless, we have to work against tobacco until the last victory. Working together, we shall be able to quit tobacco for a safe and healthy life for all./M A Jabbar writes on health and environment issues and is executive secretary of ADHUNIK, national anti-tobacco organisation of Bangladesh/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Utilising the potential of household plantation,"Bangladesh, Aug. 30 -- The importance of plants in our life can hardly be overemphasized. People depend on plants to meet their basic needs like food, clothing, shelter, and health care. These needs are multiplying because of a growing population, increasing incomes, and urbanization./Plants not only provide food, they also feed the livestock which is then consumed itself. In addition, plants provide timber and raw materials for many types of pharmaceuticals, as well as tobacco, coffee, alcohol, and other drugs. Approximately 2.5 billion people in the world still rely on subsistence farming to satisfy their basic needs, while the rest are tied into increasingly complex production and distribution systems to provide food, timber, fuel, and other plant-derived commodities./In Bangladesh, trees are fast disappearing to make way for indiscriminate and unplanned massive urbanization. The land area of the country is too small compared to its population. Income has also been increasing rapidly throughout most of the world at the same time. As income grows, plants become more valuable because people want to buy more and higher-quality products to satisfy basic needs. Plant blindness is the inability to see or notice the plants in one's own environment. The inability to recognize the importance of plants in the biosphere, and in human affairs, leads to the erroneous conclusion that they are unworthy of human consideration./A recent survey conducted by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reveals that on average of 167.4 million cubic feet of wood, worth about Tk.64.07 billion, is annually produced in the country. More than 1.0 million bamboos are also produced annually which is worth Tk.23.07 billion. Rural families chop bamboos from bamboo bushes and sell those in the market at times to meet family requirement./In this sense, bamboo bushes are a kind of insurance for rural families. Plants are mainly used as fuel by rural households. According to BBS, about 5.2 million tons of fuel woods are produced in the country per year which is worth Tk.46.50 billions. People in rural areas spend more in terms of fuel than their urban counterparts where the urban households use gas as fuel which is another major cause of disparity between towns and villages./Bangladesh saves substantially in terms of imports due to its reliance on traditional fuel. Otherwise we would have to import huge volume of kerosene from outside to fill the void. BBS survey further revealed that 1552 tons of rubber worth about Tk.55 millions is produced in the country every year. Production would have been higher if better utilization of land leased out for rubber plantation, could be ensured. In addition, there is a value addition of Tk.123.90 billion from backyard plantations by households./In this way about 2.06 million of households of the country are enriching the economy through tree plantations. Each household plants different variety of trees on a minimum of 5.0 decimal land space each. Wood, fuel wood and rubber are mainly produced from trees and plants and each household contributes to GDP (gross domestic product) by marketing them. Nearly 54 per cent of trees are planted around homesteads. Hundreds of nurseries have developed out of people's interest in tree plantation. For many families, these nurseries have become the main source of income. But we have not been able to fully utilize the potential of household plantation./About 2.0 million households are associated with tree plantations. Considering that each household consists of five members, about 12.5 million people are dependent on tree plantation, either fully or partly, which constitutes only a small fraction of a population of 160 million people. It is the responsibility of the state to provide assistance to increase the number of people engaged in tree plantation and create awareness thereof. Utility of plants and trees is not just limited to wood or fuel wood, plants control air pollution and add to the beauty of nature. Fruits are also available from trees. Pharmaceutical plants help cure diseases. Evidently, although plants and trees have multiple benefits, we have not been able to capitalize on one tenth or even less of the potential./Assuming that 1000 trees are planted every year and that the same number of trees are chopped each year, production will remain the same after every 20 years and stock of trees is also retained in equal quantities. If this formula is followed by all, there will never be deficit of trees in Bangladesh. But this is not always possible due to situations of unemployment, sickness, children's wedding, house repair and things like that for poor households when one is compelled to chop trees to meet the above costs. The economists will have to think about a pragmatic solution to this problem./The possibility of insurance against hypothecation of trees or introduction of plant preservation insurance should be explored. Crop insurance is in practice in many countries of the world. In conclusion, more trees will have to be planted to accelerate poverty alleviation, maintain ecological balance and protect people from various diseases./<a href=""mailto:saleh.akram26@gmail.com"">saleh.akram26@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

"High BP, bad diet leading cause of death worldwide: Study","Bangladesh, Sept. 13 -- Poor dietary habits and high blood pressure have replaced child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe water, sanitation and lack of hand washing as leading risks for death globally, a significant study has revealed. After looking at 79 risk factors for death in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013, the team from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington and University of Melbourne found that there has been a profound change in risk factors for death. ""There is great potential to improve health by avoiding certain risks like smoking and poor diet as well as tackling environmental risks like air pollution,"" said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray. A wide range of avoidable risk factors to health - ranging from air pollution to poor diets to unsafe water - account for a growing number of deaths and a significant amount of disease burden. The new risk factors contributed to almost 31 million deaths worldwide in 2013, up from 25 million deaths in 1990, revealed the 25-year study of Global Burden of Disease data./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

3.7m die of heart ailments annually in Southeast Asia: WHO,"Bangladesh, Sept. 27 -- The World Health Organization (WHO) says cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease and stroke, are the world's number one killers, claiming 17.5 million lives a year globally./In the WHO South-East Asia Region, which groups 11 countries including Bangladesh, cardiovascular diseases cause an estimated 3.7 million deaths annually, or one fourth of all deaths. One third of these deaths from cardiovascular diseases is premature and occurs among those aged less than 70 years./""The good news is that the majority of premature deaths due to cardiovascular disease can be prevented through simple measures, such as consuming a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding tobacco and alcohol, and by managing stress,"" says WHO's Regional Director for South East Asia, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh./In a message on the occasion of the World Heart Day, Dr Poonam urges all sectors of government and society to create heart-friendly environments and provide heart-healthy choices for all individuals, where they live, work and play./Examples of heart friendly environments, she says, may include the availability of healthy food, smoke-free zones and avenues for physical activity that should be available in public spaces, schools, workplaces and communities, a BSS report said./WHO Representative to Bangladesh Dr N Paranietharan says Bangladesh has a mortality of 179 per 100,000 populations under 70 years age among men and 152 per 100,000 in women from cardiovascular diseases (CVD). ""This gives us a clue that CVDs have a large potential of preventability,"" he said./Dr Paranie suggested for consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as food with low salt and saturated fat to minimize risks of high blood pressure and associated diseases./He also underscored the need for effective utilization of primary healthcare and engagement of non-health sectors at the upazila level to face the challenge./According to WHO, heart disease among women, which remains under-recognized and under-treated, needs to be taken into account seriously./In south-east Asia, exposure to household air pollution from using solid fuels for cooking substantially increases the risk of heart diseases for women. Almost 60 percent of households in the Region use solid fuels as a primary source for cooking./The WHO Region for South-East Asia has, however, set a target for reducing premature mortality from cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by 25 percent within 2025 and has developed a regional action plan to achieve this target./A cohesive action and collaboration is also needed beyond the health sector to reduce women's risk of cardiovascular diseases, WHO observes./The World Heart Day is observed each year on 29 September to aware and intensifies actions for effectively addressing the rising burden of cardiovascular diseases and other non-communicable diseases across the globe.

"Gridlock causes $12.561b loss a year, says BoI study","Bangladesh, Nov. 13 -- Traffic congestion in the capital eats up about US$ 12.561 billion a year, said a study report conducted by an official of Board of Investment (BoI). The estimated loss is around 7.0 per cent of the country's GDP (gross domestic product)./""If there is no traffic congestion, the country's GDP growth rate would be around 13 per cent,"" said BoI deputy director (DD) Sonjoy Chakraborty while presenting his study report at a seminar titled 'Traffic Congestion in Dhaka City and its Economic Impact' on Thursday./According to the study, the country's per capita income will also increase to $1,392 from the present $1,314, if there is no traffic congestion./The total congestion cost is around double of the country's total annual development outlay and very near to the remittance and development budgets, it also mentions./The study estimates the total congestion loss by analysing travel time cost, cost of excess fuel burnt, revenue loss by passenger transport operators, environmental damage, and cost of traffic accidents./The BoI DD identified inadequate road network, simultaneous presence of motorised and non-motorised vehicles on same street, illegal occupancy of footpath, lack of traffic management, unplanned growth of the city, and wrecked roads as well as encroachment of roads and sideways as some of the major reasons that are causing the nagging traffic jam./To overcome the problem, the study suggested curbing movement of people to Dhaka, decentralisation of administration, empowering local government, ensuring adequate public transport system, imposing more tax on private vehicles, and construction of flyover on railway level-crossings./BoI Executive Chairman Dr S A Samad presided over the seminar. He highlighted the urgency for strict enforcement of traffic rules to bring discipline in traffic management system./The BoI chairman identified powerful and influential people as major violators of traffic rules. ""State is afraid of taking any measure against these people. The main cause of the deadlock is lack of enforcement of laws because of fear, not the coordination.""/""The capital is now dying. We have to find out the causes and take actions immediately to save it,"" said Mr. Samad, urging all stakeholders to obey the traffic rules./Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) secretary M Shawkat Ali also stressed the need for strengthening the transport authority's capacity to check plying unfit vehicles on roads and highways across the country./He pointed out that the number of private cars has increased substantially whereas that of public transport has decreased./""There were as many as 7,000 public buses in Dhaka eight years ago, but the number has come down to 3,500 at present,"" he added./Deputy Chief of the Ministry of Environment and Forest Shamsur Rahman also expressed his concern over the serious air pollution in the city, caused by its transport sector, which is the main cause behind cardio-vascular diseases of city dwellers./The seminar was addressed, among others, by Notre Dame College Economics Department Chairman Prof. Azizur Rahman, Bangladesh Overseas Employment and Services Ltd managing director Md.

Natural environmental scenario of Dhaka city,"Bangladesh, Nov. 14 -- A walk by the river Buriganga or a train ride from Kamalapur in the capital city of Dhaka up to Tangail would just upset one's sense of smell. Stench oozing out of 'biologically dead' water-bodies fills the air all along. The waters of the river flowing by the capital and the ditches and streams along the rail route are all pitch-dark, sending out stomach-upsetting foul odours. The other rivers around the capital and its environments are also rotting with indiscriminate discharge of waste and sewage: solid and liquid, household, medical, and industrial./Country's eminent campaigners for 'Save Buriganga, Save Lives' civil-society movement says, ""Unfortunately, all these bad things - encroachment, dumping of industrial waste and other abuses - occur in full knowledge of the authorities. The water of the Buriganga is now so polluted that all fish have died, and increasing filth and human waste have turned it like a black gel. Even rowing across the river is now difficult for it smells so badly. The pollutants have eaten up all oxygen in the Buriganga and we call it biologically dead. It is like a septic tank. There is no fish or aquatic life in this river apart from zero-oxygen-survival kind of organisms""./Chemicals such as cadmium and chromium, and other elements such as mercury carried by the industrial waste are also creeping into the groundwater, posing a serious threat to public health. Now the selfsame authorities are taking up a dredging project for the Buriganga and its sisters to replicate such clean-up. Among the other rivers pushed into the rot are the Turag, the Balu and the Sitalakhya. All are arteries of the capital city of Dhaka, which are being polluted by pollutants of all sorts before the nose of all authorities concerned. Everyone of the onlookers is thus getting endangered through such slow-poisoning. The polluters going unpunished are tanneries, chemical and other jerry-built industrial units at the city heart, Dhaka city corporations' garbage-disposal section, DWASA's sewerage authorities and industries mushrooming sans effluent-treatment plant (ETP) in the belt around the capital of the country./Additionally, air and noise pollution also took a serious turn, amid smog and veritable dust cloud at some places, particularly construction sites, and the honking of gaggles of vehicles. Sound pollution has been the bane of Dhaka dwellers in recent times. Traffic horns, sounds of vehicles, use of micro-phones and many other sound sources are going out in the city or staying at home is painful. Green activists say that though there is Sound Pollution (Control) Rules (2006) to cut sound pollution, it is hardly enforced. The Department of Environment (DoE), city corporations, RAJUK, local government bodies and law enforcing agencies may take necessary steps to stop the menace of sound pollution that harms people's health, causing hearing loss or mental stress and even hypertensions - especially among children and elderly citizens./Hell with industrialisation without proper zoning. The green campaigners point out that indiscriminate building of industries is proscribed in all international and national laws, including the Kyoto Protocol. Life first, health first and industry must come thereafter at this stage of national economic development around the globe. A morning spot visit to BSMMU, Ibrahim Memorial Hospital's both sections - cardiac and diabetes - and diagnostic centres, to name a few, would give one a cue to the curse of living in untidy, filthy, unhealthy, polluted environment that prevails in Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka./Thousands are thronging there - many with diabetic complications or with mortal ailment like heart, kidney and liver diseases, and cancer. Aggregate cost of treatment for the critical ones outweighs profit from the industries that spew untreated toxic wastes into the environment, into the rivers. Government-set deadlines for ETP installation under a law and relocation of industries, particularly tanneries from the city's Hazaribagh to Savar, chemical and garment factories, have fallen dead. Reasons shown are aplenty. A subtle one borders on a motive for making some gains from these schemes, too, in the form of cash handouts from the state exchequer./There are thoughts and projects on paper, including a Japanese funded one, for Dhaka's garbage disposal in modern methods. These household wastes - and even some medical ones - that litter city streets were supposed to be converted to commodities, like fertilizer and power. Up till now, city-dwellers have to cover their nose with handkerchief or facial tissue while walking down roads and lanes. Rubbish keeps rotting in open piles, emitting stench./For salvaging the endangered rivers, clean-up projects have been executed spending tens of millions of Takas. Allegations have it that much of the money spent for the purpose went down the drain. The filth dug up from riverbeds is largely landed down again into the rivers. Water engineers and architects including the country's leading environmental activists, are among experts who are bitterly critical of such piecemeal solution. A recent proposal from China for undertaking a comprehensive 'river-restoration' project for reviving the rivers around Dhaka city to their natural flows is hanging up in the air./A World Bank study says the aforesaid four major rivers - viz Buriganga, Sitalakhya, Turag and Balu - near Dhaka receive 1.5 million cubic metres of waste water every day from 7,000 industrial units in surrounding areas and another 500 thousand cubic metres from other sources like sewerage waste. Unabated encroachment that prevents the free flow of rivers' water, the dumping of medicinal waste and waste of river passengers have compounded the problem making the water unusable for humans and livestock also./A major therapy to clean the rivers around Dhaka city, garbage and waste management and control air pollution is a must. Such remedy seems not to be the cup of tea for those who had improvised in the past. Recently Dhaka has been damned to 'second-worst livable' city in the world in international ratings after the civil war ravaged Syrian capital Damascus. Second-or third-best one may not be an idle jest. Dhaka is placed - by nature and the rulers' centuries back - in one of the best settings of cities in the globe. But now piles of garbage on Dhaka city roads and the bitterly polluted surrounding rivers make life hell here. Why not try to turn it around?/The writer is a retired Professor of Economics, BCS General Education Cadre.

Climate change will throw more people into poverty,"Bangladesh, Nov. 16 -- On November 08, 2015 the World Bank said that climate change could drive over 100 million people more into poverty by 2030 in absence of right policies to keep the poor safe from extreme weather and rising sea level. In a report the bank said, if global warming and its effects on the poor were not accounted for in development efforts to end poverty - one of 17 new UN goals adopted in September 2015 - would be impossible to achieve. It added that the aim of keeping the rise of global temperature within an internationally agreed limit of 2 degrees Celsius is not an ambitious plan. To reduce the effects of climate change, efforts must also cushion poor people from any negative repercussions./The World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement that ""Climate change hits the poorest the hardest, and our challenge now is to protect tens of millions of people from falling into extreme poverty because of a changing climate"". If development progresses slowly the bank's estimated victim of another 100 million poor by 2030 is on top of 900 million expected to be living in extreme poverty. The World Bank senior director for climate change John Roome said that in 2015, the bank puts the number of poor at 702 million people. Climate change is already hurting them through decreased crop yields, floods washing away assets and livelihoods, and a bigger threat of diseases like malaria. He described ending poverty and tackling climate change as ""the defining issues of our generation"". He told, ""The best way forward is to tackle poverty alleviation and climate change in an integrated strategy""./Since the main assets of the poor people are often their makeshift homes and degrading land, and their losses are largely uninsured, the poor families are more vulnerable to climate stresses than the rich. Low-income households in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are particularly at serious risk of having their hard-won gains wiped out by climate-linked disasters, forcing them back into extreme poverty. The report warns that, climate policies can do little to alter the amount of global warming that will happen, between now and 2030, making it vital to invest more in adaptation measures and broader ways to make people more resilient. A payout from a regional catastrophe risk scheme helped speed the response when Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu this March 2015. A national programme providing cash and food in return for work on community projects was quickly expanded when drought in Ethiopia led to a hunger crisis in 2011./In the next 15 years, the report said that better health coverage and social safety nets for all, together with targeted improvements such as early warning systems and hardier crops, flood defences could prevent or offset most of the negative effects of climate change on poverty. Stephane Hallegatte, a senior World Bank economist who led the team that prepared the report said that ""We have a window of opportunity to achieve our poverty objectives in the face of climate change, provided we make wise policy choices now"". Roome highlighted the need to roll out good policies faster, and ensure development projects consider climate projections, so that new infrastructure is not damaged in the future. The report, released ahead of a UN climate summit from November 30, 2015 to December 11, 2015 where a new deal to curb global warming is due to be agreed, warned that adaptation limits beyond 2030, the world's ability to adapt to unabated climate change will be limited,/The World Bank said that immediate policies are needed that will bring emissions to zero by the end of this twenty-first century to rein in the longer-term impacts on poverty. Some of those will have benefits for the poor, such as more energy efficiency, cleaner air and better public transport facilities. Others could increase energy and food prices, which represent a large share of poor people's expenditures. But, it added, policy shifts need not threaten short-term progress against poverty provided they are well-designed and international support is made available./The report also said that for example, savings from eliminating fossil fuel subsidies could be reinvested in assistance schemes to help poor families cope with higher fuel costs. Or governments could introduce carbon or energy taxes and recycle the revenues through a universal cash transfer that would benefit the poor. The international community can help by providing financial and technological support for things like crop research, public transport, insurance schemes, and weather forecasting systems./In the meanwhile ministers and negotiators from more than 75 nations have made headway in talks ahead of a crunch UN climate summit. But France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius said on November 10, 2015 that the ""the task ahead is considerable"". Laurent Fabius, who will preside over the conference in Paris to be held from November 30, 2015 to December 11, 2015, told after the three days of talks that ended on November 10, 2015 had been an important step and ""progress has been made on at least five points"". But he warned, ""the task ahead is considerable""./The UN climate chief Christiana Figueres added, ""It continues to be entirely possible to come to an agreement... despite all the challenges in front of us."" Fabius announced that 117 heads of state and government - including US President Barack Obama, China's Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi of India and Russia's Vladimir Putin - have confirmed they will attend the summit, tasked with inking a pact to stave off dangerous levels of global warming. A rough draft of that hoped-for agreement has been drawn up by rank-and-file diplomats. The ministers are set to sign the final deal at the end of the Conference of Parties (COP) in Paris. The deal will be underpinned by national pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels blamed for climate change. The ""pre-COP"" meeting sought to identify areas of potential compromise on issues still dividing global nations and thereby avoid a repeat of the 2009 Copenhagen summit which ended without a binding global pact./Laurent Fabius said that there was momentum towards ensuring that countries ratchet up their efforts to slash carbon pollution beyond pledges submitted ahead of the summit. He said that ""A review should take place every five years... to prepare an upward revision of national plans"". Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude oil exporter, filed its climate pledge on November 10, 2015, saying up to 130 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year would be ""avoided"" by 2030. ""'Matter of survival' - Current national plans would yield average global temperatures three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times-far beyond the 2 degree Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) limit that scientists say is the threshold for dangerous warming. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru's environment minister, told that ""The COP21 will put in place the mechanism to close the gap. Getting to 2 degree Celsius depends on boosting our ambition"". Fabius said that enshrining the principle that nations would not be allowed to backtrack on their carbon-cutting promises is also gaining ground./Another make-or-break issue on the table in the three-day talks was money for developing nations to help them decarbonise their economies, and shore up defences against unavoidable climate impacts. Thoriq Ibrahim, Minister of the Environment and Energy for the Maldives, one of many small island states whose very existence is threatened by rising seas, told that ""Climate finance was very central"" to the discussions and ""Adaptation is a matter of survival for us. Nobody wants to leave the Maldives, we are there to stay""./African leaders said they were looking forward to the talks for solutions to electrify their continent, grow its economies and keep their young people from fleeing abroad. The 195-nation UN climate forum has officially adopted the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degree Celsius. But many vulnerable and poor nations are pushing for that threshold to be lowered to 1.5 degree Celsius. Recent scientific studies have shown that even if the 2 degree Celsius goal is attained, the impact could be devastating in many parts of the world. According to a study published by Climate Central, a US-based research group, a 2-degree Celsius rise would submerge land currently occupied by 280 million people, while an increase of 4 degree Celsius would cover areas home to 600 million. Bangladesh is also one of the highly climate change venerable countries in the world./But one thing is certain that monetary compensation to the affected poor countries by the rich countries is not the solution to the climate problem since the entire globe is in danger of climate warming since air pollution and climate warming know no boundary. For example, developed American and European countries are of late experiencing the bite of climate change. Climate change is a global problem and it has to be faced globally through globally avoiding green house gas emission to save global population from extinction./The writer is a retired professor of Economics, BCS General Education Cadre./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Dust pollution and its effects,"Bangladesh, Nov. 25 -- Two news items carried in this newspaper on Sunday last point to a problem, serious enough but hardly treated as such. The two pieces of news concern air pollution and the diseases caused by it. One of those focuses on pulmonary complaints children under five years of age in particular suffer from. In fact, it was on the occasion of holding the 4th Child Pulmocon-2015 Conference at the Krishibid Institution in the capital that the experts in child care disclosed an alarming trend of respiratory problems among the children of such a tender age. As high as 67 per cent children suffer from pulmonary problems such as pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and tuberculosis. However the conference was not told what proportion of this high percentage suffers from congenital and pollution-related respiratory problems./Environmental activists who launched a campaign against dust pollution, however, have come up with the cost of the massive invasion by dust in terms of economy and environmental damage. They figure out that on an average a family in the city has to spend an extra amount between Tk 4,000 -Tk 10,000 on treatment of illness caused by dust pollution. The highest amount is good enough for maintaining a poor family in the slum. Its long-term effect is graver still. The extra water and detergent used for cleaning up houses and clothes get drained into rivers, lakes and other water bodies causing harm to biodiversity./Clearly, dust plays a major role in fouling the air quality in the city where vehicles -many of them unworthy of road and belching out black smokes - run without maintaining discipline and various agencies leave sands and earth in piles after digging roads. That such a high percentage of children suffer from respiratory problems is unacceptable in the first place. The diseases catalogued point to the fact that many of those are dust and polluted air-related and can largely be avoided if dust and pollution are contained in a systematic manner. One of the conditions for this is to turn the city greener as much as possible within limitations. Plantation of trees along the roads is one of the preconditions. Then the agencies digging roads must not be allowed to leave gaping holes and earth and sand piled up on roadside. A few more treatment of roads and other vacant spaces can almost do away with the collection of huge amount of dust everyday./All this is meant to putting in place a preventive system. As for the curative part of the illness suffered by children, the inadequacy of facilities has figured out prominently. Although there exists a body called the Bangladesh Paediatric Pulmonology Forum (BPPF), not one single hospital has a separate and well-equipped pulmonology department. Then most of the hospitals do not even have paediatric intensive care unit too. In a situation like this, children admitted to a hospital for pulmonary complications can hardly expect the right treatment at the right time. As the high percentage of child patients suggests, there is a need for developing a system where children can be given the best care for respiratory diseases. A few of these diseases simply do not allow children to grow normally and become strong enough in their adolescent life. So attention should be given to both preventive and curative aspects of the problem./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Of tobacco farming and public smoking,"Bangladesh, Jan. 9 -- Except a few highly restricted zones, smoking goes on unabated as before in the country. In both large and small cities, crowded places are filled with smokers. The government's occasional warning to people against smoking in public and declaring the practice a legal offence now sounds like an old ritual. The authorities have repeatedly announced its resolve to slap fines on public-place smokers. But people in the urban areas go on smoking cigarettes with careless abandon. Tobacco smoke plays a considerable role in aggravating our big cities' air pollution. Then there is the lethal hazard of passive smoking./The unbridled smoking in public places stands in sharp contrast to the government's anti-smoking stance, wobbly though. True, the authorities concerned have taken a few tangible steps. Those include, notably, the banning of advertisements of cigarettes in the mass media. The billboards publicising the pleasure of tobacco smoking have also disappeared. The government passed a tobacco control law in 2005. Smoking has been prohibited on many important premises. Yet the areas around schools and kindergartens have not been made off-limits to smoking passers-by. That the government and the other authorities are still failing us on prevention of smoking in public is stark reality. In the meantime, the fight of anti-smoking activists appears to be stuck in an exercise in futility./The smoking scenario has of late witnessed a distressing development. According to media reports, vast areas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) are now being used for cultivating tobacco. Citing the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) statistics, anti-tobacco campaigners say in the 2012-13 farming season tobacco was cultivated on 70,000 hectares of land. In 2013-14, the acreage grew to 108,000 hectares. In the year of 2014-15, an additional 38, 000 hectares came under tobacco growing. Anti-tobacco activists blame the lack of an effective tobacco farming control policy for the continued increase in its cultivation./In the past, the country's northern districts were considered as a region fertile for tobacco growing. In a few decades the focus has been shifted to the CHT pockets inhabited by mostly poverty-stricken farmers. A number of cigarette companies have allegedly been providing incentives to them to cultivate tobacco. In the recent years, scores of peasants have been lured into tobacco farming. It is said to be more lucrative than cultivation of other crops. The fact that the switching over to tobacco from the major crops emerges as a threat to food security eludes them. There is none around to clarify the bitter reality to the innocent farmers. The tobacco companies do their best to hide from them the damages caused by tobacco smoke to human health and the environment. Maybe due to this, the government campaigns to encourage farmers to grow alternative crops are failing. Many people smell a rat in the whole game. They point the finger at a nexus between tobacco enterprises and a section of unscrupulous quarters in the administration./The government in principle has long been engaged in an all-out war on tobacco use. It has ratified the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The convention aims to enforce tobacco control measures./Given this principled stand on tobacco, a steady increase in the plant's cultivation and feet-dragging on restricting smoking confounds many. The government should act --- the earlier the better./<a href=""mailto:shihabskr@ymail.com"">shihabskr@ymail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

It's time to address climate change issues,"Bangladesh, Jan. 9 -- Geographically, Bangladesh is located in the tropical region and is trapped between the Himalayas in the north and the Bay of Bengal to the south. Therefore, the country is most vulnerable to natural disasters due to frequency of extreme climate events. Natural disasters are a common phenomenon and till today Bangladesh faced frequent disasters. Climate change is the main reason behind it. The nature generously endowed the land with seasonal varieties, plenty of natural beauties, rivers, canals, hills, islands etc. But climate change due to global warming, deforestation, environmental pollution and overpopulation pose significant risks for Bangladesh./The first and foremost reason behind climate changes in Bangladesh is global warming. The planet is warming from North Pole to South Pole. The heat is not only melting mountain glaciers and sea ice; it's also shifting precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) patterns. So, climate change causes impacts of higher temperatures, more variable precipitation, more extreme weather events and sea level rise that are already felt in Bangladesh and will continue to intensify. As a result of climate change, the country is frequently facing natural calamities like floods, droughts, cyclones, tornadoes, excessive downpours etc every year. These changes are already having major impacts on the economic performance of Bangladesh and on the lives and livelihoods of millions of poor people./In Bangladesh, climate change is affecting the country's rapidly progressing economy including agriculture and food security, human health, coastal zones, ecosystems and biodiversity, communication and water resources./Agriculture is the key economic driver in Bangladesh and it is predicted that climate change could have devastating impact on this vital sector. As a result of changed rainfall patterns, crop yields are expected to drop significantly. Production of rice and wheat will be reduced by 8.8 per cent and 32 per cent respectively within 2050. Almost the whole coastal belt along the Bay of Bengal is experiencing salinity problem due to penetration of sea water as sea-level rises. Salinity causes reduction in crop production significantly. The predicted sea-level rise will threaten valuable coastal agricultural land that might lower crop production. Dropped crop output will threaten food security in Bangladesh. Moreover, if the water temperature rises to more than 32degC due to planet warming, death rate of shrimp fingerlings will increase and diseases of fishes may increase. Carp (fish) culture may be reduced due to saline water intrusion in the ponds and open water bodies. Production of sweet water fish will shrink and become extinct if the sea level rises./Biodiversity would be reduced in some of the most fragile environments such as the Sundarbans and tropical forests. About 75 per cent area of mangrove forest, the Sundarbans (60,007 sq. km) will be submerged if the sea level increases by 45 cm. If the sea level rises by one metre, then the islands of the Bay of Bengal and the whole Sundarbans will be destroyed including its fauna and flora./If the sea level rises, low-lying non-embankment coastal areas may be completely inundated. Beside this, flood, river erosion and mudslides due to climate change will engulf enormous agriculture fields and homesteads that will make the people homeless and compelled to migrate to towns as climate refugees bringing severe problems for the city dwellers./More floods will definitely contaminate water and will increase water-borne diseases. On the other hand, more droughts will cause decrease in food production and scarcity of drinking water that will increase malnutrition. More greenhouse gases will increase air pollution which is responsible for rising respiratory and non-communicable diseases. Rise of temperature will favour pest and insecticides that will increase dengue, malaria etc./Excessive downpours and floods cause water logging, drainage congestion as well as infrastructure damages in Dhaka, Chittagong and other low-lying areas of urban centres in Bangladesh which will jeopardise transportation, trade, commerce and utility services for several days. It should be mentioned that around 40 per cent of the urban population in Bangladesh lives in slums of the major cities which are highly prone to disaster risks during flooding and excessive rains./In a high-density country like Bangladesh, the effects of climate change on surface and ground water resources will be very severe and alarming. Changes in water resources and hydrology will have a significant impact on the country's economy where people mostly depend on surface water for irrigation, fishery, industrial production, navigation and similar other activities./Last but not the least, the implications of climate change on the economy of Bangladesh are quite serious. The government wants to offer its people a standard of living comparable to that in the middle-income countries by 2021. It is trying hard to alleviate poverty in the country. Leading US TV channel CNN published a report that says that Bangladesh will be the third country in the world in terms of achieving higher growth rate in 2016. It says the expected growth rate of the country in 2016 will be 6.8 per cent that will be higher than that of China. But then the country's economic growth mostly depends on growth in agriculture. If agriculture production falls considerably due to devastating impact of climate change, it will affect adversely economic growth of the country. Moreover, there would be negative impact on exports. There will also be inflationary pressure on the economy. On the other hand, a number of ultra poor people would increase due to the adverse impact of climate change./The government invested more than $10 billion during the past 35 years to make Bangladesh less vulnerable to natural disasters. Despite these efforts, the direct annual cost of natural disasters over the last 10 years is estimated to be between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent of Bangladesh's GDP. The economic impacts of future climate change are expected to be larger and could even reverse the recent gains in the areas of economic growth. We can not resist natural disasters but we can minimise its huge costs by working sincerely and unitedly with the government efforts./The writer works for primary education in Bangladesh/<a href=""mailto:auparbayazidkhan@gmail.com"">auparbayazidkhan@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

How to protect your skin from pollution,"Bangladesh, Jan. 16 -- Pollution is the buzzword in skincare for 2016, thanks to new research into exactly what it does to your skin. It's not all doom and smoggy gloom though, as it's easy to protect yourself with the latest air defences./So, why is everyone talking about pollution?/Clearly nobody ever thought dirty air was great for skin, but now we know exactly why it can add years on to you. A quick science fact - air pollution is made up of particles that love latching onto your face. Some bind to the fats in your skin, while others are tiny enough to slip in through your pores./Icky, admittedly. But how bad can a bit of mucky air be?/Very. First of all, pollution attacks the skin barrier; so your first line of defence is breached. Moisture drains away and skin gets dry and rough. A weakened barrier also leaves you wide open to skin allergies, so you can suddenly react to products you've used for years./Is pollution actually going to make me look old?/Afraid so. Pollutant particles trigger free radicals, which cause the same sort of ageing that too much sun can lead to. It's not just a case of early onset wrinkles either. ""There's a link between air pollution and pigmentation spots on the forehead and cheeks, which previously were thought to be caused solely by the sun,"" says pollution expert Dr Jean Krutman./I don't live in a city. So I'm okay, right?/Obviously the more polluted the air you breathe, the greater the ill effects. However, research shows 90 per cent of people living in built-up areas are breathing polluted air. It doesn't just come from gridlocked traffic or factory fumes either. For instance, cigarette smoke (including the passive variety) is packed with pollutant particles. Plus, research is now looking at indoor sources of air pollution, from stoves and fireplaces to foam insulation and even computer printers!/Sun and smog - double trouble./SPF itself won't protect you from pollution, but skipping it will make the UV damage worse. Why? Well, UV and air toxins work as a kind of skin supervillain tag team, which means a combination of sun exposure and a polluted environment causes more damage than the two things individually. In short, wear SPF all year round./Boost your air defences with these beauty wonders./You can fight back effects of pollution by tweaking your beauty regime:/Cleanse/Step one has to be shifting pollutant particles that sit on your skin's surface or lodge in follicles. Sonic cleansing brushes remove more dirt than manual cleaning./Exfoliate/Getting shot of the dead, dulling, polluted cells on your skin surface is another must. Go for a product that's gentle enough to use at least three times a week./Treat/We've moved beyond the cliche of a mud pack and cucumber slices - high-tech masks are huge for 2016. Defending masques not only boost the skin barrier while it's on the face, but also blocks receptors that pollutants normally lock onto in between treatments./Up the anti/Anti-oxidants are vital for neutralising the free radical carnage unleashed by pollution. Wear a day cream packed with antioxidant vitamins, and add in a vitamin C serum. As well as being a potent antioxidant, it helps curb and even reverse age spots triggered by pollution./Block it/Foundation blocks the amount of pollutant particles that can latch on and penetrate into your skin, according to TOI report./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Air pollution: Acting before things get worse,"Bangladesh, Feb. 1 -- Air pollution in China has taken a serious shape that has compelled the authorities to shut down many factories. People have been suffering and the economy is showing a downward trend. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, has not been affected in the magnitude as has been seen in the case of Beijing. However, the situation is deteriorating in Bangladesh. Air pollution is taking a serious turn in most of the cities./According to a recent report of the World Health Organisation (WHO), ""Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"" originating from air pollution is the third principal cause of deaths across the world. This disease is rampant in five countries of the world and Bangladesh is one of them. According to WHO, as the Guardian of the UK reported, the number of deaths due to air pollution is higher than the deaths caused jointly by smoking, road accidents and diabetics./Urban air pollution is assuming dangerous proportions in Bangladesh. A previous study suggests that air pollution causes two million people to suffer from major diseases and ten million people with minor diseases in five major cities of Bangladesh including Dhaka. Generally speaking, rapid urbanisation accompanied by industrialisation and population growth is contributing to the deterioration of air quality in Dhaka and other major cities. This is due to auto exhaust, especially from old and dilapidated buses and trucks, open burning, incineration, plastic factories, foundries, surrounding brick kilns, road and soil dust from the construction boom. Aircrafts, railway engines, power plants, waste disposal sites, traffic congestion etc. are also contributing to air pollution. Dust pollution due to road digging, construction and other development activities further aggravate the air pollution situation in cities. Industries in and around Dhaka are another source of air pollution in the city./The directorate of environment has so far set up eleven centres, with four centres in Dhaka, to monitor air quality. Concerned personnel in the centres collect and analyse every day the available data to see the quality of air. The information available during this winter season indicates bad condition of air quality. Following a standard procedure, air is classified as good, medium, unhealthy, very unhealthy and very much unhealthy. It is called air quality index (AQI). According to this index, 0-50 is good, 51-100 is medium, 101-150 is cautionary, 151-200 is unhealthy, 201-300 is very unhealthy, and 301-500 is very much unhealthy. According to a report published in a Bengali daily, on January 20, 2016 the average AQI was 306 at Dhaka, 328 for Chittagong, 415 for Khulna, 317 for Gazipur and 523 for Narayanganj. The air quality indices show the quality of air in these cities as ""very much unhealthy"". It means that air in these cities contains excessive carbon mono-oxide, lead, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compound, particulate matter and sulphur dioxide. The press report suggests that Bangladesh University Urban Lab found abnormally high particulate matters in the air of Dhaka. According to this lab, in a normal situation a microgram of air should contain 1-12 micrometre of particulate matters. But it found 225, 184, 214, 202 and 223 micrometres respectively from January 13 to 17 2016 in Dhaka city./Vehicular pollution, industrial pollution, brick kiln emission, indoor air pollution, road dusts, open air burning and different types of wastes cause air pollution. In cities, the principal source of air pollution is automobiles, particularly the diesel automobiles. Diesel engines and vehicles run on gasoline contribute to air pollution by emitting high levels of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and volatile organic compounds. Several studies found a very clear association between air pollution and changes in a wide range of health indicators like mortality, hospitalisation, respiratory problems, exacerbation of asthma, cardiac problems and lung infections./Wee have environmental laws, rules smoke act, motor vehicle laws etc. These laws need to be enforced. Vehicular enforcement programme for regular inspection of vehicles, penalising grossly polluting vehicles and holding regular mobile courts should be pursued. Fifteen-year-old vehicles should be phased out immediately. Fuel quality should be ensured. The traffic management system calls for improvement. Among others, adoption of new technology for brick kilns to control hazardous air pollutants, and adoption of environment friendly industrial technology are the need of the hour to save the people from air pollution. Last but not least, preventive and mitigation measures are should be in place to control soil and road dust in the cities./The directorate of environment can play the pioneering role in making air safe. It needs to co-ordinate with police, city corporations, transport owners, construction departments and associations of industries and commerce. Strong political will and enforcement of laws will help improve the situation. Things should be taken care of before they get worse./The writer is a former environment secretary./<a href=""mailto:chowdhuryjafar@ymail.com"">chowdhuryjafar@ymail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Lessons from air pollution in Beijing,"Bangladesh, Feb. 4 -- The worst air pollution in China needs to be taken very seriously in Bangladesh in view of failure of the rising economic superpower to contain it. Viewed against this backdrop, Bangladesh lacks the know-how and proper planning to handle such air pollution in its capital./Bangladesh is the fourth largest populated country of the world while its capital Dhaka is rated as the worst liveable city. Thousands of people from other districts migrate daily to the capital in search of better livelihood in the absence of income-generating activities in their own habitats. Most of them have no other alternative but to live in slums or in poor housing units in the capital./On the other hand, cottage and small industries have been established here and there in Dhaka city without any proper planning making the capital very noisy and suffocated. Chemical industries and other high pollution-emitting small industries are located in different parts of the capital while tanneries having no effluent treatment plants (ETPs) are yet to be shifted to Savar as planned. As a result, the pollution level in Dhaka is fast approaching a dangerous level./Trees in the capital are being felled recklessly while natural ponds have already been filled up by different housing companies to make room for housing units, and waste are being dumped into the rivers surrounding Dhaka city. All the open spaces are no more vacant. On the other hand, thousands of vehicles emitting dangerous gases are also polluting the city's environment./As the two city corporations are assigned to look after the well-being of the capital, the onus of keeping it pollution-free squarely lies with them. These municipal bodies can seek assistance of the Department of Environment to devise ways and means to address the issues of pollution. The Beijing scene should awaken the two city corporations from slumber./Air pollution, surprisingly, causes 4,400 deaths in China every single day. Such pollution causes respiratory diseases like asthma, lung cancer and heart ailments. Burning of coals and fossil energy sources has only added to the sorry plight of the Chinese people. Factories and educational institutions have been declared closed in Beijing as worst air pollution has compelled the authorities to declare a 'red alert'./The cloud all over Beijing is very smoggy and grey. People now have to use masks as protective shield against polluted oxygen. This situation became worst because of excessive vehicle emissions, dust from construction sites, heating system and coal-powered industries. The Beijing authorities have decided to limit production in industries. It has banned outdoor construction work. The two city corporations in Dhaka should act before it is too late./The writer is a student of the BRAC University, Dhaka/<a href=""mailto:Benozir_tuly@yahoo.com"">Benozir_tuly@yahoo.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Bangladesh cities experience 'extremely unhealthy' air during winter,"Bangladesh, Feb. 6 -- ""They were digging the street beside your house. Sand was piled up on the other side. You are choked with dust when the wind blows. Layers of dust gather in your room if the windows are left open. The tree beside the street is like a metal sculpture.""/It's how Department of Environment's Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) project Director SM Manzurul Hannan Khan describes the winter in Bangladesh's capital city, Dhaka, reports a local news agency./Not only in Dhaka, the level of harmful particles in the air increases in adjacent Gazipur and Narayanganj, and Chittagong, Barisal, Khulna and Rajshahi, making the air 'extremely unhealthy' on most days in the winter./Citizens, mostly children and elders, suffer from cold-related diseases and lesions in throats./Khan says air quality is worst in winter while the cities experience 'comparatively better' air during the rainy season./The CASE project calculated the amount of particulate matters in the air at 11 places in Bangladesh./The experts call air quality of an area 'good' when it earns less than 50 points in the Air Quality Index (AQI), a relative measure of the amount of air pollution./The standard varies by country./In Bangladesh the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants - Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone (O3)./The other levels in AQI are Moderate (51-100), Caution (101-150), Unhealthy (151-200), Very Unhealthy (201-300), and Extremely Unhealthy (301-500)./According to CASE data, the air was extremely unhealthy in Dhaka (403 points in AQI), Narayanganj (420), Gazipur (374), Chittagong (334), Rajshahi (347), and Barisal (402). The index was at 225 or very unhealthy level in Sylhet./The levels did not change on the following day, and not even by the end of the winter on Jan 18./The levels had been 'good' in all the cities on July 26 during the rainy season last year./Khan said there was no alternative to raising awareness against dark smoke emitted from vehicles and air pollution through construction./Geriatrics doctor Mahbuba Akter Arju said masks can be used to cut the amount of dust people inhale./Besides, spraying water on the streets will also help, she said./Dhaka South City Corporation official Abdullah Harun said water is being sprayed at some VIP points./Dhaka North official Tareque Bin Yusuf said they were yet to take any such step./""The Department of Environment or other related authorities have not conveyed us anything,"" he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

How to consolidate development,"Bangladesh, Feb. 8 -- Growth economists are happy. Development economists are a bit sceptical. This is all about Bangladesh economy. Bangladesh is among 17 economies in the world which are growing over 6.0 per cent plus over the last decade. Per capita income has reached US$ 1,314. Foreign currency reserves exceeded US$ 27 billion. Twenty-five million people graduated from poverty over the last 15 years. The size of gross domestic product (GDP) is now US$ 194 billion. In terms of size, Bangladesh economy has been ranked 34th in the world by a US-based think tank, Brooking Institutions. The forecast is that in the next 25 years Bangladesh economy will occupy 23rd position in the world. It may surpass many European countries and even Australia and Malaysia in terms of size. Last year, the country graduated from a low-income status to lower middle-income country. Against this backdrop, the people of Bangladesh can expect a bright future for themselves./In order to have a bright future, one has to scan the economy to make a proper diagnosis to cure the on-going socio-economic diseases that Bangladesh economy is suffering from./Domestically, there are many pertinent issues that draw the attention of development economists. The market is not behaving well. If one goes to fast-food shops and restaurants, one finds them packed up. If one goes to shopping malls, one finds dull market with low buying and selling. The transport fares and the charges for gas and electricity have gone up. The educational expenses have jumped up. Thousands of people are found in que everyday in the public hospitals seeking medical advice and subsequently paying high cost for diagnostic purposes. Public hospitals do not have necessary beds to accommodate the deserving patients and number of nurses to attend them. On the other hand, the affluent people go abroad for treatment, send their children abroad for mid- and higher-level studies and many of them allegedly have bought houses and flats abroad. This is associated with the transfer of money and capital./In the agricultural sector, there is a dearth of agricultural labourers on the one hand and one-third of the working force remain idle, on the other. The lattger are uneducated or have little education. They are dependent on parents and brothers living abroad and work as political cadres in their localities. They are jobless. Agriculture, now-a-days can not provide good return to farmers. They can not cover the production costs of paddy and other cereals. It has a dampening effect in the sector. Even according to government statistics, growth in agriculture has decreased by 1.04 percentage points to 3.33 per cent./The real estate sector has been struggling for a long time with apartment prices coming down and large unsold inventories. A huge amount of loans given to this sector - about Tk. 350 billion (35,000 crore) in 2013-14 - could not warm up the real estate business./The hope of Bangladesh revolves round the export of ready-made garments (RMG) and foreign remittance. Export of RMG and knitwear accounts for about US$ 22 billion and foreign remittance is about US$ 15 billion. But there are many challenges in these two sectors. Compliance of many international standards in the garment sector may increase production costs. Depreciation of Euros and inability to attract foreign investment may further affect this sector. However, improving relationship with Middle Eastern countries, Malaysia, South Korea and some eastern European countries may boost up exports of manpower. Of late, there has arisen reasons for anxieties regarding safety of migrant workers. There are allegations of cruelty to women workers going abroad. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure low migration cost and ensure decent, safe and secure workplaces for migrant workers./Environment is also important for economic development. In Bangladesh, we have air pollution, water pollution and industrial pollution. Aforestation and deforestation are simultaneously going on. Rivers, canals, ponds, haors and bills are being continuously grabbed./Investment in any economy is very important. Both domestic and foreign investments are necessary. The banking sector in Bangladesh has now idle money to the tune of Tk. 700 billion (seventy thousand crore). Very recently loans have become available at a single-digit interest rate. But letters of credit with the banks do not show bulk orders of industrial machineries. Moreover, the capital market could not establish a good image. The people do not have confidence in the share markets./There are several other factors like democracy, rule of law, cost of doing business and good governance. Every year in international ranking, Bangladesh does not fare well against these criteria. Two such international rankings of very recent times can be mentioned. The first one is ""Economic Freedom Index"" and the second one is ""good governance""./Against the economic freedom score, Bangladesh occupies 137th position among 186 countries in the world. It implies that Bangladesh is mostly an un-free economy making very low scores in the areas of corruption, business investment and labour. Interestingly enough, the ranking has gone down from 132nd position in 2013 and 130th in 2014. In South Asia, Bangladesh is only ahead of Nepal and falls behind every other country. Even Bhutan secures 97th position./The World Economic Forum (WEF) published its World Risk Report 2016 covering 140 countries. It interviewed thirteen thousand executives. The executives in Bangladesh have opined that the highest risk of business in Bangladesh at the moment is lack of good governance. By this they have meant political instability, clashes, uncertainty and rampant corruption. The issue of dearth of energy also surfaced side by side with good governance./All this suggests that GDP (gross domestic product) growth or per capita income can not alone explain economic or social development. Policy makers should take into account all the perspectives of development./The writer, a former planning secretary, is an economist./<a href=""mailto:chowdhuryjafar@ymail.com"">chowdhuryjafar@ymail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Air pollution causes 5.5m deaths per year: Study,"Bangladesh, Feb. 13 -- More than 5.5 million people worldwide are dying prematurely every year as a result of air pollution, according to new research./Most of these deaths are occurring in the rapidly developing economies of China and India./The main culprit is the emission of small particles from power plants, factories, vehicle exhausts and from the burning of coal and wood./The data was compiled as part of the Global Burden of Disease Project./Scientists involved in the initiative say the statistics illustrate how far, and how fast, some nations must travel to improve the air their citizens breathe./""In Beijing or Delhi on a bad air pollution day, the number of fine particles (known as PM2.5) can be higher than 300 micrograms per cubic metre,"" explained Dan Greenbaum from the Health Effects Institute, in Boston, US./""The number should be about 25 or 35 micrograms.""/Breathing in tiny liquid or solid particles can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, respiratory complaints and even cancer. And while developed nations have made great strides in addressing this problem these past few decades, the number of citizens dying as a result of poor air quality in developing countries is still climbing./According to the study, air pollution causes more deaths than other risk factors like malnutrition, obesity, alcohol and drug abuse, and unsafe sex. The Global Burden of Disease Project puts it as the fourth greatest risk behind high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking./In China, there are said to be about 1.6 million deaths a year; in India, it is roughly 1.3 million. This data is from 2013, the most recent year for which it is available./The key sources of pollution concern are slightly different in each nation, however./In China, the dominant factor is particle emissions from coal burning./The project calculates this source alone is responsible for more than 360,000 deaths every year./And even though China has targets to restrict coal combustion and emissions in the future, it may struggle to bring down the number of deaths because it is acquiring an aging population and these citizens are naturally more susceptible to the illnesses associated with poor air quality./""So, we think more aggressive policies are urgently needed to reduce the emissions from coal combustion and other sectors,"" stated project researcher Qiao Ma, a PhD student at Tsinghua University in Beijing./In India, the problem that draws particular attention is the practice of burning wood, dung, crop residues and other materials for cooking and heating./This ""indoor pollution"" causes far more deaths than ""outdoor pollution""./And looking at the broad economic trends in India, the research team says the country runs the risk of having even poorer air quality in the future./Chandra Venkataraman, from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, in Mumbai, warned: ""Despite proposed emissions control, there is significant growth in the demand for electricity as well as industrial production./""So, through to 2050, this growth overshadows the emissions controls (in our projections) and will lead to an increase in future air pollutant emissions in 2050 in India.""/Michael Brauer, from the University of British Columbia in Canada, said the statistics should make governments think hard about the scope of their anti-pollution policies./They ought to spur greater ambition, he added./""The trick here is to not take the 50 or 60 years that it took in the high income countries, and to really accelerate the process; and that's really where we think these statistics, the data, will come in handy,"" he said./""In the US, we know that for every dollar spent on air pollution improvements, we can get between a $4-$30 benefit in terms of reduced health impacts,"" according to BBC./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Living with polythene,"Bangladesh, Feb. 15 -- The government has apparently begun enforcing a complete ban on the sale and use of polythene bags in the capital. Such a move was first undertaken on January 01, 2002 to save the city from an environmental disaster. Though there are some initiatives to ban polythene, nothing seems to be effective./Polythene shopping bags were first introduced in Bangladesh in the early eighties. On an average, each family uses four polythene bags in Dhaka every day. According to an estimate, ten million of such bags are thrown to waste-bins every day. Millions of polythene bags disposed everyday are clogging drainage channels mainly in Dhaka and Chittagong cities, polluting the surrounding rivers. This results in serious harm to us, fish and other aquatic animals, thus posing a serious marine environmental hazard./Polythene remains intact in the soil; it causes problem for soil fertility which is a big concern in this agricultural country./Findings of a research on polythene conducted by the Korean Institute of Health Research, said workers in polythene factories are more exposed to cancer, skin disease and other fatal health problems. Polythene-wrapped fish and meat generate a kind of heat that creates radiation which ultimately makes food poisonous. These discarded polythene bags are a new environmental threat for an overcrowded city which is already suffering from high levels of water and air pollution and other kinds of environmental hazards./Besides, polythene-wrapped fish, meat and vegetables get infected by anaerobic bacteria, a germ responsible for skin disease and cancer, a polythene expert Dr Hossain Shahriar said. A nutrition expert of Kolkata Medical College Hospital, Dr Shashwati Roy, in a research found that taking tea in polypus can be a cause of ulcer and cancer. Polythene bags and other plastic materials, if burnt below 7,000 degree Celsius, create a dioxin like poisonous gas, which can cause cancer and skin diseases. Polythene bags dumped near households turn into safe havens for mosquitoes which cause dengue fever, filariasis and malaria, they warned./There are about one thousand polythene industries in the countries. Most of these are based in Dhaka. There is a powerful syndicate in charge of polythene business. There are many polythene industries in Mirpur, Karwan Bazar, Tejgaon, Kamrangir Char and Tongi. There are more than a hundred polythene industries from Jatrabari to Fatulla, Narayanganj. There is also a powerful syndicate in charge of polythene business in Chittagong. Because of large use of polythene, popularity of jute products is decreasing. At the same time, jute cultivation is also decreasing. Our potential jute sector has been destroyed because of our negligence. The government should play an important role to revitalise the sector./Without tougher environmental legislation, it will be very difficult for the government to attain any success in its fight against polythene. It must implement the law that banned polythene, and severely punish the violators. Moreover, high tax should be imposed on raw materials of polythene. /<a href=""mailto:munna_tareq@yahoo.com"">munna_tareq@yahoo.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

"Study: Air pollution increases risk for obesity, diabetes","Durham, Feb. 23 -- Air pollution can increase the risk for obesity and diabetes, according to a study with lab rats exposed to the highly polluted air of Beijing./Researchers at Duke University found the air caused metabolic dysfunction in rats, leading to obesity and the precursors of diabetes when compared to rats that had not been exposed to the air./The air in China's capital, and the rest of the country, has become an increasing focus of health concerns in recent years and the country called two red alerts in two weeks in 2015 because of especially bad air conditions./Previous studies have shown air pollution causes oxidative stress and inflammation in the organs and circulatory system, as well as an increased risk of death./""If translated and verified in humans, these findings will support the urgent need to reduce air pollution, given the growing burden of obesity in today's highly polluted world,"" Junfeng Zhang, a professor of global and environmental health at Duke University, said in a press release./For the study, published in the FASEB Journal, researchers exposed rats to either samples of polluted air from Beijing or filtered air./Nineteen days into the experiment, rats exposed to unfiltered air had 50 percent higher bad cholesterol levels, 46 percent higher triglycerides, and 97 percent higher total cholesterol, as well as a higher insulin resistance level./While the rats ate the same amount of food throughout the study, the rats breathing unfiltered air also gained more weight eight weeks into the study, with female rats 10 percent heavier and male rats 18 percent heavier than their counterparts breathing clean air./""Since chronic inflammation is recognized as a factor contributing to obesity and since metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity are closely related, our findings provide clear evidence that chronic exposure to air pollution increases the risk for developing obesity,"" Zhang said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

The stench of Hazaribagh,"Bangladesh, March 1 -- Professor Enamul Huq of the East West University and the present writer, undertook a study in the 1980s on impacts of tanneries on Hazaribagh areas of Dhaka city. The focus was invariably on the associated costs of water and air pollution on human and livestock health following release of chemicals and waste into water bodies. En passant, it was a time when concerns over environment were just growing. Earlier, environmental considerations had never had a place in economists' agenda. It has long been argued that a rise in income should be the first and environmental consideration the second choice. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was seemingly the pioneer in assessing environmental ramifications of different development projects in Bangladesh./The findings were frightening. Among others, the residents of Hazaribagh areas were faced with various skin diseases. As far as this writer can remember, the average medical costs of the households in Hazaribagh were much higher than those of the group selected at that time. These estimates excluded the damage of fish stock in the Buriganga River or its water quality due to rundown of chemicals or effects on livestock. It appeared that in nominal terms, leather industries earned a huge amount of foreign exchange through exports and thus could be considered an important factor in employment generation. But taking the costs on the society including bad smell and health sufferings, the real benefit would stand much lower than shown./Again, at the time of the study in the 1980s, there was rumour that the tanneries would be shifted from the city to somewhere else to help restore clean environment in Hazaribagh./Hazaribagh accommodates about 200 tanneries constituting the lifeline of the leather industry and every year contributes $1.0 billion to the national exchequer. According to data released by different sources of investigation including an article published in this daily on February 15, 2016 - around 21,000 cubic metres of untreated waste is being dumped into the Buriganga River every day. The river is the main source of water for Dhaka. In many cities of the world, such rivers are kept clean to attract tourists. Workers, engaged in the tanneries, operate with little protective gear to safeguard themselves from hazardous chemicals such as chromium. The effects of dumping chemical waste into the Buriganga are as follows: (a) bad smell is affecting the Hazaribagh residents; (b) use of 40 different types of metal and acid in raw hide processing, 40 per cent of which is absorbed into leather while the rest is discarded into surrounding water bodies and (c) serious environmental degradation. Other hazardous toxins used in the production process include potash, sulphuric acid, caustic soda, arsenic sulphate etc. The quick and crude survey in the 1980s and recent findings tell the same story. For example, a large number of people living in the vicinity of Hazaribagh suffer from various skin diseases as the water is contaminated. Both livestock and fisheries production in the area have declined./It may be mentioned here that the initiative to relocate the Hazaribagh tanneries outside Dhaka began in 2009 on the heels of a High Court order. The idea was to increase foreign exchange earnings at less human costs. It was also to set up a safe tannery zone and protect the city's water supply from contamination. Unfortunately, even in 2016, the compliance rate is very low whereas the owners have allegedly drawn a huge amount of money from the government exchequer in the name of shifting. To add salt to the injury, the reality is that most of the tannery owners who were allotted plots left business long ago. Reportedly, these tanneries are running on rent and the owners are allegedly selling their allotted plots in Savar. Many of the founders of the tanneries have also died. By and large, rampant corruption and fraudulence have become an order of the day./Most probably, this time the deadline of meeting the government's order of relocation was February 28, 2016. This meant Dhaka people, especially the residents of Hazaribagh, would no longer pass days amid bad smell, the Buriganga River would witness stoppage of chemical waste into the river, and swell with sweet water. But as ill luck would have it, there seems to be no sign of a positive development as far as shifting is concerned. People expect that the government would handle the situation with iron hand implying that non-compliant should be severely dealt with even if that means cancelling of licenses and awarding punitive punishment. Hazaribagh must be a normal habitat; the Buriganga must regain its lost vigour and Dhaka should emerge as a beautiful city. The calculus of increased export earnings and employment generation should henceforth be pitted against the pains inflicted to human beings and livestock. Green growth should always be at the top of the agenda. Without considering the side effects of pollution and environmental hazards, growth can hardly be sustainable. A livelihood comprises capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets now and in the future while not undermining the natural resource base. One of the reasons that Bangladesh's economic growth is faced with serious sustainable question is the lack of accounting on environmental hazards created by the growth process itself. Growth of exports such as leather type in Hazaribagh contributes to increased foreign exchange earnings and also employment but at a huge cost of human welfare. The present government should set an example by forcing the factories to shift to Savar even if it means paying some penny politically./The writer is Professor of Economics at Jahangirnanagr University./<a href=""mailto:abdulbayes@yahoo.com"">abdulbayes@yahoo.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Growing menace of air pollution in Dhaka,"Bangladesh, March 6 -- Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, has already earned notoriety as one of the worst cities, in terms of liveability, in the world. A number of factors have been taken into consideration while 'stigmatising' the city that once used to be considered one of the cleanest cities in the region. Its polluted air is one such factor that has been posing a serious problem for its millions of residents. A couple of statistics would be enough to show the pollution level of Dhaka's air. The tolerable level of micro particles in air is 65 mcg (microgram). But in Dhaka the level goes up to 300 mcg. Similarly, the level of small particles in air rises up to 500 mcg as against the tolerable level of 150 mcg. On many other counts, Dhaka can be adjudged one of the most polluted cities on earth./During the days when two-stroke auto-rickshaws ruled the streets, Dhaka used to remain covered by a thick blanket of smog from dawn to midnight. Most commuters were seen covering their faces with handkerchiefs or masks. The two-stroke auto-rickshaws have been driven out of Dhaka and most vehicles these days use compressed natural gas (CNG), a clean fuel. But what is polluting Dhaka's air is dust particle, originating mainly from brick kilns, located on its outskirts, motor vehicles and roads. Respiratory diseases, particularly among children, have been on the rise in city. Since micro particles are not visible and those do not produce any kind of pungent smell, the commuters are, apparently, not that much concerned./Dhaka, possibly, is the only city to have the highest volume of dust particles in air. Careless digging of roads by the utility service providers, absence of proper arrangements for sweeping of most internal roads, lanes and bye-lanes, poor garbage cleaning by the city corporations and dumping of sands and other construction materials by both private and public agencies on roads and pavements have been contributing to the high presence of dust in city air. The two city corporations are seen particularly mindful of sweeping the major city roads daily. But they bother least about other roads, lanes and bye-lanes. They are equally careless about keeping pavements clean. Utility service providers very often dig roads out of their necessity, as and when felt, on depositing funds with the city corporations for post-work repairs. But the roads are kept in deplorable state for months together with the city corporations not bothering to repair the same./The problem of air pollution in Dhaka city is yet to become a matter of concern for the policymakers or relevant agencies. But they are possibly not unaware of the developments in Beijing, the capital city of China. The rich people there are now inhaling 'pure' air in bottles that are imported from Canada; air of their own city has become totally unfit for inhaling. The government must address the problem of air pollution of Dhaka city. A little bit of care on the part of public sector agencies and residents can surely help reduce the capital city's air pollution level to a considerable extent./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Use cleaner stoves to cut 'household air pollution',"Bangladesh, March 19 -- When it comes to cooking indoors over open fires, the harmful health effects can be equal to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. This indoor air pollution plagues nearly nine out of every 10 Bangladeshi households, which use wood and other bio-fuels to cook inside. To reduce such household air pollution use of cleaner stoves is essential which will bring manifold social benefits, argued Copenhagen Consensus Centre, a Massachusetts-based research and advocacy group in research findings, says a press statement. ""Indoor air pollution is the most deadly environmental problem in the world,"" said President of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre Dr Bjorn Lomborg. /""In Bangladesh, this pollution kills up to 150,000 people each year. Research from Bangladesh Priorities can help identify the smartest ways to improve household air quality with each taka spent."" The research by economist Bjorn Larsen suggests two principal ways to help decrease deadly air pollution inside the home. People could burn the same bio-fuels that most Bangladeshi households currently use. But they could use smarter cook-stoves that emit much less pollution, or they could switch to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which burns much more cleanly. ""The cheapest way to improve indoor air quality is to get widespread investment in an improved biomass cook-stove,"" said the research report. ""This is simply an enclosed stove, often with a chimney, that reduces heat loss, protects against the wind, and transfers heat to a cooking pot more efficiently than traditional stoves or open fires."" According to the report, in Bangladesh, the cost of such a stove with two burners and a chimney that will last three years is about Tk 1,000 per year. ""This is both to cover the aggregate that needs replacement every third year, as well as some maintenance. And almost a third of the cost goes to promoting awareness of the opportunity in the first place,"" it added. The research pointed out many benefits of using biomass cook-stove. ""If all 30 million households switched to improved cook-stoves, it would save more than 33,000 lives each year,"" it said. ""And because the stoves are more efficient, each family would also save 15 minutes in cooking time and reduce fuel collection time by half each day. In total, for each Tk 1,000 spent on a better cook-stove, a family will get almost Tk 5,000 in health and time savings benefits: every taka spent will do 5 takas of good."" The research finding also argued that though LPG burns very clean, almost like an electric stove, and adoption of these stoves would produce much higher benefits, the cost of LPG is significantly higher. Use of LPG may save 91,000 lives, but, in total, one has to pay about Tk 12,000 for about Tk 12,000 in benefits. ""So spending on LPG stoves would not be a loss, but only one taka back on the taka,"" it added. The centre launches a project called 'Bangladesh Priorities' to identify the best policies that will do the most good for each taka spent. In collaboration with BRAC, it has commissioned a wide range of the best economists from Bangladesh, the region, and the world to estimate the costs and benefits for 78 Bangladeshi projects./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Are we living with life's gift or with life's woes?,"Bangladesh, March 27 -- If living quality is an indicator of happy life, the position of Dhaka can better be imagined than described, at least on the basis of successive international survey findings. Not infrequently over the last few years, various survey reports by international organisations ranked Dhaka as the least or close to being the least livable city in the world./One such recent report was published in February 2016 by US private organisation Mercer which was based on a survey carried out in 440 cities of the world. Dhaka has been ranked 214th in a list of 230 cities in terms of quality of living. In the report titled 'Quality of living ranking 2016' Dhaka lies way behind cities of neighbouring Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. More importantly, it is found perilously close to cities like Baghdad and Damascus. These two cities which lie at the bottom of the list, have witnessed continual violence and terrorist attacks in recent years. Baghdad is also rated the lowest in terms of personal safety, one of the main components of living quality./Vienna, however, continues to be at the top of the list for overall quality of living for the seventh time in international surveys. The Austrian capital is followed by Zurich and Geneva of Switzerland, Auckland of New Zealand, Munich of Germany, Vancouver of Canada, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt of Germany, Copenhagen of Denmark and Sydney of Australia. Vancouver is North America's highest ranking city. Singapore is the highest ranking city in Asia with 26th place leaving Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Manila, and Jakarta long way behind. In the Far East, Tokyo occupies the highest position with 44th spot. Other notable cities in this region like Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai, and Beijing are far behind in the race at 70, 84, 101 and 118th positions respectively./The ground level situation in Dhaka is almost the same as that of most cities of the region, but it sits at the bottom of the list. It may sound tricky but survey report says so. Question that pertinently arises is why Dhaka is so close to Baghdad or Damascus in terms of living quality although there is no war or humanitarian crisis here. With similar situation, many other cities have ranked higher./The reasons are not far to seek. Firstly, looking from the top Dhaka looks like a jungle of concrete with interminably long traffic choking the roads. In fact, the moment we step out of the house we are awestruck by the traffic gridlock at every corner of the roads. It is equally difficult if some one prefers to walk rather than take a car. There is hardly any room to walk along the footpaths as most of them are occupied by mobile vendors and hawkers. If Dhaka is to be made livable, one of the first few things to be done is to free the footpaths from illegal occupants. According to the Hawker Associations, out of 260,000 hawkers in Dhaka, around 150,000 sell on footpaths and the rest move around residential areas with their wares. The number increases by another 25,000 before every Eid festival./According to a national daily, these hawkers spend Tk.50 to Tk.300 as toll per day to transact their businesses and the total daily tolls collected in this way amounts to Tk.26 millions and the annual collection amounts to over Tk.9.0 billions. The toll goes to some dishonest members of law enforcing agencies and people with high political links and that is why, it has become impossible to evict illegal occupants from the footpaths./It is not only the long queue of vehicles halting the movement of the people, it is also the volume of carbon emission from vehicular traffic that has kept the level of air pollution considerably high and therefore the quality of living low./Safety is the key factor in determining quality of living, particularly for the expatriates. Dhaka's record in terms of personal safety, mainly work place safety, is not particularly encouraging. The tragedy at Rana Plaza and quite a few cases of forced disappearances appear to have made lasting impact on the thinking of the international community. At the same time, political and social environment (political stability, crime, law enforcement, etc) matter a lot in ensuring the overall quality of living. Although calm appears to have descended on the political front, according to many it is a case of uneasy quiet. Memories of political turmoil of the recent past still haunt us. In contrast, despite successive incidents of mass rape followed by murder that raised furor across the world, New Delhi ranks much higher than Dhaka simply because the criminals involved in the incidents were brought to justice quickly and enforcement of law was prompt and immediate. Similarly, following considerable political unrest and terrorist attacks in several tourist areas over the last few years, Bangkok ranked higher in personal safety compared to Dhaka./Quality of living also largely influences investment decisions of the foreign investors. Stagnating foreign investment here may be attributed to the fact that the expats are still unsure of the sustainability of political stability in the country. There are other contributors like economic environment (currency exchange regulations, banking services), medical and health considerations (medical supplies and services, infectious diseases, sewage, waste disposal, air pollution etc), public services and transportation (electricity, water, public transportation, traffic congestion etc) and natural environment (climate, record of natural disasters) factors./The rankings of south Asian cities may be looked at in order to assess our position. The vast region of Asia has considerable variation in quality of living. With 26th place globally, Singapore remains as the highest ranking city, whereas Dhaka with 214th is the lowest and is close to Damascus, capital of war ravaged Syria which is at 224th place. Cities of Colombo followed by Hyderabad, Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, and New Delhi of India and Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi of Pakistan are ahead of Dhaka./Mercer's survey is a comprehensive one and is conducted annually. What is notable in this year's report is that despite economic uncertainties, West European cities continue to enjoy some of the best amenities in determining quality of living worldwide as they fill first seven of the top ten slots. European cities also dominate the top of the personal safety rankings with Luxembourg in the lead, followed by Bern, Helsinki, and Zurich, which are tied for the number-two spot. A number of key or capital cities rank considerably low as many suffered either terrorist attacks or social unrest in the last few years. For example, Paris (71), London (72), Madrid (84), and Athens (124).The recent political and economic turmoil in Greece, which resulted in violent demonstrations in Athens and other cities in the country, has undermined its safety ranking vis-a-vis quality of living./In another recent report of similar nature, titled 'World Happiness Report' published jointly by Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Earth Institute of Columbia University, USA, Bangladesh has been ranked 110th among 157 countries chosen for the survey. The report was published on March 16, 2016 on the eve of World Happiness Day on March 20. Here also Bangladesh has been way behind neighbouring countries, such as China, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India and Myanmar which occupied 83, 84, 92, 107, 117, 118 and 119 spots respectively. There is hardly any qualitative difference between the two reports with both presenting a similar situation with sufficient reasoning and explanation. With all this in and around us, are we living with life's gift or with life's woes?/<a href=""mailto:saleh.akram26@gmail.com"">saleh.akram26@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

'25pc city children face abnormal lung functioning',"Dhaka, March 31 -- One in every four children of the city faces abnormal lung functioning due to ambient air pollution, says a new study./Collecting 500 samples from four different age groups, mostly from the 10-20 age group, during January and February 2016 in the capital, the study found that around 24 per cent of city dwellers are suffering from abnormal lung functioning./Bangladesh University's Urban Lab conducted the study aiming to test the pulmonary function of city dwellers according to age and gender./The findings of the study titled 'Impact of Air Pollution on Public Health' were disclosed at a programme, jointly organised by the Bangladesh University and Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), at Krishibid Institution in the capital on Thursday./Pediatric specialist of Dhaka Shishu Hospital Md Ruhul Amin said city dwellers have been suffering from various diseases like pneumonia, asthma and heart diseases caused by air pollution./Citing the study findings, he said abnormal lung functioning was found more among women than men, and the lung dysfunction is on the rise in line with the growing age. ""Air pollution is the main reason behind people's abnormal lung functioning,"" the pediatrician said./Clean air is considered to be a basic requirement of human health and well-being. However, air pollution continues to pose a significant threat to health worldwide./According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the evidence on airborne particulate matter (PM) and its public health impact is consistent in showing adverse health effects at exposures that are currently experienced by urban populations in both developed and developing countries./The PM 2.5, the finest particles which can reach to the blood of human body, was found on average about 200 25 ?g/m3 (24-hour) during January 2016, says the study./But, as per the WHO guidelines of air pollution, permissible level of PM 2.5 is 25 ?g/m3 on 24-hour./National Professor Brig (retd) Abdul Malik said air pollution is not only causing harm to lung of people but also air pollutants enter human body with food stuff and water./Warning that air pollution may affect the pregnancy of women and child growth, he said smoking along with air pollution must be checked to avoid those health hazards./DNCC Mayor Annisul Huq said the children, who are now experiencing abnormal lung function due to air pollution, may suffer from it until their death./To prevent air pollution in the city, he said, all the city dwellers should come forward to help the city corporations check construction waste and manage solid and medical wastes properly./The air quality in Dhaka city has been deteriorating due to the release of air pollutants by a number of motorised vehicles on roads, lack of proper traffic management, improper land use planning and construction activities./According to a WHO assessment of the burden of disease due to air pollution, more than 2 million premature deaths each year can be attributed to the effects of urban outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution. More than half of this disease burden is borne by the populations of developing countries, according to a news agency./Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Air pollution raises lungs problems of city people,"Bangladesh, March 31 -- Around 25 per cent of the surveyed people of Dhaka city suffer from lung function abnormalities due to higher extent of air pollution. Such lung function abnormalities cause different types of airborne diseases, like - bronchiolitis, pneumonia, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These were revealed in a research - 'Impact of Air Pollution on Public Health' - conducted by Bangladesh University (BU) Urban Lab. Professor of Dhaka Shishu Hospital Dr. Ruhul Amin presented the research findings at a seminar, jointly organised by BU and Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) at Krishibid Institute in the city. /DNCC Mayor Annisul Huq, National Professor and founder of National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh Brig Gen (Retd) Abdul Malik, BU Chairman Quazi Jamil Azher, and environmentalist Architect Iqbal Habib spoke at the seminar. The BU Urban Lab conducted the survey for two months on 500 people aged between 10 and 40 years. Focusing on the findings Dr. Amin said the risk of lung function abnormalities increase following rise in age. The rate of affected people is 27.19 per cent for people of 40 years of age, while it is 21.53 per cent for people of 10-20 age group. Speaking on the occasion the DNCC mayor said to get rid of air pollution the city dwellers have to take initiatives to keep the capital clean from construction, household, medical and brick sectors wastes, and have to plant more trees. To ensure a green Dhaka, DNCC has planned to plant 325,000 trees in the capital, he mentioned. /<a href=""mailto:Srabonty.shokal@gmail.com"">Srabonty.shokal@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Improved technologies to combat air pollution,"Bangladesh, April 17 -- Air pollution is a major issue around the world. It kills seven million people annually-one in every eight people that die around the world. And, of course, air pollution is a well-known and much-complained-about fact in Bangladesh. Few major global cities suffer from air pollution worse than Dhaka. During the dry season, when dust is especially bad, pollution levels can reach up to 16 times higher than the World Health Organisation's air quality guideline./Outdoor air pollution kills 14,000 of Dhaka city's residents each year-and it's not even the most damaging air pollution plaguing the country. Household air pollution caused by cooking indoors over open fires is the most deadly environmental problem in the world. The long-term health effects-which can include lung cancer, stroke, and heart disease-can be as bad as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Nearly nine out of every 10 households in Bangladesh use wood and other biofuels to cook inside, and the resulting household air pollution causes up to 150,000 deaths annually./Of course, we would like to fix both indoor and outdoor air pollution, along with the many other challenges that still Bangladesh faces. But resources are scarce, and we know that not all problems will be addressed immediately. So to which of the air pollution problems should Bangladesh focus its attention first? Or are there other and more urgent issues where we could do even more good first?/Answering this question requires us to look not at the problem at hand, but at the available solutions. And it also requires us to look at how much each solution will cost, and how much good it will achieve. This is exactly the information that a new project, Bangladesh Priorities, will help provide. We work with dozens of teams of local and international expert economists. Each team studies the costs and benefits of solutions to issues like air pollution, along with maternal health, education, infrastructure needs, and many others. In a partnership with Copenhagen Consensus and BRAC, we aim to help Bangladesh discover where we can do the most good for every taka spent toward solving the country's most pressing problems./When it comes to reducing deadly air pollution inside the home, our new research examines two solutions: People could replace their traditional cookstoves with smarter ones, which burn biofuels much cleaner and emit less pollution, or they could instead use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves, which replace biofuels entirely and burn even cleaner./The first option, an improved biomass cookstove, turns out to be most cost-effective. The stove is enclosed, which helps maintain heat better than a traditional stove and protects fuel sources from the wind. This helps burn biofuels much more cleanly. Improved stoves also transfer heat to cooking pots more efficiently, so they save on fuel costs./An improved stove with two burners and a chimney that will last for three years costs about Tk 1,000 per year in Bangladesh. The cost covers both the stove itself, which has to be replaced every third year, as well as some maintenance. And almost one-third of the cost helps promote awareness of the opportunity in communities./Thirty million Bangladeshi households use traditional stoves. If they all switched to improved cookstoves, the pollution reduction would save more than 33,000 lives each year. Each of these people would live an additional 28 years on average. Since this benefit is spread over 30 million households, the benefit for each is about Tk 2,600 each year. Moreover, fewer sick days add an additional benefit of Tk 260./The improved stoves cook faster and require less fuel, so each day they also lower fuel collection time by half and save 15 minutes in cooking time. Those benefits are worth another Tk 2,000. For each Tk 1,000 in spending on a better cookstove, a family will get almost Tk 5,000 in health and time-savings benefits. Every taka spent will do 5.0 takas of good./Improved stoves can take a big step to improve household air quality, but they promise to save ""only"" 33,000 of 150,000 annual deaths. Most of the problem of household air pollution would still remain. So the analysis looked at a second option that could reduce overall household pollution much more./LPG burns very cleanly-almost like an electric stove. If every Bangladeshi household adopted these stoves, it would save 91,000 lives, a total value of Tk 218 billion (Tk 21,800 crore), or Tk 7,300 per household. Each household would avoid about 700 takas of disease, cooking time would drop by 40 minutes, and there would be no need to spend any time collecting fuel. The net worth of these benefits would be Tk 5,200 for each family./But an LPG stove and fuels cost a great deal more than an improved biomass cookstove. The price is about Tk 10,000 per year, plus Tk 2,000 more to buy fuel. In total, you would pay about Tk 12,000 for about 12,000 in benefits. So spending on LPG stoves would not be a loss, but it would yield only one taka in benefits for each taka spent./This shows that sometimes the best option can be an enemy of the good. The cheapest way to improve the quality of indoor air is to get widespread investment in improved biomass cookstoves. Despite helping less overall, this cheaper option can be a much better way to help per taka spent. In the long term, however, more expensive options can become solutions. As Bangladesh moves towards middle-income status, higher LPG adoption can become more alluring/THE POLLUTING KILNS: When it comes to air pollution outdoors, the challenge is often much more difficult to address. Rather than having one source of pollution for one family, as with cookstoves indoors, there are usually many sources that emit pollution outside, and it can be costly to clean up each one. Dhaka presents a unique opportunity, however, because a great deal of its air pollution comes from just one source: kilns used to make bricks for the construction industry./More than 1,000 kilns manufacture 4.0 billion bricks each year in Dhaka, and they are responsible for about 40 per cent of the city's fine-particulate air pollution-which causes an estimated 2,000 deaths each year. Technologies to improve these kilns, however, promise great benefits-both for private owners and for the environment and society at large./Most manufacturers traditionally use fixed-chimney kilns. These are energy-inefficient, emit a great deal of pollution, and mostly burn dirty fuels./To make brick-making kilns cleaner and more efficient, they can either be replaced with entirely new ones, or be retrofitted. Our new research examines multiple options that range from a simple upgrade into ""improved zigzag"" kilns, all the way to new and cutting-edge Hybrid Hoffman kilns./A Hybrid Hoffman kiln uses top-of-the-line technology and promises very large overall benefits. But a single kiln costs Tk 160 million (Tk 16 crore). A retrofit of an existing fixed-chimney kiln into an improved zigzag kiln is 40 times cheaper. This upgrade into a zigzag kiln does about 8.0 takas of good for each taka spent, and it turns out to be the most cost-effective strategy./Retrofitting a fixed-chimney kiln into a zigzag kiln costs Tk 4 million (Tk 40 lakh) and takes about three months. The better technology heats bricks more efficiently and evenly because hot air blows over bricks in a zigzag pattern. And zigzag kilns reduce fuel consumption by one-fifth, which is one reason that an owner can pay back his or her investment in less than four years./Adopting zigzag kilns across Dhaka would reduce air pollution from brick-making kilns by 40 per cent, saving more than 800 lives per year. This would cost about Tk 408 million (Tk 40.8 crore) annually over the operating life of the kilns. But the benefits would be quite large. Annual health benefits alone would equal Tk 1.7 billion (Tk 170 crore)./The reduction in carbon emissions would be worth another Tk 80 million (Tk 8.0 crore). Private kiln operators would also get a number of benefits, including higher quality bricks and lower energy consumption. In total, the benefits to investors and owners will be Tk 1.4 billion (Tk 140 crore)./As Bangladesh becomes richer and solves many of its other challenges, adopting the cutting-edge technology rather than simple retrofits could help achieve the greatest possible environmental benefits. Replacing all kilns in the capital with Hybrid Hoffman kilns, for instance, could yield even larger overall benefits. The health benefits would be worth Tk 2.5 billion (Tk 250 crore) per year, and lower levels of carbon emissions would be worth Tk 161 million (Tk 16.1 crore). Business owners would also benefit by Tk 8.6 billion (Tk 860 crore), thanks to more efficient brick production and improved quality of bricks./However, the cost would be very high-Tk 3.3 billion (Tk 330 crore) annually. Each taka spent toward this end would do a little more than 3 takas of good, which is respectable, but not nearly as great as the 8 takas of good that retrofitting to improved zigzag kilns gives./Whether it comes to the outdoor environment or inside homes across Bangladesh, the need to reduce air pollution may seem obvious. But using scarce resources to fight air pollution means less funding will be available from the national budget, international donors, or private citizens for other proposals that can do good./Dr. Bjorn Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, ranking the smartest solutions to the world's biggest problems by cost-benefit/He was named one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time Magazine/e-mail: /<a href=""mailto:ea@lomborg.com"">ea@lomborg.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Education sector: The smartest investments,"Bangladesh, April 30 -- It seems like a great idea: to improve education in Bangladesh, we should equip classrooms with computers, moving the next generation to the cutting edge of knowledge. But while such an idea is alluring and has gotten wide traction around the world in the last decade, we need to look at the evidence. And it is surprising./A recent OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) study finds that over the past 10 years, there has been virtually no ""appreciable improvement"" in student achievement in developed countries that have invested heavily in computers and other technologies for education./Throughout the political conversation, there are many ideas that seem attractive. But confronting them with data can help us spend much less on current fads and instead focus on the education solutions that actually work./For Bangladesh to make progress toward a better education system, it will have to focus on the very best investments for the future. What are the smartest next steps that can improve education? Bangladesh Priorities, a partnership between the Copenhagen Consensus Center and BRAC, aims to discover the most effective solutions to challenges ranging from health and migration to air pollution and nutrition./The project has commissioned dozens of top economists from the country, region, and world to study which solutions can produce the greatest social, environmental, health, and economic benefits for each taka spent on development efforts./Looking at the challenge of education, new research by economist Atonu Rabbani of the University of Dhaka estimates the costs and benefits of a number of solutions. Perhaps one of the most important findings is a cautionary one: fewer than half of the solutions examined showed any positive effects on child-learning outcomes./In other words, you are more likely to do nothing than to get it right when it comes to strategies aimed at improving education and learning./Like the OECD report, Rabbani's analysis looks at the effects of computer-assisted learning. Based on studies from Colombia, Peru, and India, the research finds that the average computer-assisted learning programme will not have positive results on net. And the analysis uncovered the same finding when it came to programmes that give students more textbooks./The uncertainty over what works and the lack of cost-effective results from the majority of educational investments stand in stark contrast to one strategy: a programme designed to help young kids overcome stunting and turn them into smarter students./Stunting, or being shorter than normal for a child's age, is often caused by poor nutrition or repeated bouts of infection early in life. The effects include delayed cognitive development, lower productivity, and increased risk of certain diseases-and they often last a lifetime./Of course, it would be better to avoid stunting in the first place by getting children better food. But the analysis takes its starting point that six million kids right now are stunted, and stunting is likely to affect millions more in coming years. How can we help them? It turns out that a study from Jamaica holds great promise. At the beginning of the two-decade study, stunted children under age two had lower levels of learning and productivity compared to non-stunted kids./The proposed solution was a psychosocial stimulation programme to help these children overcome their early-life setbacks. Education specialists visited the stunted children every week to lead play sessions that help develop cognitive, language, and psychosocial skills. The visits lasted for two years, and the social workers then taught the children's mothers how to do the same stimulating activities with their children into the future./At the 20-year follow-up, the researchers could hardly believe the results. The psychosocial activities had helped the affected kids completely overcome the negative effects of stunting. Adults who had participated in the programme as children had closed the entire gap to their non-stunted peers, as demonstrated by their equal wage levels. But stunted children who were not part of the programme earned 25 per cent less as adults than the treated and non-stunted groups./The activities allowed stunted children to become just as healthy and productive later in life as their peers. Translating these findings to Bangladesh, such a programme would cost Tk 12,450 per child each year, to pay for one hour per week for a social worker for each child. The benefits turn out to be much larger. Over each child's working career, the resulting wage increase-estimated to be nearly 20 per cent-is worth more than Tk 1.5 million (Tk 15 lakh). So each taka spent on psychosocial stimulation programmes for stunted children would do an impressive 18 takas of benefits./The stimulation programme promises the most benefits of all educational investments analysed, but other strategies hold promise to do good as well. ""Streaming,"" or grouping students into classes according to their initial levels of educational achievement, has proven to be beneficial and cost-effective in various contexts, particularly in programmes in India and Kenya./When children are grouped according to achievement level, teachers can provide better and more attentive teaching, which results in higher students test scores. The reassignment of pupils also allows teachers to give remedial students better-tailored assistance./Translating this to Bangladesh, reassigning students according to their achievement levels would cost Tk 7,800 per student, but it would also increase the student's test scores by two standard deviations. The investment would be spread across the first five years of primary schooling and would provide the means to hire additional teachers./The improvement in schooling quality would boost students' yearly earnings by an estimated 8.0 per cent over the course of their working lives./The analysis finds that in Bangladesh, reassigning students according to their initial achievement and knowledge levels would do an estimated 12 takas of good for each taka spent./A third potential solution involves training for people at a later stage of life: managers who work in various industries. Surprisingly, the schooling levels for managers and supervisors of many sectors have either remained stagnant or decreased over recent years, particularly in the ready-made garment (RMG) sector./RMG factories employ four million people in Bangladesh, most of whom are women, but the productivity of the sector is low compared to regional competitors such as China, India, and Sri Lanka. There is an opportunity to improve this worker productivity, however, through on-the-job professional training. And there is already a pool of potential future supervisors who work in the sector: female employees./Women account for 70 per cent of line operators in the country's RMG factories but only about 5.0 per cent of supervisory positions. Social norms and the perception that women lack technical skills often prevent them from being hired as managers. But evidence suggests that this perception is misplaced, and that management training can increase worker and firm productivity in a cost-effective manner./Women who could apprentice in supervisory roles and increase their skill levels through training would increase productivity for their companies. Such training would also give many women the skills to become full-time supervisors eventually, raising their wages./Professional training may not provide returns as great as investments in education earlier in life, but it might be more in line with firms' incentives. Each taka spent toward on-the-job training to make managers more productive would do 5.0 takas of good./The wide range of results from these educational strategies show we should be wary of just trusting our intuition-sometimes the things that are trendy simply do not work. That's why Bangladesh Priorities looks to the data to find out which solutions can do the most good for each taka spent./A recently popular anti-poverty strategy, for instance, is unconditional cash transfers. But our research finds that these transfers do less than 1.0 taka of good for each taka spent./We similarly find that using liquefied petroleum gas cookstoves is not the best way to fight household air pollution-the stoves burn very cleanly, but the costs are so high that they do not justify the intervention, given that there are much cheaper alternatives that can do much more good per taka spent./Many trendy development strategies end up costing more than the amount of good they can do. What do you think is the best way for Bangladesh to realise its development goals?/Learn about more the solutions for education and many other challenges at bangladesh-priorities.com. In the coming weeks, I will continue to write about various other exciting solutions for the country here in Financial Express. We will identify both the costs and benefits of the proposals, which will reveal the solutions that can do the most good for Bangladesh for each taka spent./Dr. Bjorn Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, ranking the smartest solutions to the world's biggest problems by cost-benefit.

"Need to save the city from noise, air pollution","Bangladesh, May 28 -- The capital city is suffering from unprecedented noise pollution and air pollution. Noise pollution is resulting in physical and psychological problems for the city dwellers, and has thus become an alarming health hazard./In fact, noise pollution in the city has gone beyond control due to lax enforcement of the Noise Pollution Control Rules 2006 by the authorities concerned and lack of awareness among the people about the rules. The mobile courts of the traffic police can impose a fine of Tk 100 as per the Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1983 against a vehicle for violating various traffic related offences./The drivers of vehicles unnecessarily use their hydraulic horns to create blaring noise. People of the city, predominantly students, can't concentrate on their studies and are unable to sleep due to unbearable sound of horns. However, there is a provision of sentencing a person to a minimum of one month's jail term and Tk 5,000 fine or both and a maximum of six moths' jail term and Tk 10,000 fine or both for causing noise pollution violating noise pollution control rules as per a recent legislation. But such rules are hardly followed./Various studies on noise pollution level in the city suggested that in reality the sound is three times higher than the level set in the noise pollution control rules. The ruler set a maximum 130 decibel sound during the off-peak hour between 9:00 pm and 6:00 am while it was maximum 127 decibel in the silent zone after 9:00 pm. The standard has been set for silent zone at 50 decibel during the day-time while it is 40 decibel at night./According to the Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1983, any vehicle that generates more than 85 decibel sound after starting the engine will not get the clearance certificate while it is totally forbidden to install hydraulic horn in the transports. But maximum number of bus and trucks has been using hydraulic horns threatening public health./On its part, the traffic police claim that they are authorised only to enforce the Article 139 of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983 where there is a provision to fine Tk 100 for using hydraulic horn. This is their mother Act and they cannot go beyond such law. They say the drive they conduct against the vehicles permits them only to enforce the Motor Vehicle Act and not the noise pollution control rules. If there is any joint drive, then the environment department can enforce the noise pollution rules, they claimed./Even if there is any chance of conducting any joint drive, the police do not have a meter to read the sound level. In such a way, they become helpless. They suggest that the policymakers should amend the rules and laws that have flaws and pass a combined act./According to a survey of the Department of Environment (DoE), noise pollution causes mental and physical illness among the people. It causes high blood pressure, tachycardia, headache and indigestion, peptic ulcer, and also affects sound sleep. Anyone may become deaf for the time being if 100 dB or more noise pollution occurs for half an hour or more in any place./Noise pollution beyond the limit destroys hearing and might even lead to the loss of one's mental balance. Working in a noisy environment for a long period can cause complete deafness to any person. Any sort of noise pollution seriously affects expecting mothers./Unplanned diffusion of communication system, industrialisation and lack of awareness among drivers, use of loud-speakers at different festivals and indifference of authority to the problem are causing concerns. Now it is necessary to formulate laws regarding specific sound limits for industries, transports and social programmes. Sound of vehicles and industries must be kept at a tolerable level./According to the Environment and Forestry Protection Law-1997, there is a designated silent area within 100 metres of any hospital, educational institution and some government-fixed institution. There is prohibition on use of microphones and horns. But, none follows the rules./Around 25 per cent of the surveyed people of Dhaka city suffer from lung function abnormalities due to higher extent of air pollution. Such lung function abnormalities cause different types of airborne diseases, like bronchiolitis, pneumonia, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These were revealed in a study on the effects of air pollution on public health conducted by a private university./The findings say the risk of lung function abnormalities increases following rise in age. The rate of affected people is 27.19 per cent for people of 40 years of age, while it is 21.53 per cent for people of 10-20 age group./Reports say air pollution is a major issue around the world and kills seven million people annually -- one in every eight people around the world. And, of course, air pollution is a well-known and much-complained-about fact in Bangladesh. Few major global cities suffer from air pollution worse than Dhaka. During the dry season, when dust is especially harmful, pollution levels can reach up to 16 times higher than the World Health Organisation's (WHO) air quality guideline./Outdoor air pollution kills 14,000 of Dhaka city's residents each year and it's not even the most damaging air pollution plaguing the country. Household air pollution caused by cooking indoors over open fires is the most deadly environmental problem in the world. The long-term health effects -- which can include lung cancer, stroke, and heart disease -- can be as bad as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day./On its part, the government needs to conduct serious awareness campaign on the rules and health related issues out of noise pollution should be intensified and become more active in enforcement of the law. The Department of Environment has, however, been implementing a two-year programme to control noise pollution after nine years of passage of the rules./Use of the vehicular hydraulic horns at any place of the city should be completely banned. Monitoring teams should be expanded at main traffic points to determine whether the vehicles follow the rules or not./author's email address: /<a href=""mailto:szkhanfe@gmail.com"">szkhanfe@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka's air quality shows improvement,"Dhaka, June 1 -- Dhaka's air quality showed improvement as it ranked 15th worst in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Monday morning./Dhaka had an AQI score of 87 at 08:38am and the air was classified as 'Moderate'./When the AQI value is between 51 and 100, active children and adult and people with respiratory diseases are advised to limit prolonged outdoor excretion, UNB reports./China's Shanghai, Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh city and Poland's Krakow occupied the first three spots in the list of cities with the worst air with scores of 164, 159 and 153 respectively./The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them./In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants - Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone./Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution.

We should not aim to return to normal,"Dhaka, June 12 -- The world before Covid-19 looks very attractive right now. In light of the disease, mass unemployment and social distancing, a return to pre-pandemic normality seems appealing. Yet we should remember what normal was./Normal was obtaining 85.0 per cent of our energy from fossil fuels and losing seven million people a year to air pollution. Normal was careening toward a global temperature rise of over 3.50C by the end of the century, with island nations facing obliteration. Normal was one in eight species threatened with extinction, continued squeezing of wild spaces into smaller and smaller corners, and the rampant illegal trade in wildlife. Normal contributed to causing this pandemic./We should also remember that Covid-19's effects on health, jobs and economies are simply an acute version of what climate change is predicted to bring - and in places already has. Unless we aspire to a better normal with recovery, we are treating the symptom, not the disease. We must build back better than before./Many governments are preparing stimulus and relief packages to support Covid-19 recovery. Trillions of dollars will be ushered into the economy across Asia and the Pacific. These stimulus measures should help us achieve a better normal - a greener, more equitable normal. How? A recent survey of 230 economists in 53 countries suggests that green, climate-friendly stimulus measures are the best options for an economic rebound, offering the highest economic multipliers in the short- and long-terms./Even before the pandemic, the UN determined that climate action could trigger US$26 trillion in economic benefits by 2030, create more than 65 million new jobs and avoid 700,000 premature deaths from air pollution. Governments have no shortage of options when it comes to directing a green, equitable stimulus package. They can offer support to the construction industry to develop energy efficient and zero-energy buildings. This is a high employment sector, and investments can be quickly implemented./It may be tempting to scale up funds for infrastructure like roads, but that funding can go to improved and greener public transport systems to service more people. More public transit capacity will reduce the load on roads and reduce air pollution and emissions. The lockdown has shown it's possible to lean more heavily on IT to decentralise business operations, reducing time lost and carbon produced in commutes and travel. Governments should now consider incentives to companies that invest in IT solutions for their operations./Many industries will be looking for bailouts to bounce back. There is no time like the present for governments to include terms that will require companies to work toward climate neutrality. Airlines supported by governments should be asked to make stronger commitments and take bolder action to reduce emissions, which will be needed anyway for the industry to guarantee long-term sustainability and employment for the millions who rely on it. The example is being set by those governments who have made their support dependent on energy efficiency targets and shifting short haul flights to rail./Bailouts to the auto industry can be directed to investments in e-vehicle and battery production, and efficiency technology. Where bailouts should not happen is in the fossil fuel sector. Developing Asian countries account for nearly one-third of global fossil fuel subsidies. The Covid-19 recovery period is the right time to end these subsidies, and ensure there are no new investments in coal. The savings to governments can support investments in areas like public health and renewable energy. This is one answer to the question of where stimulus money will come from./Across Asia and the Pacific, governments have scarce financial resources to apply toward recovery measures at the scale needed. This underlines that existing resources must be deployed to policies with the highest economic multipliers. It also implies that finding additional revenue will be a priority./Putting a price on carbon emissions and reforming subsidies for agriculture and fossil fuels can be especially effective with oil prices at record lows, when the social impact of removing subsidies will be lessened. Measures like fee bates-- which impose a fee on high-carbon vehicles and give a rebate to low-carbon cars -- to incentivise greener transport and energy efficiency improvements provide more options for increasing revenue./Green bonds can also finance energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Outside China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, green bonds are scarce in the region. Now is the time to capitalise on a proven idea to support a sustainable and resilient recovery from Covid-19./Covid-19 is a message from nature. So is the ongoing climate crisis. Normal isn't working. We need to build back better./Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana is United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)/Inger Andersen is United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

For effective steps to control air pollution,"Dhaka, June 24 -- The air pollution in the capital Dhaka has reached an intolerable level. The city has been ranked as one of the worst in Air Quality Index (AQI) recently./The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, tells people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. Bangladesh's overcrowded capital has been grappling with air pollution for a long time. The quality usually improves during monsoon./The country's High Court (HC) has recently asked the government to constitute a high-powered committee to formulate a guideline in order to reduce air pollution in and around Dhaka city. It passed the order following the capital's worsening air quality in recent times./The HC also ordered the authorities concerned to conduct mobile courts to shut down illegal brick fields in five districts, including Dhaka. The World Bank and the environment department recently reported air pollution of Dhaka and identified brick kilns as the number-one polluter./There're many reasons for air pollution in Dhaka. There must be coordination in building public and private infrastructure, and among the agencies working with utility services. Proper management of various projects, including the elevated expressway, must be ensured./The city's air pollution is getting worse day by day. The responsibility lies with the Department of Environment to solve the problem. The department of and the World Bank published a research report on the sources of air pollution in Bangladesh in early 2019. According to the research findings, the three main sources are brick kilns, fumes of vehicles and dust from construction sites. The dust particles are contributing to the city's worsening air pollution due to construction work without putting the site under cover./According to medical experts, dust concentration in the air usually increases five times during the dry season, and dust particles from construction sites worsen the situation. Inhaling dust can severely damage the respiratory system and cause various lung diseases as well as viral and bacterial infection./Along with the air pollution, noise pollution, also known as sound pollution, has turned acute in the capital city as it always goes far beyond the permissible level, putting the public health at risk. The survey, conducted at 70 points of the city, reveals that sound pollution has reached the highest 120-130 decibels (dB) at many points -- almost double the permissible level./In fact, noise pollution in the city has gone beyond control due to lax enforcement of the Noise Pollution Control Rules 2006 by the authorities concerned and lack of awareness among the people about the rules. The mobile courts of the traffic police can impose a fine of Tk 100 as per the Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1983 against a vehicle for violating various traffic related offences./Around 25 per cent of the surveyed people of Dhaka city suffer from lung function abnormalities due to higher extent of air pollution. Such lung function abnormalities cause different types of airborne diseases, like bronchiolitis, pneumonia, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)./Reports say air pollution is a major issue around the world and kills seven million people annually -- one in every eight people around the world. And, of course, air pollution is a well-known and much-complained-about fact in Bangladesh. Few major global cities suffer from air pollution Dhaka./The government needs to conduct serious awareness campaign on the rules and health related issues out of noise pollution and become more active in enforcement of the law./Use of the vehicular hydraulic horns at any place of the city should be completely banned. Monitoring teams should be expanded at main traffic points to determine whether the vehicles follow the rules or not./There is a need for taking effective steps to control air pollution in Dhaka by all government and private agencies or organisations./<a href=""mailto:szkhanfe@gmail.com"">szkhanfe@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

The Broken Planet: Quest for Revival,"Dhaka, June 24 -- It has now been a few months since we have started living in a different world. In the meantime, many of us became used to a life confined within our four walls. We are no longer rushing to a tea stall in our neighborhood for socializing, purposely evading any offer to dine in a restaurant or to fly for business or pleasure. It is not the biosphere that we have ever dreamt of living in, but instead, seems like one day we woke up in another world that is not so fine or friendly. That's all caused by one virus sending a devastating shockwave to our way of life./While the microscopic virus delivered a huge blow to our livelihood, almost every move linked to humanity came to a stanstill. For instance, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, a thriving city of approximately 20 million is suddenly free from its extreme traffic jams; airports, rail stations or bus stops quickly became empty. Bustling malls kept their doors shut despite permission granted to operate. Instead of buying jewelries or luxury goods, people became more interested in masks and oxygen cylinders. As we got used to the captive life, nature started to shine with a newfound freedom. A city with chronic air pollution started breathing again with noticeable improvement in its air quality. The country's popular tourist destination Cox's Bazar famous for its world's longest beach was also able to reclaim some of its splendors. The coastal town observed the return of the beach's morning glory, a common tropical creeping vine, considered to be avital part of the coastal ecosystem. This time, the whole planet seemingly doing just fine except one species, the humans, continue to be tormented by the virus. Up until the pandemic emerged, neither the government nor the public could stop the overuse or abuse of the air, earth or water.With an endless angst, we are now observing how our lives came under seize by a tiny virus but have already broken the planet by acting like invaders, aggressively destroying the earth's ecosystem. While our leaders were still debating on the need for sustainability, Mother Nature couldn't wait anymore. She had already embarked on her journey toward an irreversible path of demise./Some historians claim that 'a pandemic-driven world' comes every 100 years. Each time it comes wreaking havoc on human lives and leaves a trail of devastation on the economy when it exits. The irony is that tens of millions of people lose their lives due to the pandemics whereas humans have killed each other in hundreds of millions during the same period of time. Viruses are not living things, they are complicated assemblies of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. On their own, they can do nothing until entering a living body known as the host. On the contrary, humans are considered as the most advanced form of life with the highest level of intelligence among all known forms of life. Yet, they took gazillions of lives, on the pretext of race, religion, nationalism, revolutions or alleged self-defense. The economic impacts of those annihilations were varied from local to global scale and sometimes also created opportunities for one over the other./There is no question if the present pandemic's going to affect the global economy. Some forecasts are even going out of the way to suggest that this would be the worst ever. In any case, astute humans will find a remedy against the pandemic and a way to recover the economy sooner or later. Hence, the question remains whether we are learning from the experience today to permanently adjust to the way we live so that nature can stay as it should. Our capitalist economy built around greed, dominance, insecurity and most importantly ego didn't come to rescue us from the present pandemic. Our lifestyle that largely ignores the environment or turn a blind eye to the poverty, diseases affecting the masses will continue to hurt the future generations whatever we may call them X, Y, Z or Z+ gens./Lately, many talk shows aired and articles published are calling for embracing a so-called new normal. Unfortunately, the idea of the new normal mostly aims at temporary adjustments of our behaviors to continue with our heartless capitalist agenda. This does not look for a radical shift in our lifestyle about how we treat our nature or people. So far, our shortsighted vision led us to accumulate assets for the next generation, without a real consideration for the fact that there would be many more./Since the end of the second world war, many cultures had somehow believed that the self-styled leader of the free world, the USA, will protect the good people, us, from any enemy. Now this trust is shattered since the country is not able to play the role of a savior as they are struggling themselves not only with the pandemic but also with a primitive colour-based racial fault line. True or not, the media placed China under the microscope, the initial credibility regarding its battle against virus is now full of questions, and there are hundreds of legal demands from individuals backed by the elite lawyers at least in the USA, UK and France./Unfortunately, many of the counties are suffering from lack of leaderships. The perception is the blind populism like that in American, Mexican, or Brazilian leadership with an exception to that of Canada or New Zealand that clearly are taking care of their self-interests than paying attentionto their people. In the continental Americas, this is the case from the 49th parallel to all the way to Antarctica. In Europe, except the classical Nordics and Germans, the perception is the same, the situation in Asia isn't any better with few exceptions./The lack of public trust isn't going to help with the mayhem caused by the virus. Good governance is critical more than ever before, as people are struggling to survive. Governing reactively would merely bring about impaired judgement and evading processes and systems without careful management of risks comes at a great price and a series of unintended consequences./This perhaps hasn't start yet; our brain guards us against the potential abyss we might need to avoid. It's a domino effect, the virus kills the economy and kills loved ones, if not ourselves. The lack of a credible leadership and the notion that money can make people safer will heighten the tensions, and corruption will become more evident.This will make this world rather unsafe in terms of social and natural security. The public trust is crucial for our survival and to reshape our way of life by adapting to the lessons learned from this pandemic. It is not just another disaster but should be considered as an opportunity to rethink and reconfigure our social fabric to revive and keep the planet livable for the generations to come./Dr. Sabbir Ahmad is a Director, Engineering at edotco Group.

SDG 10 & 11: Addressing economic disparities and poor urban settlements,"Dhaka, July 9 -- The SDG framework identifies inequality as a key barrier in ensuring truly inclusive development to drive human progress towards sustainability and universal wellbeing. The Gini coefficient for Bangladesh fluctuates around the trend line, but the overall trend is downward from 48.9 in 2000 to 31.5 in 2010 indicating declining income inequality. But a much clearer picture of income distribution emerges when one looks at the income distribution between the poorest 10 per cent and the richest 10 per cent. The picture that emerges is: the income share of the poorest 10 per cent is 3.85 per cent compared to 26.92 per cent of the richest 10 per cent. In effect, the income share held by the highest 20 per cent is 41.48 per cent. An estimated 63 million people live under the poverty line in a country of 163 million people./Bangladesh has also witnessed rapid urbanisation with more than a third of its population now living in urban areas. Although population growth rate has come down to 1.2 per cent per annum, the country remains one of the most densely populated in the world. This urbanisation has been spurred by structural changes in the rural economy resulting from the increased commercialisation of the agriculture sector and widespread rural poverty. But this rapid urbanisation has caused heightened urban poverty with extremely poor living conditions for these rural migrants and also urban congestion./CLIMATE CHANGE, MIGRATION AND URBAN POVERTY: The genesis of migration lies in people's quest to live or subsist in a form better than their present status. Some migrate for sheer survival, that is, to escape from poverty; others, to improve their quality of life, while still others in search for fortune. Since each of these pursuits is made by people who come from different socio-economic strata and hence have a different purpose for moving, migration is quite a heterogeneous phenomenon. In contemporary low-income economies, however, the principal reason for people to move is the worsening productive-resource-to-human-power ratio, stemming mainly from rapid population growth and an external demand for local resources. This has compelled large sections of the populace to migrate to look for work as a part of their survival strategy. Depending upon the needs and circumstances, people move seasonally, for fixed periods, or permanently. In this sense, the transition economies of South-East Asia, some of which are among the poorer ones in the world, present a picture typical of other low-income countries./SLUMISATION AND POOR URBAN SETTLEMENTS: The role of migration in urbanisation is obvious in all societies and at almost all times, since urbanisation and urban growth take place through a combination of three components, such as (a) natural increase of the native urban population, (b) area redefinition or reclassification or annexation, and (c) rural-urban (or other forms of internal) migration. In a condition of developing urbanisation, the role of migration is even more pronounced while in the state of advanced urbanisation, where urban growth is almost stagnant or even declining, internal migration plays a minor or almost no role. Rural to urban migration may again take many forms, such as (a) permanent migration, (b) temporary migration, (c) seasonal migration, (d) circular migration, and (c) commuting. The process ranges from short distance mobility (commuting) to long distance and long term movement or permanent migration. In the case of Bangladesh, the status of academic as well as planning studies on internal migration is not too bad, although, all dimensions of internal migration might not have received enough attention. Considerable literature exists on the subject of determinants or causes of rural to urban migration. A Bangladeshi scholar working at an American University has, in a recent paper, classified the models of migration into two groups (i) one which isolates migration as a domestic phenomenon and (ii) the other which places causes of migration within an international politico-economic framework. Migration is the combined effect of both push and pulls factors and it is often difficult to separate the role of the two. Within the Push-Pull model, push factors (at rural end) may be identified for Bangladesh as: 1) Population pressure, adverse person-land ratio, landlessness and poverty; 2) Frequent and severe natural disasters (particularly river bank erosion), and 3) Lack of economic opportunities./The impact rural to urban migration is both diverse and deep, both at the urban destination end and at the rural origin. Most of the researches have been at the urban end. Urbanisation and urban growth occurring due to migration have both positive and negative consequences and impacts. Some of the positive consequences of urbanisation are the following: Economic benefits: higher productivity, better income etc; Demographic benefits: lowering of age at marriage, reduction of fertility rate; Socio-cultural benefits: modernisation; Political benefits: empowerment, democracy./Urbanisation is not an unmixed blessing. Its negative consequences are of great concern. These assume critical role under situation of rapid and uncontrolled or unplanned urban expansion. The negative consequences can be grouped as the following: Environmental consequences-- encroachment on productive agricultural land and forests, extreme pressure on housing, growth of slums and the pressure on and urban services; Economic consequences-- income inequality and poverty, ill effects of globalisation; Social consequences-- increased violence and crime, social degradation; Cultural consequences-- entry of alien culture, loss of national cultural identity./HIDDEN IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AMONG URBAN POOR: Climate change can directly affect health because high temperatures place an added stress on human physiology. Changes in temperatures and precipitation including extreme weather events and storms can cause deaths directly, or by altering the environment, result in an increased incidence of infectious diseases. Air pollution can be exacerbated by higher temperature and humidity. Finally, virtually all effects of global climate change ranging from sea-level rise to impacts on agriculture and human infrastructures are linked at least indirectly to human health./The incidence and severity of many health problems increase with increasing temperature. As temperatures increase, the body expands added energy to keep cool. The most immediate consequence, if the body temperature rises above 410 C, is heat stroke. This disturbance to the temperature regulating mechanism may result in fever, hot and dry skin, rapid pulse and sometimes progress to delirium and coma. Also, temperature stress can exacerbate many existing health conditions including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and influenza. Mortality from such diseases, especially among children and the elderly, increases dramatically during periods of hot weather. Quantitative algorithms based on historical data that relate morbidity and mortality to weather conditions suggest that global warming will increase heart related mortality./The combination of higher temperatures and potential increases in summer precipitation could create the conditions for greater intensity or spread of many infectious diseases. However, risk in the human health sector is low relative to climate change induced risks in other sectors (such as water resources) mainly because of the higher uncertainty about many of the health outcomes. Increased risk to human health from increased flooding and cyclones seems most likely. Changes in infectious disease are less certain. The causes of outbreaks of infectious disease are quite complex and often do not have a simple relationship with increasing temperature or change in precipitation. It is not clear if the magnitude of the change in health risks resulting from climate change will be significant compared to current risks. It is also not clear if increased health risk will be apparent in the next few decades. On the whole, climate change is expected to present increased risks to human health in Bangladesh, especially in the light of the poor state of the country's public health infrastructure./In general, climate change impacts tend to be more on the poor than the rich. Inequality is not inevitable, it is a policy preference. Regarding sustainable urbanism, policymakers should improve urban efficiency in order to lower the cost of living by dealing with urban crowding and providing public goods, eliminate the causes that lead to squatter settlements, and not discourage internal migration, which fosters an efficient allocation of the population and has an equalising effect across places./Shishir Reza is an environmental analyst & associate member, Bangladesh/Economic Association./<a href=""mailto:shishiresrm@gmail.com"">shishiresrm@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Air pollution decreases global lifespan by two years,"Dhaka, Aug. 8 -- Air pollution reduces global life expectancy by nearly two years putting Bangladesh at the centre of threat, a new analysis of data from the Air Quality Life Index has found./The analysis of Air Quality Life Index was conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC)./Nearly a quarter of the global population lives in four countries in South Asia that are among the world's most polluted-- Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, the study published by the University of Chicago read./People living in these countries could see their lives cut short by five years on average, after being exposed to pollution levels that are now 44 per cent higher than they were two decades ago./""High pollution across the entirety of Bangladesh makes it the most polluted country in the world. The most severe pollution, however, is found in parts of India, especially northern India, including the megacities of Delhi and Kolkata,"" it read./Particulate pollution is also a significant concern in Southeast Asia, where traditional pollution sources such as vehicles, powerplants and industries combine with forest and cropland fires to produce deadly concentrations./As a result, 89 per cent of Southeast Asia's 650 million people live in areas where particulate pollution exceeds the WHO guideline. Growing metropolises-such as Jakarta, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh and Bangkok-bear the greatest burden./""Though the threat of coronavirus is grave and deserves every bit of the attention it is receiving-perhaps more in some places-embracing the seriousness of air pollution with a similar vigour would allow billions of people around the world to lead longer and healthier lives,"" said Professor Michael Greenstone, the director of EPIC./""The reality is, no shot in the arm will alleviate air pollution. The solution lies in robust public policy. The AQLI tells citizens and policymakers how particulate pollution is affecting them and their communities and can be used to measure the benefits of policies to reduce pollution,"" Professor Michael, also a leading economist whose research has focused on environmental quality, said./Launched in 2018 by Greenstone and his EPIC colleagues, the Air Quality Life Index allows users to zoom in on any district in the world and understand the effects of that district's local air pollution on life expectancy./Working unseen inside the human body, particulate pollution has a more devastating impact on life expectancy than communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, behavioural killers like cigarette smoking, and even war./<a href=""mailto:nsrafsanju@gmail.com"">nsrafsanju@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Covid-19 in an Urban World,"Dhaka, Aug. 8 -- The remarkable growth of cities in recent decades has intensified a number of humanity's most pressing challenges. It has also presented many of our greatest opportunities to protect people, prosperity and planet. Covid-19 has laid bare - and indeed heightened - both these challenges and these opportunities./With an estimated 90.0 per cent of all reported Covid-19 cases, urban areas have become the epicentre of the pandemic. The size of their populations and their high level of global and local interconnectivity make them particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that density per se correlates to higher virus transmission. Cities can manage this crisis and emerge as the hubs of energy, resilience and innovation that make them such vibrant and appealing places for many to live. But this will take conscious policy choices, as this policy brief will show, particularly with respect to inequalities, local capacities and a green, inclusive recovery./In the near term, for many cities, the Covid-19 health crisis has expanded to a crisis of urban access, urban equity, urban finance, safety, joblessness, public services, infrastructure and transport, all of which are disproportionally affecting the most vulnerable in society./Covid-19 highlights the critical role local governments play as frontline responders in crisis response, recovery and rebuilding. They play a leading role in service delivery, economic development and infrastructure investments./However, business closures, job losses, and other economic impacts have led to declining tax revenues during the crisis, placing significant financial strain on many local governments./Estimates from the World Bank and United Nations (UN) entities suggest that local governments may on average lose 15.0 per cent to 25.0 per cent in revenues in 2021. Cities with less diversified economic bases have been hit especially hard. Cities with a revenue base reliant primarily on tourism, for example, may see acute economic shrinkage as earnings from international tourism are estimated to decline by as much as 80.0 per cent in 2020, accompanied by the loss of 120 million jobs. If not addressed, the financial crises that cities may bear could jeopardise crucial urban infrastructure investments, lead to cuts in public services, and undermine broader sustainable urban development efforts./Covid-19 shutdown measures in urban areas have had economic impacts far beyond their boundaries. Urban economies account for approximately 80 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Hours worked across all countries and regions are estimated to have fallen by 14 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the last quarter of 2019, which is equivalent to a loss of 400 million full-time jobs. Globally, the effects have been especially severe in the informal sector, which represents 90.0 per cent and 67.0 per cent of total employment in low and middle-income countries respectively. In the first month of the crisis, on average informal workers worldwide lost as much as 60.0 per cent of their earnings. In Africa and Latin America this figure was nearly 80.0 per cent. This has had devastating impacts for women. Globally women are overrepresented in the informal economy as well as in the hardest hit sectors, such as tourism, hospitality, and services./Deep-rooted inequalities, including where in a city a person lives and works and a person's gender and age, can lead to the pandemic having a disproportional impact on groups that were already in a situation of greater vulnerability. Meanwhile, there is evidence that tackling Covid-19 may be more challenging in urban areas with high levels of crime and violence, poor infrastructure and housing, and/ or weak local governance with ill-equipped or under-resourced frontline workers. Limited access to healthcare, basic services and adequate housing and/or public space can further undermine Covid-19 responses./To safely adhere to coronavirus physical distancing and hygiene guidelines, everyone needs access to adequate housing. Yet the global urban housing crisis forces around 1.0 billion people or 24 per cent of the world's urban population to reside in slums and informal settlements, exacerbating the impact of the pandemic. With limited or no income during lockdowns, the urban poor in all countries face risk of eviction, while overcrowding in low-quality housing increases the risk of rapid transmission. Housing considerations may also be increasing the vulnerability of women to violence and abuse. Since the pandemic began, levels of gender-based violence have increased at alarming levels in all regions. With mobility restricted, unemployment and poverty rising, the ability of women to flee an abusive situation has become even more constrained./Public transport systems around the world have seen ridership and revenue plummet and have been forced to cut services. This is a worrisome trend considering that before the pandemic, only around half of the world's urban population had convenient access to public transport. Declining ridership due to Covid-19 - if not halted and reversed - could jeopardise the transition to safe and sustainable transport for all, and constrain efforts to tackle climate change and air pollution./Several cities have encouraged biking and walking as safe alternatives to public transport during the Covid-19 outbreak, enabling new user groups to take advantage of the affordability and health benefits of these forms of transport. The success of these initiatives may encourage city governments to convert more roads for similar purposes, further improving mobility and safety. There is also an opportunity in this moment to relook at public transport from a gender perspective, taking into account protection considerations, where main arteries and routes flow and how these factors impact time spent moving between schools, care facilities, markets and other essential facilities that are often on the periphery rather than on main transport routes./Several new scientific studies suggest that poor air quality is correlated with higher Covid-19 mortality rates. For example, a small increase in fine particulate matter has been associated with an 8.0 per cent increase and up to 21.4 per cent increase in death rates in the US and the Netherlands, respectively. New evidence also points to impacts on pregnant women and new-born babies as well as maternal mortality, particularly among populations already facing socio-economic stress due to marginalisation. While pollution and Greenhouse Gas Emissions have fallen sharply during the pandemic when countries halted their economies to contain the spread of the virus, these environmental gains are expected to be temporary if economies reopen without policies in place that prevent air pollution and promote decarbonisation./Meanwhile, the current pandemic is accelerating trends such as digitalisation, shifts to remote work, and virtual delivery of essential services. This transition to digital life has created an uncertain future for city infrastructure and buildings, as demand for office space and housing could subsequently decline. Urban segregation and migration could also accelerate as people at higher income levels look for new ways of living and working outside the city in response to the pandemic. If associated with an increase in urban sprawl and income, racial and gender inequalities, migration away from cities could undermine vital efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), protect biodiversity and address the climate crisis./There is an urgent need to rethink and transform cities to respond to the reality of Covid-19 and potential future pandemics, and to recover better, by building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities. We know that this is possible. The rapid shifts in society due to Covid-19 present a powerful lesson that society is capable of near-overnight transformation that is needed to confront our most urgent threats, such as the climate and pollution crises that threaten the very viability of cities. Indeed, previous disease outbreaks - such as the flu pandemic (1918) and localised epidemics of tuberculosis and cholera - have driven several positive urban transformations - such as the introduction of sewage systems, public parks, and housing regulations to improve sanitation and reduce over-crowding. Today, local and regional governments are already demonstrating an impressive array of innovative solutions that can address structural weaknesses exposed by the pandemic./Addressing Covid-19 in an increasingly urbanised world requires a focus on how urbanisation shapes impacts, responses and longer-term recovery. Responses that are soloed or short- sighted, focusing on quick fixes, could worsen and entrench impacts laid bare by the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, many of the short-term response measures will need to be maintained for some time, even when the initial outbreak appears to have been contained, given the risk of secondary waves of infections. Long-term policy choices by national, regional and local governments are needed to build our resilience against future pandemics, including climatic and economic hazards and shocks, while safe- guarding human rights, sustaining peace and strengthening our ability to achieve the SDGs./Realising these potential gains will require intensified commitments and action in three key areas:/1) TACKLING INEQUALITIES AND DEVELOPMENT DEFICITS: National and local government efforts to protect the most vulnerable groups during the immediate response phases are crucial, as are recovery measures that reduce urban inequalities, strengthen human rights and bolster the resilience of vulnerable groups to future shocks. Against this background, priority actions that policymakers could make - in consultation with relevant stakeholders - include:/(a) Understand inequalities and commit to disaggregated data gathering and utilisation: Spatial mapping and analysis of inequalities at urban and neighbourhood levels and disaggregated by gender and age could be conducted to assess health, wealth and wellbeing in order to reshape national and local development policies, in particular in deprived areas and slums and at the most local of levels./(b) Provide safe shelter for all and consider a moratorium on all evictions: Temporary shelters could be provided to enable those living in overcrowded or unsafe conditions to physically distance or safely self-isolate, where needed. All residents, regardless of migration status or formality of dwelling, need to be protected from evictions during the Covid-19 crisis and from essential service disconnections. Domestic violence shelters should be declared as essential services and where they are full or have insufficient space owing to distancing measures, alternative accommodation should be made available./(c) Make large-scale public investments in affordable and adequate housing and slum upgrading to ensure that marginalised groups have access to shelter that facilitates physical and mental health during the pandemic and beyond. Future-proof investments to ensure extension of adequate water and sanitation coverage are also needed./(d) Ensure that public services are uninterrupted, equally accessible for the urban poor and other vulnerable groups and payments in default forgiven or deferred: This is particularly important for services that are crucial for effectively coping with the crisis - such as water, sanitation, waste collection and electricity. For individuals and communities that currently lack access to such services, it will be important to provide immediate access - for example in the form of hand washing stations. Equally improved internet access in poor urban neighbour- hoods will also facilitate telecommuting and home education while schools are closed./(e) Ensure equitable access to health supplies, facilities and resources and support the urban poor and vulnerable groups with free or low-cost access to face masks, testing, and treatment. Coordination and collaboration should be promoted amongst hospitals to ensure that the burden of Covid-19 treatment is distributed effectively to avoid hospitals in deprived affected areas from becoming overwhelmed when those in less hard-hit areas have spare capacity./(f) Guarantee equitable distribution of vaccines: Cities are crucial distribution centres for vaccines, and as such could play a crucial role in ensuring that such distribution is equitable. Local governments can help to ensure that a Covid-19 vaccine, when developed, is available to poor and vulnerable groups free of charge or at a very low cost./(g) Ensure the most marginalised communities and individuals play leadership roles in immediate response, design and planning efforts: The most vulnerable and marginalised communities, including slum dwellers, people suffering from homelessness, inter- nally displaced persons, people with disabilities, women and girls, migrants and refugees, should be engaged as response leaders and partners to ensure that response measures are designed with their needs in mind./2) STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITIES OF LOCAL ACTORS, PARTICULARLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS: National governments could promote more inclusive, collaborative and responsive governance across jurisdictions and levels of government. National stimulus packages that maximise support for tailored subnational responses, and that boost local governments' budgetary capacity, can help to address some of the constraints that local governments face. Priority actions could include:/(a) Ensure collaboration across levels of government and subnational jurisdictions: Inclusive, participatory, multi-level governance are at the heart of local responses, and collaboration between all levels of government needs to be institutionalised, providing consistent engagement with all residents, particularly marginalised and vulnerable groups. Where there are low levels of women's formal representation in governance bodies, temporary structures such as a city level Covid taskforce with gender balanced representation, should be considered./(b) Enhance local government budgetary capacity with policy measures and dedicated funds in stimulus packages: Stimulus pack- ages and policy measures could be adopted that boost local and regional governments' ability to sustain critical public services and raise and control their own finances (for example, through local taxes, charges and fees), while also taking into account the need to prevent additional financial pressure on poor and vulnerable groups./(c) Promote accountability and transparency: Evidence-based accountability mechanisms on the implementation of Covid-19 policies could be enacted for all levels of government, in a manner that allows for direct feedback from communities./(d) Ensure communication campaigns reach all urban communities: Effective and coherent communication engagement strategies could be prioritised with a view to building public trust in Covid-19 response and recovery efforts at all levels of government, taking account of literacy, language and access to technology barriers./(e) Support local governments in avoiding disruptions of essential public services: Sufficient financial resources and revenue-raising capacity need to be ensured to sustain critical public services (e.g. water, sanitation, transport, education, electricity). Essential services should also include domestic violence shelters and other protection services. Policies and strategies could be adopted that boost capacities for equitable public service delivery and gender-responsive public transport systems that take sustainability, safety, affordability, accessibility and attractiveness into account; and infrastructure could be provided that encourages safe walking and cycling. Local governments also play an important role in supporting effective contact tracing, provided that sufficient financial and human capacities are available./3) PURSUING A RESILIENT, INCLUSIVE, GENDER- EQUAL AND GREEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY: Looking to the future, strengthening the resilience and sustainability of cities needs to be a global priority. Resilient cities address underlying socio-economic vulnerabilities, leverage data for urban planning and adopt climate investment measures. For instance, financial assistance programmes and direct stimulus funding for urban areas could help to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19 on local businesses and build new, more resilient supply chains. Social protection could be expanded to the informal sector, for migrant workers, and for paid and unpaid care workers. Covid-19 economic recovery measures in cities could harness green and sustainable solutions that provide longer-term benefits, such as the introduction of new models of urban development and a transition from a linear to a circular economy that regenerates, reduces waste and reuses materials resulting in cost savings as well as environmental benefits. Priority actions could include:/(a) Bolster micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and support a safe restarting of businesses: Stimulus measures and social protection programmes could be adopted for MSMEs and workers in the informal economy (e.g. cash transfers, tax deferrals, wage subsidies, subsidised sick leave, subsidised social security contributions and unemployment insurance). Measures to digitise economies could be adopted or accelerated, including government-to-business transfers, providing safer and faster access to government support payments for MSMEs by digital means. Digital payment ecosystems could be expanded so MSMEs can more quickly pay for business inputs needed. Development of and access to, digital financial products could be encouraged, including financing for business rebuilding and growth in the recovery phase, and insurance to protect against future shocks. Specific measures for targeting women MSME owners should be developed, recognising the greater obstacles to finance and the particular burdens of this crisis on women./(b) Sustainable economic development strategies: Local governments and their associations could implement participatory, tailored strategies for local economic development, social cohesion and choose public investments with high job multipliers. Such strategies could recognise the urban informal economy and be embedded in national economic recovery strategies. Local economic development strategies can also help to foster productive and diversified - and therefore more resilient - city economies./(c) It is important that social protection schemes also serve the most marginalised, regardless of formality of work or migration status, and not just those in the formal labour market./(d) Build future-ready cities: Stimulus packages could future-proof cities by focusing on sectors with potential for high ecological transformation and job creation (e.g. retrofitting, sustainable buildings and construction, waste collection and management, decentralised renewable urban energy, local food systems, and climate resilient urban infrastructure)./(e) Urban compactness could be a goal while de-densification could be resisted: Policy measures and incentives could be pursued hat discourage urban sprawl (e.g. implement carbon pricing, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies that reward suburbanisation, and promote well-designed urban density to generate economies of agglomeration). It is important to recognise that compact cities are healthier for planet and people, particularly when they are designed to ensure adequate housing and public green space for all./(f) Ensure resilience plans are based on disaggregated data: Disaggregated urban data gathering and use could be increased, as could local level resilience profiling and planning to build a more detailed under- standing of crisis response, preparedness and recovery at the urban level. This could help ensure scarce resources are used with greatest efficiency and efficacy in response and resilience-building efforts./(g) Develop and implement multi-hazard resilience plans: Preparedness plans could be developed for predictable risks and dis- asters (including hurricanes, heat-waves, and other impacts of climate change) which may be exacerbated by Covid-19 impacts, and investments could be made in multi-hazard resilience building./(h) Invest significantly in the care economy: This pandemic has made clear that the formal economy is reliant on both unpaid and underpaid care work. Recovery will be more effective, rapid, and sustainable if financial investments target greater investment in the care economy, allowing those who may not otherwise be able to join the formal lab or force to participate./This is the Executive Summary of the UN Policy Brief on COVID-19 in an Urban World.

A new dimension to air-quality health index,"Dhaka, Aug. 11 -- While the covid-19 pandemic now occupies the centre stage when it comes to the issue of global health concern, fresh light has been shed on an old health issue, the air quality of a place. The health hazard that air pollution poses to a population has the potential to considerably reduce its life expectancy, a Chicago University-based energy-policy think tank has claimed in its recent research finding. That inhalation of polluted air for a long time can harm the respiratory organs is common knowledge. But what makes the finding significant is that it combines air-quality data with that of life expectancy thereby producing a new kind of index termed Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) which gives a whole new dimension to the rather dull air-quality index of a place. Interestingly, the authors of this research even give the same importance to the fight against the menace of air pollution to that of combating covid-19./In Bangladesh, a densely populated country, fossil fuel burning industries, power plants and automobiles emitting toxic pollutant gases are growing in numbers by the day. Add to those the dirt and particulate matter ejecting from housing and infrastructure building activities. Though the pollution level did come down to some degree during the days of strict lockdowns in the early months of the pandemic, it has again started to catch up with the previous level after the pandemic control measures began to be relaxed for the sake of the people's livelihoods. That means mitigating the health and as such the life-expectancy-related concerns as expressed by AQLI should now get a renewed attention along with that given to combating the covid-19 pandemic./Bangladesh along with other South Asian nations like India, Nepal and Pakistan face similar health predicaments in terms of AQLI arising from poor air quality and high population density, so adds the said report. Although the calculation of AQLI adds to our awareness about the old issue of air pollution's health impacts, it does not, however, suggest any new approach to address it. So, we have to go back to stressing the green alternatives to our prevailing practice of production and use of energy to power the means of transport and industries. The only way to do that is to make renewed efforts to conserve our forest lands and bring fresh areas under aforestation programmes to increase the country's present land-forest ratio at 17.5 per cent to a higher level to attain a more sustainable level to protect environment./At the same time, the housing and infrastructure building projects are required to take necessary measures to arrest ejection of particulate matters in the air as well as control its backward linkage activities such as brick fields that expel noxious fumes. Suspended particulate matter in the air is a more serious health problem than the usual gaseous pollutants so far as it concerns their health consequences, hold health experts. In fact, those are as potent health threats as some communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and behavioural health issues like smoking. However, there is no shortcut answer to the question of air pollution leading to these health consequences as emphasised by research after research. Increased public awareness, effective pollution control measures, strict enforcement of the relevant laws are the tested methods to be applied energetically to reduce pollution-related health risks and thereby improve Bangladesh's Air Quality Life Index or AQLI./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Summit explores solutions to Covid-19 challenges,"Dhaka, Sept. 17 -- The third edition of the Bangladesh Economics Summit organised by the Economics Study Center (ESC) kicked off on September 12, 2020 with the theme ""The Impact of COVID-19: Exposing the Fault Lines of Bangladesh Economy"". This year's events include panel discussions, public lectures, research paper presentations, policy debates-- all of which are designed to engage academicians, policy-makers, and young economists in discourse and share the platform to explore the solutions to the underlying problems. Due to the pandemic situation, all the events are being held on Zoom, a virtual meeting platform, which are also broadcast live on Facebook./The summit started with a panel discussion on the topic ""Governance Failure and Corruption: Impediment towards Tackling COVID-19"". The session was chaired by Dr Selim Raihan, professor of Economics, University of Dhaka. Amongst the panellists were Professor Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Dr Kazi Maruful Islam, professor of Development Studies, University of Dhaka; and Dr Ahsan H Mansur, executive director, Policy Research Institute (PRI)./Dr Selim Raihan started the session by emphasising the need to understand the relationship between state and business, the role of non-elites, and their interaction with the elites. ""Corruption is a symptom of a bigger problem which involves three major institutional challenges- the supremacy of dealmaking over formal regulations, the inefficiency of the regulatory body, and weak state capacity,"" said Dr Raihan./Professor Mustafizur Rahman drew attention to the shortcomings of the growth-centric development paradigm of Bangladesh in this COVID-19 situation. ""COVID-19 is a test for us that has put us in a three-dimensional crisis of health, economic, and humanitarian risk, which we cannot solve without addressing the underlying issue of poor governance"", he said./Dr Kazi Maruful Islam explained the inadequacy in tackling the COVID-19 situation from a political point of view. In his opinion, it is not merely a management issue, rather it stems from the lack of transparency and competition in the election process of public offices. Although a transparent election may not necessarily lead to a corruption-free government as we have seen in the past but it is a precondition for eradicating corruption. ""When the means and the ends both are corrupted, it is pointless to expect reform and good governance,"" said Dr Islam./Dr Ahsan H Mansur, the final speaker of the panel remarked that it is a general trend that the party in power wants to stay in power and grab more power. This motivates the government to undermine the authority of institutions and compromise with many state players. Even if the government wants reform, it falls short due to the lack of political will and even authority in some cases. ""If we truly want to reform, we have to establish meritocracy and accountability in our system,"" said Dr Mansur./On the second day of the summit, a public lecture was conducted by Dr Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, professor of Economics at Yale University, on the topic ""Economic Effects of COVID-19 in Low and Middle-Income Countries."" Dr Mobarak gave a brief overview of his work during the pandemic and stated that in most countries COVID-19 will soon turn into an economic crisis from a public-health crisis and this will have a severe impact on the global structure. He mentioned that epidemiological models and their connections with economic factors have played a significant role in his work and emphasised the use of existing data to ensure social protection./Dr Mobarak discussed in detail about the epi-economic modelling and the research thought process. When the idea of flattening the curve came in from the Imperial College Model, developed countries like the US tried to minimise the case fatality rate by physical distancing and providing reliefs based on tax returns. However, it was inapplicable for developing countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia where only two to four per cent of the population are taxpayers. Thus, he urged to incorporate economic factors and data from low-income countries to the existing model instead of developed countries./Y-RISE, an initiative founded by Dr Mobarak, and a2i collaborated in data mapping at the regional level to develop comprehensive COVID-19 socio-economic data. By doing so, it was revealed that migrant families as a whole are suffering from lack of food security and are earning 36 per cent less than non-migrant households. The income of non-migrant households also declined by 31 per cent due to the pandemic./Dr Mobarak concluded his lecture by showing that even though the rate of mask purchasing has increased, only 11 per cent of Bangladeshi people are currently wearing them properly. He urged the government to take stern actions to implement consistent use of masks in Bangladesh./On the third day of the summit, a panel discussion was held on the topic ""Exploiting Nature: Root Cause for Pandemics and Climate Disasters"". The session was chaired by Dr MM Akash, chairman, Department of Economics, University of Dhaka. The panel included Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, chairman, Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation; Dr Ainun Nishat, professor emeritus, BRAC University; Dr AK Enamul Haque, professor of Economics, East West University./Dr Enamul Haque started the discussion by saying that aiming at poverty reduction has deprioritised the environmental sector. He also focused on high rates of air pollution that might increase the chance of spreading COVID-19. ""We have to look for our faults rather than looking for a scapegoat to blame on,"" he said./""This pandemic situation wouldn't have reached such a severe condition if we had strict monitoring in airports and international land ports,"" said Dr Ainun Nishat. He also focused on problems related to ecosystems like the higher rate of saltiness in coastal soil, the increasing frequency of tidal surge, lack of pure drinking water and others./Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad focused on the carbon emission issue and how it might be controlled, and how strict laws can help us to fight this battle of preserving the environment. ""Nature is for all species and nature always tries to save all its species. So, sometimes in reply to all the human tortures, it comes up with a natural remedy,"" he said. He added that due to deforestation, animals lose their habitats and they come in contact with humans and many diseases spread./Professor MM Akash concluded the discussion by mentioning how the expansion of neo-liberalism in the international front might jeopardise the entire environmental movement. ""Without focusing on the faults within governance, we cannot successfully achieve the climate action goals,"" said Dr Akash./The summit will be concluded on September 19 following the launch of a study report authored by the Economics Study Center (ESC) titled 'Assessing the Fault Lines of Bangladesh's Healthcare Sector: Implications for Future Policy Response'./The writer is a third year undergraduate student at the Department of Economics, University of Dhaka.

Envisioning a new way of living,"Dhaka, Oct. 7 -- ""Change is the only constant,"" said Heraclitus, a 5th century BC Greek philosopher./Ever imagined a concert where people are standing six feet apart? Well, now it's reality. Novel coronavirus that has already been declared a pandemic, has kept people locked at home for quite some time and claimed millions of lives as well. While the world is on the verge of a second wave, myriad questions linger-- how long can people sit like this in their homes while the economy is collapsing? If the vaccine fails, will physical distancing be enough to contain the pandemic? How will the post pandemic world or the new normal look like?/While these questions seem too far-fetched, they need to be answered to make necessary strategies beforehand. In this composition, the author tries to envision both in optimistic and pessimistic ways about how the way of living may alter./Economy/The Covid-19 has resulted in a global economic crisis where most countries are either in recession or depression. After the Great Depression in 1930, this is currently the worst economic crisis the world is facing. To contain the spread of the pandemic, more than one third of the world population were placed in lockdown. This led to a steep decline in economic activity as many people lost their jobs, the tourism industry shattered and the remittance-- which was an essential part of developing countries' economies-- ceased. If this scenario has to be changed, another surge in death toll might be imminent which makes emphasis on people's healthcare the first priority. However, if the recession continues, the world may experience a huge economic downturn resulting in a exacerbated global food crisis./On a brighter side, if the world leaders form an allegiance to end the crisis and invest for the greater good, an enriching future can be anticipated. They may team up realising that this is a high time of economic transition making it more humane, rather than market and profit oriented. It was evident during the first wave that countries like the UK and the USA which prioritise the market more than other sectors, were the least prepared for the pandemic. This is clearly a lesson to push for bringing change in the existing system./Education/While many teaching and corporate jobs are being conducted virtually at present, the fact can't be ignored that many people are unemployed and that children from insolvent families are being deprived from their right to education. If the situation worsens along with the recession, it is very likely that soon a lot of people will again fall under the vicious abyss of poverty. Years of efforts and progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) might disintegrate./Nevertheless, a different scenario is possible too. Countries, especially developing ones, may realise the importance of technology and work toward its advancement. With technological advancement, schools will only be a few clicks away, making education accessible for all helping to achieve gender equality in education. Illiteracy might decrease and with more people having access to the internet. Overall, the world may witness the emergence of a technologically advanced and research-oriented civilisation./Social and personal life/Wearing masks, omnipresent temperature sensors, and widespread sanitisation have already become the norm and the practice will remain till herd immunity is achieved. With the realisation that many pandemics emerged due to wildlife trading, a ban in animal cruelty in the disguise of food production is even possible. While being enormously disruptive and painful, crises also invariably nurture the emergence of great common purpose, solidarity, creativity, and improvisation. And social media has opened little windows into how everybody else has responded and found their own coping mechanisms. Much free time in people's hands these days has unlocked an inner creativity and resourcefulness that can be shared widely online. People in their own ways have become reconnected with something that is increasingly lost in hectic modern life -- making and doing things from scratch and realising how deeply satisfying and fulfilling that can be./Amidst all these personal life positivity, violence can't be overlooked; abuse and torture has increased as predators have their victims at proximity. According to many reports, domestic violence has soared dangerously. No matter how close social media has brought people, a lot have become traumatised during the lockdown loneliness, being overly anxious or due to precipitous unemployment and subsequent poverty. Many experts fear that mental illness can be severe after the pandemic is over. Even racism may become rampant as many believe that the pandemic was all China's fault, further fueling the xenophobia already prevalent in the western world. Nonetheless, people have become more aware during the pandemic and if the global villagers realise that it is time to express solidarity and lend a hand towards each other, such unfortunate conditions may be kept at bay./Environment/Behind all the sufferings of the coronavirus pandemic, an even larger global crisis is lurking, the climate change. Could the international lockdowns help the environmental ease, or would it just return to business as usual as quickly as possible? Many city-dwellers have noticed an improvement in their urban environments with cleaner-smelling air, calmer, safer roads and bolder wildlife, which offers a glimpse of what a greener world might look like./Indeed, satellite data have revealed a drop in atmospheric levels of nitrogen dioxide over cities and industrial centres across Europe and Asia as traffic and factories quietened -- falling in some regions by 30-40 per cent compared to this time last year. Levels of sooty particles in the air like nitrogen dioxide have also greatly reduced. So alongside slowing the transmission of the coronavirus, the lockdowns and consequent reduction in industrial air pollution itself have probably saved the lives of numerous people by reducing chronic air-born diseases. Global CO2 emissions for 2020 is estimated to fall by 8.0 per cent. This might help in achieving the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature increase below 1.5degC within a fixed period./All in all, Covid-19 has disrupted lives just like a pebble does to a placid lake. Evidently, the world needs to get accustomed to the new normal. Predicting what the new normal might look like is nothing more than a wild guess. The safest prediction is that the new normal might be a mix of both good and bad outcomes, just like the bitter sweetness present in people's lives. For now, the only hope is that mankind emerges victorious from this battle against the coronavirus as soon as possible and let the future unravel what it holds./The writer is an A level student at SFX Greenherald International School, Dhaka.

Court asks authorities to sprinkle water in Dhaka city,"Dhaka, Feb. 5 -- The High Court on Thursday issued three-point directives to protect the dwellers of the capital city from the pollution of the dust./The court directed the Director General of the Fire Service and Civil Defense Department to take necessary measures to sprinkle water at various points of the city including the gateways like Gabtoli, Jatrabari, Purbachal, Keraniganj and Tongi./At the same time, the two city corporations of Dhaka have been instructed to sprinkle water on the streets of Dhaka from above so that the dust accumulated in the small trees on the side of the roads is cleaned./The court directed the Managing Director of Dhaka WASA to supply water to the two city corporations of Dhaka in case of water shortage./The High Court has asked to implement the order and submit a report in the court in one month./The High Court bench of Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam and Justice Mohammad Ali passed the order after holding hearing on a petition filed in this regard./Advocate Manzill Murshid appeared in the court on behalf of the writ petitioner, while Advocate Amatul Karim represented the Environment Department./Advocate Sayed Ahmed Raza appeared for the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), Barrister Toufiq Inam Tipu appeared for the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Deputy Attorney General ABM Abdullah Al Mahmud Bashar appeared for the state./Later Advocate Manzill Murshid said that the High Court in January last year gave nine-point directives to prevent air pollution in and around Dhaka. Later in February, when action was taken, air pollution was somewhat reduced. But in recent months air pollution has increased again, said the lawyer./In this circumstance the writ petitioner filed a supplementary petition with the High Court seeking directives upon the respondents to take steps to prevent air pollution in and around Dhaka. After hearing the petition the High Court passed order./Following a writ petition the High Court on January 13 in 2020 directed the government bodies to seize the vehicles which are emitting black smoke exceeding the limit./In its order, the court also directed the government to take steps to fix the economic life of different vehicles as per Section 36 of Road Transport Act-2018 and prohibit those vehicles having no economic life to run on the roads./The court also directed the respondents to take appropriate steps in one month to stop burning of different tiers without having environment license and also to stop vehicle battery-recycling at any place without approval of the environment department./It also directed the authorities of the two city corporations of Dhaka to take steps to ensure that all the market owners to keep their daily garbage in a safe bag and during closing down those will be dumped at a designated area./It directed the respondents to spray water in the morning and evening every day in the area which has not been covered till today by the two city corporations and to ensure that all trucks plying on roads in Dhaka city with sand or mud or waste must use covering./Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed the writ petition on January 27, 2019, seeking necessary order from the High Court to prevent air pollution./<a href=""mailto:bikashju@gmail.com"">bikashju@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Fossil fuel pollution causes one in five premature deaths globally,"Dhaka, Feb. 10 -- Pollution from fossil fuels causes one in five premature deaths globally, suggesting the health impacts of burning coal, oil and natural gas may be far higher than previously thought, according to a study published on Tuesday./Parts of China, India, Europe and the northeastern United States are among the hardest-hit areas, suffering a disproportionately high share of 8.7 million annual deaths attributed to fossil fuels, the study published in the journal Environmental Research found./The new research gives the most detailed assessment of premature deaths due to fossil-fuel air pollution to date. Another study in 2017 had put the annual number of deaths from all outdoor airborne particulate matter - including dust and smoke from agricultural burns and wildfires - at 4.2 million./""Our study certainly isn't in isolation in finding a large impact on health due to exposure to air pollution, but we were blown away by just how large the estimate was that we obtained,"" said Eloise Marais, an expert in atmospheric chemistry at University College London, and a co-author of the study./Previous research based on satellite data and ground observations had struggled to distinguish pollution caused by burning fossil fuels from other sources of harmful particulates, such as wildfires or dust./The team from three British universities and Harvard University sought to overcome this problem by using a high-resolution model to give a clearer indication of which kinds of pollutants people were breathing in a particular area./With concern growing over the role that burning fossil fuels plays in causing climate change, the authors said they hoped the study, based on data from 2018, would provide further impetus for governments to accelerate a shift to cleaner energy./""We hope that by quantifying the health consequences of fossil fuel combustion, we can send a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders of the benefits of a transition to alternative energy sources,"" said co-author Joel Schwartz, an environmental epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka's air quality improved in lockdown,"Dhaka, April 24 -- The air quality of Dhaka city has made a marked improvement by some 45pc on average a day during the first seven days of the Covid-19 lockdown due to the low level of emissions./According to a survey conducted by Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS) of Stamford University Bangladesh, four reasons effectively worked behind the strange improvement in the air quality./It said low traffic flow, suspension of road renovation and construction works and lack of activities to burn wastes led to the improvement in the air quality though it is said to be a short-lived gain./Even the air pollution declined by 70pc in some areas in the city during the April 14-21 period, the survey says./The survey was carried out under a project titled ""Promoting Democratic Governance and Collective Advocacy for Environmental Protection in Dhaka City"" with financial support from USAID and UKAid./As part of the survey, the air quality was measured using automatic equipment for eight hours a day in 10 areas of the capital./The measurement showed that the air quality has improved on average 45pc a day from April 14 to 21 last./The average AQI score was 117.8 on April 14-21 during the full lockdown, which is 45pc less than the average score of 214.5 recorded on April 5-8 during the partial lockdown./A significant improvement in the city's air quality was also noticed in the beginning of the partial lockdown enforced on March 29 as the average AQI score was 168.3 from April 1 to 4 last. The air quality then worsened again as the restrictions on traffic and public activities were largely defied./However, Dhaka's air quality with a score of 117.8 was still 'unhealthy' for sensitive groups like children, pregnant women, elderly and people with heart and lung diseases as it falls into the AQI score 100-150 category, said CAPS founder director Prof Dr Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder./During the April 5-8 last, the air quality with 214.5 was 'very unhealthy', he said, adding that the score 200-300 is considered as 'very unhealthy'./The air quality with AQI score 300+ is considered as 'hazardous' and the score 150-200 as 'unhealthy', said Prof Majumder, also the chairman of the Department of Environment Science of the university./According to the study findings, suspension of digging, renovation and construction works of roads; non-movement of motorised vehicles; lack of pollution from waste burning; and the presence of less airborne dust contributed to the air quality improvement./It says unsafe digging, renovation and construction works of roads are the source of 20pc-25pc of air pollution in Dhaka city. The capital has been in thick construction and reconstruction activities for decades affecting its air quality badly./Black smoke emitted from some 5.6 lakh unfit vehicles is responsible for 15pc-20pc of air pollution in Dhaka. But movement of some 95pc unfit vehicles remained suspended during the lockdown (April 14-21)./Vehicular movement makes dust floating in the air from road-surfaces. But this airborne dust declined by 10pc due to the low traffic flow in the city. Burning wastages is responsible for 10pc of the city's air pollution, which also was not seen during the lockdown./During the 90 days from January to March 2021, the air quality was recorded as 'hazardous' for 12 days, 'very unhealthy' for 58 days, 'unhealthy' for 19 days and 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' for one day in Dhaka, one of the most polluted cities in the world, according to another recent study./People are advised to avoid all outdoor exertion when the air quality is hazardous, reports UNB./Dhaka that has long been grappling with poor air quality is frequently ranked the most polluted city, the second or third most polluted city in the world./Dhaka's air starts getting fresh with the advent of monsoon from mid-June and remains mostly acceptable till October./Air pollution consistently ranks among the top risk factors for death and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been recognized as increasing a person's chances of developing heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections and cancer, according to several studies./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka again world's most polluted city,"Dhaka, April 24 -- The densely populated capital of Bangladesh has once again topped the list of world cities with the worst air quality./Dhaka's air quality index (AQI) at 6.29 am read 489, considered 'severe', reports UNB./An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered 'poor', while a reading of 301 to 400 is said to be 'hazardous', posing serious health risks to city residents. And an AQI between 401 and 500 is said to be 'severe'./Pakistan's Karachi and India's Kolkata occupied the second and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality, with AQI scores of 173 and 166, respectively./AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, is used by government agencies to inform people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them./In Bangladesh, the overall AQI is based on five criteria pollutants - Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3)./Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Generally, the capital's air starts getting fresh when monsoon rains begin from mid-June./In 2021, the average daily AQI score was 261 in January, 231 in February and 211 in March, which hit the record high in the last five years./The average AQI scores were 247, 193 and 170 in January-March 2017 respectively, according to the analysis made by Prof Dr Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder, Founder and Director of Centre for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS), Stamford University, Bangladesh./During these five years, the air quality was relatively better in 2020 as the average AQI scores were 235 in January, 220 in February and 175 in March in the year./In January 2021, the air quality in Dhaka was hazardous (score 300+) for seven days, very unhealthy (score 200-300) for 23 days and unhealthy (151-200) for one day./In the last three months, the highest average AQI score was 365 on January 20 and the lowest 144 on March 11, 2021./Although the hazardous air quality poses serious health risks to residents, little is being done to check air pollution./People are advised to avoid all outdoor exertion when the air quality is hazardous, said Dr Majumder, also chairman of the Department of Environmental Science of Stamford University./What experts say/Experts say the exposure to a high level of air pollution weakens people's respiratory and immune systems, causes various cold-related diseases, making them more susceptible to Covid-19./The World Health Organization (WHO) has also recently cautioned that the cities which have a higher level of air pollution should reinforce their preparedness against the deadly corona pandemic./Experts also say the use of masks by all must be ensured by enforcing law and motivating people as it is the most effective way to protect oneself from pollution and Covid-19./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Fight against air pollution,"Dhaka, June 1 -- Air pollution is getting worse every year. Last year, Bangladesh had the worst recorded air quality in the world (106 countries were on the list). And this year, the situation is somewhat similar. Usually one of the ways air quality improves naturally is when heavy rains wash down the polluting particles from the air. The rain also halts a lot of major polluting activities like brick making furnaces and construction. So it is no surprise that Dhaka's best AQI numbers tend to coincide with the rainy season./Air pollution is constantly being associated with terrible respiratory health and breathing problems. One of every eight people dies due to complexity risen from air pollution. Stroke, chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, even heart attack is connected to air pollution./As it appears from researches, air pollution seems to be concentrated in the cities. While Dhaka city has a landmass which is roughly 0.21 per cent of Bangladesh, it is currently the residence of about 6.21 per cent of the country's population. Dhaka is estimated to have 10.3 million people in 2021 (1.03 crore). It is only natural that any sort of pollution will increase when that many people are concentrated in such a small area./Hence, the problem needs to be addressed immediately. Around the world, there has been an ongoing trend in initiatives and activities to address air pollution. In neighbouring Myanmar, young students have come up with a campaign to spread awareness among the people about air pollution and what their roles would be in fighting this problem./Another example is Graviky Lab's Air-Ink. This is a project that turns car pollution into usable ink. The crux of the idea is a Kaalink, a pollution particle capture container, which is attached to car exhaust pipes to catch pollutant particles. The invention, highly suitable for use in urban areas, can catch about 1.5 litres of pollutant in 25 hours of driving. This captured matter is then processed in the lab and used to produce different types of ink. This ink is already being used for various decorative projects like a mural in Hong Kong and is available for a wide range of utensils like pens, sharpies, markers, etc./Another illustrious example is LeafyLive in Nairobi, Kenya, which is working to produce clean fuel from waste products. The initiative recycles used diapers to produce cheap, sustainable and clean fuel. The idea came from upstanding and enterprising youth from the localities, which is now helping reduce air pollution in Nairobi./All of these stories regarding the fight against pollution have commonalities among them-- ideas and responsible youth. All it needed for those ideas to flourish was an initiative from someone and support by others. Air-Ink found its support through Kickstarter, a crowdfunding company based in Brooklyn New York.

Improving the AQI status,"Dhaka, Dec. 26 -- The Bangladesh capital has the dubious reputation of recording the highest level of hazardous air quality for nearly a decade. This infamy has been perennial with one or another city of the country. The year of 2020, however, witnessed a relatively acceptable air quality. It was a salubrious break, prompted, ironically, by a one-and-half year shutdown enforced by the government. With the traffic movements witnessing a drastic fall and the fuel-run factories ordered shut, the Bangladesh cities experienced their pollution-free ambience by default. Thus in the recent years, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is largely hinged on urban atmospheric conditions./Caused mainly by unplanned urbanisation, the deterioration of air quality speaks of ominous developments --- like that related to ground level ozone depletion. From the point of view of socio-economic conditions, Bangladesh cities are unlikely places to become vulnerable to unhealthy AQI. Sudden urban development or spurt in industrialisation in cities contributes to the worsening of the places' air quality. As a city doing nothing to improve its air quality year after year, Dhaka's poor place in the current AQI is a foregone conclusion. In fact, a few newly industrialised cities in the country have also joined the bandwagon. The once sparsely populated towns and cities of Gazipur, Chattogram and Narayanganj are among them./In general perception, it is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which calculates the AQI for five major air pollutants. It is for this purpose the national air quality standards have been established to safeguard public health. The five pollutants are regulated by Clean Air Act. Each of these pollutants has a national air quality standard set by EPA to protect public health, i.e. ground-level ozone. This year Dhaka ranked the fourth worst in the AQI on December 21. The Bangladesh Air Quality Index had a score of 197. In environmental assessment, it is classified as 'unhealthy'. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered 'unhealthy', among the sensitive groups in particular. Lahore in Pakistan, Kabul in Afghanistan, and Delhi in India have occupied three top places with their AQI scores at 426, 395 and 224 respectively. These scores are classified as 'hazardous' and 'very unhealthy'. The calculation of air quality has lately become a global practice. It's because the index's rise and decline in a country is entwined with the physical condition of its vulnerable people./Different countries have their respective unique air quality indices. Thus Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Mainland China, European countries, India, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, UK, USA, Vietnam and other countries have their own indices. Since the AQI is directly involved with ensuring a successful battle against air-borne diseases, it is imperative that the parties to air pollution and those battling the scourge were aware of the present pandemic situation. It has been proved, and is now widely known that Covid-19 and its new variant Omicron virus target the human lungs first. In a heavily air polluted environment, human lungs also turn vulnerable. Covid-19 attack exacerbates people's condition with weak lungs. So the country's city corporations should take all necessary steps to keep the vulnerable cities' AQI free of the agents of pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

"Massive volumes of Covid medical waste posing risk to health, environment: WHO","Dhaka, Feb. 1 -- Discarded syringes, used test kits and old vaccine bottles from the COVID-19 pandemic have piled up to create tens of thousands of tonnes of medical waste, threatening human health and the environment, a World Health Organization report said on Tuesday./The material potentially exposes health workers to burns, needle-stick injuries and disease-causing germs, the report said, according to Reuters./""We found that COVID-19 has increased healthcare waste loads in facilities to up to 10 times,"" Maggie Montgomery, a WHO technical officer, told Geneva-based journalists./She said the biggest risk for affected communities was air pollution caused by burning waste at insufficiently high temperatures leading to the release of carcinogens./The report calls for reform and investment including through the reduction in the use of packaging that has caused a rush for plastic and the use of protective gear made from reusable and recyclable materials./The WHO report estimates that some 87,000 tonnes of personal protective equipment (PPE) or the equivalent of the weight of several hundred blue whales, has been ordered via a UN portal up until Nov. 2021 - most of which is thought to have ended up as waste./The report also mentions some 140 million test kits with a potential to generate 2,600 tonnes of mostly plastic trash and enough chemical waste to fill one-third of an Olympic swimming pool./In addition, it estimates that some 8 billion vaccine doses administered globally have produced an additional 144,000 tonnes of waste in the form of glass vials, syringes, needles, and safety boxes./TOO MANY MOONSUITS/Montgomery said a misperception about the rates of COVID-19 infection from surfaces was to blame for what she called the ""overuse"" of protective gear, particularly gloves./""We've all seen photos of the moonsuits, we've all seen photos of people vaccinating with gloves,"" she said. ""Certainly across the board... people are wearing excessive PPE,"" she added./The WHO report did not name specific examples of where the most egregious build-ups occurred but referred to challenges such as the limited waste treatment and disposal in rural India as well as large volumes of faecal sludge from quarantine facilities in Madagascar./Even before the pandemic, around a third of healthcare facilities were not equipped to handle existing waste loads, the WHO said. That was as high as 60% in poor countries, it said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

"Landfills become prime hotspots of pollution, health hazard: Experts","Dhaka, Feb. 14 -- Landfills have become the unavoidable source of environmental pollution and the cause of health risks, said environmentalists and experts calling for a move of public-private-community to manage waste./Participants at a webinar expressed their concern over the source of pollution from waste landfills. They said that the approach to solid waste management in Bangladesh has been top-down, technocratic and disconnected from the end-users./Experts pointed out that Bangladesh needs a zero-waste movement, based on public-private-community partnerships to manage its waste. They stated that adaptation of the zero-waste principle is essential for sustainable waste management./The call was made as part of a high-level policy dialogue on ""Zero Waste Communities for Sustainable Waste Management"" organised by the Environment and Social Development Organization - ESDO virtually on Sunday, said a media release on Monday./According to ESDO presentation, In Bangladesh, inadequate collection and uncontrolled dumping or burning of solid waste are still an unfortunate reality, affecting public health and polluting the environment./Waste Atlas states that only 37 per cent of Bangladesh's huge volume of waste (about 22.4 mil tons/year) is collected by the municipalities, most of which pile up in landfills or unregulated dumpsites./These practices have led to critical challenges such as water pollution, air pollution, soil pollution, blockage in drains causing floods, food contamination, malodor in public places, and missed economic opportunities from recycling./Md Moniruzzaman, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change attended the event as special guest./He said: ""In the Solid Waste Management Rule 2021, waste segregation and reuse has been emphasised. We hope that with the spontaneous participation of the community, we will be able to have a sustainable waste management system.""/Syed Marghub Murshed, Former Secretary of Bangladesh and Chairperson of ESDO said that several success stories of community participation across developed and developing countries have strengthened the view that city corporations cannot work in isolation and require active participation of all the stakeholders to manage waste./Shibu K Nair, Coordinator, GAIA India, said: ""Municipal solid waste management is becoming exceedingly challenging in Asian cities, but when we look at the nature of waste, we see that a large percentage-typically more than 50 per cent is organic./""The significant proportion of organic waste represents an excellent opportunity for waste management. If organic waste is correctly separated and managed separately, more than half of the problem is solved. That implies we will indeed have achieved half of the journey to Zero Waste.""/Brig Gen Md. Zobaidur Rahman, Chief Health Officer, Dhaka North City Corporation stated that Waste disposal sites that are poorly maintained act as breeding grounds for disease vectors and contribute to global climate change by emitting methane gas./To control this situation City Corporation along with community people needs to come forward and work together, he added./ESDO's Secretary General Dr. Shahriar Hossain said that a zero-waste strategy needs to ensure everyone has access to tools to reduce, reuse and recycle waste where they live, work and play./Zero waste approach will build a circular economy, where ""waste"" is a resource for something new. This will also create good, green jobs as resources are endlessly recirculated through our economy instead of being used once and then disposed or destroyed, he added./<a href=""mailto:nsrafsanju@gmail.com"">nsrafsanju@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Experts for sprinkling water on city's roads to ease air pollution,"Dhaka, April 30 -- Summer or winter, air pollution trends across the seasons in Dhaka. This year-round air pollution is largely attributed to the same emissions -- construction and road dust./Construction dust is basically silica dust prevalent at construction sites and is often held responsible for health conditions like asthma. Leftover construction waste also adds dust to air./Road dust, on the other hand, is loose soil on broken or unpaved roads, and includes vehicular emissions to an extent./Experts, however, claim to have a quick fix solution for Dhaka's air pollution that peaks during winter and prevails in summer too -- sprinkling water on all construction sites, public or private, and roads to settle dust./MA Matin, former general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA), told UNB that air pollution is increasing day by day in Dhaka due to the absence of an effective control mechanism./""Dust and sand particles cause air pollution but the city's two civic bodies have to take concrete steps to control the same. The pollution has hazardous health implications that can cause death directly or indirectly.""/Professor Dr Najmul Islam, director of the Disease Control Department of the Health Directorate, echoed similar voice./""Pollutants are getting mixed with foods and triggering serious health issues -- from asthma to lung disease and kidney failure. It's high time that the pollution was curbed,"" he said./Bangladesh Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin urged all agencies concerned to act in a coordinated manner to control pollution./""Time and again, we have set up several camps in Dhaka and other big cities to determine the air quality level. However, it did not work and we now need coordinated steps to curb pollution,"" he said./According to the minister, it's the responsibility of the two city corporations to keep its roads clean every day. ""They must also sprinkle water on the roads to bring down the dust,"" he said./""Several decisions were taken at the inter-ministerial meetings to curb air pollution. Implementation of the measures can give effective results but there is no alternative to coordinated efforts of all agencies.""/The minister pointed out that construction sites across the city produce dust, one of the major reasons for air pollution in Dhaka./""In other countries, we have observed that protective measures are taken around the construction sites. Open air construction of buildings, infrastructure development works have risen in the city. RAJUK has to play a more effective role in this regard,"" he said./He said to curb the city's pollution, government and private organisations have to comply with effective environmental measures, transporting soil, sand and other construction materials following proper protocols, and spraying water in big infrastructure and development projects./Shahab Uddin said the Metro Rail construction work in the capital, going on since 2016, is also worsening Dhaka's air./""We have warned the Meto Rail Authority several times by sending them letters from the Department of Environment,"" said the minister. Closed construction is the best way for curbing pollution, he added./Unplanned brick kilns on the outskirts of the metropolis also contribute to pollution. The environment minister blamed unplanned digging of roads in the name of maintenance and drainage works by Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA) for the city's pollution problem./""To prevent air pollution, the maintenance work needs to be conducted in a planned manner and in coordination with private and public bodies,"" he said./Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Mayor Atiqul Islam said a water-spraying initiative to minimise dust pollution has already been undertaken. He attributed the city's poor air quality to the Metro Rail project./""Nine imported sweeping vehicles with brush and water spraying technology will soon be put to use on Dhaka's roads to help minimise the dust pollution.""/RAJUK chairman ABM Aman Ullah Nuri blamed the lack of human resources of the organisation for its inability to monitor the huge number of construction projects in and around the city on a regular basis./""While giving approval to building designs, we give directions to make the construction work eco-friendly,"" he said, vowing to take strict action against violators./Meanwhile, Tajul Islam, Minister of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives, said, ""Directions will be given for spraying water on the city's roads.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Pollution killing 9 million people a year: Report,"Dhaka, May 18 -- Worsening outdoor air pollution and toxic lead poisoning have kept global deaths from environmental contamination at an estimated 9 million per year since 2015 - countering modest progress made in tackling pollution elsewhere, a team of scientists reported Tuesday./Air pollution from industry processes along with urbanisation drove a 7 per cent increase in pollution-related deaths from 2015 to 2019, according to the scientists' analysis of data on global mortality and pollution levels, reports Reuters./""We're sitting in the stew pot and slowly burning,"" said Richard Fuller, a study co-author and head of the global nonprofit Pure Earth. But unlike climate change, malaria, or HIV, ""we haven't given (environmental pollution) much focus.""/An earlier version of the work published in 2017 also estimated the death toll from pollution at roughly 9 million per year - or about one of every six deaths worldwide - and the cost to the global economy at up to $4.6 trillion per year. That puts pollution on par with smoking in terms of global deaths. Covid-19, by comparison, has killed about 6.7 million people globally since the pandemic began./For their most recent study, published in the online journal Lancet Planetary Health, the authors analysed 2019 data from the Global Burden of Disease, an ongoing study by the University of Washington that assesses overall pollution exposure and calculates mortality risk./The new analysis looks more specifically at the causes of pollution - separating traditional contaminants such as indoor smoke or sewage from more modern pollutants, like industrial air pollution and toxic chemicals. Here are some of the key takeaways:/WATER AND INDOOR AIR/Deaths from traditional pollutants are declining globally. But they remain a major problem in Africa and some other developing countries. Tainted water and soil and dirty indoor air put Chad, the Central African Republic and Niger as the three countries with the most pollution-related deaths, according to data adjusted for population./State programs to cut indoor air pollution and improvements in sanitation have helped to curb death tolls in some places. In Ethiopia and Nigeria, these efforts brought related deaths to drop by two-thirds between 2000 and 2019. Meanwhile, the Indian government in 2016 began offering to replace wood-burning stoves with gas stove connections./MODERN POLLUTANTS/Deaths caused by exposure to modern pollutants such as heavy metals, agrochemicals and fossil fuel emissions are ""just skyrocketing"", rising 66 per ent since 2000, said co-author Rachael Kupka, executive director of the New York-based Global Alliance on Health and Pollution./When it comes to outdoor air pollution, some major capital cities have seen some success, including in Bangkok, China, and Mexico City, the authors said. But in smaller cities, pollution levels continue to climb./HIGHEST POLLUTION-RELATED DEATHS/The study offered a list of the 10 countries most affected by pollution-related deaths, based on their findings on mortality adjusted for population./1.

Pollution in Bangladesh: The invisible tango with death,"Dhaka, May 29 -- More than 215,000 people in Bangladesh succumbed to pollution in 2019. The ever lurking, at times invisible, killer ~ air pollution ~ alone claimed about 175,000 lives. Water pollution was responsible for 30,000 deaths, while soil contamination, lead pollution, and occupational hazard-related pollution factors, including exposure to harmful chemicals and substances at work, made up for the rest of the death pie. This was revealed in a recent report titled ""Pollution and Health: A Progress Update,"" by the medical journal The Lancet, according to thestatesman.com./While these numbers are new, the scenario is not. This dark underbelly of the growing, flourishing nation is known to all of us. Day in and day out, we breathe, we drink, we eat, we touch death like it is nobody's business. In fact, for us, it is business as usual. Unfortunately, for our lawmakers and the government, this daily brush of the common people with death has also become an acceptable norm, which is why, despite the publication of multiple reports flagging this morose reality and the concerns raised by various quarters, little to no action has been taken to rectify this./As late as March this year, it was revealed in a report by US-based organisations Health Effects Institute (HEI) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) that, on an average, almost three years of a person's life expectancy is cut by air pollution in Bangladesh. The report, titled ""State of Global Air 2020: How Does Air Pollution Affect Life Expectancy around the World?"", added that outdoor air pollution is responsible for reducing 1.16 years, while indoor air pollution is responsible for reducing 1.53 years./And Bangladesh often, unfortunately, finds itself at the top of the list of the most air-polluted countries in the world, based on the AQI score. Accord- ing to IQAir, Bangladesh was the most air-polluted country in the world in 2021 with an average AQI of 161./Despite these, the brick kilns keep operating at full throttle, non-compliant factories keep emitting harmful gases and discharging toxic wastes in rivers and water bodies, unfit vehicles keep polluting the air, and biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and dust from the various ongoing development works keep choking the life out of us. And no one bothers to take any measure to stop these./Similarly, water pollution has exposed us to various health complications, including diarrhoea and cholera outbreaks, among other diseases. Over the years, we have allowed industries to discharge their chemical and factory wastes into the rivers without a worry, which has made the waters of our rivers so toxic and polluted that they have now become hotbeds for various diseases, including harmful skin diseases and cancer. A dip in the Buriganga, and one would emerge carrying a host of germs and bacteria, resulting in immediate reactions./And while water sources have been compromised, the lack of an efficient water purification and distribution system by Wasa has exposed the population, especially in the big cities, to deadly bacteria and viruses, which can cause a wide variety of fatal liver diseases, including Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Air pollution cuts life expectancy by over two years: study,"Dhaka, June 14 -- Chronic air pollution cuts average global life expectancy by more than two years per person, a study published on Tuesday showed, an impact comparable to that of smoking and far worse than HIV/AIDS or terrorism./More than 97 per cent of the global population lives in areas where air pollution exceeds recommended levels, the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPIC) said in its latest Air Quality Life Index, which used satellite data to measure levels of PM2.5, hazardous floating particles that damage the lungs./It said that if global PM2.5 levels were reduced to the five micrograms per cubic metre recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), average life expectancy would rise by an average of 2.2 years, reports Reuters./Air pollution has been neglected as a public health issue, with funding to address the problem still inadequate, the study warned./""Now that our understanding of pollution's impact has improved, there's a stronger case for governments to prioritise it as an urgent policy issue,"" said Christa Hasenkopf, director of EPIC's Air Quality Life Index./Residents of South Asia lose an estimated five years of life as a result of smog, the study said, with India accounting for around 44 per cent of the world's increase in air pollution since 2013./Residents of China could live an average of 2.6 years longer if WHO standards were reached, though life expectancy has improved by around two years since 2013, when the country began a ""war on pollution"" that cut PM2.5 by around 40 per cent./EPIC's calculations were based on a previous study showing that sustained exposure to an additional 10 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5 would reduce life expectancy by nearly a year./Not a single country managed to meet the WHO's 5-microgram standard in 2021, according to a survey of pollution data published earlier this year./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Air pollution cuts life expectancy by nearly seven years in Bangladesh: Study,"Dhaka, June 14 -- Chronic air pollution shortens the average life expectancy of Bangladeshis by 6.9 years, according to a global study that says Bangladesh is the world's ""most polluted country""./Some areas of Bangladesh fare much worse than average, with air pollution cutting lives short by nearly nine years in Dhaka, the country's most polluted city, the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute said in its latest Air Quality Life Index./The researchers used satellite data to measure levels of PM2.5, hazardous floating particles that damage the lungs, reports bdnews24.com with details from Reuters./If global PM2.5 levels were reduced to the five micrograms per cubic metre recommended by the World Health Organization, average life expectancy would rise by an average of 2.2 years, according to the study released on Tuesday./In no region of the world is the opportunity for improved health and life expectancy greater than in South Asia, which includes four of the five most polluted countries in the world./In Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, the AQLI data reveal that the average person would live five years longer if pollution were reduced to meet the WHO guideline./Due to South Asia's high population and pollution concentrations, the region accounts for 52 per cent of total life years lost globally due to particulate pollution exceeding the WHO guideline./While India contains the most polluted air in some of its regions, the most polluted country overall in the world is Bangladesh. According to new and revised satellite-derived PM2.5 data, Bangladesh had pollution concentration of 75.8 micrograms per cubic metre in 2020. That's a 13.1 per cent increase in pollution during a year when Covid-19 lockdowns were in place./While this is a significant increase over the 2019 level of 67 micrograms per cubic metre, pollution in Bangladesh has remained consistently high over the past decade, fluctuating between 63 and 77 micrograms per cubic metre. That's 12 to 15 times higher than the WHO guideline./The researchers do not find the increase in South Asian air pollution over time ""surprising"". Over the last two decades, industrialisation, economic development, and population growth have led to skyrocketing energy demand and fossil fuel use across the region. In India and Pakistan, the number of vehicles on the road has increased about four-fold since the early 2000s. In Bangladesh, the number of motor vehicles roughly tripled from 2010 to 2020./In Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan combined, electricity generation from fossil fuels tripled from 1998 to 2017./Crop burning, brick kilns, and other industrial activities have also contributed to rising particulates in the region./'GREATEST THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH'/Measured in terms of life expectancy, particulate pollution is the greatest threat to human health in Bangladesh, reducing life expectancy by almost seven years on average, the researchers said./In contrast, child and maternal malnutrition reduces average life expectancy by about 1.4 years in the country, while smoking reduces average life expectancy by 1.6 years./More than 97 per cent of the global population lives in areas where air pollution exceeds recommended levels, according to the study. In Bangladesh, all of its 16 million people live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds both the WHO guideline and the country's own national standard./In each of the country's 64 districts, particulate pollution levels far exceed the WHO guideline./In Dhaka, the largest city in Bangladesh, air pollution is significantly higher than the national average of 88.9 micrograms per cubic metre, and residents are losing more than eight years of life expectancy on average./In Chattogram, residents are losing 6.6 years./Air pollution has been neglected as a public health issue globally, with funding to address the problem still inadequate, the study warned./""Now that our understanding of pollution's impact has improved, there's a stronger case for governments to prioritise it as an urgent policy issue,"" said Christa Hasenkopf, director of EPIC's Air Quality Life Index./As part of its efforts to prevent air pollution, Bangladesh is expanding its monitoring capacity and real-time measurements are expected to soon cover eight cities, up from the four that are covered today, according to the report./Bangladesh has both encouraged brick kiln owners to shift to cleaner technologies. In Bangladesh, where brick kilns are responsible for about 60 per cent of the particulate pollution in Dhaka, the law governing brick kiln production was amended in 2019 to prohibit the establishment of brick kilns near residential, commercial, agricultural, and environmentally sensitive areas./In addition, the government is planning to phase out the use of bricks in favour of concrete blocks by 2025 in order to lessen the damage to both the quality of the air and topsoil./""Ultimately, the success of these policies will be judged by whether particulate pollution actually decreases. We will need to turn to air quality data produced in these countries in the coming years to provide a quantitative assessment,"" the report said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

The health risks of extreme heat,"Dhaka, July 21 -- Europe is sweltering under a record-breaking heatwave, with a number of governments issuing health emergency alerts./WHAT ARE THE RISKS?/Heat affects health in a number of ways./Heat exhaustion, which can include dizziness, headaches, shaking and thirst, can affect anyone, and is not usually serious, providing the person cools down within 30 minutes./The more serious version is heatstroke, when the body's core temperature goes above 40.6 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit). It is a medical emergency and can lead to long-term organ damage and death. Symptoms include rapid breathing, confusion or seizures, and nausea./WHO IS AT RISK/Some people are more vulnerable, including young babies and older people, as well as people who have to stay active or are more exposed, such as homeless people./Existing conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as diabetes, can also heighten risk - and be exacerbated by heat./""When you see a hot day such as today, there is likely to be a spike in mortality in all of these disease groups,"" said Shakoor Hajat, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine./Globally, just under half a million deaths a year are estimated to be due to excess heat, according to a study last year in The Lancet, although data is lacking from many low-income countries. Far more die of cold, but that is forecast to change, the researchers said./LESS OBVIOUS RISKS/Air pollution also increases during heatwaves, the World Meteorological Association warned last week, with adverse health affects./Heat also can lead to low birth weight and premature birth for pregnant women and babies, a number of studies have shown./There are less obvious risks, too. Lawrence Wainwright, an environment lecturer at the University of Oxford, said suicide rates and mental health problems often arise during heatwaves./Scientists said that there was no evidence yet of any impact on COVID-19 or long COVID patients./TIMING MATTERS/Experts say more deaths occur earlier in the summer, when people's bodies have not had chance to acclimatize./Location matters, too; people are at higher risk in places where they are not used to such heat, including in parts of Europe./However, there are limits, and people all around the world are at risk in extremely hot weather caused by climate change, particularly people who have to continue to work in physical jobs, for example./""In all of the places I've seen in the world that we have data, there's an increase in mortality risk when people are exposed to high temperatures,"" said Eunice Lo, a climate scientist at the University of Bristol, in western England./WHAT YOU CAN DO/A number of European public health agencies have issued advice on keeping cool, including avoiding exertion where possible and staying hydrated./Heatstroke is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention./They also advise checking in on the vulnerable. In the European heatwave in 2003, when more than 20,000 people are thought to have died, many of them were older and isolated./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Unhealthy air-induced diseases raise crowds in Dhaka hospitals,"Dhaka, Aug. 19 -- Hospitals in Dhaka nowadays have to cope with pressure of an increasing number of patients with respiratory diseases mainly caused by the unhealthy air of the city, say chest disease specialists and air experts./Air index shows Dhaka air remains a little better in May-September, but it is of a moderate category still. The rest of the time, it remains very unhealthy to dangerous./During this period, the hospitals receive an increased number of patients with a high death rate./Major hospitals in Dhaka -- National Institute of Diseases of the Chest and Hospital, 250-bed TB Hospital, Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, Mitford Hospital - mostly handle an overwhelming pressure of such patients, say physicians./Ahsan Habib, a resident of Badda in Dhaka, caught an uninterrupted high fever last month, with a body temperature of 103-104 Fahrenheit (F) and chest pain, which lasted for a week. He was taken to private hospital in Uttar Badda./He needed a two-week bed rest for primary recovery as he developed lung infection./""I maintained a healthy routine and did not smoke, and in spite of my healthy lifestyle, Dhaka's air pollution almost ruined my sound health. The doctor I consulted suggested using a face mask outside as unhealthy air dominates Dhaka,"" he told the FE./A study published recently in Science Advances found that there were 24,000 premature deaths in Dhaka between 2005 and 2018 due to air pollution./The World Health Organisation (WHO) says about 240,000 people die globally in a year due to air pollution and most of them die from lung cancer./Dr Sadia Sultana Reshma, a chest specialist, said over 60,000 such patients came to the hospitals in the last one year while asthma exacerbation and ILD patients were prevalent among them./""Many new patients are getting post-Covid lung problems. In the past one year, people have been exposed to air pollution as one of the major reasons for the increase in diseases,"" she, also an air health activist, added./Besides, garment industries and waste from factories spread toxic pollution widely with deadly diseases, say health experts./""Among the new diseases, the incidence of occupational lung disease has increased significantly. Interstitial lung disease among construction workers is on the rise,"" Dr Reshma warned, saying, ""We are getting an increased number of patients from outside Dhaka especially from Narsingdi district, who work in textile factories.""/A growing tendency of byssinosis caused by inhaling cotton dusts, flax or hemp particles has also been seen among workers of the textile factories./""Air pollution from chemical dyes is also on the rise like byssinosis. Chemical dyes cause lung cancer, ILD,"" chest specialist Reshma added./The air pollution level in Dhaka is more than eight times the WHO limit and reduces life expectancy by nearly 7 years in Bangladesh, says another study of the University of Chicago./Lung cancer rates reportedly rose 200 per cent in the country in just three years, according to the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital./Prof Abdus Salam, teacher at the Department of Chemistry, University of Dhaka, told the FE that Bangladesh and its capital Dhaka remained on the top in terms of air pollution in the world for successive years./""Contaminated air contains particles in the air. When we inhale or breathe polluted Dhaka air, these atomic or microscopic particles enter the lung, block the lung holes slowly and finally cause serious lung disease,"" the expert said./He added, ""The numbers of lung diseases or diseases caused by contaminated air are higher than the recorded numbers in hospitals. The hospitals don't keep records of such diseases while others don't share them with us.""/Surface dust and sand and emission of smokes from vehicles and brick kilns are blamed for 85 per cent of Dhaka's air pollution./Data shows that the remaining 15 per cent is made up of lead, biomass burning and sea salt, according to a study published in 'Current Journal of Applied Science and Technology' journal./Ziaul Haque, Dhaka division director at the Department of Environment, told the FE that the government passed the Air Pollution Control Rules-2022 following approval of the Ministry of Law, which will help curb air pollution and improve the enforcement./""We hardly issue clearance certificate to build a new brick kiln while legal drives continue against the old and expired brick kilns,"" the official added./""We alone cannot curb the violators of air pollution in the city,"" he added, emphasising a joint move by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority and Dhaka Metropolitan police for better enforcement of rules./He hoped that air pollution would reduce significantly after the completion of the metro rail project and other mega or major development projects in Dhaka./Experts disagreed with the official version./""Bangladesh doesn't care about ensuring environmental protection during development works. We don't find such development work-induced air pollution in other developed countries,"" said Prof Salam, suggesting engaging local architects and builders to adopt environment-friendly infrastructure and design./<a href=""mailto:nsrafsanju@gmail.com"">nsrafsanju@gmail.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.
