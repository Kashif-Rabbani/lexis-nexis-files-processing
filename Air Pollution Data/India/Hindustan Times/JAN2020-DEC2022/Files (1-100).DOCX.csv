Delhi's first fully automated car park tower unveiled in Green Park,"India, Jan. 2 -- The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Thursday inaugurated the city's first ""fully-automated"" car-parking tower facility at Green Park. According to officials, each tower at the facility can accommodate at least 34 cars./The facility was inaugurated by Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri. ""This is the most feasible new-age system to deal with the ever-increasing demand for car parking in south Delhi. This sort of vertical parking is most appropriate for congested markets and populated colonies as it requires just 1.50 square metre space to park a car, in comparison to 30 square metre required in conventional parking.""/""The municipal corporations must come up with effective parking area management plans to deal with parking problems in their jurisdiction. I am confident that the tower parking will help contain air pollution in the area as well,"" he said./SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said tower parking is another initiative to develop useful projects over limited-sized plots. ""This facility is spread over an area of merely 217 square metres and the two towers were completed in a record time of 10 months. The facility has four towers - each of 39.50 metres height with 17 levels to accommodate 34 cars. This parking being vertical and steel structured will present a swanky look,"" he said./The operation and maintenance cost and requirement of manual labour will be much lower than conventional parking facilities, he added. ""The retrieval time of vehicles will be just three minutes, in comparison to 15 minutes in conventional parking facilities. There is going to be no pollution and no fuel consumption in the automated tower parking whereas pollution in the conventional parkings lingers on due to smoke discharge of car movement through ramps and fuel consumption./A senior official of the SDMC said that due to anti-pollution measures in force in the Capital, two of the total of four towers in the facility could not be constructed. However, the corp plans to get them finished soon, and open then tentatively by March. As of now, two towers have been inaugurated./Mayor Sunita Kangra, the local MP Meenakshi Lekhi, MP Manoj Tiwari and Leader of House Kamaljeet Sehrawat were also present at the inauguration./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'City's air in winter nine times more polluted than monsoon',"Mumbai, Jan. 9 -- The weekly averages of PM2.5 levels in the city during the winter months of November and December 2019 was nearly nine times the weekly average concentration witnessed during monsoon months (June to September 2019). These were among the findings of a study by city-based air quality monitoring group UrbanSciences and Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-K), with assistance from Delhi-based Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation./The study analysed the Centre's air quality monitoring data for 2019, for Mumbai, Lucknow, Raipur, Jaipur and Ahmedabad. In Mumbai, against the average PM2.5 concentration ranging around 100 microgrammes per cubic metre (ug/m3) in the monsoon, peak levels increased to 585 ug/m3 during the third week of November and 922 ug/m3 in the last week of December. The study also found PM2.5 levels in the city are around 30% higher at 8am (70 ug/m3) while at 2pm, they are at 50 ug/m3, which is below the daily safe standard of 60 ug/m3./Average PM2.5 concentrations across 10 monitoring stations in Mumbai showed Sion to be the most polluted location over six months (31.5 ug/m3), followed by Kurla (29.6 ug/m3), the area around the international airport in Santacruz (28.8 ug/m3), Colaba (27.2 ug/m3) and Vile Parle (26 ug/m3). The least polluted area was Borivli (17.1 ug/m3)./While Mumbai had the lowest pollution levels of the five cities, the researchers said the data may not be representative of the city's actual air quality. ""We assessed official data for the city [Mumbai], which will be submitted in the form of an aggregate for 2019 under the Centre's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). The results show the air quality situation was 'good' for Mumbai in 2019, but the reality is different. Air quality of different hotspots in the city is not getting captured in this data,"" said Ronak Sutaria, founder and director, UrbanSciences./A scientist associated with the study, on condition of anonymity said, ""Mumbai needs nearly 90 to 100 air quality monitors to get spatially accurate data of air pollution hotspots combined with biennial measurement-based source apportionment studies to track emissions.""/The most polluted days during the winter period saw PM 2.5 concentration ranging between 58 and 108 ug/m3, with the average peak PM2.5 level of 92 ug/m3. In contrast, average peak levels were at 25 ug/m3 during the monsoon months when PM 2.5 concentration ranged between 15 ug/m3 to 40 ug/m3. ""This shows that the last two weeks of November and through December, air pollution was significantly unhealthy for people with sensitive breathing conditions,"" said Sutaria./City doctors confirmed this finding. ""I have personally recorded a 40% rise in patients diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, lung fibrosis etc. Owing to exposure to poor air quality during winter months in the early hours of the day, children are at twice the risk than adults to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis; hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asthma,"" said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist, Lilavati Hospital./On the high levels of PM 2.5 concentration at 8am, the city's School Bus Owners' Association (SBOA) confirmed 7am to 9am to be peak travel times. ""Apart from 6,000 buses, 16,000 of the 20,000 vehicles that take children to school are illegal and are diesel or petrol-based. Despite court orders to phase out these vehicles, there has been no action, putting the lives of children at risk,"" said Anil Garg, president, SBOA./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Exacerbation of asthma, COPD, dermatitis among frequently reported pollution-related symptoms: Health dept","Gurugram, Jan. 11 -- Exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dermatitis, and dry eyes or allergic conjunctivitis are the most frequently reported air pollution-related cases at the district's government hospital, as per data collected by the health department over the last two months./According to officials, around 10 cases of each category of symptoms related to air pollution were reported daily at the Sector 10 Civil Hospital's outpatient department (OPD) in November and December, when pollution levels rose due to stubble burning and meteorological reasons. The number in the second week of January has come down to around four each, officials said./The Civil Hospital sees around 1,000 patients in its OPD daily, as per records./The district health department has been reporting air pollution-related cases at the government hospital to the state health department since November 4, following a direction from the latter in late October. Other cases identified as air pollution-related include acute bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, and rhinosinusitis (inflammation of sinuses and nasal cavity)./District health department officials said that the data of such cases between November and February will be collated to find the impact of pollution on the health of residents./""The types of cases reported were specified by the state health department earlier, and are symptoms and diseases closely linked to air pollution,"" Dr Ram Prakash Rai, district epidemiologist, said, adding that the purpose of collecting the data was to identify the rise in health problems in the district due to pollution and find solutions./Studies have shown that air pollution is a major cause of death and disease around the world. Bad air quality is linked to heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children, experts said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Experts discuss health impact of air pollution,"New Delhi, Jan. 15 -- A group of public health experts and air pollution researchers has begun a collaboration to discuss the health impacts of air pollution, including premature mortality, and options before individuals to address this./In a roundtable organised at the University of Mexico's Health Science Center and Extension of Community Health Outcome (ECHO), India, a medical education and care management collaboration, on Tuesday, public health experts said action can be driven when people understand the real health impact of air pollution./""There is no doubt about the health impacts of air quality. Morbidity and mortality figures can be disputed. But there is a spurt of cases in emergencies on poor air days. Even if we don't have long term India-specific studies, retrospective data analysis like comparing the disease incidence data on a polluted area with non-polluted area helps establish long term health impacts,"" said Dr MK Daga, director professor of medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and member secretary, Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health./In Lok Sabha last June, union environment minister Prakash Javadekar had said there was no conclusive data to establish a direct correlation of death/disease exclusively to air pollution./ECHO has asked experts who attended the roundtable that included VK Shukla, head of CPCB's air quality management division; Dr Daga; MP George, head of air quality lab at Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Dr Ravinder Singh from Indian Council for Medical Research; experts from National Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Foundation of India; World Health Organisation among others to join consultations to be organised by ECHO virtually once a week for the next six months to begin with./Following these consultations, the team will arrive at a health communication strategy which can make a difference to air pollution levels in Delhi. ""ECHO's goal will be to reduce air pollution with the purpose of improving health. We don't want to focus on what the government has done or can do. This is to see what stakeholders could do themselves,"" said Dr Sanjeev Arora, Director, ECHO Institute./Shukla said annual PM 2.5 concentration in 2019 was 109 micrograms per cubic metres, more than double the annual national safe standard of 40 micrograms per cubic metres. ""PM 10 levels met the standard on 121 days in 2019 and air quality was in good, moderate or satisfactory on 182 days. Still on 50% of the days air pollution is very high in Delhi which needs to be addressed,"" he said./KK Agarwal, President Heart Care Foundation of India said as former Indian Medical Association President he had found that there was no consensus among health specialists to communicate that air pollution is harmful. This was mainly because if heart or respiratory diseases are linked to air pollution then it would be termed a natural disaster and health insurance will not cover them. Experts gave ideas like targeting indoor air pollution, planting tree species which are efficient absorbers of pollution particles, ending waste and biomass burning, using the environment ministry's Sameer app to collate pollution sources etc./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Spike in viral infection, allergy cases, says BMC","Mumbai, Jan. 21 -- Sharp fluctuations in day and night temperatures over the past few days caused a spike in viral infections and allergy in the city. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)'s health department said around 30% more viral infection cases and 50% more cases of allergy were reported over the past fortnight./""When there is a sudden change in temperature, the finer viruses and bacteria enter the smaller airways of lungs. As these are foreign antigens [that the body didn't produce], they lead to irritation in the lungs. People with poor immunity develop infections,"" said Dr Om Shrivastava, an infectious diseases specialist at a city hospital./After dropping to 11.4 degrees Celsius last Friday, the minimum temperature rose to 19 on Monday night. The maximum temperature rose to 32.9 degrees Celsius and 31 degrees Celsius in Santacruz and Colaba respectively, on January 19 (Sunday). On Tuesday, maximum temperatures dropped to 30.3 degrees Celsius and 29 degrees Celsius in Santacruz and Colaba respectively./Air pollution levels have also spiked in the city. ""Every day I examine at least 200-350 patients suffering from breathing disorders on account of the haze. Patients with asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) are finding it difficult to breathe,"" said Dr Wiqar Shaikh, head of internal medicine, Sir JJ Hospital./More allergens in the air, along with smog and pollutants, may predispose children to viral and bacterial infections./""An alarming increase in air pollution attacks the respiratory system. Moreover, higher levels of carbon monoxide directly hit the cardiovascular system and the entire respiratory tract, particularly among children,"" said Dr Nikanth Awad of BYL Nair Hospital./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Diseases, allergies stalk residents of India's most polluted city","India, Jan. 27 -- Arshad Jamal, 48, has been battling a skin disease for four years in addition to asthma. Doctors have advised him to remain indoors, drink clean water and avoid dust pollution to avoid aggravation of his health issues . There is, however, little he can do to heed the advice for Jharkhand's Jharia, Jamal's home for 35 years, continues to be among the country's most polluted cities. According to Greenpeace India's Airpocalypse-IV annual report released last week, Jharia was India's most polluted city in 2018./""I sell clothes on a footpath... to feed my five-member family. If I do not work, what would my family eat?"" asked Jamal. He added the doctors have blamed pollution in Jharia for his woes. ""Life is no less then hell for us here,"" said Jamal, who visits a doctor almost weekly/Jamal is not alone. Many like him in the city of half-a-million known worldwide for its underground coal fires suffer from pollution-induced diseases. Shatia Bhuniya, 50, a local resident who suffers from regular chest pain, said she can feel coal dust and ash inside her body. Babita Devi, a housewife, said they cannot even dry their clothes in the open because of layers of dust that stick to them/In neighbouring Dhanbad that was second on the list of most-polluted cities in 2018 as per the report, Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH)'s Dr Bibhuti Nath Mittal said most patients from Jharia they treat suffer from pollution-related diseases. ""... [They] complain of skin allergies, burning sensation in eyes and allergic bronchitis. Pollution plays a significant role in aggravating such diseases,"" said Mittal./Mittal said Jharia's air has high levels of nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide, which can further aggravate breathing ailments, emitted by diesel trucks that move around the city daily carrying coal./Jharia is the hub of coal mining in Jharkhand and has 40 opencast mines, which are mostly affected by underground fires, according to government officials. Over 2,500 trucks ferry coal out of the region daily./Kolkata-based organisation Science for Human Being's March 2017 survey found 17% of Jharia residents face hair loss, 17% suffer from skin diseases and 13% from respiratory issues due to pollution./Another study by South Korean Future Science Research Institute in October 2019 found a link between high particulate matter (PM) and baldness. It said the PM and dust reduce protein levels in the scalp and lead to hair loss. To be sure, experts say there can be other reasons for hair loss in addition to air pollution./Coal is the biggest contributor to high air pollution in Jharia, which according to the Greenpeace study, was 50% more than the average annual pollution levels in Delhi in 2018. The Greenpeace report said Jharia recorded highest PM10 at 322 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) in the country in 2018. It was more than five times the normal limit of the 60 ug/m3./A study by Dhanbad's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR) in 2018 found opencast mining, underground coal fires and unscientific coal transportation were the major contributors to Jharia's toxic air. It said the city's air quality can improve by 50% if the mining is restricted. The study added high PM and emission of toxic gases like nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide were directly linked to the coal burning./The CIMFR study's main author, Raj Sekhar Singh, said PM can reach deep into lungs and lead to diseases like asthma and tuberculosis. He added the diseases were badly impacting human health in Jharia. Jha said nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide were adding to more woos./Rashtriya Colliery Mazdoor Sangh general secretary A K Jha said 60,000 to 1 lakh tonne coal is extracted daily from Jharia coalfields. He said there are 58 small and big opencast mines operating in the area and almost all opencast mines are fire affected./Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), the biggest mines' operator in the region, officials insist they have taken various measures to check pollution in Jharia./Sumit Jha, a BCCL official, said most of the mines affected by fires are very old. ""The underground fires can be checked only through opencast mining. If fire-affected coal blocks are not extracted at the earliest, they will also damage the entire city,"" Jha said./He said they have made it mandatory for trucks to cover the coal being transported out of the region. ""We are also constructing concrete small ponds at exit points of mines so that tyres of the coal loading vehicles could be washed. Water is also sprinkled on roads in morning and afternoon to check dust pollution,"" he said. Sumit Jha added greenery was also being promoted./Activist Pinaki Roy of Save Jharia campaign said the steps being taken were inadequate. ""Opening cast mining has reached the city's boundaries. The height of the coal dumps is much higher than permitted. Even slight wind brings ashes and dust from the mining areas to the city,"" he said./Mohammed Shabir, a local resident, said environmental safeguards were not good enough. ""Heavy vehicles enter the city without proper coverings and are laden with coal dust,"" he said./Congress leader Poornima Singh, who is a lawmaker from the region, blamed the previous Bharatiya Janata Party government and BCCL for making Jharia a non-livable place./""The BCCL has outsourced opencast mines to private companies, which do not follow rules and regulations. A small example is of the coal dumps. Rules say the height of a dump should be between 35-50 metres. However, the minimum height of such dumps in Jharia is 90 metres and a maximum 150 metres, which adds to the pollution problem,"" she said. Singh promised more funds to tackle the pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Sunderbans saving Kolkata from smoke of shifting cultivation in Eastern Ghats, suffering in turn","India, Feb. 5 -- Just like smoke from stubble burning regions of Punjab and Haryana spikes air pollution in Delhi every year during the winter, fumes from shifting cultivation in some states along the Eastern Ghats could have deteriorated the air quality in Kolkata, had it not been for the Sunderbans, scientists have recently found./The new study by researchers from Bose Institute in Kolkata has revealed that the world's largest mangrove delta in south Bengal acts like a green barrier against the smoke coming from further down south and stops it from reaching Kolkata./""Biomass burning during slash and burn agriculture emits huge amount of pollution. Trajectory analysis shows that these pollution plumes, laden with vapours of sulphuric and nitric acid, ultimately reach the Sunderbans. The sea-salt particles and other biogenic particles in the air consume a large amount of these polluting gases. This saves Kolkata,"" said Abhijit Chatterjee, associate professor of environmental sciences at Bose Institute, who led the study./The study has been published in Chemosphere, an international peer-reviewed journal of Elsevier, in December 2019./The Sunderbans covers more than 10,000 sq km across India and Bangladesh, of which 40% is in India. It's thick and nearly impenetrable mangrove is home to many rare and globally threatened wildlife species such as the Royal Bengal Tiger./Slash and burn agriculture, which is a form of shifting cultivation, is practised in tribal areas of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, parts of Karnataka, Telengana and Tamil Nadu. It involves clearing the jungle on the hill slopes, burning the trees and growing crops on the ashes./The scientists have warned that the toxic particles are reacting with sea salt particles present in the air and changing the latter's properties. As these sea-salt particles help in the formation of rain clouds, change in their physical and chemical properties can have a negative impact on rainfall levels in the area./""The air in the Sunderbans region is laden with salt, as it is located near the sea. The sea-salt particles help in the formation of rain clouds. But when these react with the fumes of sulphuric acid, nitric acid and other toxic elements brought by the southerly winds their physical and chemical properties are altered. The particles lose their potential to form clouds. This finally affects precipitation levels,"" said Abhinandan Ghosh, another researcher in the team./Sea-salts are primarily made of chloride particles. The average chloride depletion in PM10 (particulate matter of less than 10 microns in size) ranged between 70 and 74% over the Sundarbans, the researchers have found./The study says that since biomass burning over Eastern Ghats occurs just before the monsoon, this phenomenon bears significant importance. Scientists have warned that the delta is already facing scarcity of fresh water due to several factors such as depletion of ground water levels, intrusion of saline water from the sea and drying of some rivers due to siltation in the upper reaches./""Because of lack of sweet water not only the population of Sundari trees, the species from which the Sunderbans derive its name, is depleting but the growth of such trees is also getting stunted. Paddy farming and culture of giant fresh water prawns are also getting affected. Instead, culture of brackish water fishes such as Parshe, Bhetki and tiger prawn is increasing,"" said Abhijit Mitra, former head of marine science department of Calcutta University./The Sunderbans is often tagged as the savior of Kolkata as it had earlier saved the metropolitan city with a population of more than 4.5 million from the fury of cyclones such as Aila in May 2009 and Bulbul in November 2019 by acting as a barrier against strong winds./Some of the fumes from these shifting cultivation areas however do manage to pass the mangrove cover and reach Kolkata and Darjeeling in north Bengal, the trajectory analysis has revealed./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'No country adequately protecting children's health and future',"New Delhi, Feb. 20 -- Predatory marketing of junk food, sugary beverages, alcohol and tobacco products preys on children and must be regulated, said A Future for the World's Children report by a commission of 40 global child and adolescent health experts by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and The Lancet./No single country is adequately protecting children's health, their environment and their futures. Among 180 countries surveyed, India ranks 131, mainly because of high infant mortality and poor child health. The ranking is based on the ability of a child to survive and thrive, and includes performances on health, education, and nutrition; sustainability, with a proxy for greenhouse gas emissions, and equity, or income gaps, among others./""Evidence suggests that children in some countries see as many as 30,000 advertisements on television alone in a single year, while youth exposure to vaping (e-cigarettes) advertisements increased by more than 250% in the USA over two years, reaching more than 24 million young people,"" the report reads./Anthony Costello, one of the commission's authors, says that industry self-regulation had failed. ""Studies in Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the USA - among many others - have shown that self-regulation has not hampered commercial ability to advertise to children. For example, despite industry signing up to self-regulation in Australia, children and adolescent viewers were still exposed to 51 million alcohol ads during just one year of televised football, cricket and rugby. And the reality could be much worse still: we have few facts and figures about the huge expansion of social media advertising and algorithms aimed at our children,"" said Costello in a statement./Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor, psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, said, ""It does play a role in enticing children the way an ad is designed. All ads meant to target children use attractive props, cartoon characters, bright colours that entice young and impressionable minds. These are quite detrimental for children.""/Children's exposure to commercial marketing of junk food and sugary beverages is associated with eating unhealthy foods, which leads to them being overweight and obese. According to the report, the number of obese children and adolescents increased from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016, an 11-fold increase. The report said excessive carbon emissions - disproportionately from wealthier countries - threaten the future of all children. If global warming exceeds 4C by the year 2100 in line with current projections, this would lead to devastating health consequences for children due to rising ocean levels, heatwaves, proliferation of diseases like malaria and dengue, and malnutrition./India has performed well on most environmental metrics and on the way to beating its 2030 emissions targets, on track to come in 32% under target - producing 1.84 CO2 tonnes per capita - versus the highest world emitters producing more than 20 tonnes per capita, says the report./""One of the key concerns for me as an author of this commission is that we need to look at the issue of climate change from children's point of view. How environment degradation, such as air pollution, unclean water, etc, is impacting lives of children. It's going to jeopardise the life of all children across the world,"" said Sunita Narain, director general of New Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment./""It's good to have sustainable development goals (SDGs) but so far these are just numbers; we need to give SDGs a human face, and that face is of a child irrespective of whether the child is white or black, or rich or poor. The purpose of ranking countries on the basis of per capita CO2 emissions is to build principles of equity,"" she added./The child survival index shows that children in Norway, the Republic of Korea, and the Netherlands have the best chance at survival and well-being, while children in Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, Niger and Mali face the worst odds. India (131st), Pakistan (140th) and Bangladesh (143rd) fall within the bottom 50 countries worldwide when it comes to managing child health in the early years./However, when authors consider per capita CO2 emissions, the top countries trail behind: Norway ranked 156, the Republic of Korea 166, and the Netherlands 160. Each of the three emits 210% more CO2 per capita than their 2030 target. The US, Australia, and Saudi Arabia are among the 10 worst emitters./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Stuck between planes and trains,"New Delhi, Feb. 23 -- Vipin Lamba looks pretty dismayed as he refers to his village, Shahabad Mohammadpur, in southwest Delhi, as a ""unique transport hub""./""You can see and hear planes take off and land in our vicinity all the time, a Metro passes underground, and trains rattle through our village throughout the day,"" he says. ""But these modes of transport have only been a source of trouble.""/Lamba is on the roof of a house in Shahabad Mohammadpur village. From here one gets a panoramic view of the Terminal-3 (T-3) of the Indira Gandhi International Airport, or IGIA, one of the biggest and busiest airports in the world. T-3 is the largest single terminal in India and the fifth-largest in the world, according to the Delhi airport website. Separated by a barbed wall, the airport taxiway is just a few hundred meters away from the village./""We are exposed to dangerous levels of air and noise pollution,"" says Lamba, loudly as he tries to be heard over the sound of an aircraft. Even as we talk, a train passes through the village, its engine blaring a deafening horn./Shahabad Mohammadpur, an urban village of about 30,000 residents near Dwarka, about 25 km from Connaught Place, has a railway station of its own, a bus terminal, is surrounded on three side by the barbed airport wall, and a Delhi Metro line runs underground-but locals say all of this, instead of easing their travel, has added to their daily travails./""Our village is a polluted open prison, with the main entrance, a railway crossing, remaining closed for considerable time, causing massive jams,"" says Pradeep Lamba, another resident./""In the 1960s, when we first gave land for the development of the airport, we thought it would prove to be a boon for the village. But, as the airport expanded over the years, we just became a walled village without any economic opportunities,"" says Rameshwar Dayal, 79, a resident./Shahabad Mohammadpur is one of the many villages whose land was acquired for the building and expanding the airport./For the uninitiated, Delhi's first airport - the Safdarjung airport, was built in the late 1920s, and remained the city's main airport till 1962, when operation shifted to the newly built Terminal-1 (T-1) of the Palam airport, originally an Indian Air Force (IAF) base. In 1986, a new international terminal (Terminal-2) was built and the airport was renamed as IGIA./""But our problems started when T-3 was operationalised a decade back, with aeroplanes taxing to and from the new terminal. We smell burnt jet fuel throughout the day,"" says Satyendra Solanki, a resident. The Delhi International Airport Limited, which operates the airport, did not respond to HT's email queries on the issue till the time of going to the press./""You cannot walk anywhere in the village without sniffing the pungent odour of the fumes from the jet engines. People living in houses along the airport wall people find it hard to sleep. The trouble comes not just from the skies, but also from underground (where the Metro's Airport Experess Line runs),"" says Solanki./In 2012, many residents had first complained of ""tremors"". About 70 houses had developed cracks, which the residents attributed to the Metro trains running underground. ""Those days it was like low intensity quakes, and it was hard to sleep. But things improved with the Metro reducing the train speeds on the route. But there are portions in our house that still develop cracks over a period of time,"" says Solanki. ""Even now at times, I can feel the rumbling noise when the Metro passes beneath my house; it is a pretty weird feeling.""/Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson Anuj Dayal says that whenever they receive such complaint, they examine and take necessary mitigation measures to reduce the vibrations and noise by installing special elastomeric pads, noise barriers, wheel grinding of trains, as needed.""At Shahbad Mohammadpur also, DMRC took the issue seriously. Necessary mitigation measures such as wheel profiling and track grinding were conducted to solve the problem,"" he says./Shahbad Mohammadpur is among the few villages in Delhi to have a railway station. It has been in service since 1971. About 80 trains pass through the station through the day, with about 11 passenger trains halting at the station.""On an average three trains per hour, both passenger and goods, pass through the station,"" says Karan Singh, a ticket supervisor at the station./Over the years, as the rush to the station increased, especially of people coming from Dwarka and the airport, the traffic at the railway crossing got heavier, disrupting life in the village./""School buses do not come to the village from Dwarka because of the never-ending jams. There have been instances of sick people dying as they waited to cross the tracks to Dwarka. There is an urgent need for an underpass or an overbridge at the level crossing,""says Praveen Lamba, a local./The residents got a scare in 2015 when a Ranchi-bound small BSF plane crashed soon after take-off a few hundred meters from the village, bursting into flames. All 10 people on board were killed. '""The the incident only added to our many fears of living near the airport,"" says Rajesh Lamba, a property dealer in the village./Besides, he adds, being enclosed by the airport wall from three sides, and by a railway line on the fourth, has affected the employment opportunities in the village, with most residents depending on rental incomes. Unlike other villages close to the airport such as Mahipalpur, which has over the years become a hub of hotels, our Shahbad Mohammadpur failed to attract any economic activity, barring a few small cargo firms and taxi services started by locals./""It is because the access to the village is difficult, and people are wary of air pollution in a village so close to the airport,"" says Rajesh Lamba, a property dealer in the village./""In fact our cremation ground, bus terminal, and parks have been taken over by the airport as it expanded over the years. There is no sewerage system, and we all depend on septic tanks,"" says Praveen Lamba, adding, ""One might think an international airport in your vicinity can be a boon, but being so close to it has only brought us a litany of miseries."" One can see the bus shelters of the old bus terminal popping out of the new airport wall which was erected in 2018./Residents say there has been a rise in the incidence of brain stroke, cancer and skin diseases in the past decade - which they fear could be the result of the high levels of noise and air pollution in the village after T-3 became operational./""My 14-year-old son died of lung tumour last year. There have been several cancer deaths in the village; though we are not sure, we fear that our constant exposure to the air and noise pollution from the airport could be the reason behind this,"" says Parminder Gaur, a villager./Paras Tyagi, co-founder, Centre for Youth Culture, Law & Environment (CYCLE), an NGO, which is conducting social-economic surveys in several Delhi villages, says, ""The quality of life is very poor in the village. The government should conduct a study on the effects of the air and noise pollution on the residents and take mitigating measures. Besides, there is an urgent need to create employment opportunities in the village. The airport seems to have grounded all their dreams over the years.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Need multi-sectoral coordination to tackle health impacts of climate change in Maharashtra: Experts,"Pune, Feb. 24 -- Maharashtra has unique vulnerabilities while dealing with climate change given its geographical expanse and hence, it is important to discuss the health challenges the state faces due to climate change, said experts at a conference held at Bal Shikshan Mandir on February 22./""Climate change has been declared as the biggest public health challenge of the century and Maharashtra has unique vulnerabilities,"" said Dr Abhay Shukla, public health physician and senior programme coordinator at Support for Advocacy and Training to Health Initiatives (SATHI) Pune. All the panellists reiterated the importance of active participation of the community, which is crucial in shaping sustained and locally relevant responses to the challenge. They emphasized that health impacts of climate change are an ill-understood subject, and there is a need for comprehensive multi-sectoral and urgent approach./Shukla began the discussion along with Gufran Beig, meteorologist and scientist-G, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune and Dr Anand Bang, health advisor, Tata Trusts, who together made an attempt to grasp the complexity of this challenge for Maharashtra and the kind of responses it would need./Dr Anand Bang said, ""The agriculture losses due to climate change mean food insecurity and poverty, which are closely linked with malnutrition. Another dimension is mental health burden. Suicides of farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada is a glaring example of this. The climate change may revert back successes of controlling infectious diseases. Diseases like dengue and malaria, even cholera, are on rise.""/While talking about climate change predictions in Maharashtra, Beig elaborated on the diverse vulnerabilities within the state, given its geographical expanse. He also drew upon the close connection of climate change and air pollution, another important public health hazard./Climate change is likely to deepen the existing inequities in health outcomes. There are obvious inadequacies in the existing health systems. Talking of responses from the health sector, Dr Abhay Shukla said, ""We need more resources and capacity building to strengthen the primary healthcare component. The systems need to be flexible, responsive and resilient. It needs to adopt participatory approaches and have robust accountability mechanisms. The climate change crisis needs involvement of experts from multiple domains. Health sector can take a lead role in bringing out coordinated action. There is a lot to learn from states like Kerala and Tamilnadu.""/The conference was organised by Prayas Energy on the occasion of Girish Sant memorial annual event 2020./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi remains world's most polluted capital, says study","New Delhi, Feb. 25 -- Two-thirds of the world's most polluted cities are in India and Delhi has the worst air among all national capitals, according to a new study of air quality readings from 98 countries that also showed how China has made big improvements while India - which has been dealing with the problem at a similar scale - has hardly been able to tackle it/The assessment - published in the 2019 World Air Quality Report by IQAir AirVisual -- was based on average yearly levels of PM2.5 concentration. PM2.5 particles measure up to 2.5 microns in size and can enter the blood stream via the respiratory system to travel throughout the body, causing problems such as asthma, lung cancer and heart disease/The report noted that the of the world's top 30 most polluted cities during 2019, ""21 are located in India, 27 in South Asia, and all the top 30 cities are within greater Asia"". The numbers are a slight improvement over 2018, but the report adds that it is largely due to a slower economic growth./""Whilst cities in India, on average, exceed the WHO target for annual PM2.5 exposure by 500%, national air pollution decreased by 20% from 2018 to 2019, with 98% of cities experiencing improvements. These improvements are believed to be largely a result of economic slow-down,"" the report said./Indian officials, however, were sceptical of the connection. ""How are they saying the improvement is because of slowdown? We cannot comment on it unless we know what data they have analysed to arrive at this conclusion. Air pollution control action is being taken in 102 cities under NCAP (National Clean Air Programme),"" said a senior Central Pollution Control Board official, who asked not to be named. ""We will look into it. We are still analysing our data from 2019,"" this person added./Environmental experts said the reduction in the emissions must be looked at more closely. ""Economic slowdown is being attributed globally to emission reduction. It could be a factor but it's very difficult to say at the moment what could have led to the reduction in India. Whatever the reason be, let's not lose the reduction, let's be ambitious and reduce PM 2.5 concentrations and exposure further,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment/Several Chinese cities, including Beijing, have dramatically improved their air quality in recent years. Beijing, once synonymous with images of a metropolis shrouded in toxic smog, had an average PM2.5 concentration of 42.1ug/m3 - less than half of Delhi's 98.6ug/m3./In the rankings part of the report, Delhi was the fifth most polluted city while its suburb Ghaziabad occupied the first rank. One Chinese city and two from Pakistan were the others in the top five./India, China and other Asian countries remain disproportionately affected by toxic air as a result of factors ranging from crowded cities and vehicular exhaust fumes to coal-fired power plants, agricultural burning and industrial emissions./The World Health Organization estimates that dirty air kills around 7 million people each year, while the World Bank says it drains the global economy of $5 trillion annually. The deadly air also kills roughly 1.2 million Indians each year, according to a recent study in the Lancet./Across much of northern India, air quality remains catastrophic in the pre-winter and winter months when farmers take to burning crop residue as a cheap and quick way to clear their fields. The result is a toxic haze that has, in its worst episodes, caused schools to be shut down and vulnerable people to be restricted to living indoors./""In Beijing, it's a priority -- in China, when they say something, they do it, they put the resources in,"" said Yann Boquillod, AirVisual's director of air quality monitoring, news agency Bloomberg reported. ""In India, it's just starting. People need to put more pressure on government.""/India, however, was far from the only country that remained deeply challenged by smog. Although several Chinese cities -- including Shanghai -- saw improvement in air quality, Kashgar and Hotan in the restive, western Xinjiang region were among the world's worst./Cities across Asia -- including Chiang Mai, Hanoi, Jakarta and Seoul -- saw sharp increases in PM 2.5 levels./The problem is particularly challenging for South Asian countries. Using a weighted population average, Bangladesh was actually ranked the world's most polluted country, while its capital Dhaka was the second worst after Delhi./Pakistan was the second-most-polluted country, while Afghanistan, India and Nepal were all in the top 10./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"NCAP can't drive change unless data, reporting issues are fixed","India, Feb. 27 -- Two-thirds of the world's most polluted cities are in India, and Delhi has the worst air among all capitals, the 2019 World Air Quality Report by IQAir AirVisual, which takes readings from 98 countries, said on Tuesday. The study was based on average yearly levels of PM2.5 concentration. (PM2.5 particles measure up to 2.5 microns in size and can enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system to travel through the body, causing problems such as asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease.)/The road map for cleaning Delhi's air has been clear for some time. While the closure of power plants and big industry, natural gas transition across sectors, phase-out of old vehicles, reduction in truck numbers, BS-VI fuels and BS-IV standards, and more, has bent the curve, more disruptive action is needed for clean energy and technology transition, mobility transition and waste management to get the next big cut. There also needs to be a stronger awareness about the nature and direction of action to drive change more strategically and for effective impact./While the media focus on the non-flattering IQAir AirVisual report, which comes a year after the Centre rolled out the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), has been on the Delhi-National Capital Region area, this is also an opportune moment to look at how other cities faring on the NCAP, the ambitious five-year action plan with a tentative target of 20-30% reduction in concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in 102 non-attainment cities, by 2024, with 2017 as the base year. This is important because the IQAir AirVisual says India has 14 of the top 20 world's most polluted cities./While air quality monitoring has begun to expand under the NCAP to address the data deficit, without a methodical system for reporting, the data will remain unusable and cannot drive change in cities. For example, the CSE's Breathing Space, How to Track and Report Air Pollution under the National Clean Air Programme, says manual monitors require at least 104 days of monitoring, which is 28.5% of the days in a year. But the organisation's assessment of the latest available manual data for all cities shows that as much as 73% of monitoring stations do not meet this requirement. The cities are also expected to immediately begin reporting on their annual progress; but for that, they must know the methods and standard operating procedures for such reporting. No official method for compliance reporting by cities/states has been released. Along with tackling sources of air pollution, these issues need to redressed without further delay to ensure that cities are on the correct path for clean air./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Coding needed for innovation: Nadella,"India, March 4 -- ""Coding is like poetry, a compact expression that can be the most liberating. Everyone should learn coding irrespective of whether they are studying computer science, history or literature. It is a core skill and a malleable, changeable resource for the future,"" said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer, Microsoft, at the Young Innovators Summit in Delhi where he was in conversation with Anant Maheshwari, President, Microsoft India./Last two days in Mumbai and Bengaluru, Nadella talked business and technology with Indian industry, entrepreneurs and developers. In Delhi, Nadella spoke about the role that technology will play in transforming the education ecosystem over the next decade, outlining the opportunity students have to solve some of the world's most pressing problems./The showstopper at the event were the young kids who showcased their technology-powered innovative apps, built to address societal issues like health pollution and organ donation./Impressed with their presentation, Nadella said, ""I am inspired to go back to middle school. While earlier, my generation used to learn about technology, today the kids are using technology to learn and build. I am so impressed by their quality of ideas, the scope of ambition and most importantly, empathy towards the people and issues around them. That is how societies and cultures move forward and that is something we value at Microsoft.""/For instance, Ishlok Vashistha, a student at a school in the national capital, is fighting air pollution using artificial intelligence (AI). He has designed Caeli, a smart anti-pollution face mask and portable nebuliser to help those with breathing ailments like asthma and chronic respiratory diseases that are on the rise in Delhi, given its poor air quality./Another young student, Pratik Mohapatra, spoke about the organ donation app that he has built using machine learning algorithms./The app matches organ donors with recipients, providing real time updates to people in need of a transplant. A coding enthusiast, Mohapatra has been developing apps since he was 14 years old and is all set to join Microsoft as an employee later this year. Nadella emphasized on the balance between consumption and creation of technology. ""It is always an issue we have at Microsoft, whether you are a Power point first person or a Word first person, but both the story and the writing are important.""/He also spoke about games like Minecraft that have the ability to attract young middle school girls to STEM. Nadella was referring to 13-year-old Namya Joshi, who has been helping teachers of her school convert their class lessons into interactive Minecraft sessions. ""Minecraft is a great platform. If a child does not like reading books, for example, you can make them in Minecraft and get the child interested,"" the student from Ludhiana said matter-of-factly. Minecraft is like a pedagogical tool and can be used to learn coding, create lessons for others but the real currency is in striking the balance between consuming it like a game and using it to build and create something, added Nadella./The session concluded with a rapid fire round where Maheshwari threw some googlies at Nadella which he replied to very smartly. Nadella's favourite subject in school was history and if he had one superpower, then it would be to read all the books he had bought but not had the time to read./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Kids exposed to indoor pollution from burning of solid biomass fuel have lower IQ: Study,"India, March 8 -- Children who are exposed to indoor air pollution triggered by burning of solid biomass fuel such as cow-dung and wood may be suffering from lower Intelligence Quotient (IQ) levels, a new study has indicated./The study was conducted by a team of medical professors and doctors from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh. The team analyzed how household air pollution was taking a toll on children's cognitive function, particularly of those who were exposed to such household air pollution during the first three years of their lives at a stretch./""The IQ level of children, aged between six and eight years, who were exposed to household air pollution triggered by burning of solid biomass fuel was found to be significantly lower than those children who came from houses where LPG was used as a fuel,"" said PVM Lakshmi, professor of epidemiology, department of community medicine and school of public health at PGIMER and the corresponding author of the study./According to the 2011 census, more than 70% of the population in the country resides in rural areas with the widespread use of solid biomass fuel. At least 86% of the rural population use solid biomass fuel, particularly for cooking./""What adds to the risk is that the infants are almost always carried by their mothers or allowed to play around them when they cook. This practice exposes the child to harmful household air pollution, which can be detrimental to the development of the children,"" said Lakshmi./Data for the study was collected from 108 children, aged between six and eight years, from two village schools at Kheri and Samlehri in Haryana between July 2012 and June 2013. The researches visited their houses in the villages to find out the level of indoor pollution. All the children were tested for their IQ using Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC). The mean IQ was calculated as the average of Verbal and Performance score/""High levels of indoor and household air pollution have their own hazards no doubt. But as this is an epidemiological study, it is not convincing enough to come to a conclusion based on a small sample size. This is, however, an interesting indication,"" said TK Joshi, a member of the Central Pollution Control Board-led task force on air pollution./The researchers said that children from both kind of families - those using solid biomass fuel and families using LPG for cooking purposes - were selected for the study. The samples were taken from similar economic backgrounds and having similar dietary habits./""We found that at least 55% of the children had borderline or below average IQ levels. The mean IQ of children, who came from houses where LPG was used as fuel, was at least 5.5 points higher than the children who were exposed to indoor pollution triggered by solid biomass fuel,"" said Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor (environment health) at the department of community medicine and school of public health at PGIMER, who led the study./The findings of the study appeared in the March 2020 issue of Science of the Total Environment published by Elsevier./The union government in 2016 had started the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, popularly known as Ujjwala, to eliminate health hazards poor women face from indoor pollution by increasing their access to clean, smoke-free cooking fuel. The scheme aims to reach 80 million households until March 2020 with free LPG connections./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Holi in the time of coronavirus,"New Delhi, March 8 -- On Saturday, senior citizens of south Delhi's Malviya Nagar gathered at their recreation centre, some wearing masks, greeting each other only with polite Namaste, to attend a health awareness programme where two doctors spoke on the growing threat of the coronavirus./Originally, it was supposed to be a Holi Milan programme./""We thought that instead of cancelling the event, we should convert it into a coronavirus awareness programme to dispel rumours circulating on social media. Older people are more susceptible to the virus,"" says Ashok Prabhakar, 80, president of the area's senior citizens welfare association. ""All my life I have not seen a Holi so overshadowed by the fear of disease.""/This is perhaps the first time that the city is coming together to forego celebrations in the wake of a public health crisis. During Diwali, people still burst crackers despite warnings from scientists that doing so would increase the already peak air pollution levels in the city./The coronavirus threat has altered people's well laid-out plans: the otherwise boisterous festival of colours is now a strictly private fiesta, rather than a community gathering; made-in-India Holi toys are in demand, while the Chinese ones are out of favour; 'antiseptic' turmeric and flowers have replaced gulal (colour powder); and a safe Namaste is the greeting of choice rather than hugs and handshakes./The novel coronavirus, known to spread through people-to-people contact, has killed over 3,500 people globally since the outbreak was first reported from China's Wuhan on December 31, 2019. India has had 34 positive cases till date. There have, however, been no deaths reported in the country yet due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)./In the Capital, there have been three positive cases till date that has spooked Delhiites, forcing many to cancel celebrations. A majority of housing societies across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) have cancelled their annual Holi programmes./Sanskriti Apartments housing society in Dwarka, known for its colourful Holi party, cancelled its event. ""Dear residents, we have cancelled our Holi programme... If we remain healthy we can celebrate many such events together in the future, but we will not be able to forgive ourselves if something untoward happened,"" says the message sent by the RWA to the residents./""We had announced the programme more than two weeks ago and had made payments to all our vendors. All the residents concurred about the threat from the coronavirus and decided to call it off,"" says Deepak Sachdev, general secretary, RWA, Sanskriti Apartments./Similarly, Capetown, a housing society in Noida, which has about 4,000 flats, cancelled its Holi event. ""In view of the fear of coronavirus spreading, we have decided with a heavy heart to cancel our Rang Barse programme. We have no choice in this matter,"" said a communique sent to the residents of the society. ""We had already collected money for the program, but we are now returning it,"" says PK Puri, who is a member of the society's residents' welfare association (RWA)./""We have urged RWAs across the city to stop forwarding unverified corona-related messages; they are only creating unnecessary panic,"" says Atul Goyal, president of United RWAs joint action (Urja), the apex body of RWAs in the national capital/Not just apartments, many five-star hotels, farmhouses, have also called off their gala poolside Holi parties, which have in the past few years become a rage with rain dance, music, drinks and food. Among them is the Hyatt Regency in Gurugram, which had planned, what it called, Holi Part By The Pool, that had promised guests a 'war of DJs', Holi brunch, among others. ""We have cancelled it as a precautionary measure against Covid-19,"" said Vishal Singh, General Manager, Hyatt Regency. Even the Delhi government's tourism department has called off all its events at Dilli Haat at INA and Janakpuri./The coronavirus fear has also led to an unprecedented slump in the sale of Holi toys in Sadar Bazar in Delhi, the city wholesale market, which imports most of its goods from China. There were several messages doing the round on social media that merely touching products from China could lead to an infection, something that the World Health Organization has debunked./Hari Om, a water-gun vendor, says he has never before seen such demand for 'made in India' Holi products. Since morning, Hariom has been shouting at the top of his voice, ""Sari pichkari yahain India ki hain (All water-guns here are made in India)""./But Rakesh Arora, who has come from Ghaziabad wearing a mask, is not convinced as the pichakari Hari Om is trying to sell him does not have ""made in India"" written anywhere. Arora looks at the water-gun from a distance, careening his neck forward, his hands folded behind his back./""It is quite bizarre. Until last year, my customers would not want an Indian pichkari, but this Holi, people would not buy a pichkari at all rather than buy a Chinese one,"" says Hari Om. These days, Sadar Bazar presents quite a curious sight with vendors, their faces covered with masks, sitting in front of piles of playful props of holi-sprinklers and water-guns of various designs and sizes, magic balloons, colourful hats and masks./Anil Gupta, a prominent trader, says that 80 per cent of Holi toys in Sadar Bazar are from China, and that most traders are left with a large stock of unsold pichkaris, which had arrived in mid-December before coronavirus hit the headlines./""Holi is just a couple of days away, but 40 per cent of my pichkari stock remains unsold,"" says Gupta. Adds Vicky Gupta, one of the biggest importers of water guns from China: ""We import water-guns from Shantou (a coastal Chinese city). We go there because they provide us variety, quantity and quality,"" says Gupta. While Delhi has toy factories in places such as Inderlok, Bawana, Narela, and Noida that produce pichakaris, the traders say these factories cannot meet the demand./""Apart from water-guns, Holi is also one of the best seasons for toy sales. Most toys in the market are from China, and people are wary of buying them as they feel they could be infected with coronavirus,"" says soft toy dealer Rajender Sharma, general secretary of Federation of Sadar Bazar Trades Association./""In the current corona crisis, there is an opportunity for the country to promote 'made in India' products by providing incentives to local manufacturers,"" says Rakesh Kumar Yadav, the association's president./Vivek Gupta, a resident of Noida, says that since his RWA has decided to go ahead with Holi programme, he will go to his native place in Allahabad. ""I am virtually going into hiding. I have no other option. I am very social, and actively take part in community activities, but this Holi I want to avoid being part of a gathering no matter what,"" he says./But then there are others who plan to celebrate Holi with a close circle of family and friends-people whose travel history they know. And they also want to return to what they call 'traditional Holi'./""This year I am not going to use gulal that is available in the market. We will play Holi with chandan (sandalwood), haldi (turmeric), and kesu flowers. These things have antiseptic and antibacterial properties. They are natural and harmless,"" says Vidhi Hatwal, a resident of Mahagun Mywoods, a residential complex in Greater Noida West. ""Besides, I will play Holi songs, which is the best way to keep alive the Holi spirit.""/Ramesh Singh, a software engineer, who always carries a small bottle of hand-sanitiser these days to ward off threat from ""unavoidable headshakes"", says, ""Holi is a symbol of brotherhood, and I have always celebrated it with warm hugs. But this year Namaste will be my only form of greeting."" And he tell us that he took the decision well before Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu recommended it to his people.

Turn the coronavirus crisis into an opportunity,"India, March 11 -- The planet is in intensive care, and it has taken a possible pandemic to shake us out of our inertia. One of the world's biggest economies, China, came to a halt when the coronavirus was detected. To date, it has affected over 100,000 people in more than 100 countries. Incidentally, the disease was thought to have been transmitted to humans via bats and pangolins, although further research is still needed on its origins./But the virus is more than just a health crisis. It is symptomatic of all that we have unleashed on our planet in the name of development. As we course-correct to combat the coronavirus, even the short-term measures that have been put in place to contain the virus have helped improve the planet's condition. A recent report of Carbon Tracker, a London-based not-for-profit think tank researching the impact of the climate crisis on financial markets, said that China staved off a quarter or more of its Co2 emissions in two weeks by stopping work at manufacturing units and construction sites to quarantine its workers. These restrictions led to fewer numbers of vehicles on the road, and air travel dropped by 70%. The European Space Agency and NASA images showed a drop in pollutants like nitrogen oxide that lead to respiratory diseases, asthma and breathing problems./Another decision made by the Chinese authorities could have far-reaching implications for the planet. Since the coronavirus is believed to have originated from a wildlife food market, the authorities banned consumption of wildlife meat. A massive crackdown has been initiated on wildlife farms and breeding centres. This could help the conservation of a number of species, in particular the pangolin that has been on the verge of extinction. Pangolin meat is considered a delicacy, and their scales are used in traditional medicine. Experts, however, remain sceptical about whether the ban on wildlife trade will be permanent, and if the restrictions will apply to traditional Chinese medicine as well./Are these measures too little, too late? In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on 1.5degC had said that any warming of 1.5degC is not considered ""safe"" for most nations, communities, ecosystems and sectors, and poses significant risks to natural and human systems. The same report added: ""The principal vectors for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, and the zika virus - are projected to increase in number, with a larger geographic range by the 2030s than at present, which could put more individuals at risk of the diseases they carry, with regional differences."" And, prophetically, the report stated that incidents of zoonotic diseases will grow./It's taken a disease in a small province in China to bring the world to a halt. But if we continue to treat this as just a ""health crisis"", we are signing ourselves up for more pandemics. The Amazon fires and Australian bushfires are symptomatic of our inertia on climate. And, yet, a state of crisis could give us opportunities to heal the planet. The reduced emissions, even if temporary, means a far lesser number of people are exposed to air pollution, and serve as an example that significant policy shifts aimed at decarbonising our economies could help improve lives. Can we use the coronavirus epidemic as an opportunity to decarbonise our economy, and shake us out of our inertia to respond to the climate crisis? We can cut fossil fuel consumption and air travel, and ban wildlife trade to save ourselves from pandemics, and also help the planet to heal./Bahar Dutt is an award winning environment journalist and the author of Rewilding -India's experiments in saving nature./The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How coronavirus can affect India,"New Delhi, March 16 -- Even before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic, the world recognised the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) as a rapidly expanding global threat that raced across continents at startling speed. Perhaps, the WHO delayed the declaration to prevent panic from hindering the evolution of effective health system responses in countries which had never encountered this virus before. Now the whole world has to deal with it, in terms of health and economic impacts./India first recorded cases among Indians residing in Wuhan, where the virus emerged, followed by Italian tourists and others with international travel history or contact with infected foreign visitors. The initial response was to screen travellers from countries reporting cases and, as more countries joined that list, extending it to all international travellers. Case and contact tracing, with a 14-day quarantine, aimed to prevent spread within India. Entry to foreign visitors has now been shut for a month to keep out new sources of infection./Will this be enough to shackle the virus or will it become a community infection with widespread transmission within India? It is difficult to predict now, but wise to prepare for all scenarios. Irrespective of which scenario becomes the dominant reality, there is no reason to let panic undermine organised response. It must be noted that Covid-19 is somewhat more virulent than its common cold-causing cousin, but far less virulent than the ""bad boys"" of the corona group (SARS and MERS), with an overall mortality of around 2-3%. It hands out its visiting card liberally, but serves the warrant of severe illness mainly on the elderly, persons with pre-existing diseases and smokers. We are unsure at present of its seasonality./Scenario One: Containment measures will succeed, blocking new entrants harbouring the virus from entering the country till mid-April. This will enable our health systems to effectively deal with the in-country cases and contacts already detected, without fresh entrants expanding that list. By mid-April, we will better understand the course of the epidemic in other countries to define how immigration checks should be modified. Within-country transmission would have ceased by then./Scenario Two: Evidence of community spread would appear in some places. Cases and contacts will be vigorously traced, quarantined, triaged for severity of illness and treated at home (if mild) or hospital (if severe). Since Covid-19 causes severe infection in about 15% of the people infected, the numbers needing hospitalisation would not be high and existing health care facilities would be adequate. Weaker state health systems will need to be reinforced, to prevent community spillage that can spread across the country. Immigration checks will continue to be rigorous to keep out new sources, so that the health system doesn't need to deal with a thousand fires at once./Scenario 3: The propensity of Covid-19 to sneak in undetected during the asymptomatic incubation period, and speedily spread thereafter, may result in a widespread community infection. While this will strain the health systems, the relative mildness of Covid-19 means that the majority of infected persons will recover without residual harm, under home quarantine. Because of the higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, air pollution, and malnutrition in our population, severely-affected cases may be around 20% of those infected. These cases will need hospital care under isolation. Some will need intensive care with respiratory support. Resources will need to be directed to case identification, assessment of clinical severity with apportionment to home care for the mild cases and hospital care for the severe cases. Strong primary health services should be able to supervise and support home care, while all available public and private hospitals will need to be mobilised for hospital care. Non-emergency patient care and elective surgeries can be deferred to prioritise hospital care for the sicker Covid-19 patients. Even hotels can be taken over if more isolation facilities are needed. The challenge will be in mobilising enough public and private health care providers. Equipment, such as respirators, too should be made available./We do not know which of these scenarios will play out over the next three months. We should prepare for each, but alarmist predictions are unhelpful. Every health system in the world is being tested. We too will have to ramp up our health system efficiency to deal with this new threat. Strengthening of our health system, at all levels, cannot be a fleeting priority if we have to overcome this threat and avert or quell other health threats in the future./If Covid-19 teaches us the importance of strong and adequately resourced health systems, the value of preserving domestic capacity for producing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and essential drugs, and the imperative of backing away from the ecological despoliation that becomes the launch pad for zoonotic viruses, this frightening experience would have been worth it. Perhaps, if Covid-19 returns a year or two later, we will react with greater confidence and less alarm because more of us would be immune, there will be new drugs and possibly a vaccine, we will have better-prepared health systems and we will have a better estimate of how mild or virulent it is. Till then, let us deal with the new virus with situationally appropriate strategies and avoid self-defeating hysteria./Srinath Reddy is president, Public Health Foundation of India/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Undetected coronavirus cases may fuel spread with many trying to flee screening,"India, March 17 -- No community transmission of coronavirus disease has taken place so far in India, show the first 500 results of community tests done across the country, but with people continuing to evade screening and escape quarantine, the threat of undetected cases looms large./""These are chances of asymptomatic or mild cases being missed and depending on the contagiousness, numbers and exposure, it can lead to many new infections. This is why people who are diagnosed are isolated for at least two weeks till they test negative twice for the infection,"" said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research./For every confirmed case in China, there are five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections who have mild symptoms, according to a new analysis of data from China published in the journal Science./The study, which examines how contagious are people with mild or no symptoms, and whether they can cause undetected community infection, found 86% of infections in China had not been recorded before the January 23 lockdown./The mild, undetected cases were around half as contagious as confirmed cases. But the sheer number of mild cases made them the infection source of 79% of confirmed infections in China, found the modelling study of the virus's natural spread in China before the January lockdown./""These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of Sars-CoV-2 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging,"" said the study, which used mobility data, a dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference to estimate the prevalence and contagiousness of unreported cases to predict the pandemic potential of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19./Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference to update the probability for a hypothesis as more information becomes available./Covid-19 has a long incubation period of up to two weeks, which makes home quarantine essential for everyone who may have been exposed to infection. This is done to stop it from causing undetected infections during the asymptomatic period, which would result in widespread community outbreaks and strain the health system./""Most people recover under home quarantine, but with the higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, air pollution, and malnutrition in our population, severely affected cases may be around 20% of those infected. These cases will need hospital care under isolation, some will need intensive care with respiratory support,' said Dr Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India./In a worse-case scenario of widespread community transmission, mild cases will have to be treated at home and only severe cases will be hospitalised. ""Strong primary health services should be able to supervise and support home care, while all available public and private hospitals will need to be mobilised for hospital care,"" said Dr Reddy./The China study underscores the pandemic potential of Sars-CoV2, much like the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus also caused many mild cases, quickly spread globally, and eventually became an endemic seasonal flu that has been infecting and killing people since 2009-10./""Presently, there are four, endemic, coronavirus strains circulating in human populations (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43). If the novel coronavirus follows the pattern of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, it will also spread globally and become a fifth endemic coronavirus within the human population,' said the study./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Coronavirus: Millions of covid-19 tests needed, not going to end soon, says expert Dr Giridhar R Babu","India, March 18 -- Tracking a virus is like a detective work; it needs careful and planned monitoring, says Dr Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India. Instead of waiting for people to show up with symptoms, the household of an infected person and those in close contact with him or her should be tested immediately and isolated to contain the spread of the virus. That would mean testing thousands of people but in a planned manner. Now is also the time to prepare for critical care once community transmission is established, said Babu, who has worked on curbing polio transmission, measles surveillance and has studied parental milieu, air pollution and psychosocial environment during pregnancy and how they affect development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in childhood. Edited excerpts from an interview with Jayashree Nandi:/Q. Does India need more testing to identify community transmission?/A. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) is planning to do rapid tests with a few samples from each of their centres. If the fire is in one place and you are looking for damage in another place altogether, you will not find it. For maximum impact, we need to test people within the household where infection has been detected. There is a 15% chance that those in the household may be infected. People the infected person has spent considerable time with [close contacts] need to be tested. Testing allows you to identify and isolate more cases and stop transmission through effective contact tracing. Don't wait for symptoms to show up, just test./Q. Should testing parameters be revised from travellers and contacts to include people with symptoms?/A. This is also the flu season. Every person with a viral illness will want to get tested. There will be panic. To test every person with symptoms is definitely not the best strategy. When you want to trace an epidemic you have to work like a detective and follow the virus. In Bangalore, for example, there are seven cases, so we have to monitor 7,000 people including {those} who could be contacts of those seven. Symptoms alone can dictate the criteria for testing. Contact tracing is crucial because it's like a matrix./Q. Do you think the private sector should be involved in testing for Covid-19?/A. Yes, it should. But it should follow the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol and the tests should be validated by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. There shouldn't be any unverified random testing or people may also be exploited./Q. The government has been saying there are a limited number of test kits. If we have to track community transmission, how do we increase testing infrastructure in India?/A. The NIV is preparing its own rapid diagnostic tests. Right now, these tests are available from China and South Korea. We can validate those tests for India. The NIV can do it pretty fast. We are talking of millions of tests because this is not going to end now. We don't know the timeline./Q. Do we need to import anything to conduct these tests here?/A. There is a primer that is available with WHO. It can provide more of that primer. NIV has isolated 11 viruses. They can standardise their own kits. It's an administrative decision./Q. Once we start testing more don't you think our hospitals will be overburdened?/A. Of all the people infected, not everyone will require hospitalisation. Only about 15% will need hospital care and about 5% will need critical care. We need a strategy now on how we will deal with critical care. There is no point waiting./(Dr Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

COVID 19 Update:Delhi govt planning to shut some of its offices till March 31,"India, March 19 -- The spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) contagion is making the Delhi government work on a plan to shut some of its departments till March 31 to prevent a possible community spread of the deadly disease in the city, functionaries privy to the matter said on Thursday./Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to discuss this proposal with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal in a meeting scheduled at 4:15 pm at Raj Niwas. Coronavirus has infected 13 people in the city./""The proposal is to shut most of the departments till March 31. But, departments catering to essential services such as health, food and civil supplies, Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Fire Services and so on are likely to remain open,"" said a senior government official on condition of anonymity./A second official said that all procedures from the Delhi government's end have been completed. ""A green signal from the L-G is awaited which is one of the reasons why the chief minister will be meeting him today,"" the official said./Staggering office timings for some departments like it was done during the odd-even road rationing scheme when air pollution had peaked in the city is also being explored, the official added./The proposal comes after a delegation of the Delhi Government Employees' Welfare Association (DGEWA), met Kejriwal to demand a week's leave and submitted a memorandum stating that around 2.5 lakh people are employed with the city administration and most of them are engaged in public dealings, making them vulnerable to an infection./The association suggested that the government can completely shut 86 departments. These include art, culture and languages, tourism, development and education departments./It had also proposed that 68 government offices be allowed to function on alternate days, while registrar and MLO offices be closed because property registration and driving license can be issued later./In a tweet, Kejriwal on Thursday urged people to work from home. ""I have directed all schools, colleges and universities in Delhi to be shut down completely both for students and the staff until 31 March. All exams, including Board exams will happen only after 31 March. I urge all Delhiites to work from home as far as possible #DelhiFightsCorona,"" he said./Officials said the chief minister and the L-G have also explored the possibility of restricting passenger flow in public transport. ""But, it was also observed that Delhi being the national Capital putting curbs on public transport would be extremely difficult and could cause inconvenience to a number of people. All these are still being discussed,"" a third official said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"China, Italy among nations reporting drop in pollution","New Delhi, March 22 -- Satellite images and data released by the European Space Agency (ESA) show that the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter over parts of China plummeted as millions quarantined themselves to guard against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and the pollutants appeared to be returning as restrictions were being gradually eased amid slowing infections in the country./Scientific data also suggests that air pollution over Italy and other parts of the world fell as governments introduced large-scale lockdowns. NO2 primarily adds to air pollution because of the burning of fuel. '/ESA used data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite that shows the NO2 emissions from December 20, 2019 to March 16, 2020. ""The drop in emissions in late-January is visible, coinciding with the nationwide quarantine, and from the beginning of March, the levels have begun to increase,"" the analysis said./The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) also recorded a decrease of fine particulate matter (PM) concentrations in February 2020 compared to the three years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Covid-19 update: As country shuts down, a sign of the new normal?","India, March 22 -- Close to one billion people worldwide were confined to their homes on Saturday. On Sunday, most of India's 1.3 billion people, too, are expected to shut themselves in./The day after, the lifeline of public transport in the country's capital, the Delhi Metro, will run for only eight hours. Schools, colleges and malls are already shut. Business districts now increasingly resemble ghost towns./This could soon become the new normal as disease outbreak modelling suggests humanity will need to put in place aggressive social distancing measures for at least two-thirds of the next 18 months, the period at the end of which scientists expect the production of a viable vaccine to halt the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic./The shutdowns and the quarantines ""will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) - given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed,"" said scientists from Imperial College of London in a report that last week that pushed the governments of the United States and United Kingdom into action after projections showed millions could die in the two countries./According to an AFP tally, an estimated 900 million people were on Saturday confined to their homes in 35 countries around the world, prominent among them being Italy, the United States, France and Spain./According to the ""Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand"" report, for a sustainable fight against the pandemic, countries will need to put in place a Grap-like mechanism that will allow them to pare back some of these restrictions when the outbreak relents, but immediately reimpose them if infection rates pick up./Grap, or graded response action plan, is a strategy used in the National Capital Region to fight pollution by rolling out progressively stiffer curbs on activities that contribute to air pollution once the air quality deteriorates./The strategy to fight Covid-19 is based on the combination of what the authors describe as ""suppression"" - measures that slow the virus's spread - and ""mitigation"", which sets out to achieve so-called herd immunity./A mitigation strategy banks on the fact that patients once infected will be immune after they recover, but, in the case of Covid-19, this could lead to a surge in hospitalisations that will overwhelm health care facilities and leave the most critical out - a scenario projected to cause 250,000 deaths in the UK and 1.1-1.2 million deaths in the US./""Long-term suppression may not be a feasible policy option in many countries. Our results show that the alternative relatively short-term (three months) mitigation policy option might reduce deaths seen in the epidemic by up to half, and peak health care demand by two-thirds,"" the report added./India, to be sure, has put in place several of these suppression strategies - such as isolation of confirmed cases, home quarantine of suspected patients and closing of schools and colleges./The authors suggest the sustainable strategy will be to put in place a strong surveillance of the disease so that an on/off mechanism can be used for the suppression measures./Once the outbreak eases to a certain degree - measured, for example, by weekly intensive care unit (ICU) admissions dropping below 200 - some of the curbs can be relaxed./""We show that intermittent social distancing - triggered by trends in disease surveillance - may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relatively short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound,"" the report adds./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations is even more pronounced because the major source of NO2 emissions are vehicles, which have gone off the roads, and industries, which have been ordered to close to reduce the risk of infection./The hourly pollution trend in Delhi and in the neighbouring cities of Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad analysed by CSE used to be influenced by traffic peaks in the mornings and evenings, a factor hasn't been relevant in the past four days./For example, in Delhi the daily peak PM 2.5 concentrations has declined on a lockdown day by about 57% compared to a regular day and the peak on the ""Janta Curfew"" day (Sunday, March 22) dropped by about 24% compared to a regular day. The peak concentrations of NO2 dropped by 66% on a lockdown day compared to a regular day and by 32% on the people's curfew day.

""Subsequent lockdown is more rigorous and pertains to 24 hours with curfew rules in place,"" it said. There's also the cumulative effect to be taken into account./The main source of NO2 emissions is fuel combustion by vehicles and industries.

An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi has revealed that morning and evening peaks in PM 2.5 (particulate matter 2.5, fine, respirable pollution particles) levels have flattened out./""As a result of this, several stars and planets have become much brighter. The Canopus star in the southern hemisphere is looking quite bright. Planets such as Jupiter, Mars and Saturn have become brighter and can be seen before dawn around 4 am. Venus is also looking brighter in the evening sky,"" said J Khemchandani, secretary of Ahmedabad's astronomy club./""The sky is now dotted with stars, many of which were earlier not visible. Earlier, only two objects from the deep sky were visible. But now I can see at least five including the Little Beehive star cluster, Messier 36, Messier 37 and Messier 38. These could be seen in the western sky in the evening. Earlier I could see only two to three stars of the Scorpio constellation. But now I can see the entire constellation. Even the pole star is shining brightly over the last one week or so,"" said Sneh Kesari, an amateur astronomer in Delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Uran dump threatens safety of 3K residents; No alternatives amid Covid-19 lockdown say officials,"Mumbai, March 31 -- Amid nationwide lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic, a garbage dump in Uran has been on fire for the past 15 days, sending toxic fumes into the air and threatening mangrove forest and a gas pipeline in its vicinity./Over 3,000 affected Uran residents have been demanding the closure of the 13-year-old dump but district officials said even though an alternate site was identified, it was impossible to operate a new landfill amid the current lockdown scenario./The fire, cause of which is unknown, has now started spreading across mangrove forests, and is dangerously close to a gas pipeline that belongs to the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC)./Environmentalists filed a fresh complaint before the Maharashtra government and Bombay high court (HC) appointed mangrove protection committee on Tuesday. In January, the HC committee had directed City Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) and the Raigad collector to find an alternative site while revenue officials had booked the Uran Municipal Council (UMC) workers for environmental destruction./""We have been posting daily fire bulletins to all state and central agencies, including the Prime Minister's Office, pleading for immediate intervention before the situation gets worse,"" said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation. ""However, there has been no visible action.""/An ONGC official requesting anonymity said, ""The dump site is a ticking time bomb and poses a health risk. It can spread more infection during this crisis period. A temporary alternate arrangement needs to be made at the earliest.""/HT had reported in January that an alternative site had been identified and finalised at Navghar but it would take time to make it operational./Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari said, ""The process of acquiring final no-objection certificates is already underway but owing to the lockdown everything is stalled. The process will take time while acquiring clearance from Cidco [landowners]. Meantime, all complaints are being swiftly addressed.""/Residents alleged that taking advantage of the lockdown, the UMC ignored their concerns while they suffer due to unchecked air pollution. ""To make matters worse, the civic body started spraying pesticides in heavy doses on the garbage being dumped,"" said Samir Ashrit, resident of Bori Pakhadi./Started in 2007, the two-hectare dumping ground is located between Bori Pakhadi and Hanuman Koliwada villages receives 3,000 kg of waste per day. A residential colony is located less than 100-m away from the dump on one end while dense mangrove cover on the other./Last Wednesday, a massive fire was doused by ONGC fire tenders as the police booked three unidentified persons for starting the fire./Awdhut Tawde, chief executive officer, UMC alleged there was foul play by local residents. ""We were told that one major fire was due to a short circuit but continuous small fires are being lit purposely. We are investigating this. To avoid any mishap, we are building a fence to cordon off the site from mangroves and the pipeline.""/Another resident Pritam Thakur said, ""We have been facing breathing problems due to the smoke billowing out of the burning plastic, rubber, tyres and other muck. After the UMC flattened the garbage, mangroves are now choking.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Scientists use lockdown to get data on unpolluted Delhi air,"Kolkata, April 1 -- The 21-day nationwide lockdown, coupled with favourable weather conditions, is not just giving Delhi its cleanest air possible, it is also allowing scientists to determine the city's baseline pollution levels -- for the very first time./With pollution sources brought down to a bare minimum, within and outside the National Capital Region, researchers from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur and other private organisations, have started gathering data to determine Delhi's baseline pollution levels, or the lowest pollution level Delhi can ever hope to achieve./""Even though baseline data is important to fight air pollution, it is hard to get. There is always some form of pollution in a city that skews the data. If we can determine the lowest achievable pollution levels, it would help us to prepare a road map and strategy to cut down on sources,"" said D Saha, former head of the CPCB's air quality lab./Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Since then, factories, construction sites, and some other local sources that pollute Delhi have been totally shut, while vehicles on the roads have been at a bare minimum./""The city's air quality is at its best at the moment, and is unlikely to get better than this. All man-made pollution has come down to near-zero levels. Nothing is operating within a range of 300km, barring a few essential vehicles, and service providers such as power plants and oil refineries. This is a never-before opportunity to collect the city's baseline pollution data,"" said MP George, a scientist with DPCC./The 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) of the last seven days has not crossed 100 on a single day. It dropped to 45 (good) on March 28, and has been hovering in the 50-100 (satisfactory) range for the rest of the past week. During the corresponding period in previous years, it remained much higher - often in the 200-250 range (poor). The AQI had crossed 300 (very poor) on March 25, 2016. In the winter, it frequently shoots up beyond 400 (severe)./""We hardly get such an opportunity when almost all major sources of pollution are stopped in one go. We plan to start work on preparing baseline pollution level for Delhi very soon with the data that is being collected during the lockdown period,"" said Mukesh Sharma, a professor of civil engineering from IIT Kanpur, whose team prepared the Capital's first source apportionment chart in 2016./A 2018 study by The Energy Resources Institute (Teri) and Automotive Research Association of India (Arai) had shown that during winters 36% pollution is generated within Delhi. Around 34% comes from areas within the NCR and 18% comes from northwest India (beyond NCR). At least 13% of Delhi's pollution was coming from outside India. Real-time source apportionment of air pollution has been a problem in Delhi, and the state government is working on a project with Washington University to fill the gap./""The shutdown is not limited to a particular sector like industry or vehicles. Neither is it a city-level shutdown. It is a pan-India shutdown, so chances of pollution coming from outside has also been minimised. We are gathering data as this an opportunity that Delhi will not get in years to come,"" said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, and coordinator of Cerca at IIT Delhi./State pollution control board officials from Haryana and Punjab confirmed that summer stubble burning (when farmers clear their fields for the next crop) is not happening at present, which also contributes heavily to the city's pollution./Now add to this good weather - strong winds, occasional sharp showers, and sunlight. The India Meteorological Department (IMD)'s Safdurjung observatory, which is taken to be a representative of Delhi, received 109.6mm rain in March 2020. This is the highest rainfall in the month of March since 1901. In 2015, Safdarjung received around 97.5mm rain. With moist soil there is hardly any dust in the air, say experts./""Delhi, along with other parts of north-west India, received good rain because of more western disturbances this month. Over the past one week, north westerly winds with a speed of 15-20km per hour are blowing,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre in Delhi./Though the yearly average PM2.5 level in Delhi usually remains two to three times higher than WHO permissible limits at all times, in the last one week, the levels of both PM2.5 and PM10 have remained well within the daily permissible limits of 60ug/m3 and 100ug/m3 respectively./Such levels are usually seen only after heavy showers during the monsoon. In the winter, PM2.5 and PM10 breach their respective severe+ marks of 300ug/m3 and 500ug/m3./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Gurugram: Grassland near Basai rail overbridge set on fire, second case in under a month","Gurugram, April 4 -- The vast field of dry grassland, stretching along the Rewari-Delhi railway line in Basai, near the Basai railway overbridge (ROB), was set on fire on Thursday, much to the annoyance of those living in Sector 37D, located nearby. This is the second such incident in Basai in less than 30 days./On March 9, a fire had taken place within the Basai waste treatment plant, causing pollution in the area. The blaze had left a trail of smoke and fly ash over the skyline in the area, settling on rooftops, balconies, roads, etc./Spotted by residents from their balconies, many clicked pictures and shot videos of Thursday's blaze, with trains passing through. They later shared these posts in a WhatsApp group for civil defence - a newly created social platform of volunteers and top officials of the district in view of the Covid-19 outbreak - with complaints raising concerns on air pollution. Some alleged that the blaze was caused by railway employees./The residents said they spotted the fire around 1.30pm and it lasted for five-to-six hours. They said a team of fire tenders reached the spot around 5pm and they took nearly 30-40 minutes to douse the flames./Harish Sharma, assistant sanitary inspector, municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG), said, ""It took us half an hour to put out fire. We will inquire into the issue. Residents told us that fire incidents keep taking place in the grassland.""/The residents said they are concerned about air pollution in the area and they want a proper investigation into Thursday's fire incident and a lawful action against the culprits./""We requested the MCG officials to inquire into the fire incident and take action. Since October last year, fire incidents in the grassland in this area have taken place five times. This is an offence and we want proper action and a check on it,"" said Yadvendra Singh, a resident of NBCC Green View residential society, Sector 37D./However, railway officials denied that the fire was caused by railway employees, when asked./""Our personnel did not set the grassland on fire. We got many calls from residents and we told them that this was not done by our men at all,"" said a Railway official, requesting anonymity./The Supreme Court has banned burning of grass, leaves and other materials which might cause air pollution. The Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB) is the nodal authority to take action and fine source generators./Shakti Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, Gurugram South, said, ""I will speak with the Indian Railways regarding this, as well as the MCG and and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and take action accordingly to make sure this does not happen again.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Cracker bursting breaks spell of good air in Delhi,"New Delhi, April 6 -- At 9pm on Sunday, Delhi's 13-day spell of good air days was broken. A sudden spurt in firecracker burning on Sunday, coupled with low wind speed, pushed the city's air quality further into the 'moderate' category on Monday./While environment experts said that the situation could have been worse if such unprecedented cracker bursting had happened in ""normal circumstances"", authorities are ascertaining how large quantities of crackers were procured by people during the lockdown./Amid the Covid-19 outbreak, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged people to come out to their balconies and light candles, earthen lamps or torch lights for nine minutes at 9pm on Sunday to show their support for the government's fight against the disease. However, on Sunday evening, while lamps glowed, the sound of firecrackers also echoed across the city./As per the data, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Monday was recorded 142, up from Sunday's 102, in the lower-end of 'moderate' zone. On Saturday, the AQI was 87 ('satisfactory'), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./By 4.30pm on Monday, the AQI at many stations in Delhi had slipped to the 'poor' category. Monitoring stations at Rohini, Wazirpur and Vivek Vihar recorded AQI levels above 200 at 4.30 pm./Since March 24, the air quality levels in the national Capital have consistently remained in the 'satisfactory' zone, and had even improved to 'good', with an AQI of 45 on March 28./Experts said that assessing real-time air pollution, the spike in the pollution levels between 9pm and 10pm on Sunday was somewhat similar to that seen in the early hours of Diwali night. If such cracker burning activity had happened in regular circumstances, with vehicles plying and industries operating, under similar weather conditions, the AQI would have dipped considerably, experts said./A senior CPCB official said that since cracker burning was consistent across the city and was the only polluting activity that happened, its impact on air quality was noticeable./""Since these circumstances are not normal and everything else is shut, the AQI levels remained in the moderate zone. The problem was that even the wind speed was not strong enough to neutralise the impact of cracker bursting. But Sunday's cracker burning was more like a freak episode, which authorities were not anticipating. We can attribute the spike in pollution solely to cracker bursting because nothing else is happening,"" the official said./Weathermen said that the wind speeds were low through Saturday, Sunday and until Monday afternoon./""The winds were calm on Sunday night and it was only by Monday morning that it improved to reach around five to six kilometres per hour (kmph). By Monday afternoon, the wind speed picked up to reach around 15kmph. This was not enough to blow away the pollution caused by yesterday's (Sunday) cracker burning,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre./Srivastava said that the wind speed will pick up from Monday night. There is also a forecast of rain and thunderstorm on Tuesday, which is likely to improve air quality to acceptable levels./Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) hourly average data on particulate matter levels shows that at 9pm on Sunday, PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels in Delhi's air was 48.1ug/m3. This spiked to 49.5ug/m3 at 10pm and gradually to 57ug/m3 by 6am on Monday./Delhi Police officials said that considering that the city is under lockdown and only the sale of essential commodities is being permitted, chances are that the crackers that were burnt on Sunday night were hoarded by people since last Diwali. Senior officials said that no action was taken against cracker bursting. Officials also confirmed that no permission requests were received by them for licences to sell crackers over the last few weeks./""All shops selling non-essential commodities are shut and our teams are continuously monitoring areas. The crackers that were burst last night could be what people saved from Diwali,"" said MS Randhawa, Delhi Police spokesperson./Wholesale cracker dealers said that sale has been completely shut during the lockdown. Narendra Gupta, president of fireworks and general traders association in Sadar Bazar, said that permanent vendors had also stopped distribution and sales. ""Nobody had anticipated that there would be a call from the Prime Minister to light candles, let alone cracker bursting,"" said Gupta./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution raises risk of Covid-19 deaths: study,"India, April 8 -- Air pollution is likely to be a major risk factor for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) mortality, scientists have concluded./Prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory response even among the young and healthy which makes people living in polluted areas more susceptible to developing chronic respiratory conditions. This theory is borne out by the high Covid-19-related death rates in northern Italy compared to the rest of the country, environmental scientists and physicians in Italy have concluded./In a paper titled ""Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high-level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?"" published in Elsevier's journal of Environmental Pollution on April 4, the scientists pointed that the mortality was 12% in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, as compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country. This region is one of Europe's most polluted based on data from Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Aura satellite./The data indicates that there is stagnation of pollutants in the region because of geographical and climatic factors. A review of air quality index (AQI), which is calculated based on concentrations of particulate matter and other gases, is also the worst for this region in Italy./""Air pollution represents one of the most well-known causes of prolonged inflammation, eventually leading to an innate immune system hyper-activation,"" the study by scientists at the rheumatology unit of the University of Siena and departmental of environmental science at Arhaus University said. The authors explained how pollutants impact the human immune response./In a small cohort of mice exposed for three months to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) showed a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines in both serum and lung parenchyma. High systemic inflammation impairs heart function as well. A high correlation has also been seen between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM in inducing 1L6 (an inflammatory cytokine) hyperexpression./""Our considerations must not let us neglect other factors responsible of the high lethality recorded: important co-factors such as the elevated medium age of the Italian population, the wide differences among Italian regional health systems, ICUs (intensive care units) capacity and how the infects and deaths have been reported have had a paramount role in the lethality of SARS-CoV-2, (which causes Covid-19) presumably also more than pollution itself,"" cautioned environmental scientist Dario Caro in a statement./The paper has concluded that pollution impairs the first line of defence of the upper airways called cilia (microscopic hair-like structures or organelles) which is why people in polluted areas are more likely to develop chronic respiratory conditions due to an infective agent like SARS-CoV-2./This was seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 too. A study by scientists of the Fielding School of Public Health analysed five regions with 100 or more SARS cases which showed that the fatality rate increased with the increment in AQI or air pollution levels. Moderate AQIs had an 84% increased risk of dying from SARS compared to those from regions with lower AQI./""When a population is chronically exposed to high levels of air pollution, the lung is compromised. The lung develops an inflammation. In short, the lung becomes ready for external attack. Those living in areas with cleaner air are more battle-ready. There have bee high cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), rhinitis and other conditions, which have manifestations similar to Covid-19. Indian population is extremely vulnerable to rhinoviruses but we've grown immunity and come out of it within four to five days. But the unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 is that it can be fatal for some people. This is a great opportunity to study how the impact of a new virus is influenced by air pollution,"" said Dr Manas Ranjan Ray, former assistant director of Kolkata-based Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute./India has some of the most polluted cities in the world, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) region. People living in the IGP region are expected to lose seven years of their life because of severe air pollution, according to an analysis conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) released last year./The analysis said there has been a 72% increase in pollution between 1998 and 2016 in the region which accounts for 40% of the country's population./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Higher air pollution could increase Covid death rate,"India, April 8 -- Air pollution is likely to be a major risk factor in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) mortality, scientists have contended -- a finding that could have serious implications for India./Prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory response even among the young and healthy, which makes people living in polluted areas more susceptible to developing chronic respiratory conditions. This is borne out by the high Covid-19-related death rates in northern Italy compared to the rest of the country, according to environmental scientists and physicians in Italy./And an analysis by Harvard University's TH Chan School of Public Health, published in MedRxiv, a pre-print journal for health sciences, on April 5, of 3,080 counties in the US, an increase of only 1 microgram per cubic metre in PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less) concentrations is associated with a 15% increase in Covid-19 deaths./The US's annual PM 2.5 average is around 9.9 micrograms per cubic metre (meets the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline of 10 micrograms per cubic metre) whereas India's annual average PM 2.5 concentration was more than 80 micrograms per cubic metres in 2017, according to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study, indicating that Indians' exposure to polluted air is about eight times higher./""Their analysis is robust.We need to estimate the same for India as it is not possible to extrapolate the impact at high pollution level linearly. Covid mortality rate also depends on pre-existing conditions (like diabetes, heart problems). So, the Indian context may be completely different. As of now we may not have enough Covid cases to perform the analysis and get the statistically significant result,"" said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi./In another paper titled ""Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high-level of Sars-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?"" published in Elsevier's journal of Environmental Pollution on April 4, scientists said that the mortality was 12% in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country.

"Of all polluted cities in UP, Noida and Greater Noida register the best improvement","Noida, April 8 -- With the 21-day nationwide lockdown bringing to a halt vehicular movement across cities and also shutting industries, both polluting and otherwise, the air quality has markedly improved, especially in Noida and Greater Noida, a recent analysis of major cities of Uttar Pradesh shows./Both industrial districts - Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida and Greater Noida) and Ghaziabad - had been consistently listed as the most polluted cities of the country, with excessively high concentration of particulate pollutants./The analysis done by Greenpeace India compared the levels PM2.5 - particles in air with a diameter less than 2.5 microns - of seven top polluted cities of the state for the period from March 24 to April 4 for the years 2020 and 2019./While all cities have shown a reduction in PM2.5, the drop in Greater Noida is 68.83%, Noida 65.87%, Ghaziabad 65.75%, Agra 58.92%, Lucknow 55.25%, Kanpur 50.25% and Varanasi 46.96%. Greenpeace India procured its data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the apex body for monitoring ambient air quality in the country./""This analysis clearly shows humane activities such as burning fossil fuel, transport sector, and the energy sector contribute significantly to particulate matter in cities and it can be controlled by transitioning from fossil fuels to renewables,"" said the Greenpeace India analysis./It added that PM2.5 is the major pollutant that causes serious health risks such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and lung cancer./According to the report, the average concentration of PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 26.98 microgrammes per cubic meters (Ug/m3) for period between March 24 and April 4, 2020, against 86.56 Ug/m3 for the same period last year./The average concentration for Noida was 29.80 Ug/m3 this year against 85.40 Ug/m3 last year. The average concentration of PM2.5 for the given period for Ghaziabad was 35.74 Ug/m3 against 104.40 Ug/m3 last year./The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 Ug/m3, according to the national standards, while the World Health Organization keeps it 25 Ug/m3./""Although we are seeing a reduction in air pollution across cities owing to the lockdown, we should not see it as a relief. The changes are very temporary, and will not contribute much to the annual average pollution levels. Once the lockdown ends, the pollution will increase again,"" Avinash Chanchal, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India, said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Now, odd-even rule in Delhi's wholesale markets to fight Covid-19","India, April 13 -- Traders in Delhi's crowded wholesale vegetable and fruit markets will have to follow the odd-even rule to maintain social distancing to break the chain of coronavirus infections, minister Gopal Rai has said./Delhi's development minister Gopal Rai had called a meeting of officials of all the wholesale markets on Monday to discuss ways to ensure social distancing in these areas as the national capital reported 1205 coronavirus disease cases and 24 deaths./Rai said traders will sell fruits and vegetables on alternate days under the odd-even scheme, which was the Delhi government's flagship road rationing scheme to check air pollution by controlling the number of vehicles on the road./Also read: PM to address nation at 10 am tomorrow, expected to outline lockdown decision/The minister also said vegetables will be sold from 6am to 11am and fruits from 2pm to 6pm in all the wholesale markets in the national capital, news agency PTI reported./Gopal Rai said while speaking to the agency that the Delhi government has formed four special task forces to ensure effective social distancing in these markets, some of which have densely places sheds./Several such rearrangements have been worked out at the Azadpur, Keshopur, Najafgarh and Mehrauli markets. While the first two have been subjected to staggered timings, the others have been relocated to more spacious zones./The Delhi government on Saturday directed the relocation of the Mehrauli vegetable mandi to Mehrauli bus terminal. The wholesale market was shifted to its new location by Sunday morning, where the local police had designated areas for vendors, ensuring a safe distance from one another./Markings were also made for the general public, to ensure six-foot gaps among them./The Azadpur mandi, the largest wholesale fruit and vegetable market in the country, has already implemented the odd-even rule and staggered its sale time from Monday./The decisions came amid reports that social distancing rules were not being followed at the mandi, spread over 80 acres./Adil Ahmad Khan, the chairperson of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), Azadpur, said there are 22 big sheds under which hundreds of traders sell vegetables and a huge number of people visit the market every day./""Under the odd-even rules, we will allow all the 22 sheds to operate according to their numbers. For instance, on even date, even-numbered sheds such as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 will be allowed to function,"" Khan had said./Traders, Khan said, can bring only one truck inside the Azadpur mandi. Until now, a trader could take three to four trucks inside the mandi, shrinking the space for others./Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tweeted a couple of pictures on Monday morning that showed people at the market standing in queues in designated spots-circles drawn on the ground./""Social distancing at Azadpur Mandi,"" Sisodia tweeted in Hindi./As the number of Covid-19 cases has been rising in the Capital, the Delhi government has ramped up measures to fight the Covid-19 outbreak, including identifying 43 hotspots where strict containment measures have been put in place./Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his government was focusing on zones designated ""red"" and ""orange"" to isolate and control the outbreak./Kejriwal has said the government will keep adding containment zones wherever new patients of the highly contagious disease are detected./He has also said that sanitisation and disinfection drives will be scaled up from Monday in the containment zones created across the city and ""high-risk"" areas ascertained by the health department./(With agency inputs)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Favourable monsoon could give farmers some hope: scientists,"India, April 14 -- Indian farmers may be suffering because of the nationwide lockdown imposed since March 25 to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has disrupted supply chains but global weather models may have something to lift their spirits, as they are suggesting that the monsoon will be normal this year and may set in a day or two early./India Meteorological Department (IMD) is expected to issue its monsoon forecast later this week./India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually begins in June before starting to retreat by September. The monsoon rainfall is crucial to rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds cultivation in the country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy and employs over half of its people./Global weather models are numerical weather prediction models run by various agencies. The seasonal forecasting of the southwest monsoon is done with the help of statistical and dynamical models./IBM's The Weather Company, a private weather forecasting company, has said that the monsoon is likely to set in slightly earlier than normal on May 31 as against June 1 and the above normal rain at 105% of the long-period average (LPA) is likely. ""Uncalibrated climate model forecasts suggest an unusually wet monsoon season this year although our calibrated and bias-corrected model suggests a lesser degree of dryness. We're expecting a transition from weak El Nino conditions towards La Nina conditions as we progress through the monsoon season, which will favour a large-scale atmospheric pattern that will become increasingly conducive to heavier rainfall later in the season,"" the company said in a statement./La Nina is associated with a strong monsoon and above-average rains in India while El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino years in India are linked to below-normal monsoon rains and higher than normal frequency of heatwaves. Last year, weak El Nino conditions prevailed and led to a delayed onset of the monsoon./""Our observations suggest more rains in south-western parts of the country and lower rains in northwestern India,"" said Himanshu Goyal, India business leader, The Weather Company./Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said global agencies unanimously indicate normal monsoon rains for June to September, which is good news. ""This is largely based on the favourable conditions in the Pacific as there is no coherent sign of an El Nino developing during the early stage of the monsoon. El Nino, if present, can weaken the moisture carrying monsoon winds and reduce the rainfall received.""/The rain in the pre-monsoon period has also been above average, which experts say will help improve and retain soil moisture and help with sowing in some parts of the country. From March 1 to April 12, central India received 165% and north-western parts 52% excess rain even as eastern and the north-eastern parts are 44% deficient, according to IMD./Ocean temperatures in the equatorial Indian Ocean are forecasted to be warmer than normal, which has the potential to reduce monsoon rains. ""Our analysis has shown that such conditions can have an adverse impact on monsoon rains over central-north India. The significance of the Indian Ocean is increasing year by year as it is warming rapidly due to increasing carbon emissions. Forecast models do not generally pick this link between the warm Indian Ocean and the monsoon rains,"" Koll said, clarifying that his analysis is not a forecast./The warm Indian Ocean could also trigger cyclones during the onset of monsoon./Air pollution levels have reduced in India and across the world due to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions and this is also likely to impact the monsoon. There have been scientific studies that show high air pollution levels have led to a decline in monsoon rains over the past decades./""I don't know if the models are factoring in this new scenario with less pollution,"" Koll said./M Rajeevan, secretary, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, said there is no El Nino influence this year and the government will share full details of the onset and monsoon performance in their forecast later this week./Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate and meteorology at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said there is some warming in the eastern pacific but as the monsoon progresses, there will be a likely movement towards La Nina or low sea surface temperatures across the east-central Equatorial Pacific./""The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is also negative. High temperatures are already being recorded in central and western India. Rain in the pre-monsoon period has also been good. All these factors indicate that it is likely to be normal or slightly above normal monsoon.""/IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean; positive IOD conditions are associated with normal monsoon./Skymet Weather will not issue a monsoon forecast this year because its services have been impacted by the ongoing lockdown restrictions. ""Our modelling teams haven't able to run these models from home. Also, last year, none of the weather agencies got the monsoon forecast right. We also plan to reflect on what's going wrong with monsoon forecasts,"" Palawat said./After a delayed onset of the south-west monsoon on June 8 last year and very little rain in June due to presence of a weak El Nino, there were fears among meteorologists that it would be a drought year. June ended with a deficit of 33% but July, August and September received 105%, 115% and 152% of their LPA, respectively./The IMD announced monsoon withdrawal on September 30 last year with cumulative rainfall of 110% of the LPA./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Post Covid-19, India needs increased focus on air quality","India, April 22 -- The nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is certain to bring enormous social and economic costs to the country. The lockdown has, however, afforded us a look into how our skies and trees could look if Indian cities had cleaner air. It highlights the fact that even though the government must prioritise the economy in the coming months, the other public health crisis - air pollution - can't be overlooked. This brings into focus the Centre's Rs 4,400-crore grant to municipal corporations (MCs) of bigger cities for 2020-21 to tackle air pollution./Covid-19 has re-emphasised the need to proactively invest in public health systems. This includes mitigating risk factors that increase the incidence of illnesses. Air pollution is the second largest risk factor - behind malnutrition - contributing to India's disease burden. Commonly known impacts of air pollution include cardio-respiratory diseases, lung cancer in adults, and acute lower respiratory infections in children. Besides, emerging research suggests that it impacts early childhood development, including birth weight and growth. Early evidence also suggests that air pollution increases the risk of Covid-19 infection./In what now seems a lifetime ago, last winter witnessed one of the most severe smog episodes around Delhi in recent memory, accompanied by unprecedented attention on air quality, with the issues being raised in Parliament, discussed in the media, and included in the Delhi assembly election manifesto. The Union finance minister accepted the interim recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) that provides additional fiscal support in 2020-21, incentivising MCs to tackle air pollution in cities with one million or more population./To put the quantum of outlay in perspective, in 2019-20, the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) budget under the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) was merely Rs 300 crore, distributed among 102 polluted cities, with grants ranging between Rs 10 crore and Rs 10 lakhs. The outlay also dwarfs MoEFCC's total budget of Rs 3,100 crore for 2020-21, signalling a shift in the air quality management approach, with additional resources and increased devolution towards MCs./While the MoEFCC is still developing the performance framework to determine exactly how the grant will be distributed across cities, the 15th FC report outlines the broad contours. It has recommended that the grants be allocated to cities based on their population. Thus, the total possible grant size for Mumbai would be Rs 488 crore, and for a smaller city, such as Tiruchirappalli, it would be Rs 21 crore. This grant is to be released in two instalments: Half of it upfront for ""air quality improvement measures including capacity building of local bodies"", and the rest is subject to the city's performance against its targets./This is the first time that an FC has given grants specifically to tackle air pollution. Air pollution has multiple sources in Indian cities, and many of these - such as waste burning, and road and construction dust - fall directly under the ambit of MCs. Tackling air pollution involves not only regulating emissions from vehicles and industries but also improving urban governance and public services./Institutionally, too, the approach marks a recognition of urbanisation's changing needs by earmarking a larger share of grants to urban local bodies (ULBs): From 30% in the previous year to 37.5% in 2020-21, and making a distinction between million-plus urban agglomerates and smaller towns./Finally, by setting aside funds upfront for capacity-building, the FC acknowledges that if MCs are expected to deal with air quality-related issues, their human and fiscal resources must be strengthened. A review of 23 cities by Janagraaha in 2017 had found that most cities lack urban planners, and more than half of the cities did not generate enough revenue to meet even their salary costs./To be sure, while these grants are necessary, they are not enough to improve air quality. Much depends on the final design of the performance framework. City-level measures by the MCs need to be complemented with actions on sources of air pollution outside their jurisdiction - be it within or outside the city, in the larger regional ""airshed"". To do this, the grants framework should be integrated with NCAP action plans and institutions, with aggressive but achievable timelines for implementing prioritised measures, and a comprehensive cross-agency strategy for resource allocation. Further, it needs a sustained effort to improve the air quality, necessitating, at a minimum, the continuation of the grants for the next five years./The emergence of different city models of Covid-19 response - from Bhilwara to Agra - shows why having a decentralised form of governance, capable of responding to city-specific needs, matters. While the budget priority in the immediate term is rightly given to health and social protection, we must not lose momentum on the strides made in tackling air pollution. Proactively channelling resources to mitigate a critical risk factor today is a crucial investment for tomorrow's public health./Avani Kapur is director of the Accountability Initiative, and fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).

Mumbai's vehicular pollution dropped by three-fourth during lockdown period: Study,"Mumbai, May 5 -- Transport pollution levels declined by three-fourth across Mumbai and Pune between March 24 and April 25 (lockdown period), as compared to the period between February 20 and March 20, revealed an analysis published by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Sunday./Meanwhile, the pollutant-measuring indicator, air quality index (AQI), in Mumbai was 37 (good), making it the cleanest air day so far this year, while Pune recorded 47, also under the 'good' category./The month-wise comparison of air quality levels for four cities - Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Ahmedabad - also revealed that the highest reduction was witnessed in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels for Pune at 70%, followed by Mumbai (69%). Delhi and Ahmedabad recorded a 33% and 30% decline in NO2 levels. Average NO2 concentration fell from 23 parts per billion (ppb) before lockdown month to 7 ppb during lockdown for Mumbai, and 24 ppb to 7 ppb for Pune./""Drastic NO2 decline in Mumbai and Pune indicate that vehicular emissions play a major role in contributing to overall air pollution. Stringent restrictions imposed during the lockdown helped in bringing down the pollution level. Even industrial emissions were lower. However, in Delhi and Ahmedabad this was not the case because under minor influence of external emissions, mild dust storms allowed pollutant particles to be suspended closer to the surface,"" said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR./Toxic gases such as NO2 are formed by burning of coal, oil, and emissions from vehicles that worsen respiratory conditions./""NO2 or other oxides of nitrogen can lead to chemical deposition in the lungs, leading to inflammation of the lung tissue. Prolonged exposure weakens the lungs leading to serious ailments,"" said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist (chest specialist), Lilavati Hospital, Bandra./SAFAR also recorded reduction in PM2.5 levels, which showed maximum decline at Ahmedabad at 51%, followed by Mumbai 49%, Pune 39% and Delhi 31%. PM2.5 is breathable particulate matter comprising solid and liquid particles of 2.5 microns in size or smaller./""Unlike NO2, PM2.5 is influenced by other factors including meteorological conditions. All four cities witnessed weather disturbances leading to fluctuating particulate matter concentration during lockdown,"" said Beig./Independent researchers said a comparative analysis for air quality is more valid when done for the same period year-on-year./""When we compared month-wise averages, meteorological conditions between two months may be very different from each other which may not establish the reduced impact of external emissions within a city,"" said Ronak Sutaria, founder and director, UrbanSciences./Meanwhile, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also recently published its analysis of Mumbai's air quality between March 16 and April 15. The analysis revealed that Mumbai had witnessed a 40% reduction in PM2.5, 43% decline in PM10 (larger coarser particles), 77% reduction in NO2, 59% fall in average benzene levels (contributes to volatile organic compounds) and 50% drop in sulphur dioxide (SO2 - colourless gas with pungent odour that causes respiratory diseases)./""The absence of non-essential vehicles, combustion activities in industries and commercial construction sites during the period may be attributable to the decline,"" the analysis stated./The lowest 24 hourly average for PM10 was 54 microgrammes per cubic metre against the safe limit of 100 ug/m3, PM2.5 was 20 ug/m3 against safe limit of 60 ug/m3, and NO2 levels at 5 ug/m3 against 80 ug/m3 safe limit./""Hourly decline in all pollutants was observed due to restriction on construction activities, less road dust resuspension, and to some extent curb on industrial activities. Absence of emission sources was seen missing at night early morning that would otherwise accumulate before lockdown,"" said a senior CPCB official./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"To counter the Covid-19 pandemic, bring more poor into the LPG net","India, May 6 -- One of the most important components of the government's coronavirus disease (Covid-19) relief package is free LPG for three months for nearly 500 million people. As the national system of LPG distribution is reasonably well-functioning, it is an efficient way to provide economic support to the poor. With uncertainty all around us, ensuring free LPG takes at least one important burden off people's plates./There are, however, some concerns. The programme is focused on its recent customer base - about 83 million - created by the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. It may be an efficient way to reach the poor, but it, unfortunately, leaves out a number of equally deserving groups of the poor. To reach the left-out sections, India needs additional measures./A secure and continuous supply of LPG is another concern. It is the only fuel in the country with stable demand. The consumption of other major fuels - gasoline, diesel, CNG, or coal - is drastically down due to the lockdown. Other energy-intensive activities involving the use of cars, buses, trains, and planes are at much lower levels. Due to the complete lockdown, more people are cooking at home, further pushing up the LPG demand./LPG is an odd fuel in that, unlike oil, it's not searched for directly. There are no LPG wells anywhere. It is, in fact, a secondary product of the oil and gas production, which, owing to low demand, threaten the availability of LPG. To ensure its supplies, the government has reached out to natural gas producers in the Persian Gulf. But with global gas and oil production suppressed, it may require more effort./What perhaps is not so well-understood and appreciated is that ensuring the use of LPG among the poor is actually a direct health benefit measure. Air pollution exposure from biomass cooking fires increases the risk and severity of infection, a harmful situation particularly during the Covid-19 spread./It is well-established that air pollution exposure increases the risk of respiratory diseases, including infectious ones like flu or pneumonia. This is not because pollution contains pathogens - the virus in this case - but because it decreases the effectiveness of the human immune system./Recent research shows that those exposed to air pollution are more susceptible to Covid-19. It's also true for smokers whose immune system is further weakened by smoke./Outdoor air pollution in India, among the worst in the world, and the use of fossil fuels such as coal, has dropped drastically during the lockdown. This is good for health, a partial counterbalance to the terrible disruption of life brought about by the economic disruption. Sending people to their villages and towns during the lockdown, however, may expose them to smoke from cooking fires if they are still using biomass fuel./It will cause extra pollution exposures and enhance the risk of Covid-19 by counteracting the benefit from lower ambient pollution exposure. Since the household use of biomass is responsible for a substantial portion of ambient pollution nationally, some of the health benefits accrued due to low consumption of fossil fuel will also be lost./It's praiseworthy that India has convinced most people to stay in their homes that have cleaner air owing to the use of LPG. But it may also want to find ways to ensure gas supply for those who are left out to help keep homes clean and safe for everyone./Kirk R Smith is director, Collaborative Clean Air Policy Centre, New Delhi, and professor, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Covid-19 pandemic sets back Delhi's infra projects by six months,"India, May 9 -- Major infrastructure projects in the city would be delayed by at least five to six months due to the ongoing Covid crisis, hampering government efforts to streamline traffic flow at major junctions in the city and making roads safer for pedestrians./Even though construction work has begun at some places after a long hiatus in view of the national lockdown to arrest the spread of Sars-Cov-2, funding and labour remain pertinent problems before the contractors. Last week, the government had relaxed norms but still several restrictions remain regarding social distancing and management of labour at the sites./Construction on key projects across the capital had been in limbo for the past nearly six months. In November, all construction activity in Delhi was banned in view of rising air pollution. It was completely lifted on February 14, but within almost a month, it was again halted on March 25 due to the nationwide corona lockdown./The Delhi government's Public Works Department (PWD) is helming key projects such as the construction of 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila road near Mathura Road and the Ring Road, which is part of ITPO Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Project; Barapullah phase-3 elevated corridor; Ashram underpass; flyovers at Seelampur and Shastri Park; Benito-Juarez Road underpass./""Deadlines for almost all projects are likely to be extended. Work has started but it is going on very slow. Since November, we have not been able to work properly,"" a senior PWD engineer said requesting anonymity./With thousands of labourers returning home and the Delhi government making it clear that it will release funds on priority only for Covid-related works, the construction work is expected to take a lot of time to pick up pace, officials associated with several projects said./S Velmurugan, senior principal scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said, ""Such long delays will not only delay freedom from crippling traffic jams but also escalate project cost. Projects such as Ashram underpass and Barapullah-3 are of utmost importance as they aim to decongest traffic bottlenecks at Ashram, Ring Road, ITO,"" he said./Sewa Ram, professor at School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said the city may have to wait another winter for key infra projects to finish. ""It is going to have a ripple effect. The cost will escalate, then fresh approvals would be needed and fresh resources will have to be mobilised. The government may have a relook at some of the projects or halt them temporarily,"" Ram said./A look at five key infra projects that have been hit by intermittent delays./Delhi's first road tunnel/The PWD is constructing this Rs 777-crore project, which entails construction of a 1.2-km-long tunnel and six underpasses to ease travel to India Gate and parts of central Delhi from different corners of the city especially from east Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad./The tunnel road, a first for Delhi, would go beneath the Pragati Maidan, which is being revamped. The tunnel will start near National Sports Complex of India (NSCI) on Purana Qila Road and culminate on the Ring Road near Pragati Power station. PWD officials said that about 70% work of the project has been completed./""The June deadline is to be extended by around three months. Big exhaust fans, which are used to maintain air circulation in the tunnel by throwing smoke emanating from vehicles out of the tunnel, were to be procured from Germany but due to lockdown the process could not be started,"" a PWD official said./Ashram underpass project:/It is one of the most awaited projects of the city because the underpass can help decongest of the most busiest stretches across Delhi. The project entails construction of a 750-metre-long underpass along Mathura Road at busy Ashram crossing. The project also include extension of existing Ashram flyover on the Ring Road up to the beginning of DND Flyway. According to PWD officials, only around five percent construction work of the underpass has been completed while the construction of flyover extension is yet to start./Traffic police data shows that around 3 lakh vehicles cross the Ashram intersection every day during peak traffic hours. Deadline of the underpass construction is December 2020. It is likely to be extended by around four to five months as work couldn't be carried out at desired pace./""Preparatory works such as site marking, site survey and utility identification was completed. But we could not start construction work in full swing as the we could not get required traffic diversion due to protests at Shaheen Bagh. Because of protests, the road leading to Noida was closed so entire traffic was moving through Ashram only. Later, the construction work was stalled due to coronavirus outbreak,"" a PWD official said on the condition of anonymity./The official added that now they have asked the concessionaire to resume construction activities on the site./Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridor:/The elevated corridor aims to provide seamless connectivity between Mayur Vihar-I and Sarai Kale Khan, where it will meet the existing Barapullah-I elevated corridor, making the nearly 9.5km journey to AIIMS signal free. In September 2019, the government had issued a gazette notification to start acquisition of two patches of land - 250m and 500m - which had stalled the progress of the 3.5-km elevated corridor project for the last four years. The land belongs to farmers of Nagli Razapur village near Sarai Kale Khan./""By publishing the land acquisition notification, the government had paved way for removing the major hurdle of the project. After this the district administration had to begin the process of land acquisition but it was stalled earlier because of model code of conduct and later due to coronavirus lockdown,"" a senior PWD official said on the condition of anonymity./()/Flyovers at Shastri Park and Seelampur:/The construction of these flyovers had started in February 2019 and was to be ended in March 2020 but the project hit a hurdle initially when construction was banned due to pollution and later because of riots in north east Delhi. A majority of the migrant labourers employed in the construction of these two projects have fled to their villages fearing attacks. ""The construction was further banned due to coronavirus lockdown on March 25. Now we have resumed construction activities and are hoping to complete the project in next two months as over 85% work has been completed,"" a PWD official said./These flyovers aim to end traffic bottlenecks in congested east and north-east Delhi areas such as Shahdara, Welcome, Shastri Park, Kashmere Gate, Seelampur and Kajoori Khas./Benito-Juarez Road underpass/The project includes construction of a three-lane underpass, near Venkateswara College, in south Delhi. It will connect Benito Juarez Road- the radial road connecting the Ring Road with the Outer Ring Road - with San Martin Road. The facility will reduce travel time from the airport to central Delhi and AIIMS by 20 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. ""The project was initially delayed due to shifting of utilities, and the complex nature of construction work. Later it was delayed by the construction bans imposed due to pollution and Covid-19 lockdown,"" an official said associated with the project said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India losing almost a million under-5 children annually: Study,"New Delhi, May 12 -- Even as the under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) in India has reduced by almost 50% in the past two decades, the country is still losing at least a million children annually before they reach their fifth birthday./Of these, half a million children die within 28 days of being born (neonatal mortality) primarily due to lower respiratory tract infection, pre-term birth and diarrhoeal diseases, show recent papers published in The Lancet./""U5MR in India reduced by 49% from 83 in 2000 to 42 per 1000 live births in 2017, and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) reduced by 38% from 38 to 23 per 1000 live births during this period. There were 1.04 million under-5 deaths in India in 2017, of which 0.57 million were neonatal deaths, down from 2.24 million under-5 deaths including 1.02 million neonatal deaths in 2000,"" says the study published on Tuesday./Air pollution is also found to have killed about 9% of the under-5 children in 2017 when data for the papers was collated./The two papers on child survival are published under the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, and have the first comprehensive estimates of district-level trends of child mortality in India from 2000./""It is not like we have not made any gains in the past 20 years. We have. In fact, neonatal mortality rate has reduced by 38% during these years and same goes for under-5 mortality rate that has seen nearly 50% reduction. The government has been focusing a lot on maternal and child care, and we are seeing results,"" said Dr Rakhi Dandona, Public Health Foundation of India, one of the lead authors of the study./""However, what this study also shows is that India now needs to have an area-specific plan in place to reduce child deaths as no two states have the same problem and that is why the solution that worked in one state may not work in another. The study has in detail mentioned the risks and other issues that individual states face, and solutions will have to be created accordingly,"" she added./Although the child mortality and child growth failure indicators have improved substantially across India from 2000 to 2017, the inequality between districts has increased within many states, and there are wide variations between the districts of India./""There is a silver lining to finding variations within states as it assures that the government is willing to work and has found appropriate solutions to problems they face at the local level, and one district improving exceedingly well means there are workable solutions that can be implemented in other districts, and because it's the same state, could show similar results,"" she said./Uttar Pradesh and Bihar continue to lag behind. The highest number of under-5 deaths in 2017 was in Uttar Pradesh (312,800 which included 165,800 neonatal deaths) followed by Bihar (141,500 which included 75,300 neonatal deaths)./The NMR is a bigger concern for India as almost 60% districts need higher NMR reduction to individually meet the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets. The SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. The SDGs were set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly, and intended to be achieved by 2030./As per the global SDG target, NMR has to be brought down to 12 per 1000 live births universally by 2030. India's current NMR remains around 23 per 1000 live births./""Given the inequalities in the burden and reductions in neonatal mortality across Indian districts, a more granular approach at the district level to determine the strategies for improving newborn survival is needed. Without doubt, continuum of care has to be the pivot around which newborn and child survival strategies must revolve but to homogenize all continuum of care strategies and move them all in tandem is a challenge given the varied implementation capacities of states and districts. We must continue to strive to saturate the continuum of care strategies not only in quantity but also in quality. But in regions with high mortality burden, prioritised interventions should be the focus in the short term along with the holistic continuum of care interventions,"" said Dr Siddartha Ramji, professor of pediatrics and neonatology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi./The top three causes of neonatal mortality continue to remain preterm birth, birth asphyxia (suffocation) and trauma, and lower respiratory infections, followed by congenital birth defects./The top three causes of under-5 mortality have been lower respiratory infections, preterm birth, and diarrhoeal diseases, followed by birth asphyxia and trauma./Experts said nutrition for prospective mothers is crucial. ""The nutritional status of young girls is very important as they are going to be future mothers and they need adequate nourishment to avoid complications later on during pregnancy. If not during adolescence, they should at least start taking balanced meals once they get married. It helps to have a well-nourished body before one conceives. As we have seen, by the time women know they are pregnant, and access medical care, it is already about 10 weeks, and by then the cells of the baby have formed. Chances of complications are high in malnourished pregnant woman and the newborn is likely to be malnourished too,"" said Dr Hemalatha R, director, National Institute of Nutrition./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Lockdown spells cleaner air with stubble burning at lowest in 5 yrs,"India, May 16 -- The heavily polluted Indo-Gangetic plains have recorded the lowest agriculture residue burning this year since 2016, satellite images from US space agency NASA have shown./Researchers and government officials said of the several reasons behind the decline in the springtime farm fire count could be the nationwide lockdown after the outbreak of Covid-19./""Springtime fire activities (mostly agricultural) over the Indo-Gangetic Plain have been the lowest this year in comparison to the last five years during the Covid-19-led lockdown period,"" Hiren Jethva, a researcher from Universities Space Research Association at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, tweeted on Saturday./Although the National Capital Region gets engulfed in smoke from stubble burning during the winter season, particularly in the villages of Haryana and Punjab, rabi crop residues are also burnt during this time of the year across north India. Air pollution is, however, much lower during summer because of favourable meteorological conditions such as strong winds./Graphs and data tweeted by Jethva showed that while in 2016 the cumulative fire count between April 15 and May 15 was around 70,000, in 2020 the figure has come down to around 10,000 during the same period across various north and central Indian states located in the plains. In 2019, the fire count registered a rise, the data shows./Top officials from the state pollution control boards of Punjab and Haryana confirmed that there has been a sharp drop in stubble burning incidents this year till date./""In 2019 there were around 5,768 such incidents in Haryana till May 15. In 2020 we have recorded around 2,430 incidents. The lockdown effect could be one reason. A clearer picture will emerge when the harvest is completed by the end of May and we take the final survey,"" said S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board./""We have seen the NASA maps and analysed fire counts in the National Capital Region. There is definitely a decline in such incidents. The restrictions during the all-India lockdown and the shortage of labour could be the reasons,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi./Though Jethva suggested lower crop volumes could be an additional factor for the decline in stubble burning, government officials said the harvest has been good this year./The reasons notwithstanding, the fall in air pollution levels should come as welcome news. As HT has reported earlier, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can cling to air pollutants. Tests conducted in Italy have found the same. Also, air pollution is likely to be a major risk factor for coronavirus disease mortality, scientists have concluded./""There has been a definite decline in the number of fire incidents. The reasons behind this need to be verified -- whether it is because of the shortage of labour, whether crop yield is low this time or some other reason. This could provide some vital inputs for future planning,"" said Sagnik Dey, coordinator of the Center of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA) and associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Lockdown made Delhi's poor poorer, but led to behavioural change, say researchers","India, May 16 -- Mask usage in Delhi's slum clusters quadrupled, frequent hand-washing became nearly universal and time spent indoors doubled compared to the pre-Covid-19 period, according to a working paper on behavioural change and job loss during the lockdown./Nine out of 10 respondents reported they weren't smoking but it hasn't been assessed whether most of them are non-smokers or quit smoking because of the Covid-19 crisis./The findings of the working paper, by researchers at the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago and the University of British Columbia, are based on a survey of 1,392 respondents in Delhi's slum clusters engaged in different professions, including construction workers, drivers, salaried workers, skilled labourers, domestic workers, and street vendors./The impact of the lockdown on their income and employment has been unprecedented, the researchers found./Their weekly income dropped by 57% on an average, as working days were reduced by 73%. By early May, weekly income had fallen to zero for nine out of 10 of the respondents. Around 35% of the sample reported accessing Delhi government's food assistance programme./The Delhi government set up more than 500 assistance centres across the city to provide food (rice and dal) to those who needed it. These centres appear to have been well placed, as the average distance between individuals in the sample and the nearest government assistance centre is only 640 metres, researchers found./The same team of researchers were studying the impact of air pollution on residents in slum clusters for the past 1.5 years, which is why they had pre-Covid-19 data for preventive measures such as wearing masks./During the first week of November last year, the Delhi government distributed five million masks to help people defend themselves against PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles), concentrations of which often surpassed 300 micrograms per cubic metres, which is 30 times higher than the WHO standard./Researchers found mask usage had increased in the weeks following the government's distribution of masks but it did not reach 35% of the sample. In contrast, it has become nearly universal during the Covid-19./""If we want to understand what came out of the lockdown, one potential benefit is behaviour change. But we have to see if people can continue this for at least a couple of years till a vaccine or treatment is available,"" said Ken Lee, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in India (EPIC India) and the lead author of the study../""The impact of the lockdown on people's incomes has been massive. About 35% of the sample reported accessing food assistance, which is quite high because you would assume that many will not need food assistance. Our sample mainly consisted of people who earned on average Rs 3,000 a week. But this highlights that food assistance mitigated a crisis. The Delhi government should scale up this scheme.""/The paper found these behavioural changes were mainly driven by extreme fear and widespread media coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic./Researchers used Facebook mobility data to find that intra-city movement dropped by 80%, immediately following the Janata curfew till May./Compliance with public health directives will decide how cities can gradually emerge out of lockdowns./""Future decisions to implement extreme social distancing mandates will involve complex trade-offs between the costs of higher infection rates in a world that remains open, and the economic and non-economic costs in one that is periodically closed. A key factor influencing this trade-off is the extent to which people follow the public health directives,"" the paper concluded./Dileep Mavlankar, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhi Nagar, said: ""Behaviour change cannot be sustained with hunger, so that needs to be addressed. Also, most workplaces like shops and restaurants do not provide toilet or other facilities to staff./""Work places have to provide masks, water and soap for hand-washing. Alcohol is very expensive. Also, in behavioural science, there is the ABC theory which stand for antecedents, belief and consequences. So the behaviour change needs to be reinforced through consequences like congratulating the person for wearing a mask and hand-washing or negative feedback for not doing so.""/Banita Paik, a domestic worker who lives in Tughlakabad village, which is a containment zone, said, ""All of us (family of four) bought masks from a medical store immediately after the lockdown began.

Lockdown helps city breathe easy,"Mumbai, May 23 -- Researchers have found that the average concentration of most pollutants in the city's air fell during the first three phases of the lockdown (from March 25 to May 18). An analysis of pollutant data available from the monitoring stations of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), done by Urbanemissions.info, found that the levels of five out of six pollutants were lower in the last two months, as compared to pre-lockdown levels./Urbanemissions.info, an air pollution research group, studied the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) over the 54 days of lockdown, divided into three phases. The first phase of the lockdown was from March 25 to April 14; the second, from April 15 to May 3; and the third, from May 4 to May 17. Levels were compared with a 30-day average (February 20 to March 22) during the pre-lockdown period. While levels for most pollutants dipped, SO2 saw a spike during lockdown./Average levels of PM2.5 - breathable particulate matter of 2.5 micron size or smaller - fell from 45 microgrammes per cubic metre (ug/m3) during pre-lockdown to 27.8 ug/m3 during the first phase and then to 23.3 ug/m3 and 22.6 ug/m3 in second and third phases respectively. A similar trend was observed for CO and O3. The most substantial decline was witnessed for NO2 - produced by burning of coal, oil, and emissions from vehicle - which fell from pre-lockdown levels of 37.5 ug/m3 to 9.8 ug/m3 during the first phase; 7.3 ug/m3 in the second; and rose to 9.8 ug/m3 in the third./Sarath Guttikunda, founder and director, Urbanemissions.info, said, ""In Mumbai, most of the traffic was down, which followed up with reduction in dust resuspension. Emissions from the construction sector were not there while residential open waste burning was limited. Light industry operations too were not there while migration of most low-income groups resulted in reduced biofuel emissions from cooking.""/However, the levels of SO2 - a colourless gas with pungent odour and taste that causes respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema - spiked during the lockdown. While it fell from 15.4 ug/m3 pre-lockdown to 12.5 ug/m3 during the first phase, a surge was seen during the second (24.6 ug/m3) and third phases (36.2 ug/m3). A marginal spike in PM10 (larger, coarser particles) was also witnessed during the third phase of the lockdown./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India's lockdown encouraged life-saving behavioural changes. Make them last,"India, May 25 -- It's been about two months since the start of the world's largest coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown - in India. For millions of migrant workers across the country, it has resulted in a humanitarian crisis. But it has also been devastating for the non-migrant and urban poor, many of whom have lost their incomes./The economic costs of the lockdown have been enormous, but there may have been one benefit: People did their best to comply with public health directives. They wore masks, washed their hands regularly, and followed basic social distancing guidelines. These behaviours can slow the spread of the coronavirus, ultimately saving lives. As the Indian economy gradually reopens, we cannot afford these behavioural gains to be lost, even as the novelty of the pandemic fades./At the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in India (Epic India), we have studied the impacts of the lockdown for a representative sample of mostly poor, non-migrant workers in Delhi. Our study documents large declines in employment and income. Over the first seven weeks of the lockdown, weekly income dropped by nearly 60%, on average. Daily wage workers were hit hardest first, followed by salaried workers - perhaps as it became clear that the lockdown will be extended. The situation worsened over time. By early-May, nine out of 10 survey respondents reported that their weekly income has fallen to zero./The reduction in employment and earnings is no surprise. What truly stands out in our data, however, is the widespread compliance with public health directives. Compared to pre-coronavirus levels, mask usage increased from 20%, at the height of the most recent air pollution crisis, to 90%; time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95%, and regular hand-washing became nearly universal. We need to view these types of behaviours, important in limiting the spread of the virus, as some of the hard-fought gains of this long and costly lockdown./This week, lockdown restrictions have been eased across the country. In Delhi, the intra-city movement is on the rise again. As some semblance of normalcy returns to everyday life, a few actions should be prioritised. First, the government should not only maintain but be prepared to expand its food assistance and relief efforts. In our data, a third of respondents reported benefiting from the Delhi government's food assistance services, suggesting that these relief centres may have lessened some of the hardships caused by the lockdown. For many, it is not clear when employment will return, and with infections on the rise, these services should be continued./Second, we need to ensure that maximum public awareness of Covid-19 is maintained so that the behavioural changes achieved during this lockdown do not fade away. Most importantly, everyone will need to wear a mask at all times. This is crucial in densely-populated cities like Delhi, where maintaining a physical distance is often impossible./To keep the infection rate as low as possible, masks should not only be mandatory, they should also be free. In the current situation, wearing a mask generates positive externalities. The government should find ways to support private-sector investments to scale up domestic mask production and subsidise it for most./Some state governments have already introduced compulsory mask policies and penalties for non-compliance. Although this may be effective at the moment, the opportunity for authorities to selectively enforce such rules could end up causing more harm. Instead, we need to leverage the behavioural habits adopted so far to establish lasting social norms that encourage widespread and proper mask usage (for example, masks should not be worn hanging off the chin). Perhaps India's leaders, social influencers, and celebrities can play a role in promoting such norms./Some argue that producing so many masks has environmental costs and, so, people should just make their own using standard materials found at home. But the effectiveness of Do It Yourself (DIY) masks in reducing the spread of Covid-19 is not clear. Until a vaccine is both available and widely administered, which could take years, it will be important to make sure that people wear high-quality, hospital-grade masks./The lockdown bought the government and the people valuable time to prepare for Covid-19's rise, and probably also prevented countless deaths. We do not yet know whether the total benefits of the lockdown - flatter curve, life-saving behaviours and such - will outweigh the massive economic and humanitarian costs. The battle has only begun, and the final outcome will depend on whether some of the key gains from this lockdown-in terms of public awareness and public health compliance-will persist into the future./Kenneth Lee is an economist and executive director, Epic India.

Parisar urges PMC to set up Clean Air Committee for Pune,"PUNE, May 29 -- Civil society organisations and citizens have urged Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad to set up the Clean Air Committee for Pune which has been mandated under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)./Launched in January 2019, NCAP requires review committees to be set-up at the state and city levels./Sharmila Deo, air quality (AQ) coordinator at Parisar said that a budget of Rs 10 crore has already been allocated by the environment ministry for this purpose. ""The funds are for sweeping machines, tree plantation, electric crematorium, and awareness on air quality. There have been no expenses so far till date,"" she said./After the Covid-19 lockdown was declared there was a substantial reduction in the PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels in most of the cities across India. In Pune, PM 2.5 dropped by 32%, PM 10 by 31% and NOx (nitrogen oxides) by 63%, said Deo./PM 2.5 are fine particulate matter of 2.5 microns which come from motor vehicles, residential and agricultural burning while PM 10 are dust, pollen, mould and particles. NOx emissions result from combustion of fuel and result in vehicular pollution./Deo said, this reduction in pollution levels can clearly be attributed to reduction of vehicles on the road, stopping of construction activity, and minimal open burning./""The city needs to be able to calculate emissions from each of the major sources. While Pune already has 10 air quality monitors set-up by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), four by Pune Cantonment Board, and 50 low-cost monitors installed by the Smart City Corporation, there is no common platform where this data is integrated to enable the city to take informed decisions to reduce air pollution,"" Deo said./Forecasts can also help citizens take precautions when air quality is predicted to worsen, and the city can take short-term actions to mitigate pollution in such an event, she added./Deo pointed out that air pollution is responsible for around 4.2 million deaths globally each year mainly due to heart disease, respiratory problems, and stroke. It impacts all age groups, from senior citizens to youth, young children to even unborn babies. It affects body organs like liver, kidneys and even affects mental health./Ranjit Gadgil, programme director Parisar, said that cities like Nagpur and Nashik have already set up these committees and convened meetings under them. ""It is high time that Pune forms this committee and effective measures are taken through it. The committee should comprise various stakeholders like the PMC, State Pollution Control Board, doctors, air quality experts, Traffic department, Regional Transport Officer, and civil society organisations,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Covid norms to shape Delhi's next Master Plan,"India, June 3 -- Covid-19 norms, including social distancing and better preparedness to tackle pandemics, will be among the key focus areas of the Capital's next master plan (Master Plan of Delhi-2041) - a blueprint for city's urban development - prepared by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), according to two people familiar with the matter./DDA has asked the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which has been tasked to draft MPD-2041, to incorporate post-Covid norms while planning for housing, mobility and public spaces in the next master plan. It has also asked NIUA to factor in pandemics and new kind of threats while reworking the city's disaster management strategy, the people said./A meeting in this regard was held a few days ago between DDA and NIUA officials, said a senior DDA official involved in the master plan preparation who asked not to be named. ""The issues that were discussed included incorporating Covid norms in future planning,"" he said./Until last year, air pollution topped the focus areas for MPD-2041. However, after the breakout of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), DDA officials said the current challenge also has to be considered while making the master plan. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way we live; social distancing and protective gear are the new normal now. Now we will have to rethink about the future development in Delhi keeping in mind the post-Covid norms and the emerging situation,"" said the DDA official cited above./Delhi reported 1,513 infections on Wednesday -- the maximum in a day so far -- with the total cases reaching 23,645. With nine more succumbing to the disease in the past 24 hours, the toll was 606, according to the Delhi government's bulletin./NIUA, which has to submit the draft of MPD-2041 by December, is currently in the process to finalise the chapters of MPD-2041, which will govern city's urban planning for the next two decades./""DDA has asked us to review the MPD-2041 preparation incorporating lessons emerging from Covid-19 situation. We have to take into account post-Covid social norms in public spaces, mobility, workplaces and housing while laying out guidelines for city planning,"" NIUA director Hitesh Vaidya said./Urban development experts say that housing, commercial spaces, environment, transport or mobility, disaster management, including pandemics, are some of key areas that need to be re-examined in view of the new challenges posed by the Covid pandemic./The Covid-19 pandemic has put the spotlight on disaster management strategy in the master plan, which was largely about earthquakes and floods so far. ""Based on the learnings from Covid-19, we should also look into disaster management strategy for Delhi and include this new threat. Till now, the focus has been only on flood and earthquakes,"" Vaidya said./In the past two decades, Delhi has witnessed outbreaks of diseases such as dengue, H1N1 (another pandemic in 2010) and now Covid-19. However, the current master plan is silent on pandemics. With Sars-CoV-2 virus bringing parts of the world to a halt, experts say the master plan of big cities should have a chapter on pandemic resilience./""Every city should have a plan to deal with pandemics, we can't be caught unawares. The master plan should also focus on benchmarking health infrastructure,"" said R Srinivas, senior town and country planner, Town and Country Planning Organisation -- an urban planning body under the ministry of housing and urban affairs./Health care infrastructure has to be an integral part of planning, said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, adding that Delhi doesn't have good secondary level health facilities. ""There are dispensaries and then tertiary care centres. There has to be a secondary level of health care facilities that can take the load off tertiary centres. Currently, there is uneven distribution of hospitals. Areas such as Dwarka and Najafgarh don't have a single big government hospital whereas there are two tertiary care centres in South Delhi-Safdarjung and AIIMS. Similarly, Lok Nayak and GB Pant hospitals are located in close vicinity in central Delhi. The master plan should focus on even distribution of healthcare centres,"" said Dr Kishore./Urban planning experts also said that housing, especially for poor, public spaces, and mobility are some of the areas, which will have to be re-imagined while factoring in the realities of the post-Covid world./Slums clusters and densely populated residential neighbourhoods have emerged as hot spots for Covid-19 in the city. At a time when the Centre and the state governments focus on housing for all, they point out that there is also the need to review housing for poor./""While planning for housing, we will have to ensure density management so that it doesn't lead to crowding, as social distancing has become essential now,"" Srinivas said./AK Jain, a former planning commissioner at DDA, said it is also time to focus on Transit Oriented Development (TOD), which is mentioned in the MPD-2021 but hasn't been implemented, and to increase mixed land use developments. ""Work from home has to be encouraged, especially now. There is a need to push for mixed land use developments were 50% of the space is reserved for commercial activity. The main focus of the MPD should be to ensure that a sizeable population can walk or cycle to work. Focus should be on planned densification,"" said Jain./Anuj Malhotra, mobility expert and knowledge partner to the high-powered committee of the Union ministry of home affairs, said TOD has become extremely relevant in the post-Covid scenario because it addresses both mobility and housing concerns. ""Planned mixed-use development near Metro stations will automatically reduce the number of trips or the need for travel, since it will bring residential and commercial developments in close proximity.TOD is the way forward,"" said Malhotra./DDA officials agreed that fixing mobility would be a challenge./The restriction on the number of passengers in buses and other public transport modes to ensure social distancing, transport experts say, provides an excellent opportunity to address the problem of crowding in public transport in one stroke./""Though these are testing times, it is an opportunity to address the issue of crowding in public transport-one of the main reasons why people avoid using it.. We should ensure that the travelling in public transport remain convenient even after things return to normal. This can be done by prioritising public transport lane so that buses can cover more kilometers. Also infrastructure should be built in such a manner that it takes load off public transport by making it easier and safer to cycle or walk,,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, transport at the Centre for Science and Environment./The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria said, ""The impact pandemics can have on economy and livelihood has become more evident now. Healthcare infrastructure has to be integrated with city planning for better and effective management during pandemics. There is a need to have dedicated setup for outbreak management centres in cities which in normal times can work as regular hospitals.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Covid-19 fallout: NCR remains a concept on paper, as states act in silos","India, June 4 -- The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has exposed the deficiencies in the concept of the National Capital Region (NCR) envisaged in 1985 for coordinated urban development in and around Delhi so that there could be seamless mobility, quality housing, and shared infrastructure, say multiple experts in planning and administration./Over the past month, three of the principal state administrations that make up NCR -- Delhi, UP and Haryana -- have sealed and unsealed borders at will, failed to share or pool health care infrastructure, and not tried to evolve a common strategy in the face of rising Covid-19 cases. Delhi, which has reported 25,004 cases till Thursday, sealed its borders to restrict the number of patients coming in for treatment on Tuesday, just as Noida and Gurugram, which had sealed their borders for weeks despite Delhi letting commuters in, were ready to ease curbs on intercity movement. Noida had 543 cases, while Gurugram reported 1,410 infections by Thursday./This lack of coordination forced the Supreme Court on Thursday to order the Centre to convene a meeting of member states - Delhi, UP, Haryana and Rajasthan - in order to evolve a ""common programme and common portal"" for easing interstate movement in the National Capital Region./The way the concept was developed, however, such a situation was never meant to happen./Capital expansion/NCR was constituted due to a spurt in population growth in the region since 1951, largely due to migration resulting in congestion and shortage of civic amenities, as per the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB)./The aim was primarily to decongest Delhi, and the region came into being in 1985 under the NCRPB. In the 1990s, with the emergence of Noida (New Okhla Industrial Development Authority) and Gurugram, the urban growth accelerated at breakneck speed. What used to be agricultural fields on the Capital's outskirts became the hubs of industry, offices, and housing./With almost invisible borders, Noida carried the promise of affordable housing and easy commute to and from Delhi. ""Noida offered all than an upper-middle class person aspires for. The authority planned at least 150 residential plotted areas and at least 600 group housing colonies in view of high demand,"" said Rajpal Kaushik former chief architect and urban town planner of Noida Authority./While Noida was redefining urban growth on the eastern border of the Capital, business was booming in Gurugram (then Gurgaon) located on its southern border with home-grown carmaker Maruti setting up its plant in the 1980s. Gurugram, a village till then, had vast swathes of barren land and minimal local government. Sensing the potential for industrial and urban growth, private builders such as DLF and Ansal consolidated large tracts of land and soon world class residential condominiums and office spaces sprung up across Gurugram, earning it the tag of ""Millennium City""./Proximity to the Capital and the IGI airport, a large inventory of office space, and the economic liberalisation in the 1990s enabled Gurugram to attract corporate houses, both domestic and multinational, IT companies, BPOs, and Fortune 500 companies to set up base in the city, spurring growth and opportunities./Several industrialists from other Haryana cities such as Hisar, Bhiwani and Jhajjar also came to Gurugram to set up their base, making Udyog Vihar and Manesar industrial hubs./""The National Capital Region is seen as a single economic and social unit where people move seamlessly while working in one corner or city and living in another part. It is also one of the largest integrated economic and social corridors in the world. It attracts the best talent, top corporates who want to work and live here. Real-estate growth has happened to a great extent because of economic growth and opportunities offered by a seamless NCR, which has common ethos and culture. It important to ensure people move with ease in this region,"" said Akash Ohri, senior executive director, DLF./While Noida and Gurugram owe their growth mostly to the economic liberalisation, Ghaziabad in UP and Faridabad in Haryana has been traditional industrial powerhouses of the two states./Today, NCR comprises Delhi and 23 districts from UP, Haryana and Rajasthan and is spread over 55,083 square km. However, the administrative integration has remained largely on paper, with member states working in silos and often sparring over issues such as water sharing, mobility and pollution. A case in point is the fact that the region is yet to evolve a common mobility solution with no reliable public transport, except Metro, to commute across the cities of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram./Mobility issues/Despite existing as a massive urban conglomerate, there was no common, reliable public transport in the region before the Delhi Metro came up. Delhi operates nearly 100 buses for Gurugram, Noida and Bahadurgarh, but Haryana and UP roadways buses can't enter Delhi since they run on diesel, which is banned for public transport in the city since 1998, when the switch to CNG was made./Public transport between NCR cities involving para transit vehicles is even more restricted. As against the 95,000 registered auto-rickshaws in Delhi, only 10,000 have permits to ply from Delhi to NCR cities and vice versa./Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the Capital has put in place some of the ""most relaxed norms"" for transport vehicles coming from other states. ""But we do not get the same treatment from them. For example, we charge no passenger taxes on any bus coming from Haryana or any other adjoining state. But DTC buses have to pay extra passenger tax on routes such as Gurugram or Bahadurgarh. We run the buses despite the high passenger tax which in turn, makes the ticket quite expensive. Since long, we have been demanding abolition of passenger tax so that public transport becomes cheap and affordable and more and more public uses public transport,"" he said./The recent sealing of borders because of Covid-19 has only added to the chaos./The Regional Plan-2021, the second plan prepared by NCRPB, mentions the formation of a unified metropolitan or regional transport authority for NCR./""But the plan has remained on paper. It was to ensure better coordination between various government authorities in the NCR for seamless connectivity and movement of commuters. If this authority was in place, the problems we are facing today would have been easily addressed,"" said PK Sarkar, member of the technical committee of NCRPB./According to a senior NCRPB official, there is a committee of transport secretaries chaired by NCRPB's member secretary which takes up issues related to better coordination between member states./""But the committee has not met during the Covid-19 crisis. There has been no request either from the member states in this regard. All state governments are taking decisions as per their local situation,"" said the official, requesting anonymity./Urban transport experts say that some of the provisions mentioned in the Regional Plan-2021, such as Regional rail Transport (RRTS), development of peripheral expressways (Eastern and Western peripheral expressways), expressway between Ghaziabad and Meerut, expansion of Metro network etc. have been implemented./Sarika Panda Bhatt, a transportation expert based in Gurugram, pointed out that there is a common transport agreement which allows unrestricted movement of vehicles between these states. ""But as it would appear, such reciprocal gestures do not apply during a pandemic,"" she said, pointing out the lack of a coordinated approach during a crisis./A second senior official in the NCRPB, who asked not to be named, said: ""NCRPB is merely a facilitator, and we cannot enforce any regulations. It is up to the states to accommodate each other's challenges. But now we are facing a storm, so everyone has shut their doors and windows to keep themselves safe.""/Satish Mahana, UP's industry minister said, ""As far as the Supreme Court direction on borders is concerned, the state government will take appropriate decision on it.To ensure that office goers or factory workers don't face any problem in commuting our government has directed Gautam Budh Nagar or Ghaziabad to issue passes.""/Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma said the government is aware of problems being faced by the people. ""An industrialist in Faridabad has a factory in Gurugram and transports his goods to Delhi. We can see that people are being inconvenienced. I will speak with the chief minister before taking discussions forward. We have to find a solution that balances protection of both life and livelihood.""/Pollution politics/Every year when the air pollution goes up in the winter months, so does the blame game between NCR states. While Delhi maintains that crop residue burning by farmers in Haryana and Punjab accounts for a bulk of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) pollutants in Delhi's air, the governments of the two states fault Delhi for not doing enough to curb other sources of pollution in the capital. Despite pollution posing a major health emergency for millions, the states are yet to reach a consensus on a common approach and collaborate to tackle the problem./Now, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) regulates and enforces measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across NCR./While referring to the challenges posed by the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease, Sunita Narain, member of EPCA, said the administrations which constitute NCR should go back and remember how they have together tackled air pollution in the past few years,/""NCR is completely interlinked in terms of movement and the air-shed is one. At EPCA, we found that the only way to deal with it was cooperation. There were a lot of times NCR cities such as Gurugram and Bhiwadi came to us questioning why we were locking them down as well under the graded response action plan, despite their pollution levels being fairly lower than Delhi. But, we didn't allow any compromise and it worked only because the entire plan was executed as NCR as a whole,"" Narain said./What is currently happening is not the way to go, she added. ""It is like drawing borders between states right now and it feels like we are drawing international borders. We have been pushing for augmentation of public transport among NCR cities because there is massive to and for Delhi from the neighbouring cities,"" Narain said./Water woes/Politics, protest and posturing have dominated on the issue of sharing water of the Yamuna between Delhi and Haryana. Delhi depends on the Yamuna for most of its water needs and blames the Haryana government for not allowing its share of water to flow in the Munak canal - the main water supply tributary to Delhi. Haryana, on the other hand, alleges that Delhi wants Haryana to part with its share of water./The two states are locked in a legal battle over the issue and the courts have time and again directed the two states to reach a negotiated settlement./(With inputs from Vinod Rajput in Noida and Prayag Arora Desai in Gurugam)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Focus on air, water and waste management","New Delhi, June 5 -- While the climate crisis is the overarching challenge, delineate immediate priorities/With insensitive planning that creates a false binary and prioritises development over environment, weak implementation of the green laws, inefficient and corrupt regulators, and irresponsible civic behaviour, the list of India's environmental challenges is long. At the top of it, of course, is the climate crisis, which cuts across all sectors and has an impact on everyday life. Battling the climate crisis has to be the overarching framework. All laws and rules should be based on that priority and objective. But the World Environment Day also offers an opportunity to look at three, other, more immediate, crises - air pollution; water crisis; and waste management./While the lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) gave us clean air for two months, this was only a short-term gain. With industries opening up and vehicles back on road, it will be business as usual. Come winter, the challenge will intensify. The water crisis is marked by falling groundwater levels, contaminated water bodies, or drying of Himalayan springs. Last year, India committed to phase out the use of single-use plastic by 2022. This will not be easy, and the rising demand for disposable personal protective equipment will add to the challenge. With the country facing an economic downturn due to Covid-19, there will be a temptation to relax environmental norms for industries. But this will be a major mistake. Building back greener will prepare the country for the future./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

There is a crisis in the coal industry | Opinion,"India, June 7 -- The headwinds against the coal industry both domestically and internationally have been evident for some time. Drying up financing for new thermal power plants, private sector announcements of exiting the business, and declining plant load factors have been stoking pessimism about the future of the industry. Despite this, there was hope that the production triumphalism around coal would be accompanied by forward-looking policy measures which would focus on productivity, moderating coal's considerable externalities, and some form of local equity. The recent policy announcements of the Government of India regarding the industry are evidence that these dreams will remain an unfulfilled fiction./The first nail in the coffin was the announcement to do away with mandatory coal washing. In theory, a process like coal washing was supposed to be good for everyone; thermal power plants would have fewer operational problems due to poor coal quality, combustion of washed coal would be better from an emissions and local air pollution perspective, and the unnecessary transport of large amounts of ash and non-combustible material would be minimised. In practice, most consumers of washed coal (both in steel and power) have regretted their decision; they were usually delivered a substandard product for which they had paid a premium. Not surprisingly, much of domestic coking coal today tends to be used for power generation as steel companies prefer to import their coking coal than rely on domestic products. The dream of Indian coal washing had morphed into a nightmare, and the environment ministry's notification was a delayed acceptance of the ground reality./The second nail in the coffin has been the failure of India's coal mine auction mechanism. In the last five years, aggregate production from auctioned mines has remained less than the heights of captive coal mining prior to the Supreme Court's de-allocation decision in 2014. Bringing auctioned mines into production is a three to five-year process, and it is unlikely that the current commercial coal mining regime will ever rival Coal India's established production base. Despite the repeated energetic announcements of introducing competition in the coal industry, the majority of domestic power consumers will continue to remain dependent on Coal India. Very few companies (public sector or private) have been able to match Coal India's ability to navigate the complicated bureaucratic and political hurdles associated with opening new coal mines. Despite all the revisions announced in the stimulus package, new coal mine auctions are unlikely to attract significant domestic or international interest except from the few large players who already exist in the sector domestically. International companies, which have avoided India's coal industry so far because of regulatory and reputational issues, have zero incentive to take new risks in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) world. Smaller Indian companies simply do not have access to credit or cash on hand to open new mines./The third nail in the coffin has been the deliberate weakening of Coal India's financial position. In addition to the usual royalty payments, cesses, taxes, and other fiscal contributions reasonably expected of Coal India, there has been a concerted effort to extract cash from the organisation. Between inflated dividend payments, unnecessary share buybacks, and questionably useful corporate social responsibility contributions, Coal India has transferred tens of thousands of crore to the central government in various ways. Coal India's cash could have been used to further diversify the company, reinvest in new operations, promote research and development for alternative uses of coal (like the coal gasification mentioned in the stimulus package). Coal India could have been strategically repurposed as a vehicle of industrial investment to help coal-bearing regions (where it has operated for 50 years) diversify their economies. Instead, it appears to have become a victim of a larger strategy to weaken the Indian public sector. Not surprisingly, Coal India's market capitalisation is less than a third of what it was in 2014./The fourth and final nail in the coffin has been the spectacular rise of the mine development operator (MDO) mode of mining. Subcontracting of mine operations has been a major feature of the coal industry for more than two decades now. It has also brought considerable financial and operational efficiencies to Coal India. But as the demise of coal mine operator EMTA showed, the MDO model remains rife with problems related to transparency, undue transfer of gains to private entities and a general deterioration of social contract in mining regions. In fact, the retreat of Coal India from the front lines and the increasing use of various forms of subcontracting has led to a much harsher face of mining in India today. The MDO model also creates an incentive mismatch; why would a large mining company take the risks of buying a mine if they could make good money subcontracting for coal block owning public sector units instead?/To be clear, the status of coal as India's energy incumbent in the power sector will not be evaporating any time soon; this will be a decades-long process. But with the coffin nailed tightly shut, it may not be reasonable to have any new dreams about India's coal industry. We might just have to settle for decades of stagnation until its ultimate decline./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

A blueprint to improve health systems in cities,"India, June 10 -- History is replete with examples of disease outbreaks altering cities and changing lives. In 1849, a cholera outbreak in New York's congested clusters prompted it to recalibrate its infrastructure. In 1994, Surat's municipal corporation played a key role in overhauling its sanitary and hygiene systems after the city was hit by the plague. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has again reminded the country that strong and resilient health systems act as the first line of defence, not only against outbreaks but in meeting everyday health challenges./It has underscored the weaknesses, inequities and dearth of investment in urban health infrastructure and serious issues of governance. The pandemic has taken its roots in cities and proven to be the single-most potent disruptive force to the ""engines of economic growth"". States with a higher proportion of urban populations are driving up the numbers. In India, while efforts have been made to create tertiary care facilities at the district level, little has been done to reform municipal bodies in urban areas. It is important to distinguish between the two./Having directed the efforts towards rural India, today the country is faced with the reality of urban health care. About 60% of all hospitalisations in urban India are in the private sector, all of which may not be fully regulated in small, urban slum settlements. While the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM, 2005) was able to address some critical challenges in rural health care, India's cities continue to struggle under the high burden of diseases./During this crisis, a stronger and tiered structure of primary health services in cities could have served as the first points of testing and care, alleviating some of the burden on tertiary systems. While the human and economic cost of this crisis cannot be stressed on enough, it is important that we consolidate the learnings and restructure the system. Here are a set of reforms./One, the National Urban Health Mission (2013) was launched to bring primary health services within the reach of the urban poor. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, modest progress was achieved under this programme, though its potential remains untapped. Now is an opportune time to revisit the programme. Having a strong network of primary and community health centres in cities, as in rural India, can lead to more equitable health outcomes./Two, we need to rethink the Smart Cities Mission. Launched with the objective of promoting cities that provide core infrastructure, currently, building health infrastructure is a low priority in the 100 such cities being developed. A closer scrutiny of data of projects taken up under the mission reveals that only 69 of the 5,861 projects were for health infrastructure and capacity-building - this works out to a little over 1% of the total projects selected since 2015. This is an opportunity to recalibrate this scheme and build sustainable cities, better equipped to handle disease outbreaks./Three, we must remember the linkages between health and other determinants. Families in informal settlements lack a consistent supply of clean water and soap and rely on ill-maintained community toilets and shared taps. With nearly half of Mumbai's population living in squalid conditions that are emerging as clusters for Covid-19, Maharashtra has the highest burden of the disease in the country. The Swachh Bharat Mission has been able to drive shared understanding about the benefits of sanitation - we must expand on this./Even the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation can be leveraged better to ensure proper infrastructure and improved sanitation channels and networks in cities. Similarly, we can link efforts with initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (2019), that align policies against air pollution with those under the country's climate change plan./Four, we must leverage the strong digital infrastructure. There are many examples of how cities are doing so during the pandemic - including the Agra Smart City Mission's e-Doctor Seva, a tele-video consultation facility, launched as a public-private partnership. In Chandigarh, there are ""fight Covid stations"" with thermal screening, pedestal operated hand-wash, soap dispensers. Recent telemedicine guidelines issued by ministry of health and family welfare in collaboration with Niti Aayog and the Medical Council of India, provide for an excellent opportunity to enable health care delivery to the urban poor even beyond the lockdown period. With such use of digital technology, we can manage health facilities more effectively, and ensure better disease surveillance and data collection./And finally, given the high proportion of patients seeking care in the private sector, it's important to harness its large pool of resources so that more people can access quality services. More public private partnerships can ensure better regulation and monitoring so that protocols are followed./As per a Boston Consulting Group estimate (2017), about 40% of India's population will be living in urban areas by 2025. It is imperative that the government re-imagines these spaces to meet the needs of the people. By building or upgrading infrastructure, including a trained workforce, it cannot only address epidemics, but also provide quality health care. India's has the framework, it must act on it./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Low traffic helps speed up Sirhaul U-turn underpass project; likely to be completed by July 31,"Gurugram, June 18 -- The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is likely to complete the U-turn underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza and the flyover at Shankar Chowk by July 31, ahead of the schedule, said officials on Thursday. Once complete, the underpass will allow motorists to take a U-turn at Rajokri to reach Ambience Mall and DLF Phase-3 without having to go all the way to Delhi./The work on the underpass had started on March 5, 2019 while September 4, 2020 was fixed as the deadline. However, a ban on construction last November due to air pollution and the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 24 to contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease had stalled the work on the project twice. Construction resumed on April 30 after the government had announced certain relaxations in the lockdown./NHAI officials said that low traffic volume due to the lockdown helped in construction work as workers did not have keep one eye on vehicular movement or making traffic diversions. On an average, around four lakh vehicles crossed the Sirhaul border on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway daily before the imposition of lockdown, said NHAI officials./Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI, said that almost 80% of the work on the underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza and the flyover at Shankar Chowk is complete. ""The work on the underpass and the flyover project has been on an upswing as the lack of heavy traffic has helped us to singularly focus on construction work. Nearly 75% to 80% of the work has been completed. We are confident of completing the project by July 31,"" he said./Sharma also said that while work on a couple of other NHAI projects in the city had suffered due to the exodus of migrant workers to other states, the contractors at the Sirhaul U-turn underpass and flyover project site were able to retain the construction workers and also get new workers hired. ""The retention of workers and the low traffic flow have helped speed up work. This underpass and flyover are going to significantly reduce traffic congestion at this busy junction"", he said./The length of the U-turn underpass is 377 metres. It has a 559-metre-long and 7-metre-wide service road. The designated speed in this underpass is set at 40kmph, said Sharma./The flyover at Shankar Chowk, on the other hand, will help traffic coming from the Cyber City to cross the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and turn towards Delhi. This grade-separated flyover has been designed for a motorable speed of 30kmph. It will be 455 metre-long with three lanes on each side./The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs.161 crore and it is being built as a part of the plan to reduce congestion on highways across the National Capital Region./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Skinners stop lifting carcasses, epidemic fears in dairy complexes","Ludhiana, June 22 -- Even as the coronavirus pandemic rages, there are fears of another disease outbreak at the Tajpur and Haibowal dairy complexes as skinners, protesting against the fine imposed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), have gone on strike and refused to lift animal carcasses./At least 70 carcasses, including those of buffalos, cows, oxen and calves, are lying at both dairy complexes and decomposing rapidly due to hot weather conditions./According to dairy owners, the skinners stopped lifting carcasses on Saturday. If the carcasses were not removed from dairies, another epidemic would break out in the city./Concerned over the situation, dairy owners met mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu on Monday over the issue./President of the Tajpur Road Dairy Association DS Oberoi said that dead animals have been lying in the dairies since Friday. The problem will aggravate soon after carcasses will start decomposing. They would meet the deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to intervene in the matter./The NGT had issued notices to skinners in March this year, following which they had stopped working in protest. However, following an assurance of mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, they had again started lifting the carcasses./A skinner, Happy Kainth, said five families are involved in dumping carcasses in Ladhowal near the Sutlej. Following a complaint of a local, the NGT formed a committee. After the committee submitted a report, the NGT imposed a fine of Rs 2.28 crore on each family./The NGT had also ordered them to stop dumping carcasses near the Sutlej as it led to water as well as air pollution./Happy added, ""As we have no resources to pay the fine, we stopped lifting carcasses from the city.""/""We usually lifted 40 to 50 carcasses daily from dairies and nearby villages and disposed of them at the carcass dumping ground. Now, we have been forced to stop lifting carcasses,"" said Suraj./Paramjit Singh Bobby, chairman, Haibowal Dairy Complex, said they are holding a meeting with skinners to resolve the issue to save the situation./Mayor Sandhu said dairy farmers raised the issue with him on Monday./""We would not allow people to cause any kind of pollution, but we cannot let the carcasses decompose in dairies. I have asked the MC to complete the carcass plant at Noorpur Bet, which is already under construction, as soon as possible,"" said the mayor./""I have also asked dairy owners and skinners to hold a meeting to resolve the issue. We will try to find a permanent solution of the problem later,"" he added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How the world's strictest lockdown affected India,"India, June 23 -- The preferred first step to control Covid-19 by most countries was a lockdown. On March 25, when India had reported only 500 cases, the country went into what was one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. This first set of curbs remained in place till April 14 and was extended four times, each time with gradual relaxations. The rest of the world adopted different models./STRATEGIES/An analysis of countries with the highest Covid-19 cases shows most of them have not relaxed lockdowns without a decline in daily cases. In fact, some continue with the strictest measures even after several days of fall in cases or have only reduced the stringency marginally. Those who haven't followed these two paths seem to find it difficult to continue reducing daily cases. To be sure, this could also mean that a lockdown, although necessary, isn't a sufficient enough measure to contain the infection./On June 18, 15 countries with the most Covid-19 cases in descending order were: United States, Brazil, Russia, India, United Kingdom, Spain, Peru, Italy, Chile, Iran, Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, Mexico, and France. Most of these 15 countries can be categorised into two groups based on the daily number of cases (we consider a seven-day rolling average to smooth out daily fluctuations): those with a rising number of cases, and those that have seen a decline in daily cases./The former group comprises India, Pakistan, and three of Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Of these five countries, India and Pakistan imposed the harshest lockdowns. The stringency index - a number given by the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker to the harshness of the lockdown imposed - of India's March 25 lockdown was 100. The highest number recorded for Pakistan was 96. These two countries also relaxed the lockdown the most without the infection slowing its spread. The number hovered around the 80 mark for Brazil, Mexico, and Chile. The former two relaxed the lockdown marginally recently, while Chile made it slightly more stringent./Countries that have seen a significant decline from the peak of their daily cases - viz. rest of the countries excluding Iran - have also reduced the stringency of their lockdowns only after a consistent decline, or have made no or minor relaxations. The latter group includes the United States, which officially made no relaxations; and Turkey and United Kingdom, which gave a marginal relaxation. In the US, however, the strictness number is 72.7./France, Spain, Italy, and Germany have given more relaxations, but only after the peak. Russia, which relaxed its lockdown marginally in the middle of the peak, has seen its number of daily cases stagnate. Saudi Arabia, 16th on the list of countries with the highest cases on June 18, relaxed its lockdown very fast after the cases peaked, and has seen a second wave. So has Iran, which imposed a less strict lockdown to begin with, and has since made only a small reduction in the stringency./Though there is no consensus on, or way to determine, which strategy is the best, a few things are clear: it's a good idea to impose lockdowns early, make them as strict as possible, and from a spread of disease standpoint, lift them only after the peak. To be sure, factors such the cost of the lockdown - higher for developing than developed countries - may not always allow this. India is a case in point because it imposed the earliest and strictest lockdown, but eased restrictions before cases peaked./()/NATURAL RELIEF/One good thing the restrictions brought was a breath of fresh air, literally. As people stayed at home, factories, cars, buses fell silent, giving the planet a much-needed (albeit temporary) relief. The air quality in Delhi - notorious for air pollution - improved. The average of PM2.5 concentrations was far better in 2020 compared to 2019 in the period of the lockdown. PM2.5 refers to particles with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers in the air./As the lockdown began to be eased from the second half of May, PM2.5 concentration in Delhi nearly went back to 2019 levels. To be sure, even in the lockdown period, air pollution in the city wasn't always better than that in 2019. For example, in the April 13 to April 17 period, the concentrations were near the ""good"" and ""satisfactory"" range both in 2019 and 2020. This could have occurred last year because there were rains in this period, which might have cleared the air of pollutants./EMPLOYMENT/Data from the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) shows the unemployment rate in India rose to 23.8% in the week ended March 29 - the week when the lockdown was introduced - from 8.4% in the preceding week. This was the highest unemployment rate since the survey started in 2016. This was accompanied by a drop in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) - the share of people looking for work - to 39.2%, the lowest since the survey began. Although these numbers are not to be taken at face value - CMIE reported problems in data collection in the lockdown -they do indicate the direction of two things. One, people stopped looking for work due to the lockdown. Two, a higher than usual share of people looking for work didn't find any./As the lockdown progressed, LFPR continued to drop and reached its lowest level in the week ending April 19, when the lockdown was slightly reduced. LFPR recovered to 38.7% in the last two weeks of May - the last phase of the lockdown. The unemployment rate has, however, not followed the trajectory of the stringency of the lockdown as much as LFPR. Although it did reach a high of 27% in the week ending May 3, when the second phase of the lockdown ended, it mostly hovered around the 24% mark for most of the lockdown period, dropping to 20.2% only in the last phase of the lockdown./()/POWER DEMAND/As most activity dropped across the country in the weeks following March 25, the demand for power fell as well, according to data gathered by the Brookings India Electricity and Carbon Tracker. An analysis of this data shows that in the first week of March 2020, the demand for power saw an average drop of 1.2% compared to the same period in 2019. In the week between March 25 and March 31, at an average the year-on-year demand for power fell 31.4%, the data shows./In the final week of May, which corresponds with the end of the fourth phase of the lockdown, the average demand for power saw a marginal rise, though it still remained 17.3% below the average demand in the same time period last year./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

UEPPCB approves state fuel policy; petcoke to be banned as fuel in state by March 2024,"India, June 26 -- The Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) has approved the State Fuel Policy (SFP) in a bid to reduce air pollution in the hill state over the next few years./SP Subudhi, member-secretary, UEPPCB, said that the Board has decided to ban the use of carbon-rich petroleum coke, or petcoke, as a source of fuel because it has been found to be one of the biggest sources of air pollution./The Board had approved SFP in mid-June./""The policy focuses on which fuel will be allowed as far as industries are concerned. Petroleum coke and furnace oil are likely to be banned in the state by March 2024,"" said Subudhi./Petcoke is a final solid byproduct that derives from the oil-refining process and is rich in carbon. It is also a byproduct of bitumen-based synthetic crude oil./Petchem is an environmental concern because of its rich carbon content that leads to a spike in the emission of greenhouse gases./Though initially, the plan was to roll out the ban of these pollutants over the next two years, the industry associations demanded relief for an additional two years because of the economic downturn induced by the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, Subudhi added./SFP allows the use of coal, wood, pine needle, and agricultural waste./The state government will also be promoting the use of less-polluting sources of fuel such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), piped natural gas (PNG), high-speed diesel (HSD), bio-gas, bio-fuel, refused derived fuel (RDF), etc./The Board has asked all districts to form an environmental action plan for air, water, and solid waste management, which will be later be incorporated in a comprehensive green action plan for the hill state./The district authorities have been tasked to find out the availability of infrastructure, ecological awareness among local people, identifying gaps and how they can be bridged./""The ultimate goal is to become carbon neutral. There are 14 thematic areas that have been notified by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) such as air and water pollution, solid waste management, bio-medical waste management, hazardous waste, polluted river stretches, industrial pollution, among others, which will figure prominently in the state's comprehensive action plan,"" Subudhi added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Vehicular density linked to rise in nitrogen oxide levels in Chandigarh: Study,"Chandigarh,, July 5 -- Nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels are increasing in the city due to higher vehicular density, reveals a study by the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on air quality in the last 25 years./NOx are a group of toxic gases that contribute to the formation of aerosols and ozone that can worsen respiratory conditions and cause other health problem./The study showed a 68.2 % and 165.2% increase in NOx concentration at commercial and industrial sites, respectively, in 2018 as compared to 2000. This can be linked to increased vehicular emissions./The study titled Air pollution trend in Chandigarh city situated in Indo-Gangetic Plains: Understanding seasonality and impact of mitigation strategies has been authored by Ravinder Khaiwal (department of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER), Tanbir Singh and Suman Mor (department of environment studies, Panjab University) and Vivek Pandey (Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee)./Increasing trend at all locations/""As in the year 2011, vehicle number has increased by 270%. Similarly, the concentration of NOx is showing an increasing trend at all the locations in Chandigarh,"" the study reads./Chandigarh has the highest vehicular density (878 registered motor vehicles per thousand persons) in India due to which vehicular emissions can be considered as one of the primary sources of background air pollution here./The study has also shown higher particulate matter (PM) 10 concentration (which are inhalable and hazardous to health) in winter as compared to monsoon as air quality deteriorates during December due to crop-residue burning and meteorology./More pollution in winter/Winter of 2018 had the highest PM10 levels, and the concentration decreased by 28 to 47% during monsoon./As per United Nations Environmental Protection Agency, ""Breathing air with a high concentration of NO2 can irritate airways in the human respiratory system. Such exposures over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing), hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms.""/According to the study, air pollutants show strong seasonal variability having a higher concentration in post-monsoon and winter season, which was found to be linked with activities such as crop residue burning and use of solid biomass fuel for cooking and other purposes./Besides, industrial and commercial sites show a statistically declining trend of PM10. In industrial areas, the reason could be attributed to stricter implementation of air pollution control policies. At commercial sites, moving of interstate bus terminals has restricted movement of diesel buses and cleaner air./The study underlines the need for stringent action to control air pollution due to non-exhaust emissions, municipal solid waste, and crop residue burning to minimise public health and climate risk/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Average global temperature could rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius in next 5 years: WMO,"India, July 9 -- At least one or more months during the next five years will be 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned on Thursday./A 1.5 degrees Celsius rise in average temperature over pre-industrial times is the threshold beyond which many regions, including India, will record extreme temperatures; increases in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy rainfall and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had flagged last year in its special report titled, ""Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees""./WMO in its Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update for 2020-24, released on Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland, said the annual global temperature is likely to be at least 1 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels (defined as the 1850-1900 average) in each of the coming five years and is very likely to be within the range of 0.91 - 1.59 degrees Celsius./This year, large land areas in the northern hemisphere are likely to be over 0.8 degrees Celsius warmer than the average temperature in the 29-year period between 1981 and 2010./This year, the Arctic is also likely to have warmed by more than twice as much as the global mean, the report said./The Copernicus Climate Change Service reported an exceptionally warm spring in western Siberia, with higher-than-average surface air temperatures throughout May and June and up to 10 degrees Celsius higher than normal in May. The average monthly temperature over the entire area was more than 5 degrees Celsius higher than normal, which breaks the record for the previous two warmest Junes - 2018 and 2019 - by more than one degree Celsius. The maximum temperature in the Arctic was recorded on June 20 at 37 degrees Celsius./The smallest temperature change is expected in the tropics and in the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere./""The WMO annual report indicates that we might be hitting the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark in some of the months in the next five years. The report suggests that the smallest temperature change is expected in the tropics and in the mid-latitudes. This should not mislead us,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune./""Considering that the mean temperatures over the tropics are high, even a small increase in temperature can result in major impacts. For example, the recent climate change assessment report for India shows an observed change of 0.7 degrees Celsius in average temperatures over India. As a response to the local and global temperature rise, we already see a spike in extreme weather events over the region. Rainfall patterns have changed, with longer dry spells intermittent with heavy rainfall events. The frequency of very severe cyclones has increased over the Arabian Sea. Over the Himalayas, the glacier retreat is going at a fast pace. Glacier melt and ocean warming are raising the sea level across the Indian Ocean,"" he added./This year many parts of South America, southern Africa, and Australia are likely to be drier than the recent past. Over the 2020-24 period, sea-level pressure (atmospheric pressure at mean sea level) anomalies suggest that the northern North Atlantic region could have stronger westerly winds leading to more storms in western Europe./For India, the consequences of failing to keep warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius would include severe heat-stress in megacities along with high air pollution levels; sea-level rise induced saltwater intrusion in coastal areas and increased vulnerability to disasters in high mountain eco-systems, IPCC scientists had projected last year./Regions at disproportionately higher risk of severe climate impacts from a 1.5 degrees Celsius include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states, and least developed countries, according to IPCC./""This study shows - with a high level of scientific skill - the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" said Petteri Taalas, secretary-general, WMO./""While coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems, and economies for centuries, governments should use the opportunity to embrace climate action as part of recovery programmes and ensure that we grow back better,"" he added./The Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update is led by the United Kingdom's Met Office, which uses computer models from leading climate centres around the world to make projections annually for policymakers./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"More returnees, respiratory disorders, weather conditions contribute to increased Covid-count in Valley","JAMMU,, July 11 -- Apart from the large number of returnees in Kashmir, population, lifestyle diseases and weather conditions are responsible for the spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths in Kashmir valley, which has comparatively fared worse than the Jammu region./Both regions have 10 districts each. As per the 2011 census, Kashmir has a population of 69.1 lakh and Jammu a population of 53.50 lakh./Till Thursday, Kashmir had recorded 140 deaths and Jammu 14 deaths. Similarly, the Valley had recorded 7,504 positive cases and Jammu 1,997 cases./With a testing rate of 25,000 per million and a doubling rate of 22 days, the Union territory, which has six Covid-testing laboratories, has done remarkably well in tackling the Covid-19 infection./Kashmir director health services Dr Samir Mattoo said, ""Essentially, the people returning to Kashmir are far more and our testing rate is also very high. These are the basic reasons responsible for the increase in Covid-19 cases in Kashmir.""/He, however, also said that weather conditions in Kashmir were also different from Jammu./""In Kashmir, respiratory diseases are also more and of course smoking can also contribute to it,"" he added./Another senior doctor in Jammu said, ""Different factors are responsible for fewer Covid-19 infections and deaths in Jammu as compared to Kashmir. The population of Kashmir is more than Jammu and its climatic conditions are different from Jammu. Lifestyle disorders are also higher in Kashmir. According to a study, their cholesterol levels are high and more people in Kashmir smoke as compared to their counterparts in Jammu,"" he said./DOCTORS OBSERVE INCREASED PREVALENCE OF PULMONARY DISEASE/The doctor referred to a 2018 report published in Lancet, an international medical research journal, which brought the growing prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in J&K to the fore./The report had put J&K among the four top states and UTs in India with 'alarming prevalence' of respiratory diseases./'THE SMOKING CAPITAL'/In J&K, over 4,750 people per lakh suffer from COPD. Besides air pollution, the report had put the onus on a 'staggering' rate of smoking among the people./In 2015, the Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI) had said in its report that J&K was fast emerging as the smoking capital of north India.

The interplay between the pandemic and pollution,"New Delhi, July 17 -- Air quality was gradually gaining political salience in India over the lastfewyears,butthecoronavirus pandemic and the deepening economic recession may now change the speed, and possibly direction, of progress./As the country battles a public health crisis of staggering proportions, we must remind ourselves that we do not have the luxury of tackling air pollution at a later point. Air pollution is a risk factor that, based on current information, has a long-term mortalityandmorbidity burdengreaterthanCovid- 19, given the severity of pollution levels./It also increases the risk of infections such as Covid-19. Although restrictions during the lockdown mechanically led to temporary improvements in air quality, as economic activities resume, air pollution too will return to plague us./In the context of air quality management, our analysis reveals that the disruptions caused by the pandemic, and actions taken in response to these are likely to result in three sets of outcomes, each offering a different call to action: New opportunities to accelerate transitions, dilution of safeguards in theguiseofincentivisingeconomic recovery that need to be contested, and avenues for sustaining recent progress./The first set of outcomes present opportunities to set a new agenda, or provide an impetus to existing policy measures. These opportunities, when harnessed, will allow us to lock-in infrastructure or accelerate behavioural changes that are well-aligned with improved environmental and health outcomes, particularly air quality. We identified five such opportunities./One, providing increased, better-targeted subsidiesaspartofasocialprotection package to allow poor households to use LPG as their primary cooking fuel. This would be consistent with the three LPG cylindersincluded intheGaribKalyanYojana package. Two, sustaining the increased rate of shifting away from paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana due to labour constraints, and ensuring that the alternatives (for example,maize, cotton) are viable for farmers. Three, focusing the demand for vehicle scrappage policies towards the replacement of old, heavily polluting vehicles, especially trucks. Four, retiring old coal power plants so that newer or less polluting plants can meet a larger fraction of power demand, while likely easing the financial crisis in the sector. Finally, increased acceptability and experience with work-from-home and online meetings need to be sustained to reduce commute by private vehicles and taxis./In the second set lie potentially regressive outcomes, which need to be firmly contested./Some of these outcomes arise from the government's efforts to dilute environmental safeguards, formally or informally, while citing the need for urgent economic recovery and improving the ""ease of doing business"". For instance, the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Notification 2020 that is currently under consideration will have massive implications for the country's air quality. It dilutes the process to obtain environmental clearance, reduces the categories of projects and activities that will have to undergo impact-assessment scrutiny, curtails public consultation processes significantly, and proposes procedures to deal with violations that are legallyuntenable,andwilleffectivelyallow environmental offences to be condoned at very little or no cost to the violator./Another example is the government's tacit support to power plants that have failed to comply with the 2015 emission standards by extending the deadlines. The health costsoftheirnon-compliancecannolonger be ignored, and the pandemic cannot become yet another basis for delaying compliance./Finally, the call for greater transparency in monitoring, inspection and enforcement data from the pollution control boards becomes more urgent to ensure dilutions in day-to-day regulation do not go unnoticed./In the third set are areas that we believe will not be directly impacted by the pandemic, but where we need to actively sustain the discourse, develop ideas and make progressonlonger-termsystemicimprovements./The framework of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) needs continued strengthening, in particular on developing uniform processes for identifying non-attainment cities and to track inter-year air quality improvements./ThefirstyearofNCAP(2019-20)washobbled by its modest budget. However, this year, the newly-allocated performancebased grants linked to air quality from the 15th Finance Commission (FC) substantially increases the resources available to the large cities - totalling ~4,400 crore to 42 urban agglomerations with million-plus populations. Effective utilisation of these funds needs significantly greater efforts by stateandmunicipalgovernmentstoengage with civil society in prioritising actions./Further, the grants need to be sustained over the 2021-26 period of the 15th FC, and need to shift - together with NCAP - towards managing air quality at the regional, ""airshed"" level. At the same time, investments in sustainable infrastructure, and improvements in public services that will lead to cleaner air will need to be undertaken in parallel with developing the knowledge base on sources and air quality monitoring./The pandemic has appropriately brought about an urgent response, given the scale of its effects. As we set in motion recoveryplans,wemustremember thatair pollution-linked deaths and disease must also be tackled with the urgency they deserve./Santosh Harish and Shibani Ghosh are fellows at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New Delhi.

MMR's air quality monitoring mechanism takes a hit as most stations go kaput,"India, July 23 -- The densely populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region's (MMR) air quality monitoring mechanism has taken a hit because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak coupled with several monitoring stations have been lying dysfunctional, data showed./Three air quality-monitoring stations, located at Malad, Colaba, and Navi Mumbai, have been dysfunctional for the past week under the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)./While four stations under the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) at Borivali, Worli, Navi Mumbai (Nerul) and Dombivli have not been operational since June./The Borivali station has gone kaput since April 11./""The four stations have reported technical snags pertaining to internet connectivity and power failure. There is also an accessibility issue with the Borivali station because it is located inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Though the data is not being regularly updated on the website, it is being meticulously collated,"" said VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB./SAFAR has been monitoring and forecasting air quality using real-time information from 10 stations in MMR -- the urban agglomeration around Mumbai -- since June 2015./While MPCB launched its air quality-monitoring stations across 15 locations in MMR last year./At present, the overall pollutant-measuring indicator --- air quality index (AQI) -- for Mumbai is done on the basis of an average of seven stations/-- Bhandup, Mazgaon, Borivli, Chembur, Worli, Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), and Andheri -- for SAFAR and 11 stations for MPCB./MPCB data is used to tabulate annual average air quality information made available to the Centre's National Clean Air Program (NCAP), which was launched in January 2019./SAFAR researchers said all three monitoring stations are located near Covid-19 containment zones./""This is the first time we are monitoring air pollution data, when some of our stations are not functioning,' said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR./""We have a team of engineers, who regularly visit these stations to ensure that there are no technical snags. However, the frequency of their regular visits has vastly reduced because of the pandemic. Besides, restrictions are in place since many of these stations are located near or within containment zones. We are hoping that the data will be live again soon,"" he added./HT had reported on April 15 that there were data gaps in MPCB's real-time AQI data, when officials had said the state pollution control board was not listed as an essential service during the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government in end-March in a bid to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak./""Three monitoring stations such as Borivali, Nerul, and Dombivali are located in containment zones, while the Worli station has reported technical glitches. There have been persistent issues with the station at Borivali. Work is in progress to resume the availability of real-time air quality data,"" said an MPCB official, requesting anonymity./Independent researchers have called for the installation of an automated facility for an uninterrupted supply of real-time air-quality data./""By definition, these stations don't need human intervention and they are designed to be operational 24x7. We need to ascertain the causes of these stations going offline and the specific technical snags that are deterrent to their smooth functioning,"" said Ronak Sutaria, an independent air quality expert./On Thursday, Mumbai's AQI was 50, which comes under SAFAR's ""good"" category./The corresponding count for MPCB was 54 or ""satisfactory"". SAFAR has predicted 47, or ""good"" for Friday./""Air quality in Mumbai is likely to oscillate between good and satisfactory level for the next week depending on how much rain the city receives.

Air pollution cuts Indians' life expectancy by 5.2 years: Report,"New Delhi,, July 28 -- Pollution levels in India shave off 5.2 years from the life expectancy of the average Indian and it most acutely hits people living in the Indo-Gangetic plains, according to an assessment by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, which also showed that the situation had slightly improved between 2016 and 2018./India is the second most-polluted country globally after Bangladesh, while Nepal, Singapore and Pakistan are the other top countries with dirty air. The authors use an air quality life index (AQLI), which takes particulate air pollution and determines the hit it has on life expectancy./According to the AQLI, India's yearly average particulate pollution concentration of 63.2 ug/m3 in 2018 reduced life expectancy of the average Indian by 5.2 years. The life expectancy lost in 2016 was 6.1 years when the particulate pollution - which is linked to diseases affecting the lungs and heart - was at 71ug/m3./Also read: The interplay between the pandemic and pollution | Analysis/In 2018, Lucknow's (the most polluted district in the country) residents were exposed to an average annual PM 2.5 concentrations of 114.6 micrograms per cubic metres which is likely to cut short life expectancy by 10.3 years compared./That makes Lucknow the most polluted district in the country followed by 13 other districts, all in Uttar Pradesh./The National Capital Territory of Delhi is the 15th most-polluted region in the country as per the analysis, which relies on satellite data. The average PM 2.5 concentration was 106 micrograms per cubic metres which can lead to loss of 9.4 life years compared to if Delhi had met the WHO guidelines for air quality./The analysis did not include figures from 2019 and 2020./The report, released in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh on Tuesday evening, showed air pollution problem that was severe in India in the late 90's only worsened further in recent years with an estimated life expectancy loss of 3.4 years in 1998, 4.8 years in 2010 and 6.1 years in 2016./China, however, stands out as a success story as per the data. Singapore, China and India were the three most polluted countries in 1998 with the Chinese losing 3.6 years of life to pollution but by 2018, China was the seventh most polluted and had improved its life expectancy by 1.3 years. Singapore has also improved./China declared a ""war against pollution"" in 2013 with some aggressive reforms.

The drive was first launched in September last year. The campaign, Kejriwal said will be launched again from the first week of September during which people would be encouraged to inspect their homes for stagnant water to prevent breeding of mosquitoes./Before his formal speech, Kejriwal shared a video message in which he urged people to take three pledges. ""First, today take the pledge that neither will you give nor accept bribe. Second, pledge against pollution. Do not contribute to pollution - be it air, water or land. Third, keep your city and environment clean. Do not litter,"" he said./Talking about the many firsts which the Capital has seen during the pandemic, Kejriwal said Delhi was the first to introduce the home isolation model in India which further helped in scaling up testing.

"Slowed by Covid, 100 cities must race to reach clean air targets","India, Aug. 18 -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced on the occasion of the 74th Independence Day on August 15 that a clean air programme would be implemented on mission mode in 100 cities soon./But the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) has hardly made any progress since its launch last year./City-level action plans of around 102 cities had been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to meet the NCAP target of 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 (respirable pollution particles) concentrations over the 2017 annual concentration./This year, CPCB has been directing state governments about an immediate implementation of its city-level action plans./For example, CPCB issued a directive to the West Bengal government on June 26 under section 31A (power to issue directions to any authority) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, to implement the city-level action plans and submit a financial layout of each action within 30 days and a progress report on a quarterly basis./NCAP has been done in by the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, resultant lockdown restrictions and financial slowdown./It is staring at an uphill task of ensuring various sectors such as industries, thermal power plants and also manage transportation to reduce emissions by moving towards cleaner processes and fuels./""We have directed the state governments to implement the action plans. Timelines have been given to them and we have sought regular review. The 2024 deadline to achieve the NCAP target is firmly in place,"" said Prashant Gargava, member-secretary, CPCB./Clean air efforts in cities with a million-plus population got a shot in the arm with an allocation of Rs 4,400 crore for 2020-21 from the Union budget, up from Rs 460 crore for air pollution abatement last year./Besides giving a financial boost to cities implementing the NCAP, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said state utilities would be advised to close down old thermal power plants that are found to be non-compliant with emission standards./""The pollution levels in Delhi in the past two-three years have been coming down. Clean air tops our agenda. However, it does not mean that clean air can be achieved by stifling development. A part of it has already been rolled out and the rest of it will be rolled out soon. There is a huge commitment as far as funds are concerned to achieve targets,"" said RP Gupta, secretary, ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC)./Experts said the ministry should have clear indicators of whether they are on track to achieve NCAP targets, else it could be left with dirtier air amid industries' bid to bounce back from the economic impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak./""The NCAP targets have to be met by 2024. It has to be taken very seriously. Covid-19 has helped in achieving the target. The 15th Finance Commission has announced Rs 4,400 crore, which is largely meant for state pollution control boards and urban local bodies. We need performance-based indicators for multiple sectors such as transport, industry etc. For example, the industry sector will need strategies to scale up clean energy transition and high-level emission control systems. We need a policy for that. I don't think it can be addressed only through city-level action plans,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./""Now, most sectors will deal with economic reconstruction. So there should be an alignment of the sectoral budget with the NCAP goals. The government will also need a compliance and deterrence policy to ensure targets are met. Otherwise, we will face a larger pollution problem in the near future,"" added Roy Chowdhury./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air pollution can risk diabetes development, heart attack and stroke","India, Aug. 24 -- In response to air pollution, genome-wide epigenetic changes were compared in a first-of-its-kind study by Indian-origin researcher Sanjay Rajagopalan who found that it can risk diabetes development, heart attack and stroke. From the University Hospitals Harrington in the US, Rajagopalan conducted the study and examined the impact of air pollution after creating an environment that mimicked a polluted day in New Delhi or Beijing./He then found that air pollution can play a role in the development of cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and the cardiovascular effects of air pollution can lead to heart attack and stroke. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes suffered an increase in likelihood on exposure to air pollution, the research team showed./The genome-wide epigenetic changes were compared and contrasted with that of eating an unhealthy diet. The impact of air pollution cessation on these changes were then examined as it was interestingly found by the researchers that being exposed to air pollution was comparable to eating a high-fat diet./Hence, three groups were observed on the mouse model study. These included a control group receiving clean filtered air, a group exposed to polluted air for 24 weeks, and a group fed a high-fat diet./The study was published in the Journal of Clinical. IANS quoted Rajagopalan saying, ""We concentrated fine particles of air pollution called PM2.5. Concentrated particles like this develop from human impact on the environment, such as automobile exhaust, power generation and other fossil fuels.""/The results showed that just like in a pre-diabetic state, insulin resistance and abnormal metabolism was also shown by both the air pollution and high-fat diet groups. Epigenome represents a critical buffer in response to environmental factors as it is a layer of control that can masterfully turn on and turn off thousands of genes. The research team found that changes in the groups' state were associated with changes in the epigenome./The author wrote in the study, ""The good news is that these effects were reversible, at least in our experiments. Once the air pollution was removed from the environment, the mice appeared healthier and the pre-diabetic state seemed to reverse.""/Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Polluted air linked to increase in blood pressure: Study,"India, Aug. 29 -- A seven-year study until 2016 involving 5,300 adult residents of different parts of Delhi found that exposure to polluted air was linked to an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and an enhanced risk of developing hypertension./Out of the randomly selected participants, 3,000 developed hypertension during the study period while the rest were already hypertensive./The study published in the AHA journal of Hypertension on August 17 found higher average systolic BP with higher PM 2.5 exposure. For every 15 micrograms per cubic metres exposure in PM 2.5, there was an increase in 3.3 mm Hg in systolic BP. Average annual PM2.5 exposure (ranging from 87 to 138 micrograms per cubic metres) over 1 year, 1.5 years and 2 years increased the risk of developing hypertension by 50%, 60% and 20% higher, respectively. The risk for exposure of two years was found to be lower because those who were likely to develop hypertension developed it during the 1 to 1.5-year period./These results were also found to be stronger in study participants with higher waist-to-hip ratios, which are an indicator of obesity./The authors of the study from Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Centre for Chronic Disease Control, India, collected questionnaires and annual year blood pressure measurements and developed a high-resolution model to assess their exposure to air pollution./The model was fed with PM 2.5 data from the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, satellite data, etc, to study how PM 2.5 exposure affected blood pressure over time./The heightened effect of PM 2.5 exposure observed in this study may not be simply due to the higher exposure but also the composition of PM2.5 in Delhi, authors have noted. The major sources of PM2.5 in Delhi are traffic, power plants, industries, and regional sources of pollution such as agricultural crop burning which include metals, inorganic aerosol, carbon etc./""In India, there is very little or no evidence linking the exposure of ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), as a marker of air pollution with hypertension. This is first of a kind study in the Indian context, which shows epidemiological evidence, for short- and long-term effects of ambient PM2.5 exposure on elevated BP and hypertension. The findings have shown that both short- and long -term exposure to air pollution contributed to higher BP and increased risk of hypertension especially in certain sections of the population (eg obese individuals). The results suggest there are significant benefits of controlling air pollution in reducing a major risk factor for cardiovascular deaths, the leading contributor to deaths in our country,"" Dorairaj Prabhakaran, vice president, Research and Policy, PHFI, and the lead Investigator of the study said in a statement on Friday./The study has concluded that ""reducing exposure to ambient air pollution has a large impact in controlling blood pressure, reducing risk of developing hypertension and future cardiovascular disease, and ensuring overall well-being"". ""Till we reach the safe levels of air quality, people with high risk of arrhythmias, worsening heart failure or stroke, such as those with severe heart failure, should be specially protected by avoiding exposure to high levels of outdoor PM2.5 by not going out on these days or through the use of protective N95 masks if feasible.""/""The association between air pollution and hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases is not new. The Harvard School of Public Health's six-city study had already found that PM 2.5 exposure was linked to higher mortality. In northern Italy, which is highly polluted, Covid-19 mortality was 12% compared to southern Italy where it was 4.5 %. This also shows that air pollution can lead to higher mortality from Covid-19 indirectly. The treatment outcomes of Covid-19 in patients with hypertension are poor,"" said Dr GC Khilnani, who heads pulmonary medicine department at New Delhi's All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Mumbai's Covid-19 waste doubles in 3 months, treatment facility runs out of storage space","India, Aug. 29 -- With a 104 percent increase in Covid-19 and associated biomedical waste generated in Mumbai over the past three months, the city's waste incineration unit has run out of storage space at their one-acre plant in Deonar./Private waste operator SMS Envoclean Pvt Ltd, appointed by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to deal with the city's entire Covid-19 waste, said plastic waste comprising syringes, saline bottles, masks, gloves, discarded medicines, equipment, empty ampules etc., weighing 2,000 kilograms, was piling up daily at the plant./""As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines, we have been instructed to segregate plastic waste received from healthcare facilities (collected separately) in red bags. Each waste product is disinfected and kept aside to be sent to private recyclers. However, with hardly any recycling units functioning and less number of vehicles with us, we have completely run out of space to store any additional quantity,"" said Amit Nilawar, director, SMS Envoclean./The rise in waste restricts the movement of people within the plant as well, said Nilawar. In June, HT had reported that 20 sanitation workers had quit the waste treatment centre in fear of being infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus./According to SMS, the quantity of Covid-19 and biomedical waste increased from an average of 12,200 kilograms per day in June to 24,880 kilograms per day average in August being brought in yellow bags from across 12,000 healthcare facilities in Mumbai. Every Monday, the quantity of Covid-19 waste reduces to 18,000-19,000 kilograms./Additionally, 6,000 kilograms of recyclable waste is being presently brought to the plant. While SMS has 60 vehicles catering to only hospitals, another 35 vehicles from the BMC are bringing waste from quarantine camps and homes, containment zones in yellow bags. ""The entire load of 24,880 kilograms is being incinerated daily but we are managing to send only 4,000 kilograms of the plastic waste to functional waste recyclers. The pile of treated waste stock has increased so much that we don't have any space to park our vehicles,"" said Nilawar. Each vehicle can carry an average of 250 kilograms of waste (ranging between 100 to 400 kilograms depending on the size of the vehicle)./The National Green Tribunal (NGT) in April appointed a committee that directed all states to look into the expansion of waste treatment facilities apprehending additional Covid-19 waste. Then state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta had asked all municipal corporations to audit their respective facilities./""The BMC had asked us whether we would like to increase our capacity. We asked for 3-acres but they agreed and approved the handover of a one-acre plot adjacent to our facility in June,"" said Nilawar adding, ""Once we have the land, we will procure 10 vehicles immediately and build a storage shed for additional waste.""/The BMC confirmed that the approval to hand over the land had been issued. ""It will take some time to complete all formalities but will be done soon,"" said a senior civic official./Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner said, ""We are meeting with the contractor soon. We will try to come up with a way out of the matter. At the moment, we have asked all solid waste management staff to focus only on Covid-19 waste. We are getting very few complaints about the non-lifting of waste, and I am personally monitoring the progress on a weekly basis.""/He added that antigen testing camps had been organised for all sanitation workers. ""Only one or two persons handling and transporting waste have been infected so far since March, and as restrictions have eased in the city, the workforce has increased,"" said Kakani./How the waste plant controls air pollution from excessive waste burning/With almost 25,000 kilograms of Covid-19 and associated biomedical waste being incinerated daily at the private waste treatment centre in Deonar, air pollution is a concern for the operator and residents. However, they have built a mechanism to ensure minimal emission./The waste treatment centre follows a process of second combustion followed by scrubbing and water sprinkling to remove hazardous pollutants. First, the waste is incinerated in a chamber and resultant hazardous smoke is transferred to another chamber where it is burnt for the second time ridding the air of harmful pollutants. Then it is sent to a third chamber where the air is filtered using a scrubber, and finally to a fourth chamber where a water sprinkler using chemicals further purifies the air before residual steam is released from the chimney./""The chimney is located at a height much above the peripheral residential area and the steam (almost colourless) disperses quickly into the air, and no black soot or smoke is visible,"" said Nilawar./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Centre calls on cities to deliver on clean air goals in next three yrs,"India, Sept. 8 -- Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on Monday urged states and cities to deliver on its clean air goals before the 2024 deadline for the national clean air programme (NCAP)./The minister made the appeal during a webinar with principal secretaries of urban development and environment departments of all states and union territories (UTs). The webinar reviewed the progress of activities under NCAP. This was the first review meeting since the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in end-March./Also read: Report says Air pollution cuts Indians' life expectancy by 5.2 years/Javadekar said that states and cities should try to achieve the target of reducing particulate matter (PM) concentrations in non-attainment cities by up to 30% by 2024 over 2017 annual average levels./Non-attainment cities don't need to meet the national clean air standards./Javadekar was speaking on the occasion of the United Nations (UN)-designated the first International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies, which was observed on Monday (September 7)./There are 122 non-attainment cities, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) out of which 48 cities exceed the PM standard by 100% and 35 cities by 50%./Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB, said air pollution action plans for 122 cities had been approved that are focused on management of pollution hotspots, public transport and fleet modernisation, paving of roads, cleaner fuels for industries etc./The 15th Finance Commission has allocated Rs 4,400 crore, which is largely meant for state pollution control boards and urban local bodies for clean air projects./Javadekar said though pollution woes caught the government's attention since 2014, the problem persisted for decades. He cited that under the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's regime - until 2004 --- industries were moved out of the national capital and public transport had made a switch to compressed natural gas (CNG)./""In 2014, PM Modi gave attention to the (pollution) problem again. The following year, we launched the air quality index (AQI). We accepted the problem and were never in denial. We started NCAP as well. India has leapfrogged to Bharat stage (BS)-VI while skipping BS-V emission norms for vehicles. It's a huge step. In the last six years, several road projects have been launched in a bid to ease traffic congestion,"" he said./The minister urged states to focus their resources on public transport, electric mobility, zig-zag technology for brick kilns etc. He also said states could impose tax on polluters./""PM Modi had announced on Independence Day that at least 100 cities will achieve clean air goals in four years. Let's strive to make a difference in three years,"" he added./The New Delhi- based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a not-for-profit public advocacy organisation, in an analysis released on Monday said the government needs a ""green recovery"" strategy to achieve and even exceed its NCAP goals./Two of the main interventions would be to revive public transport and a road map for electric vehicles to be scaled up, the analysis stated./All clean air action plans have included a bus transport strategy to cut transport sector emissions. But the public transport systems have nearly collapsed in several cities, the analysis showed./A survey conducted by the International Association of Public Transport (UITP) of 14 State Road Transport Undertakings (SRTUs) showed that 81% of the operators have reported no ridership at all during the Covid-19-induced lockdown phases, while others have reported 90% reduction in ridership from the pre-Covid-19 level. Ridership of SRTUs in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Delhi, and Hubli-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HD-BRTS) are still below 90%. Recovery of ridership is expected to be slow due to fear of contagion, but the government needs to have a plan, the analysis added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution can intensify Covid-19,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 9 -- As India faces a steep rise in Covid-19 cases, it is critical to employ all reasonable strategies to decrease transmission and to lower the number of severe infections which burden the health care system. Reducing air pollution is one such strategy that may be more important for India than any other country globally. So far, the spread of the pandemic has occurred during spring and summer when air pollution is relatively mild, but the interaction of high winter pollution levels with Covid-19 infections can have serious consequences./India has some of the highest exposures to air pollution in the world and faces a double impact from outdoor air pollution in cities and throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plain, plus household air pollution from the millions of chulhas in daily use especially in rural areas. Covid-19 is a respiratory infection, and we know from other such infections that air pollution can worsen their severity through its impact on the immune response. In 2019, nearly 200,000 respiratory infection deaths in India were linked to air pollution exposure. Simply put, air pollution may be an important factor that moves a mild Covid-19 infection to one that requires acute medical care./Although direct evidence of the impact of air pollution on Covid-19 is limited, and more time will be needed to conduct proper studies, evidence from the SARS epidemic in 2003 (caused by a similar virus) indicated a link between air pollution and increased mortality. Evidence from multiple countries, including studies from India, shows consistent associations between both short-term exposure to air pollution and hospitalisation for pneumonia infections (in children), and between long-term exposure and several types of respiratory infections in children./Studies of short-term increases in air pollution suggest a worsening severity of co-incident respiratory infections. This co-exposure interaction is supported by mechanistic studies which show how air pollution reduces the immune response to respiratory infections. For example, in the lower airways, where respiratory infections are most damaging, immune cells called macrophages can digest and destroy viruses and bacteria, but under conditions of air pollution exposure, these cells become filled up with particles and are no longer effective against the infection. Emerging research also suggests that air pollution may alter lung cells to increase the number of Sars-CoV-2 virus receptors./In addition, another group of studies indicates that longer-term exposure to air pollution increases the risk of infections, especially in those with pre-existing chronic lung disease. In this case, air pollution can lead to permanent structural changes in the lungs that erode a person's reserves. An infection that might lead to mild symptoms in a healthy person results in severe impact in those with chronic lung disease. This may be one reason that many of the same diseases caused by air pollution are also present in the majority of people with Covid-19 infections severe enough to require hospitalisation./Along with these roles in increasing susceptibility to infections and worsening infection severity, some reports also suggest a role of air pollution in increasing transmission of the virus. Studies have detected the presence of the virus on air pollution particles, but this does not mean these particles are themselves infectious and current evidence does not suggest that the virus hitching a ride on air pollution particles is an important route of transmission. Further, there is little evidence to indicate that infections occur outdoors except when people are in very close proximity. Although there is no direct evidence, there is a plausible pathway by which air pollution may enhance transmission by making it more likely that an infected individual will cough./So, what does this all mean for India? From one perspective, the current timing of the pandemic in India during the months of the year when air pollution is at its lowest levels suggests a window of opportunity during which concerted actions to reduce virus transmission may be effective in ""flattening the curve""./However, timing is important, as winter typically brings much higher levels of air pollution and the potential for the interaction with Covid-19 infections to lead to far larger impacts. Thus it is critical, even as economic activity increases, to accelerate the air pollution control measures already described in the National Clean Air Programme./Actions such as agricultural (stubble) burning that may lead to episodes need to be either curtailed entirely or managed in a way that is timed with tightening of pandemic management measures. In the future, full-scale lockdowns are unlikely, but may be replaced by on-again/off-again measures that could be targeted towards periods of high and low air pollution, to balance Covid-19 cases and air pollution against economic activity and employment. More rapid expansion of LPG use may reduce household pollution./There has never been a more important time for action on air pollution. Efforts implemented today will have immediate impact related to Covid-19 and will also continue to bear dividends long into the future via benefits on diabetes and chronic heart and lung diseases. What's more, actions taken to improve air quality will benefit everyone./Michael Brauer is professor, School of Population and Public Health, The University of British Columbia, and the Environmental Risk Factors Team lead at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"No action on slums for four weeks, SC told","NEW DELHI, Sept. 15 -- The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that discussions were underway to implement the court's August 31 order to remove 48,000 slums located alongside railway tracks in the Capital, and ruled out the immediate evictions of their residents, offering them a semblance of relief at a time when the city is battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic./The court recorded the Centre's submission that no coercive action will be taken against the slum-dwellers until a decision is taken and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks./""The ministry of railways, the ministry of housing and urban affairs, and the government of Delhi are going to take a decision on the issue raised in the instant petitions and till a decision is taken, there is no question of removing them,"" solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the central government, said./The apex court was hearing an application filed by Congress leader Ajay Maken, who was represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and a separate petition by slum dwellers challenging the demolition notices issued by Indian Railways./The petitioners said the notices had been issued in total disregard for the policy of rehabilitating the slum-dwellers, adding that they had ought to force them out of their homes during the Covid-19 pandemic./A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said, ""It is a fair suggestion made by solicitor general. We will record his statement and the matter can be heard after four weeks.""/Eleven slum dwellers represented by senior advocate Salman Khurshid were also allowed to join the proceedings on the next date of hearing. The biggest grievance of the slum dwellers was that an order removing slums was passed without them being heard. The August 31 order also restrained any courts from granting a stay on the eviction./The court recorded Mehta's statement, which said: ""Till then (until a decision is taken on the issue) the Union of India will not take any coercive action against the slum dwellers.""/Singhvi understood the order to be as good as a ""status quo on demolition"". But the bench clarified, ""We have not given any status quo. The solicitor general has said that they will maintain status quo, which we recorded.""/But Monday's order provided much-needed relief to nearly 240,000 affected slum dwellers./""We were all tense after we heard about eviction notices being issued to several slums along rail tracks in neighbouring areas. We knew that we too would receive a notice very soon..."" Ghanshyam Vishwakarma, a resident of a slum along the tracks in Kirti Nagar, said./Puran Mehto, a 45-year-old resident of a slum along the railway tracks in Mayapuri, has other concerns. ""We have learnt that the government and the Court are talking about rehabilitation...if we are relocated to far-off locations, we shall lose our livelihood. And that would take a heavy toll on us under the present circumstances, especially in the light of the loss of work because of the pandemic.""/Both Vishwakarma, 32, and Mahato were factory workers who lost their jobs in April during the lockdown./Advocate Vrinda Grover, who appeared for four Nangloi slum dwellers, told HT: ""The August 31 order of the top court never sought demolition of slums. The notice of demolition issued by the Indian Railway is totally illegal and contrary to two decisions passed by the Delhi high court which recognises right to shelter of slum dwellers and entitles them for in-situ rehabilitation under the Delhi Slum & Jhuggi Jhopri (JJ) Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015.""/Singhvi claimed that demolitions had taken place in some areas on Friday (September 11) and Monday (September 14), but Mehta denied this, stating: ""My instruction is that under this order (of August 31), no demolition has taken place.""/Presenting a short note of his submissions, Singhvi pointed out that India is currently president of UN-Habitat, which issued guidelines on March 14, urging member-states and governments to stop all relocations and evictions during the pandemic. Singhvi said, ""India is globally the second worst affected country in the world due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the said circumstances, it would be highly risky to demolish the jhuggis (slums) of approximately 2.5 lakh persons without prior rehabilitation... Even a small percentage of the displaced population, if affected by Covid-19, the same will prove to be a recipe for disaster in the current pandemic.""/The court passed its order of August 31 when considering the issue of garbage and solid waste piling up near the railway tracks in pending matters related to air pollution in Delhi. The court asked the authorities to put their mind together on the issue. Pursuant to discussions, the Railways filed an affidavit which acted as an immediate trigger./The Railways stated that the presence of slums along the 140-kilometre route length of track in the national capital territory of Delhi ""are not only adding to the present menace of accumulation of garbage, municipal solid waste, human waste along the railway line but are a safety threat to the day-to-day operation of the Railways."" The transporter informed the court that despite a special task force having been constituted to remove encroachments, political interference was coming in the way./On Monday, the ministry of railways said it will not dismantle any encroachments along the city's railway tracks, without a ""proper decision"" taken in consultation with the urban development ministry and the Delhi state government. Railway officials are holding regular meetings with stakeholders, including the Delhi government, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board and the urban development ministry, a statement by northern railways said. ""Further, Railway will not dismantle any encroachment without proper decision...The same stand has been taken by ministry of railways in hearing of Ajay Maken's petition in Hon'ble Supreme Court listed today,"" it said./Railways has removed 5-6% of garbage lying along train tracks. The garbage cleaning will be completed within three months as given in the top court order, it added./Indu Prakash, a member of Supreme Court-appointed committee on monitoring of homeless shelters in Delhi, said, ""It is a good sign that the court has agreed to put the matter on hold for a month and the Centre and the Delhi government will sit together and discuss it. We are writing to the railways and the Delhi government to include the residents in this discussion too, as it is a matter of their lives. We will be submitting a memorandum in this regard to the two governments soon. These people should be actively involved in the decision-making process.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi's AQI hits 148 as pollution begins to rise,"India, Sept. 21 -- After a month in which Delhi saw its cleanest air in five years, air pollution has seen an uptick in the national capital over the past few weeks. With monsoon drawing to a close and little possibility of more rainfall this month, the air quality may deteriorate further by the end of this month, scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said./Unlike August, when the air quality was in the 'good' category for four days, and 'satisfactory' for the remaining 27, the air this month has mostly remained in the 'moderate' category./August was the cleanest month on record since 2015, from when air quality index (AQI) records in the city have been maintained./An AQI reading of 0-50 is considered 'good' (minimal health risk), 51-100 is 'satisfactory' (minor discomfort to sensitive people), 100-200 is 'moderate' (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease)./Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that the AQI this month slipped to 'moderate' category on September 5, with a value of 101. It improved to 'satisfactory' for a few days before again falling into 'moderate' on September 9, a zone it has remained in so far./On Sunday, Delhi's overall AQI was 148, in the 'moderate' zone, as per the CPCB's 4pm bulletin, up from 118 the previous day./""The spell of clean air days may almost be over now, as meteorological conditions are changing. The monsoon is set to withdraw by September-end, after which calm winds blow across the northwestern region that are not favourable for the dispersion of pollutants,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre/""Pollutants suspended in the air that were till last month being washed away by the rain and winds are likely to persist, in the absence of any such weather activity,"" he added./He added that while August received the most rainfall in at least 10 years, September, which usually sees good showers every year, has not received adequate rainfall this year and will not be able to cover the deficit for this month./""The monsoon trough this month has remained mostly in the hilly regions. Only three days of light rain were recorded this month - on September 5,6 and 8. There is a system forming in the Bay of Bengal, which is likely to induce light rain or thundershowers on September 22-23, but even that will not be able to cover the deficit for this month,"" Srivastava said./The Safdarjung observatory, which is representative of Delhi's weather, has a rain deficit of 78% so far this month./Another IMD scientist, who did not wish to be named, said industrial and vehicular pollution was almost zero during the lockdown months. Then in July and August, even with curbs being eased in phases, good and continuous spells of rain kept the air quality in check./""Now, from the end of the month, the weather will slowly transition to calmer winds and a decrease in temperature neither of which are favourable for pollutants to disperse. Besides, it is also the time when stubble burning in neighbouring states begins, which adds to the pollution load,"" the IMD scientist told Hindustan Times./The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) is scheduled to meet the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) next week to discuss an action plan to curb pollution in the major 'hot spots' across the city./Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had, last week, asked all agencies to submit a winter action plan by September 21./The Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), put in place to deal with various levels of pollution, is enforced in Delhi and the National Capital Region from mid-October./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

First stubble fires start to show up on Nasa map,"New Delhi,, Sept. 22 -- Farmers have begun burning crop residue in parts of Punjab and Haryana, satellite images from the United States space agency Nasa has shown, suggesting an early start to a practice that plunges much of the region, including Delhi, into a pollution crisis in the run up to the winter./Data from Nasa's (national aeronautics and space administration) fire information for resource management system (FIRMS) shows a progressive increase in detection of fire in areas that typically have farmlands./Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, said that the most number of fires, shown as red spots on the map was seen from Amritsar district in Punjab./""Crop fires in the state of Punjab and Haryana have started appearing in India. This year, we will be supporting satellite air quality data analysis and forecasting through a community forum for better understanding the impact of such fires on local weather and environment,"" said Gupta./Data provided by Gupta shows that in the Amritsar district, between September 13 and September 16, five to seven fires were spotted through satellite monitoring. However, the number started rising and reached 26 on September 18 and on September 19 as many as 50 fires were spotted. On September 20, 62 fires were observed only in the district./Apart from Amritsar, other districts in Punjab where stubble burning fires are being seen are Tarn Taran, Firozpur, and parts of Kapurthala, Mansa and Jalandhar, where every day, at least two fires are seen./A senior official of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) said that these fires were signs of 'early varieties' of crops being harvested./""We are hoping that the number of stubble burning cases will be less this year. Our teams are alert but these fires are yet to start,"" the official said on the condition of anonymity./While the situation in Haryana is still better, fires were spotted in the districts of Fatehabad and Ambala./Every year these farm fires usually begin in full-swing by mid-October, last year early fires were detected by September 25./The practice is linked to paddy farming in both these states. As a cheap and quick solution, farmers set fire to vast spreads of crop residue in order to turn their farm around for winter sowing./But this spews clouds of smoke in the atmosphere, which coupled with typical pre-winter conditions - slow, cooling winds that settle down closer to settlement - covers cities in a thick blanket of toxic smoke. The problem has turned into a public health crisis in recent years, with vulnerable people being advised to stay indoors./This year, it is likely to exacerbate Covid-19 outbreak. Research from Italy, one of the first coronavirus hot spots, showed that air pollution was linked to worse mortality rates. The virus, in severe cases, causes respiratory distress -- a condition that can be made worse to exposure to polluted air./By October 15, when monsoon retreats, winds change direction: they turn westerly and north-westerly, bringing in the smoke./In Delhi, the average wind speed in winter ranges between one and three metres per second, which is nearly one-third the average speed in summer months./Delhi government data shows that last year stubble burning accounted for 44% of Delhi's air pollution./Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of crop stubble out of which 9 million tonnes was burnt last year. In Haryana, 1.23 million tonnes out of 7 million tonnes was burnt./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

EPCA writes to Punjab and Haryana to act against stubble burning,"India, Sept. 23 -- The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority on Tuesday wrote to the chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, asking the states to control cases of crop stubble burning, after early instances began appearing in satellite imagery./In his letter to the two primary stubble-burning states in the country, Epca chief Bhure Lal said crop residue burning had been spotted on satellite data recorded by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) and the United Nations' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa)./He said it was imperative that early action be taken to control these fires ahead of the winters to control the annual pollution spike in Delhi./Delhi government data shows that in 2019, stubble burning accounted for 44% of air pollution in the national capital./Citing the Safar and Nasa data , Lal said 42 fires Monday, shown as 'red dots' on the map, were seen around various districts of Punjab, while 20 cases were observed on Sunday./""EPCA has been monitoring progress with you on the implementation of the different measures in this past two months and has also worked out the clear benchmarks and targets that need to be achieved before the coming season. We would now request that these steps are taken with urgency,"" Lal said in his letter./The letter added, ""We recognise that we have lost time because of Covid-19, but given that the winter season is now fast approaching, we need to tackle this with urgency and ensure compliance.""/The SC-appointed body also said that even though the impact of these early instances of burning is expected to be negligible on the air quality of Delhi at least in the next three days, because wind speeds are not currently supportive for transport and accumulation of smoke, the situation in Delhi will deteriorate in the coming weeks once the wind pattern changes./Lal also asked state governments to set up control rooms ahead of the harvest season that will start functioning in full-swing from mid-October, to ensure that harvest machines are available easily to farmers and enforcement is prompt against violations./Hindustan Times had reported on Tuesday that NASA had started observing early instances of crop residue burning is some districts of Punjab and Haryana. Recordings show that such instances had progressively been increasing from September 13, but had seen a spike over the last five days./The worst affected district was Amritsar in Punjab, followed by Tarn Taran, Firozpur, and parts of Kapurthala, Mansa and Jalandhar./Krunesh Garg, member secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board, said the satellite imagery catches all kinds of fires, and said the images were not necessarily stubble burning./""It is too early panic. Our teams are tracking any signs of early burning, but what we have largely observed is that compared to previous years farmers are more aware and are spreading the message of among their own neighbourhoods of not burning stubble,"" he said./Garg said monitoring teams will begin thorough monitoring from Wednesday to check for any violations./In Haryana, where the only two or three instances were observed in parts of Fatehabad and Ambala, officials said the government has zero-tolerance for stubble burning this year./""We have marked 38 villages that will be intensely monitored. Till now, we have not observed any instances of stubble burning on the ground. We are hoping that the cases will be less this year. We have see over the past few years that cases have progressively been reducing every year,"" said S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana Pollution Control Board./In Punjab last year, 9.8 million tonnes out of 20 million tonnes of paddy crop residue was burnt. As many as 50, 738 cases of stubble burning was recorded by the state pollution control board in 2019. In Haryana, on the other hand 1.24 million tonnes out of 7 million tonnes of paddy crop residue was burnt./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The impact of air pollution on Covid-19 | HT Editorial,"India, Sept. 24 -- The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Tuesday wrote to Punjab and Haryana governments, asking them to control cases of crop stubble burning, after early instances were spotted on satellite data of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The early warning to the two states is important because every winter, the air pollution level increases to dangerous levels due to stubble burning, vehicular pollution, lack of proper systems of garbage burning and disposing of construction and demolition waste./This year, however, controlling air pollution is not just critical for civic, political and health reasons. A study published by Havard University on air pollution and Covid-19 deaths in the United States found that even a minor increase in PM2.5 particles can lead to an increase in Covid-19 death rates. Another study reported in Physics of Fluids said wind speed is another critical factor when it comes to the spread of the disease. While none of these studies were done in India, experts here also feel that there is a good chance that increased suspended particulate matters and rising wind speed could transport the virus faster and wider. The Centre and states, which are grappling with a rising number of cases, must take these warnings seriously, implement anti-pollution protocols strictly, increase testing and strengthen the health care system for a potential surge in the number of cases during the winter months, especially in the northern plains./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Hot, wet weather raises risk of airborne coronavirus transmission, shows study","New Delhi, Sept. 24 -- Rapid evaporation of saliva droplets contaminated by the Sars-CoV-2 virus in hot, dry weather lowers the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), but high humidity can boost it, which may explain why cases surged during the monsoon in Delhi and Mumbai, and many other crowded cities around the world, according to new research that reinforces the importance of social distancing and the use of face masks to stop the pandemic from spreading./Quick evaporation emerged as a critical factor in the transmission of the infectious particles, which are immersed in respiratory clouds of saliva drops, found the study, which analysed the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed on the survival of Sars-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the disease./""High temperature and low relative humidity lead to high evaporation rates of saliva-contaminated droplets, thus significantly reducing the virus viability,"" according to the study on weather effects that fuel the spread of Covid-19. The study was published in the journal Physics of Fluids of the American Institute of Physics./It found that travel distance and concentration of the droplet cloud were significant even at high temperatures if the relative humidity is high. Wind speed is another critical factor that can negate the benefits of social distancing./""The study examines three factors that affect transport of the virus, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, of which relative humidity is the most significant. It also explains why infections rose in India during the monsoon and why cases are low in the Middle East and Australia, which experienced its summer during the northern hemisphere winter,"" said Dr NK Mehra, former dean, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi./The new report reinforces the findings of past studies, including one from Princeton University published in the journalSciencein May, that said without effective control measures, strong outbreaks are likely in more humid climates and high summer temperature will not substantially limit the spread of the pandemic./""Our work focuses on the potential risk of being infected - rather than disease transmission itself - from exposure to an airborne cloud of contaminated saliva droplets... The results reveal the importance of the weather conditions in the virus's viability,"" write the researchers who conducted the new study./Because research on heat and mass transfer around and within respiratory droplets containing the virus is scarce, the researchers developed theoretical correlations for the unsteady evaporation of coronavirus-contaminated saliva droplets./They implemented the theory in an advanced computational fluid dynamics platform and studied the effects of weather conditions on airborne virus transmission./The study adds to the understanding of airborne droplet transmission but does not link the evaporation rate change to disease transmission as the viral load required for someone to be infected depends on several factors such as age, gender, underlying medical conditions, genetic factors and cross-infections, among others./""It highlights the importance of weather conditions in the virus's viability, but what we need to factor in India is pollution levels, particularly suspended particulate matter, which can transport the virus. In India, air quality index, along with rising wind speed, are the other important factors that will affect droplet transmission over the winter months,"" said Dr Mehra./Air pollution increases the risk of viral transmission. A Harvard University study on air pollution and Covid-19 deaths in the United States found that an increase of only 1 ug/m3 in PM2.5 levels is associated with an 8% increase in the Covd-19 death rate, which underlined the need for continued enforcement of existing air pollution laws. PM2.5, or fine particulate matter, is an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when its levels in the air are high./The new study provides a warning on the possibility of a second wave in the northern hemisphere autumn and winter, when temperatures fall and wind speeds rise./Public health experts said it will help guide the design of measures to reduce airborne virus transmission in both indoor and outdoor environments. ""Such studies reinforce the need for wearing masks and maintaining social distancing in both indoor and outdoor environments to reduce airborne virus transmission, whether you're at home or in a public place,"" said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Stubble burning can spike Covid-19 deaths': Petition in SC,"India, Sept. 28 -- Pollution caused by stubble burning in Delhi's neighbouring states can exponentially increase the mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), claimed a petition filed in the Supreme Court seeking total ban on stubble burning./The plea has been moved by two young environmental activists - a Class 12 student, who under his own initiative of ""Plant A Million Trees"", has planted 1.5 lakh trees in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR), and a third-year law student who is an active campaigner against the use of single-use plastic./A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde has listed the petition for hearing on October 6 along with the batch of MC Mehta matters pertaining to Delhi pollution. The petition was mentioned by senior advocate Harish Salve who is assisting the Court as amicus curiae (friend of Court)./Also read: Covid-19 vaccine portal launched, all data linked to research on it/""The consequence of allowing any stubble burning to take place in the times of this pandemic will be catastrophic,"" the petition by the two young environmentalists said. Citing international medical studies, the plea stated that medical studies have found that people with weak respiratory system or living in polluted areas are at serious risk of contracting Covid-19 leading to death in some cases./""Any increase in air pollution levels in Delhi-NCR this year while the Covid-19 pandemic is spiralling out of control, will exponentially increase the mortality rate due to Covid-19 by compromising the respiratory system of the citizens, particularly in the case of senior citizens and children,"" the petition stated. Further, it stated that enhanced pollution level can offer ""direct pathway for airborne transmission"" of Covid-19 virus./Salve told the Court that the petition raised an important issue and requires to be heard. Delhi witnesses an exponential rise in air pollution levels around this time of the year due to stubble burning by farmers in Punjab, Haryana Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Last year, the air quality index (AQI) crossed the 1,000 mark as stubble burning releases suspended particulate matter in the air and emits harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and methane./Farmers have to prepare the fields for sowing of the rabi crop after harvesting the Kharif crop. As the period between the two events is short, the remains of the Kharif crop cannot be manually plucked out and to remove it, they are set on fire. As a way out, the petition suggested that stubble removing machines should be either provided at affordable rents by state governments to small and marginal farmers. It recommended daily wage workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MNREGA) scheme. The petition has even recommended putting strict curbs on construction activities and polluting industries in Delhi-NCR if AQI crosses 150./In the MC Mehta case, the Supreme Court has been monitoring the stubble burning issue by asking respective state governments to inform progress made on setting up biomass plants and providing stubble removal machines to small farmers.

Farm fires set to continue as subsidy may not encourage shift to tech,"India, Sept. 28 -- The harvest season has already begun in many parts of northwest India, and even as most farmer groups agitate against the farm bills, community leaders said crop stubble burning may continue this year too, saying subsidies on straw management machinery is not enough for small farmers to switch to machines./Satellite images released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) have shown an increasing number of stubble burning incidents in Punjab over the past five days, especially in Amritsar district./Nasa also warned that with plumes of smoke being seen over Delhi, the city's air quality may also deteriorate in the coming weeks. Delhi government data shows that stubble burning accounted for 44% of the city's air pollution last year./Also read: Current approach not helping cut farm fires, says Kejriwal in letter to Javadekar/A silver lining, however, is that the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) will in certain farms this year test its microbial consortium, which helps decompose stubble quickly, thereby removing the need for any straw management machinery. But it may not be scaled up to all of northwest India immediately, officials said./""We had been working on the microbial consortium for a couple of years after the happy seeder (for straw management) was introduced. Last year, it was tried in Uttar Pradesh and it had worked. So, after the crop is harvested with a combine harvester, it needs to be chopped so that the straw is short and the microbial consortium can be used. The money for straw management machinery to be subsidised has also been released to Punjab and Haryana so farmers can access that. I think there will be a further reduction in crop stubble burning this year compared to last year,"" said Trilochan Mohapatra, director, Indian Council for Agricultural Research./But farmers are not aware of the microbial consortium's effectiveness. ""We have heard about the solution. If it works, nothing like it. The only worry is that if straws from paddy don't decompose , it will delay the sowing for the Rabi season. They should do a trial,"" said Dharmendra Kumar, spokesperson, Bharatiya Kisan Union./Also read: Air quality on the decline in Delhi, expect worse in coming week/""No machine can remove the straw effectively and farmers end up spending on the machines and fuel. So there was talk of giving direct subsidy to farmers of about Rs 100 per quintal. But that has not happened. Instead they have used that money to subsidise straw management machinery,"" he added./Harvesting started a week early this time, according to Rattan Singh Mann, chief of the BKU's Haryana unit./""I have seen small farmers are already setting fire to their farms after harvesting. That's because it was very warm this month which prepared the crop for early harvest. Small farmers who do not have access to machinery will continue to burn stubble this year. But the Haryana government has made both cooperative societies for renting machines and is also offering subsidies to those who need to buy it,"" Mann said./BKU general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said a large number of farmers have not received subsidies to buy straw management machinery this year, so obviously they will burn stubble. ""Farmers are extremely disturbed about the farm bills also. It's a crisis,"" said ./Besides causing pollution, burning also affects the soil's fertility. Burning one tonne of straw accounts for loss of 5.5kg nitrogen, 2.3kg phosphorus, 25kg potassium and 1.2kg sulphur. Heat from burning straw penetrate into the soil up to 1 cm. Repeated burning permanently diminishes the bacterial population by more than 50% according to an analysis by Centre for Sustainable Agriculture./Centre under its in-situ management of crop residue scheme has allocated Rs 1,151.80 crore for subsidising straw management machinery from 2018-19 to 2019-20./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
