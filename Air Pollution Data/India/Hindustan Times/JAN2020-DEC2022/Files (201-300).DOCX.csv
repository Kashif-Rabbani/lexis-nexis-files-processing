Odisha: 16 held for stir against coal trucks emitting smoke,"Bhubaneswar, Feb. 19 -- Sixteen tribal activists and villagers of Sundargarh district are in jail for the past 4 days for allegedly protesting against the expansion of a mines operated by state-owned Mahanadi Coalfields Limited that is allegedly causing massive pollution near their villages./On January 19 this year, around 5,000 people from 45 villages of Hemagir block of Sundargarh district started their peaceful protest against pollution from the trucks carrying coal from Kulda Open Cast Mine and Basundhara open cast mines to an unit of Jindal Steel and Power Limited in Chhatisgarh's Raigarh, 41 km away. The villagers, most of them Hill khadia, Bhuyan and Gond tribals, started a blockade to stop the trucks from Sundargarh travel to Chhatisgarh./""It is impossible for most villagers in the area to not beathe the air laced with coal and flyash. The paddyfields are covered with a layer of coal dust,"" said a tribal villager requesting anonymity./A villager of Hemagir block said on February 14, police came and arrested Rajendra Naik, a tribal leader of Jana Shakti Vikash Parishad and 15 others on charges of murder, criminal intimidation among other charges. ""Since January 19, around 200 people would gather at Taparia and block the way of the trucks headed for Chhattisgarh. Even at night, about 150 people continued the blockade. We had no other way as the trucks carrying coal leave behind a trail black dust on schools, hostels, houses as well as farmlands. Now police said if we do not stop agitating then many more would be arrested,"" the villager said./However, inspector of Hemagir police station, Ramakanta Sai said 16 persons were arrested after a truckdriver lodged a complaint that the activists tried to strangle him and beat him up. ""The truckdriver was beaten up by the people who were opposing the transportaion of coal. In his complaint, the truckdriver alleged that there was an attempt to murder him. As per his complaint, we made the arrests,"" said Sai./Locals said the the ministry of environment and forest's expert appraisal committee recently had recommended environmental clearance for expanding the capacity of the Kulda opencast coal mine by 20%, despite popular opposition over the project's impact on their health, agriculture and water bodies./The expansion would lead to increase of Kulda opencast mine's capacity from the current 14 million tonnes per annum to 19.60 MTPA. The clearance was recommended on condition that Mahanadi Coalfields Limited which is the owner of the mine, will plant 100,000 trees with broad leaves along the villages and 50,000 trees along the transportation route in two years to prevent air pollution. MCL, in its compliance reports, said that it had avoided transporting coal through any village./The agitating villagers however said MCL had lied in its compliance report. ""Around 3,000 trucks pass through the 45 villages every day, leaving a trail of black dust. This month we had filed a complaint with the Odisha Human Rights Commission detailing the impacts of pollution from the coaldust after which the OHRC recommended that coal transporting vehicles should not be allowed to ply until the district administration reports on the action it has taken in the matter,"" said an activist./The Kulda mines was initially allowed to mine 10 MTPA. In 2018, it was allowed to scale up the mining to 14 MTPA. After the recommendation of the EAC of the Ministry of Environment and Forests the capacity was increased from 14 to 16.8 MTPA./Many of the activists on the ground said that they are scared of the police arrest, but would not stop the agitation. ""We want a special corridor for coal transport so that our villages are spared of the coal dust. The coast dust has polluted out agricultural fields and water bodies,"" said an activist./However, Sundargarh sub-collector Abhimanyu Behera said he was aware of the pollution caused by the trucks and a new corridor would be built at a cost of Rs.146 crore. ""The construction of the corridor would soon start. But till the new road is made the villagers should not try to blcok the trucks. We have ordered MCL to transport the coal by covering with tarpaulins,"" said the sub-collector./Environmental activists said Odisha government's arrest of the 16 activists in Sundargarh was another example of stifling popular opposition. ""Starting from Niyamgiri to Posco, the state government has not shied away from putting activists behind bars if they dare to oppose its industrialisation dreams. The government should release the activists and take steps in controlling the pollution due to coal transportation,"" said activist Prafulla Samantra./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Give young environmentalists a voice,"India, Feb. 21 -- The climate advocacy group, Fridays for Future, has been in the news recently due to the arrest of one of its members, Disha Ravi, in connection with allegedly playing a role in producing and sharing a protest ""toolkit"". On the face of it, producing and sharing a toolkit is usual for advocacy groups seeking to mobilise attention and action around an issue, and it is hard to understand the serious allegations being made. Since I am not privy to the details of the case, I want to flag some broader, problematic, perspectives in the public conversation about this case ./First, a prominent theme in public conversations around this episode is that climate activists should stick to narrow environmental issues. Environmentalists, some imply, should play among themselves in a sandbox at one corner of the public debate. The irony is that India and Indian stakeholders - activists, diplomats and political leaders alike - have played a leading role in successfully arguing that the climate crisis is not only an environmental issue, it is a question of development choices, livelihoods and equity./Notably, Fridays for Future appears to have taken on board this broader view: ""ensure climate justice and equity"" is the second ""demand"" listed in a August 2019 declaration on its website (the first and third are ""limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C"" and ""listen to the science""). This recognition of equity is essential to ensuring that poor people and poor countries do not bear the cost of climate adjustment, which India has been in the forefront of arguing internationally. The bottom line is that environmental and social outcomes are inter-connected, and one cannot come at the cost of the other./This broad perspective on environment is just as salient domestically as it is internationally. And from this point of view, it is reasonable - and even necessary - to look at not only the environmental problems arising from farming, but also the social condition of farmers, and the political and economic forces shaping farmer choices. Calling for Indian environmentalists to limit the scope of their interests not only impoverishes the national conversation, but also contradicts a uniquely powerful Indian stance espoused by activists and government alike, and that has served the national interest well in climate negotiations./Second, it would be deeply problematic if the grumbling about the international linkages of the ""toolkit"" at the centre of this issue diluted the truth that it is strongly in India's national interests to address environmental concerns; this is not just some international fiction. Environmental issues affect Indian interests in multiple ways./To begin with, the local environment is despoiled in much of India. The Centre for Science and Environment found that, as of 2018, 275 of 445 monitored rivers were polluted and that unprocessed solid waste is the norm even in many cities. A dire air pollution problem is taking a toll on the health of Indians, with air pollution estimated to cause 1.2 million premature deaths a year, about one-eighth of all annual deaths in India, according to Indian scientists who have contributed to the Global Burden of Disease study. While much remains to be done, some potentially useful steps have been taken, such as creation of a new Commission on Air Quality Management./In addition, the climate crisis is an enormous threat multiplier in India, according to a comprehensive Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology compilation. It could increase the destructive power of natural disasters, affect crop productivity, impact labour productivity through heat stress, disrupt the monsoons, and affect India's water supply. Simply put, the climate crisis will make India's development aspirations much harder to achieve./Not least, the landscape of economic opportunity and job creation, both in India and globally, is changing in response to the environmental and climate crises. In energy, fossil fuels are giving way to solar, wind and battery technology; in transport, the days of the internal combustion engine may be numbered - GM recently announced their phase-out; in food, meat substitutes are taking off, and all these changes are driven by environmental concerns. In some areas, the government is attentive to these changes, seeking to stimulate solar panel production, and battery technology and manufacturing./In brief, local pollution, climate damage and new economic opportunities tied to climate and environment are all important to our national interests. While an enormous amount remains to be done, the environment has long left behind the confines of the sandbox./What a time, then, to send a signal to the young citizens of this country - discouraging them from paying attention to, asking challenging questions about, and putting personal energy into acting on, the big issues of our day. India needs more, not less, engagement and energy around environmental issues. We may not agree with the answers young activists come up with. We may sometimes disagree with the way in which they frame questions or seek attention for their cause. But as a society, we will be poorer if we silence them./Navroz K Dubash is a professor at the Centre for Policy Research, and the editor of India in a Warming World: Integrating Climate Change and Development/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Rising air pollution led to 41,090 deaths in Punjab in 2019: Report","India, March 1 -- Punjab reported as many as 41,090 deaths attributable to air pollution, which is 18.8% of the total fatalities, in 2019, revealed the Down to Earth and Centre for Science and Environment's annual report titled ""State of India's Environment 2021""./The report, which was released on Saturday, stated that 1.67 million Indians died due to air pollution in 2019 as per the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 on health and economic impact of air pollution in the states of India. Half of these deaths were in just five states including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Rajasthan./In Punjab, 1,148 million US dollars (1.49% state GDP) economic loss was ascribed to air pollution. ""As many as 34,119 deaths (19% of total deaths) were attributable to air pollution range in Haryana in the year while the state pegged 1,566 million US dollars economic loss due to air pollution,"" the report said./The report mentioned that two Punjab industrial clusters, including Jalandhar and Batala, were among 33 of the 88 clusters of the country where air quality evaluated in 2009 had worsened by 2018. In 2009, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) developed the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) to identify problematic industrial areas in the country. In the 2009 CEPI study, a total of 88 industrial clusters were identified as polluted industrial areas (PIAS) by CPCB and state PPCB.""/Water pollution up in Ludhiana/The report said that the industrial cluster of Ludhiana was among 45 of total 88 clusters where water pollution had increased. The city scored over 70 (CEPI score out of 100) in 2018, under the critically polluted cluster category, since 2009 in absence of adequate action to reduce the pollution./""Jalandhar and Batala were among 35 of the 88 industrial clusters between 2009 and 2018 where overall environmental degradation was witnessed in the period. In this category, CEPI score of Jalandhar was around 70 in the year 2009, but it has increased nearer to 80 (out of 100), while Batala scored over 60 in 2009 while it was closer to 70 in 2018,"" the report said./The report underlined that despite environmental concerns, an industrial park was approved in July near the Mattewara forest range and the Sutlej in Ludhiana./Govt making all efforts: Environment secy/Punjab environment secretary Rahul Tiwari said the Punjab government has been making efforts to curb air pollution.

22 of 30 most polluted cities in India: Report,"India, March 17 -- 22 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world, including 14 in the top 15, are in India, an air quality report released by a Swiss organisation, IQAir said. This includes the second most polluted city, Ghaziabad in the national capital region./The report, released globally on Tuesday, said that while India saw a ""marked improvement"" in air quality last year on account of the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions on activities imposed on account of it, the levels of pollution were still ""dangerously high""./""Every city in India observed air quality improvements compared to 2018, while 63% saw direct improvements against 2019. However, India continues to feature prominently at the top of the most polluted cities ranking with 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities globally,"" the report said./While the focus of the governments in tackling the problem of air pollution in India is largely focused around the national capital, Delhi, high concentrations of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) are recorded in the entire Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) , especially during the winter season. That's when levels of PM 2.5 from local sources such as vehicles, industrial emissions, construction and open burning are complemented by external contributors such as stubble burning and the unfavourable weather conditions, leading to the accumulation of pollutants closer to the surface./According to the rankings, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh was the most polluted with the average annual PM 2.5 levels of 106.6ug/m3, making it the second most polluted city in the world after Hotan in China (110.2 ug/m3).The next 13 ranks were also held by cities in India./The other Indian cities on the list are: Bulandshahr, Bisrakh Jalalpur (both in Uttar Pradesh), Bhiwadi (Rajasthan), Noida, Greater Noida, Kanpur, Lucknow (all in UP), Delhi, Faridabad (Haryana), Meerut (UP), Jind, Hisar (both in Haryana), Agra, Muzaffarnagar (both UP), Fatehabad, Bandhwari , Gurugram , Yamuna Nagar, Rohtak (all Haryana), Muzaffarpur (UP), and Dharuhera (Haryana). Kashgar, also in China, is ranked 15. Manikganj in Bangladesh follows in 16th rank./Other foreign cities that made it to the list were Lahore and Bahawalpur in Pakistan, in the 18th and 19th rank, Dhaka in Bangladesh ranking 23, South Tangerang in Indonesia in the 25th spot./1.7 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution in 2019, which was 18% of the total deaths in the country according to India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, a scientific paper on the health and economic impact of air pollution published last December in Lancet Planetary Health./""The global burden of disease has time and again highlighted the massive health burden of air pollution on health and how it leads to premature mortality. I think its time that new technologies such as low cost air quality sensors should be used creatively to assess where air pollution exposure has reduced....

Ministry issues guidelines to keep pollution from making Covid-19 infections worse,"New Delhi, March 18 -- In a bid to prevent high levels of air pollution from increasing the severity of Covid-19 infections, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) released a set of guidelines and best practices to be adopted by state governments and citizens to control the spread of infections./RP Singh, secretary, MoEFCC, said Covid-19 is known to seriously impact human health, especially a person's respiratory system. With Covid-19 cases rising again in several states, Singh said it was important to come up with guidelines to keep vulnerable sections of the population such as senior citizens and children safe./""Creating awareness about air pollution sources, indoor as well as ambient, and associated health impacts in Covid-19 times has become crucial. Addressing the issue of air pollution will lead to a decline in morbidity and mortality, as well as a decline in respiratory related illnesses during the pandemic,"" Singh said./Listing in detail the link between high pollution levels and the severity of coronavirus infections, the guidelines said, ""Poor air quality affects our lungs and other body organs. It increases the risk of chronic diseases such as COPD, asthma, pneumonia etc.""/It added, ""Air pollution can exacerbate respiratory and circulatory diseases in patients and vulnerable populations, and can also increase the severity of development of more serious illnesses.""/The guidelines have been prepared by Suman Mor, associate professor and chairperson of the department of environment studies, Panjab University, and Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor of environment health department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER./This document will also be circulated among state governments and agencies so that the awareness message is disseminated to the public, ministry officials said./In a list of things that citizens can do to control emissions indoors, the guidelines suggested keeping indoor plants, avoiding smoking in closed spaces, using cleaner fuels for cooking, avoiding use of mosquito coils, incense sticks and room freshners, and using micro fibre cloths for dusting furniture./The document also reiterated that people need to ensure proper ventilation in homes and the city administration must ensure strict adherence to the graded response action plan (Grap)-a set of emergency measures to tackle air pollution./Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh, said that it extremely important that people adhere to all Covid prevention norms to prevent cases from rising further./""Such guidelines are important because cases have started rising again in several states. We should take lessons from other countries, where the moment people and the governments let their guards down, another wave started.

NGT notice to factories causing pollution,"Lucknow, March 22 -- The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has taken note of air pollution caused by around 36 small and big factories operating within city limits in Bahraich district./The Bahraich Nagar Palika too had carried out an air pollution test in the city that pointed out increasing pollution level in the city due to smoke bellowing from factories. This pollution is causing respiratory problem among locals./Taking note of the issue after locals lodged a complaint; the NGT has sought a reply from the Pollution Control Board, Ayodhya, which covers Bahraich district./After the NGT's tough stand, the Board has sent notices to factory owners warning them to cancel 'no objection certificate' issued to them if they do not comply with pollution norms./""These factories are in Dargah area which is within the city limit. In Chittaura block, just at city outskirts, Bhinga Road and Malhipur Road one can spot Dal and Rice mill units among other factories,"" said lawyer Raman Kumar Singh, Bahraich district court./""None of these units have necessary equipment to check rising smoke carrying dust particles which cause respiratory problems. The Pollution Control Board has issued notices only after locals here lodged complaint with the NGT,"" added Singh./Pramod Pandey of Irrigation Colony, Deepak Pal of Salarpur, Harish Yadav and Mukesh Yadav of Kalpipara among others have lodged a complaint with the NGT raising the issue./""Despite the Pollution Control Board issuing notices to factory owners, nothing has happened. Now, we are planning to file a writ at the Lucknow high court on the issue,"" said lawyers Raman Kumar Singh and Nandan Srivastava./""One can easily spot dust particle in air in areas adjoining these factories.

Smoke from fires in Uttarakhand worsens Delhi's air quality,"India, April 7 -- The Capital's air quality index (AQI) has moved from moderate to poor to very poor over the past four days, the result of raging forest fires from Uttarakhand (and to a lesser extent, Himachal Pradesh) and winds blowing in from the northern state that has lost around 200 acres of forest to fires in the past few days./At 279, Delhi's air quality was in the ""poor"" category overall on Tuesday, which according to the Central Pollution Control Board's Sameer app means ""breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.""/""Delhi's air quality is on the poor zone as suddenly the dispersal of pollutants has gone down and pollutant load has increased because of many reasons and forest fires is probably one of them,"" said Anumita Roy Choudhary, an air quality expert with Centre for Science and Environment./It isn't just Delhi, several cities in the northern plains are facing the same problem. For example, Sharanpur in Uttar Pradesh recorded AQI of 331 on Tuesday and Yamunanagar in Haryana AQI of 289. And some areas in the foothills of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh witnessed haze like conditions on Tuesday./Uttarakhand has reported close to 100 forest fires in the last 48 hours and close to 250 in the past week. The intensity of forest fires in Himachal is lower, with close to 60 forest fires reported in the last 24 hours./Most of the forest fires are in lower hills, which have pine tree forests that shed highly immflamable needles in this season. As there is no mechanism to collect the needles, a spark can cause fire, said Himachal's forest minister Rakesh Pathania./What has further contributed to forest fires is the dry hot weather. In the month of March and in first week of April, there was 79% rain deficiency in Uttarakhand and 65% in Himachal Pradesh, according to the India Meteorological Department./A CPCB official, who asked not to be named, said that till the last week of March the wind direction was taking the smoke from forest fires towards the north, thereby not contributing much to the air pollution levels in the plains./According to an Uttarakhand pollution control board official, there has been an increase in pollution levels in even within the state because of the forest fires. ""We will be able to provide the data on the increase after few days as raw data was being analysed,"" the official said./""There are some forest fires in Uttarakhand, but air quality hasn't declined in NW India only because of that. Winds are northwesterly here. Air quality is in poor category mainly because of dust and lack of moisture. It will improve later today because a western disturbance is expected to bring rain,"" said VK Soni, scientist in IMD's air quality division./(With inputs from Jayashree Nandi)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mumbai needs to encourage the walk-to-work culture. Here's why,"India, May 20 -- Honking, traffic snarls, and high stress levels - this is exactly what commuting to work looks like for most Indian professionals, especially those living in metro cities. There are several reasons that contribute to this mess: growing population, socio-economic parameters, poor road infrastructure, and a weak transport network./""Every year, it's getting harder to get to work on time. Not just time, but it's so stressful. Neither can you focus on work properly nor is there any balance at home, because you spend all your time stuck in traffic,"" says Shreyas Sinha (36), head ofa Mumbai-based ad agency. ./Banker Ananya Keshav is also aggrieved by the traffic situation. ""Even if I leave early from the office, my time is spent on the road. There really is no space for 'me time',"" she adds./There are several solutions to address this issue, one of them being the introduction of a 'walk-to-work' culture. What this means is that residences are not too far from commercial spaces. Office-goers, therefore, save time, money, and energy spent on commuting, and can focus on improving the quality of their lives./Need for walk-to-work in Mumbai/The concept of walk-to-work is fast becoming popular in major cities. For a city like Mumbai, where so many people spend hours commuting to work, this 'one change' would make a huge difference./""All big cities around the country, especially cities like Mumbai and Delhi, have expanded their boundaries over time. With this expansion, hot spots for different uses of the city, namely residential, commercial, industrial, and educational, have been created. People are now spending more time traveling. This kind of extensive everyday travel has burdened the city infrastructure,"" says Shruti Sahariya, an architect and urban planner. Sahariya is also an Associate Member of the Institute of Town Planners, India./She adds that it takes years of planning and implementation to work at a city level, but the pandemic has brought forth the importance of walk-to-work, especially when travel is so restricted./Mumbai competes with global cities to attract and retain talent, says Rohit Tak, urban design and urban mobility expert and Fulbright scholar. According to the study Foot Traffic Ahead by the George Washington University, ""The most walkable urban metro areas have substantially higher GDPs per capita"", and this can be true about Mumbai./The question will be: how does Mumbai, as a city, support the walk-to-work policy?/""While Mumbai city's linear urban form and urban sprawl is not ideal for everyone who lives in and around Mumbai to walk to work, it is important to make walking as a popular mode to access public transit stations or bus stops,"" Tak adds./Advantages of walk-to-work/The World Health Organization has recommended weekly 150 minutes of physical activity to be fit and healthy. However, a pre-pandemic study by ICMR revealed that less than 10 percent of Indians met this recommendation, which, in turn, resulted in increased obesity, diabetes and cardiac diseases./""This has also added to transport-related air pollution and subsequent health hazards including asthma. Apart from physical health, walking as a daily routine, including going to work, can help reduce mental stress,"" explains Tak./""If cities advocate policies supporting walk-to-work, it can also lead to less traffic congestion, fewer conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians, and reduced road crash occurrences,"" he adds./Taking inspiration from global cities/For cities to support walk-to-work and make it a lifestyle, certain radical approaches supporting decentralization, density, mixed land-uses, last-mile connectivity, and policies and infrastructure advocating modal shift from automobiles to active mobility are the key./Sahariya sheds light on the half-mile concept or the neighbourhood concept, which talks about having everyday necessities at a walkable distance./""To make walk-to-work successful, one needs to incorporate all essential fabrics of the urban city. Many cities in Europe are working on making their cities more pedestrian-friendly (not limiting to only walking to work). They have been investing greatly in services & infrastructure, which is essential for a 'walk-friendly city'. It also includes continuous walkways having ramps for the differently-abled, cycle tracks, cycle parking, and facilities to rent cycles,"" she adds./The changing Mumbai/According to Tak, around 51 percent of the total mode of Mumbai consists of pedestrians and cyclists. Hence, it's easy to assume that most people in Mumbai walk on a day-to-day basis. Moreover, every citizen is a pedestrian for at least one point in a day. But this doesn't translate into better walking infrastructure, as around 58 percent of total fatalities in Mumbai consist of pedestrians./""Considering the linear mobility patterns in Mumbai, walk-to-work can only be successful if the mass transit stations including local train stations, metro stations, bus stops and mono-rail stations are well linked, with good-quality and last-mile connectivity,"" he adds./Is Mumbai, then, ready to embrace the walk-to-work culture? Could the city see more dedicated pedestrian friendly infrastructure? Will we see more complete streets that incorporate easier movement for cyclists, walkers, assisted walking, skating and other forms of walk-to-work?/In the prime commercial business district of Lower Parel, plans are afoot to facilitate this. 'One Change' is coming./Know more REPLACED./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

PMC introduces white coal option to cremate bodies,"India, June 3 -- Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is encouraging the use of white coal (briquettes) at crematoriums after those in the neighbourhood raised the issue of thick smoke and pollution./Following the rise in Covid fatalities, the use of wood to cremate bodies has increased. During the Covid pandemic peak period, PMC used white coal to cremate bodies at Vaikunth crematorium after residents complained about pollution./Now, the civic body is making efforts to provide residents the option of environmentally friendly white coal along with electrical and gas facilities at crematoriums./Of the 24 cremation facilities across the city, 10 are electrical and 13 are operating on gas. Three crematoria have both electrical and gas facilities./Residents in the neighbourhood of Vaikunth crematorium registered complaints of pollution as last rites increased due to spike in Covid cases. Later, PMC cremated 589 Covid bodies in April-May using white coal option and spent around Rs.15 lakh./Public awareness/Shriniwas Kandul, chief of the electrical department, PMC said, ""We are planning to introduce white coal option to people to cremate bodies. It is environment friendly and cost effective as compared to traditional wood. We have kept this option open at Vaikunth crematorium and have started public awareness campaigns.""/Kandul said that white coal cannot be made mandatory as people's sentiments and emotions are involved. ""We will use posters and banners which will give information about white coal use and its benefits to the environment. On public demand, we will provide white coal at Vaikunth crematorium through a supplier,"" he said./Regarding the proposal of corporators Smita Vaste and Saraswati Shendge of Navi peth-Parvati ward to provide white coal at crematoriums, Dr Kalpana Baliwat, PMC assistant medical officer said, ""The proposal was sent to health department for opinion and we had given a positive response and mentioned that it is a good environment friendly alternative to traditional firewood.""/Mangesh Dighe, PMC environment officer, said, ""It is a good alternative to save trees and protect our environment. But, we cannot make it compulsory as it involves people's sentiments. Any social change takes time just like when we started electrical and gas facilities at crematoria decades ago.""/Cost and eco-friendly/To cremate a body using traditional firewood, it takes 280 to 300 kilograms of wood. The total cost is around Rs.4,500 to Rs.5,000 along with transportation. It creates air pollution. However, white coal costs Rs.2,500 per body, generates more heat, cremation takes place faster and pollution levels are lower as compared to wood./White coal/It is biomass briquettes made from agro forestry waste, agriculture waste or biomass such as sugarcane bagasse, forestry gleanings, wood chips and shavings, castor seeds shells, rice husk and paddy straw, coir dust, wheat straw, mustard waste, bajra cobs and groundnut shells. It is gathered and compressed under large pressure into briquettes which is converted into biofuel./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Slight dip in Lucknow's air pollution due to Corona Curfew: IITR report,"India, June 4 -- HT Correspondent/<a href=""mailto:lkoreportersdesk@htlive.com"">lkoreportersdesk@htlive.com</a>/LUCKNOW Though the state capital saw a slight reduction in air pollution levels due to the Corona Curfew, Gomti Nagar remained the most polluted area of Lucknow, as per the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), which released its 'pre-monsoon-2021 report of assessment of ambient air quality of Lucknow on Friday./The RSPM concentration in the ambient air saw a decreasing trend from 2017 to 2020. This may be due to partial/complete lockdown, which may be attributed to lowered vehicular density on road, less consumption of petrol/ diesel fuel and complete/ partial closure of industrial establishments during lockdown periods, said the report./""The five years' pre-monsoon data has been compared to find out the prevailing trend of air pollution in Lucknow and a slight change in the values may be attributed to some local environmental/climatic factors and curfew restrictions imposed by the government,"" said the report./Among residential areas, Gomti Nagar recorded an average 128.7 microgram/cubic meter of the respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10) followed by Indira Nagar that recorded an average RSPM level of 124.5, in the report. The next is Vikas Nagar, with an average 117.3 RSPM level and Aliganj with lowest RSPM level of 111.9./""RSPM is of size 4 to 5 microns that settle inside human organs such as lungs when we breathe in polluted air,"" said Dr AA Mahdi, HoD, biochemistry at King George's Medical University./Among commercial areas, Charbagh with 143.8 RSPM levels remained the area with highest air pollution, followed by Alambagh 133.9, Chowk 121.1 and Aminabad 109.8. The Amausi industrial area recorded RSPM level of 152.5./The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) has kept 100 microgram/cubic meter as the optimum value of RSPM in the air while WHO kept it at a maximum 50 microgram/cubic meter. None of the areas were within the NAAQS or WHO standards./""Pollutants in the air can directly be linked to diseases such as COPD, asthma and other respiratory disorders. A secondary result could be general weakness or even premature deaths,"" said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Health City and Trauma Centre./The pre-monsoon ambient air quality assessment of Lucknow was carried out by the environmental monitoring division of CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow during April-May, 2021/PM2.5 level slightly up/The PM2.5 level, which refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, was recorded a bit more than the limit prescribed by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)./In residential areas -- Aliganj, Vikas Nagar, Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar, the 24-hour average concentrations of PM2.5 were in the range of 60.7 to 68.2 microgram/cubic meter while the NAQS prescribed limit is 60 microgram/cubic meter and WHO's 25./In commercial areas like Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk, the average concentrations of PM2.5 were in the range of 62 to 71.1 microgram/cubic meter with an average of 114.5.

80% Patnaites unaware of Clean Air Action Plan: CEED survey,"PATNA, June 13 -- Around 80% of people living in the state capital are not aware of Patna Clean Air Action Plan (PCAP) even after more than two years of its implementation, while 55% of people are not satisfied with the steps taken by the state government to control air pollution, revealed a survey report released by Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) on Saturday./CEED conducted a public perception survey titled 'How Patna perceives Air Pollution' in March and April, which involved more than 1,235 participants. The main objective of the public survey was to gauge the mood and perceptions of the people on air pollution and its impact on public health./As per survey findings, 96% of people blamed air pollution for its impact on their health, especially risks like asthma, respiratory diseases and breathing-related disorders. However, 88% of people do not know where to go and lodge complaints on polluting sources or subsequent violations./Speaking on the occasion, Mr Ramapati Kumar, CEO of CEED said, ""Patna launched a Clean Air Action Plan in 2019, however effective implementation remains a big challenge. Our study indicates that even after two years, there is a lack of transparency and accountability among departments and enforcement agencies for better implementation. The State government must put words into action to convert the grey sky into a blue sky in Patna.""/Elaborating the key recommendations of the report, Ankita Jyoti, Senior Program Officer at CEED said that, ""We need to urgently have an integrated and responsive implementation task force at the district level, which must work in a convergent and coordinated approach. The state nodal agency must bring transparency in implementation measures and must publicise adequate information regarding 'Grievance Redressal Cell' for ensuring active and collaborative participation of the people in the fight against air pollution.""/CEED also urged for active citizen and civil society participation in a collaborative manner on main stages of implementation as a part of preventive and mitigation measures./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Civic Sanskriti: Pedal power to wheel the city towards health and sustainability,"India, June 21 -- The next municipal elections are coming up in early 2022. I look forward to the manifestos and different visions for our city that the main protagonists will come up with. We hope they will respond to the public's urgent needs to heal from the Covid-19 impacts, and improve the city's natural environment./From the public's point of view, surely, traffic and transport deserve to be an election issue./As the city opens up, the same old congestion, air pollution and lack of road safety are returning, but we must do better./We would do well to generate some report cards and expectations related to walking, cycling, shared transport and the public bus service, to feed into the election manifestos./Let's focus on the cycle first, which is the most elegant, clean, sustainable mobility mode, usable by most people. It is also highly appropriate in Covid-19 times to keep us healthy and to maintain safe distance./The Cycle Plan/In December 2017, Pune became the first city in India to have a city-wide Comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan, passed by the General Body. Full marks for the plan. But, what marks should be given for implementation? It would be an achievement to be proud of at a global scale, provided Pune does comprehensive implementation!/NMT Cell/The first provision of the Cycle Plan is that the city government should have adequate and dedicated staff to implement the plan. Initially, a Bicycle Department was created. After some months, the Road Department was awarded the responsibility of implementing the Cycle Plan through a Non-motorised Transport Cell. This is appropriate since cycling infrastructure has to be part of road design./The expectation from the Road Department is that it will be a proactive lead agency to implement the cycle plan. It must coordinate with other departments and agencies like Traffic Police, PMPML and MahaMetro to ensure cycles are given space and connectivity with other mobility modes. For this, the Road Department must have adequate resources, including staff qualified in non-motorised transport planning and design./Cycle infrastructure/The most critical provision in the Cycle Plan is the creation of a safe, connected, comfortable and attractive cycle-track network of over 800 km. However, over the last three-and-a-half years, only about 25km of cycle tracks have been made./Over 800 cycle parking locations were also identified. The PMC and Traffic Police did well to put up signage for cycle parking. However, both cycle tracks and cycle parking need to be protected for cyclists' use./Monitoring and enforcement/Participatory monitoring and assessment of the cycle tracks is a provision in the Cycle Plan. Since the city government did not organise any participatory assessment, local NGO Save Pune Traffic Movement (SPTM) went ahead and conducted a survey./SPTM's study shows that in the early mornings, most cyclists prefer to use the road. Later in the day, as traffic increases, more cyclists use the cycle tracks at JM road, FC road, Ganeshkhind road and parts of Karve road./One reason cyclists ride on the carriageway is the huge number of bollards placed on the cycle tracks to prevent motorised vehicles. The cure seems worse than the disease here!/Cyclists prefer that bollards be placed only at critical locations. Neither the municipal corporation nor the traffic police have implemented the Cycle Plan provision for cycle wardens and CCTVs to monitor cycle tracks and challan the offending motorcyclists./Bicycle share/Public Bicycle Share system (PBS) is a term for a service that provides cycles to commuters without them having to own and maintain cycles. Often people mistake the Bicycle Share Scheme with the Cycle Plan./The Cycle Plan made a policy provision for multiple options of how the PBS may be run - as a government-owned system, a partially-supported or privately-run system with government regulation. In all cases, the city government has to create an inviting and facilitating environment for PBS to operate./In Pune, four private companies set up PBS services in 2017-18 with several thousand public bicycles. For a few months, it was a joy to see the yellow, green, orange and blue coloured public bicycles in many parts of the city./Unfortunately, they vanished with equal speed. The PBS was run by private companies and no taxpayers funds were used in 2017-18. The PMC needs to revive the public bicycle share system in Pune, with a different model./Ranjit Gadgil, from Parisar says, ""The dockless system introduced by private companies gave Pune the experience of PBS. The downside is that they could and did pull out when the financials didn't work out for them due to complex global financing. PBS has worked where cities themselves invested money and planning effort, such as Paris, London, New York etc. We can learn from the free pilot we got - what worked, what didn't""./Pune could be a cycling city again. Will our elected representatives give us a city-wide bicycle tracks network, cycle parking, public bicycle share and the required administrative, regulatory and public engagement mechanisms in place?/The election promise I would most like to see is, ""We will make Pune a cycling-friendly city where cycling is safe, comfortable, convenient, attractive and enjoyable""./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Cross country study finds link between air pollution and Covid-19,"Mumbai, June 25 -- Areas with poor air quality and higher emissions of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 are more likely to have Covid-19 infections and related deaths, according to a joint study by four institutes across the country. This is the first time that a pan-India study has found a direct correlation between air pollution and Covid-19./Statistical analysis established that there was a significant correlation between Covid-19 cases and PM2.5 concentrations in all states in India, with a correlation coefficient of 0.66. The correlation coefficient for PM2.5 concentrations and deaths resulting from Covid-19 was 0.61. In statistics, a correlation coefficient above 0.5 means the two data sets have a compelling correlation to each other./The study titled 'Establishing a link between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) zones and Covid-19 over India' based on anthropogenic emission sources and air quality data was published in the peer-reviewed journal Urban Climate on June 10. The study was conducted by scientists from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, National Institute of Technology Rourkela; School of Earth, Ocean and Climate Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar. It was partially funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the Government of India./""We have done a statistical analysis to see if there is any correlation between district-level air pollution data and Covid-19 cases. While there are some studies in Europe to find a correlation between the two data sets, in India there have been no prior studies to understand these correlations. Our findings suggest a significant correlation between the district level air pollution data and Covid-19 cases. We found that regions with huge amounts of fossil fuel such as petrol, diesel, and coal etc. combustion in transport and industrial activities, also experiences a lot more Covid-19 cases,"" said Saroj Kumar Sahu, lead author of the study and assistant professor at Utkal University./The study involves three kinds of data sets-National Emission Inventory (NEI) of PM2.5 for 2019, developed by the scientists; a number of Covid-19 positive case and corresponding death as of November 5, 2020, adopted from the government of India website and air quality index data (in-situ observations) collected for 16 stations across the country. The scientists divided specific areas into different hotspot zones across India. From 36 states, 16 districts were picked for the study, including Mumbai and Pune./Maharashtra recorded the second-highest emission load- 828.3 Gigagram per year (Gg/Yr) of PM2.5, after Uttar Pradesh which recorded 1138.08 Gg/year, according to the National Emission Inventory developed by the scientists. 'Between March and November 2020, Maharashtra recorded 17.19 lakhCovid-19 cases, which was the highest in the country./""However it is important to note that in terms of PM2.5 emission per person, Maharashtra is ahead of Uttar Pradesh,"" said Sahu./Among the 16 cities captured in the study, Mumbai and Pune recorded the third and fourth highest 'bad air quality days' respectively. For Mumbai, out of a total of 165 bad air quality days, 22 were very poor. Pune recorded a total of 117 bad air quality days. Parallelly, Mumbai recorded 2.64 lakh Covid-19 cases and 10,445 deaths during the period studied, which was the highest in the country while Pune recorded 3.38 lakh Covid-19 cases and 7,060 deaths. The transport and industrial sector was the major PM2.5 contributor in Maharashtra and correlated with a rise in Covid-19 cases./""What is worrying is that there is evidence that the novel coronavirus sticks to fine particles like PM2.5 allowing them to move from one part to another by making the airborne transmission of Covid-19 more effective. Through our analysis, it has become clear that rising pollution load is becoming more of a catalyst to aggravate the Covid-19 cases,"" said Sahu, adding that polluted hotspots are also triggering long-term effects and more studies are needed to understand this./Apart from Mumbai and Pune, the study also found that two other hotspots -Nagpur and Chandrapur - in Maharashtra witnessed high pollution as well as higher Covid-19 cases and casualties. Gufran Beig, senior scientist and founder project director, System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and co-author of the paper said that at hotspots within Maharashtra exposure to daily air pollution can make a person's lungs weak./""When human-induced emissions are added combined with the double impact of the Covid-19 virus, the damage to lungs will be much faster and worsen health conditions,"" said Beig./The study found that all the districts where cases of Covid-19 crossed 20,000 recorded emissions more than 200 Gg/yr of PM2.5. ""It confirms that sources of the tiny particle are fossil fuel and mostly dominated in developed and urban places,"" said the study./Sahu said the study results will help slow down the spread of the virus by providing more preventive steps and resources in areas with high pollution levels for present situations as well as for future possibilities. Among solutions, the study highlighted that there was a need to adopt cleaner technology, better transport emission norms like Bharat Stage (BS) VI at the earliest, and ensure better coal technology like ultra-supercritical power plants to reduce particulate emissions./Ashok A Shingare, member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, who was not a part of the study said, ""By and large we are aware that if there are more pollutants in the air, there is a predominance of more pneumatic diseases in those regions.

Study suggests correlation between high levels of pollution and Covid-19 deaths,"India, June 26 -- A study involving various experts from across the country found a correlation between high levels of pollution and Covid-19 deaths. The study shows that Maharashtra has recorded the second-highest annual particulate matter 2.5 emission loads in India and has also recorded the highest number of Covid-19 related deaths which indicates a link between air pollution and Covid-19, both of which directly impact the respiratory system./The study titled 'Establishing a link between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) zones and Covid -19 over India based on anthropogenic emission sources and air quality data' also provided the first evidence about how people living in highly polluted areas are vulnerable to Covid-19 infection./It is authored by Dr Saroj Kumar Sahu, PG environment sciences and Poonam Mangaraj, PG environment sciences from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar; Dr Gufran Beig, senior scientist; Suvarna Tikle, a scientist from IITM-Pune; Bhishma Tyagi, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela and V Vinoj, IIT-Bhubaneswar./In the study, Covid-19 cases were observed between March 2020 to November 2020, while national PM 2.5 emissions load were estimated from the base year 2019./For the study authors divided specific areas into different hotspot zones across India. From 16 cities across 36 states, Pune and Mumbai were the two cities picked from Maharashtra (falling under zone 6) for the study. Also, Pune and Mumbai are among the Covid-19 hotspots in the country, where high air pollution from the transport and industrial sectors are having a visible relationship with a higher number of Covid-19 cases and casualties./Dr Sahu said, ""Our findings suggest a significant correlation between the district level air pollution data and Covid-19 cases. We found that regions with huge amounts of fossil fuel such as petrol, diesel, and coal among others. combustion in transport and industrial activities, also experiences a lot more Covid-19 cases, PM2.5 are small-sized particles affecting the upper respiratory system, and Covid-19 too has shown similar health impacts.""/Air has suspended particulate matter (PM) of different sizes. Many of these are a complex mixture of dust, pollen, soot and smoke and they are hazardous. Of this, PM 2.5 is the smaller kind, with a diameter, not more than 2.5 micrometres (fine particles). PM2.5 is considered to have a very significant health impact as it can stay in the air for days or weeks, and is small enough to invade the lung airways./The study found that out of the 16 cities captured in the study, Pune and Mumbai recorded the third and fourth highest 'bad air quality days' respectively. Pune saw a total of 117 bad air quality days. Similarly, Mumbai saw 165 bad air quality days out of the total./Parallelly, Pune recorded 3.38 lakh Covid-19 cases and 7,060 deaths, while Mumbai recorded 2.64 lakh Covid-19 cases and 10,445 deaths during this period, which was the highest in the country./Dr Sahu highlighted that the study revealed that while Maharashtra was one of the leading industrialised and developed states with a high quantity of PM2.5 emissions, district-level emission estimation showed Mumbai was experiencing more pollution than Pune./Apart from Mumbai and Pune, the study also presented two other hotspots - Nagpur and Chandrapur - in Maharashtra that witnessed high pollution as well as higher Covid-19 cases and casualties./""Though these cities were not directly part of our study, both locations have the presence of industrial units and power plants that aggravate air pollution making them hotspots in Maharashtra,"" said Dr Sahu./The study identified that Maharashtra has emerged as a dominating polluting state where the road transport sector plays an important role followed by industrial, thermal power plants and biomass burning among others./Dr Sahu added, ""Through our analysis, it has become clear that rising pollution load is becoming more of a catalyst to aggravate the Covid-19 cases.""/Dr Beig, senior scientist and founder project director, System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and co-author of the paper, said that at hotspots within Maharashtra exposure to daily air pollution can make a person's lungs weak./""When human-induced emissions are added combined with the double impact of the Covid-19 virus, the damage to lungs will be much faster and worsen health conditions,"" he said./Ashok A Shingare, member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), said, ""By and large we are aware that if there are more pollutants in the air, there is a predominance of more pneumatic diseases in those regions.

"Vehicular emissions in Mumbai double in five years, says study","Mumbai, June 29 -- The transport sector's contribution to air pollution in the city has almost doubled in the last five years, reveals a new study by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), an initiative under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, which is under the Union ministry of earth sciences./The study, conducted over one year between 2019 and 2020, shows that vehicular emissions contributed 30.5% of all PM2.5 particles in Mumbai during the study period. This is up from 16% contributed by the same sector in 2016-17, as per a previous source apportionment study conducted by SAFAR./PM2.5 refers to small, ultrafine particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter, which can enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system and travel throughout the body, causing health problems such as asthma, lung cancer and heart disease. PM2.5 is made up of hundreds of different chemicals and is emitted by a range of sources, from construction work to industrial smokestacks, power plants, open fires and automobiles./According to SAFAR, other prominent sources of PM2.5 in Mumbai include the industries and power sector, which contributed 18% of the city's overall PM2.5 pollution load. Another 15% came from domestic sources - such as residential cooking practices in slums, burning of garbage, wood, cow dung and other cheap fuels./Windblown dust (referring to transboundary pollutants originating outside of the city) made up another 15% of PM2.5 pollutants, while the remaining 21.5% is estimated to have come from an amalgam of sources, including solid waste plants, brick kilns, crematoria, aviation and various miscellaneous activities./A similar source estimation for PM2.5 pollutants by SAFAR in 2016-17 had shown transport accounted for 16% of this distribution, while industry and power was the biggest contributor at 36%. Domestic sources of PM2.5 made up 27% of the inventory, while the share of windblown dust was 21%./Experts said this trend is indicative of the substantial threat posed by vehicles powered by conventional, non-renewable fuels like petrol and diesel. Such vehicles have exploded in number on city streets in the past decade. Gufran Beig, senior scientist and the founding project director of SAFAR, said, ""This (trend) is a combination of both an increase in the number of vehicles in Mumbai and more stagnation at traffic junctions leading to congestion.""/While all major Indian cities have witnessed a significant rise in the number of vehicles over the past decade, Beig pointed out that cities like Delhi have pushed for the adoption of compressed natural gas (CNG), in both public transport and private vehicles. ""The uptake of clean fuel has been very less across Mumbai. The majority of the vehicles continue to be petrol and diesel,"" he said./As per data with the Maharashtra transport department, Mumbai has already registered at least 40 lakh new vehicles, a threshold which it crossed earlier this year. Of these, 11.6 lakh are private cars and 24 lakh are two-wheelers. This is up from 30.69 lakh vehicles registered by 2016-17, and 20.28 lakh vehicles in 2011-12. A recent, state-wide economic survey estimated that there are roughly about 2,000 vehicles per kilometre of road in Mumbai. As the city gets more congested and more vehicles idle in traffic, the more emissions they generate./That automobiles are a significant threat to clean air in the city was highlighted as early as 1982, when the Indian Journal of Environmental Protection had published a study titled Level of Air Pollution in Bombay. ""The urgent task is to reduce the number of cars and their movement in the city. It should not be difficult to provide an efficient public transport system,"" the study said./Though Mumbai's favourable position along the coastline helps in the quick dispersal of pollutants, experts have expressed concern over the SAFAR study's findings. ""We may soon approach a natural tipping point where environmental buffers will not make any difference to the overall pollution scenario. A sector-wise plan to tackle emissions at source is needed,"" said Beig./Commenting on the preliminary results, Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, said, ""Even though we have to see the exact numbers, the source apportionment analysis seems logical in identifying the transport sector as a rapidly growing source."" She also pointed out that the increase in vehicles coincides with a slowdown in the establishment of new industries and power plants around Mumbai, which is consistent with SAFAR's findings./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Are India's urban poor using clean cooking fuel?,"India, July 6 -- With increased urbanisation, India is experiencing acute air pollution in its urban centres. Slum-dwellers are doubly affected, both by the higher concentration of particulate matter in urban areas as well as indoor air pollution from the use of unclean cooking fuels. With more than 13.7 million people living in slums in country (Census 2011), there is a strong impetus to understand the use of clean cooking fuels in such households./Existing literature on energy access and use in slums across developing countries assume that energy infrastructure is available in these settlements as they are situated in urban environments (Butera et al. 2016). Household air pollution (HAP) has an estimated average contribution of 30-50% to ambient air quality across India's urban and rural areas (Balakrishnan et al. 2019). Addressing biomass burning for cooking, water heating, and space heating during the winter has the potential to help reach the national ambient air quality standards (Chowdhury et al. 2019)./However, our analysis shows that a large share of these households do not have access to clean fuels due to lack of affordability or patchy supply. In this brief, we discuss access to clean cooking energy in urban slums across six states (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh). These states have a low socio-demographic index and a high disease burden due to air pollution (Balakrishnan et al. 2019)./The findings of this brief are based on a primary survey conducted in rural areas and urban slums in these states - Cooking Energy Access Survey 20201. The analysis focusses on the fuel use patterns of households, the extent of use of LPG and solid fuels, fuel stacking behaviour, and the primary cook's perception of various cooking fuels and their health impacts./1. Households using LPG as their only fuel/While most urban slum households have an LPG connection, exclusive use of LPG is limited to just over half of the total households. The household's economic status (measured through asset ownership) and their access to doorstep delivery of LPG refills are two critical factors that determine their ability to use LPG exclusively. We found that households with higher asset ownership have significantly higher odds of using LPG as an exclusive fuel./2. Households stacking LPG with polluting fuels/Although schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) have helped increase LPG adoption, this has not resulted in the complete replacement of biomass-based fuels. Despite 86% of households having an LPG connection, the data shows that over a third of slum households are stacking with polluting fuels (including firewood, dung cakes, agricultural residue, charcoal, and kerosene). Most of these households use polluting fuels daily or at least weekly, which increases their exposure to household air pollution./Among the households stacking LPG with polluting fuels, the reasons for stacking vary: Affordability, free-of-cost availability of biomass, seasonality, and taste preferences. Across asset quintiles, we find that stacking is highest among the middle categories (second and third quintile), though most households in these categories have adopted LPG. Still, the affordability of the fuel remains a significant concern. One-fourth of households who are stacking polluting fuels have a median annual refill rate of eight cylinders and above (same as exclusive LPG users), despite having a similar household size as those using LPG exclusively. Most of such households fall in the wealthiest asset quintiles and use a chulha (mud stove) for cooking chapatis or vegetables, suggesting that they are not necessarily using unclean fuels due to the unaffordability of LPG, but due to other factors like taste./2.1 Non-cooking uses of polluting fuels/Despite using LPG as the primary fuel for their cooking needs, households that stack fuels use polluting fuels for non-cooking purposes like heating water for bathing (29%) and space heating (10%)./2.2 Seasonal variations in fuel use/Most households (88%) use LPG as their primary fuel in the rainy season, while in winters, less than 45% of households do so. The increased use of polluting fuels in winter could be because during these months, the polluting fuel requirement for non-cooking tasks within the household like water heating for bathing and space heating increases - which leads to the increased use of polluting fuels for cooking as well. Unfortunately, the increased use of polluting fuels in winters exposes households to the double burden of high ambient and household air pollution due to unfavourable atmospheric conditions./3. Households using only polluting fuels/Despite large-scale government initiatives like PMUY, 12% of urban slum households do not use LPG and rely on polluting fuels. While most of these households are aware of PMUY, the high upfront LPG connection cost, along with the high recurring expenditure on refills, deter them from procuring an LPG connection./Way forward/While we see a progressive change in households' energy-use patterns as we move from rural to urban, issues like affordability, availability, preference, seasonality, and the end-uses of the fuel remain essential factors that determine household fuel choice. Understanding user categories and fuel use patterns is crucial in enabling access to and sustained use of clean cooking fuels. Also, it is vital to recognise the implications of cooking being a gendered activity. However, women's participation in intra-household decision-making regarding LPG use is limited./Despite being in urban areas, 37% of slum households do not receive home delivery of cylinders - availability is an essential factor that determines the household's likelihood of using LPG exclusively. To increase LPG use, oil and marketing companies (OMCs) and distributors need to improve home delivery of LPG refills in slum areas./Emissions from household sources contribute hugely to the surrounding air quality (Harish et al. 2019), which is already poor in congested slum areas. Majority of households cook inside the main house without a chimney indicating high exposure to pollution from the use of unclean fuels for cooking./Integrate the issue of lack of access to clean cooking energy with urban poverty./This study reiterates the need to look at poverty in urban areas in the context of energy access. The vulnerability of urban slum-dwellers needs to be accounted for while designing and implementing policies, including social protection schemes. Given the health and economic impacts of pollution, access to clean cooking energy schemes must be integrated with the social assistance programmes of other ministries (e.g., health, education, and nutrition assistance) to better target support for slum households. Government programmes such as the National Urban Livelihoods Mission and social service allocations for housing should use existing targeting approaches to include access to clean cooking energy within their ambit of services for the poor./The economic impact of Covid-19 will push households into energy poverty, leading to the increased use of free-of-cost biomass - consequently increasing the risk of exposure to emissions from fuel burning. While the government has announced that it will provide up to three free refills under the PM-Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme to all PMUY households, less than a quarter of households in urban slums have Ujjwala connections - effectively making them ineligible for relief support. There is a need to expand the reach of PMUY to cover all slum households./Bring renewed emphasis on clean cooking during Covid-19/Increased poverty would mean increased use of polluting fuels - there is a need for a renewed emphasis on clean cooking energy access during the Covid-19 pandemic as increased use of polluting fuels has health implications (lower respiratory infections and coronary chronic obstructive disease (COPD) that increase the risk of Covid-19 infections being more severe./You can download the academic study by clicking here/(The study has been authored by Shaily Jha, Sasmita Patnaik, and Rithima Warrier)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi rolls out graded plan for Covid-19 curbs,"New Delhi, July 9 -- Private offices, malls, weekly markets and the Metro will be shut down in Delhi if the test positivity rate (TPR) rises above 2%, and the city will be put under a curfew if the number breaches 5%, according to a new Covid-19 action plan approved by authorities that sets clear thresholds for curbs that kick in from as low as 0.5% TPR in order to scuttle an outbreak./The graded response action plan, which harks back to a similar mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months, was drafted by an expert committee formed by the Delhi government and approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)./It classifies outbreak severity into four bands - yellow, amber, orange and red - with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it./""In today's DDMA meeting, 'Graded Response Action Plan' was approved. There will now be no confusion regarding when lockdown is to be imposed and when scaled down. In the meeting, we also had discussions on Delta+ variant. We have to protect Delhi from spread of this variant (of the virus), for which the government is taking all necessary actions,"" chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting./The colour-coded classifications take into account three factors: the test positivity rate over two consecutive days, new cases over a seven-day period, and the average weekly hospital occupancy rate (see box)./Had such rules been in place prior to the April wave of infections in the Capital, a lockdown would have been put into place 10 days sooner than it was - the city crossed the 5% threshold for what is now the red alert category on April 9. A full lockdown was announced only on April 19./To be sure, the test positivity rate in the Capital has been 0.12% over the past two days, there have been 580 cases in the last seven days and, over the last week, the number of hospital beds occupied has reduced form a little over 620 to 450 on Friday./""Now that this plan is going to be in view of the public, there will be a sense of certainty and accountability on our part towards the people of Delhi. The plan descriptively elaborates upon when the lockdown will be imposed and when it will be lifted. This kind of a graded plan should be adopted at the national level as well. We can't let our guard down, the preparation for the road map of an impending third (nationwide) wave (of Covid-19) is being worked upon consistently by the Delhi government,"" Kejriwal said in a press statement./The chief minister is the vice-chairperson of the DDMA, which is headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal./A senior official in Baijal's office, who asked not to be named, said: ""After detailed deliberations and presentations made by the health department of the Delhi government and the Indian Council of Medical Research, it was decided to notify the graded response action plan that will objectively and transparently ensure an institutional and automatic response with regards to enforcement measures, lock downs and unlock based on criteria such as test positivity rate and quantum of cases.""/According to the plan, seen by HT, the first of curbs are triggered when the positivity rate crosses 0.5%, or new cases over a week exceeds 1,500, or if there are more than 500 oxygen beds occupied on average over a seven-day period./Once any of these thresholds are breached, the city is under a yellow alert mechanism in which non-essential shops are allowed to open only on an odd-even basis, a night curfew comes into force, and offices are required to move half of their staff to a work-from-home function./If test positivity, case numbers and hospitalisations rise further, the amber alert comes into effect. In this scenario, some venues and activities are completely halted: parks need to close, barber shops cannot open, and dining in at restaurants will be prohibited (as will the opening of bars). Amber alert is when TPR rises above 1%, or if there are more than 3,500 cases over a week, or if oxygen bed occupancy surpasses 700./The next alert level, orange, takes effect if TPR breaches 2%, the number of new cases in a week goes beyond 9,000, or if the average number of oxygen beds occupied over the week goes beyond 3,000. In this scenario, private offices, malls, Metro rail services and weekly markets will be shut down./In the most severe red alert category (if TPR is above 5%, cumulative weekly case above 16,000 or hospital occupancy above 3,000), there will be a 24-hour curfew with people allowed outside only for essential services. In this scenario, all offices engaged in non-essential work need to shift to a completely work-from-home functioning./The new mechanism also makes it mandatory for incoming passengers in the national capital to produce a certificate of full vaccination (both doses) or a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours if Delhi is on red alert. People coming by air from states with positivity rate higher than 5%, or if they come by any mode of transport from a state with positivity rate is of 10% or more, irrespective of the alert applicable in Delhi, too, will be subjected to the same requirements./People coming from a state where a new variant is found spreading, irrespective of the nature of alert in Delhi at that point, will also need to show vaccination certificates or a negative test, the documents said./Friday's DDMA meeting was also attended by Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog, Dr Balram Bhargav of ICMR, Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, and Dr SK Singh of NCDC, said the official in the L-G's office./Experts welcomed the response plan. Dr Charu Hans, the head of the department of microbiology at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences, said: ""Such anticipatory actions are likely to prevent any delays and avoid confusion, and conceivably lead to effective preventive measures in limiting the spread of Covid-19 disease. The experience gained in the last two waves of the disease and learning about mutations of the virus have enabled the government to come up with such a strategy. This strategy can play an important role in limiting the impact of a potential third wave.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Neurological disorder incidence has doubled in Punjab: ICMR study,"India, July 15 -- Chandigarh Neurological disorders like stroke, headaches, and epilepsy have doubled in Punjab over the past 30 years, experts in field have found after research./The empirical result that has been established is that in 1990, 4% of all disorders were neurological disorders; in 2019, this percentage doubled to 8%. Neurological disorders affect the brain and nerves, especially in the spinal cord./The Indian Council of Medical Research and the Public Health Foundation of India conducted the research./Their findings have been published under the title 'The burden of neurological disorders across states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2019' in one of the leading global medical journals, Lancet Global Health, on July 14 (Wednesday), under the name of India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative./The study aimed at increasing awareness about these disorders, early identification, cost-effective treatment, and rehabilitation./Speaking on the trend of neurological disabilities in Punjab, Dr Gagandeep Singh, professor, Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, said, ""The burden of non-communicable neurological disorders is increasing across the country. In Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh, these spread mainly due to the ageing population. Communicable diseases contributed to the majority of total neurological disorders burden in children younger than five years, non-communicable neurological disorders were the highest contributor in all other age groups.""/""Among other neurological disorders - stroke, headache, and epilepsy are the leading contributors in Punjab. The state has lower disability burden due to stroke, when compared to the national average, but residents of Punjab have higher incidence of headache and epilepsy disorders, as compared to the national average,"" he said./""There is, however, a need to scale up the treatment coverage of epilepsy in governmental schemes such as the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram and Ayushman Bharat. Policies and practices focusing on safe births, preventing head injury and stroke would help in averting a substantial proportion of epilepsies,"" Dr Gagandeep added./He cautioned that high blood pressure, air pollution, dietary risks, high-fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index are increasing the risk of neurological problems in adults./Dr Dheeraj, professor, department of neurology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, who was also part of the study, said, ""Hypertension is very common among Punjab residents, as a result of which neurological disorders have also doubled. The state is making efforts to create awareness about stroke due to which, lower number of deaths were reported due to this disease.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

PMC presents six-point action plan to central government to improve air quality,"India, July 15 -- PUNE The Central government's Ministry of environment forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) has reviewed an action plan to improve air quality in Pune./The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has presented an plan based on six action points of the ministry./On Thursday, Dr Prashant Gargava, member and Naresh Gangwar, joint secretary the ministry held a video conference call, with all the environment, forest and climate change ministry officials of the states, and representatives of cities, included in the central government's plan to improve air quality./The Central government has disbursed Rs.134 crore to the PMC to improve air quality. The amount has been given to Pune, PCMC, Pune and Khadki cantonment area./As per central government guidelines, cities have to submit a time-bound programme to develop year-wise targets on ambient air quality for 2020-25, based on annual average concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2.5./Mangesh Dhighe, environment officer of the corporation said, ""We have already started working on the plan which was submitted to the ministry.""/He added, ""Pune city's air quality is moderate. Under the national clean air programme (NCAP), we are working on six components to improve air quality, such as mechanical sweepers, water sprinklers, awareness education activities, creating green corridors and electrical crematoriums.""/""In meeting, officials instructed us to use other local-level funds to improve air quality of the city and not only use central government grants for this programme,"" he added./Pratap Jagtap, sub-regional officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control board (MPCB), said, ""It was a review meeting about action taken by cities to improve air quality. Pune corporation has taken all necessary steps to improve the air quality and we are monitoring the system.""/City's air quality is determined by five components: PM 2.5, fine particulate matter; PM 10, particulate matter in the air with a diameter of 10mm or less, including smoke, dust, soot, salts, acids, and metals; ozone (O3), highly reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms; nitrogen dioxide (NO2), highly reactive gases and carbon monoxide./The central government has given instructions to take measures to control vehicular emissions, road dust re-suspension, biomass burning, control of industrial air pollution, treatment of construction and demolition waste, air quality monitoring network strengthening, monitoring of diesel generator sets, and shifting to liquefied petroleum gas from solid fuels./PMC action plan includes:/* Formulation of city-specific plan for e-mobility and rapid augmentation of the charging infrastructure/* Execution of city specific plantation plans/* Gradual transition to e-mobility in the two-wheeler sector and specific allocations for creating a venture capital fund for e-mobility. Government-run buses for public transport, private buses, and three-wheelers to be converted to EVs and government office fleets older than 15 years to be shifted to EVs/* Maintenance and repair of roads on priority/* Introduce mechanical sweepers. SOP for addressing issue of disposal of the collected dust from mechanical sweeping/* Treated water sprinkling system with PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipeline along the roads and at intersecting road junctions; and spraying of water twice a day before peak traffic hours./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Civic Sanskriti: Historical core city of Pune needs an election push for devp,"India, July 20 -- PUNE Pune's core city, like many historical cities built before motorcycles and cars were invented, has many people- and environment-friendly features. The street network with small block sizes makes it easy to walk around./Despite the density, you find sitting platforms, locally known as paars, around peepal and banyan trees that provide quiet spaces to relax. You can enjoy a chai and misal and watch the bustle of commercial activity and modernity amid heritage./The core city also has heritage temples and ghats, traditional occupations of Kumbhars (potters), Tambats (brass and copper workers) at Tambat Ali, bamboo artisans at Burud Ali. Tulshi Baug is still a popular shopping street selling specialised household products. Such precincts have a character that no other place in Pune has./Unfortunately, new developments in the last few decades are erasing the core city's unique fabric. The hustle-bustle has turned into congestion. People avoid visiting the core city for shopping for traditional items like saris and jewellery./According to Sujit Patwardhan, founder Trustee of Parisar, ""There are broadly two visions for the core area's future. One that sees it as no different from the rest of the city, and the other, that values the historic and cultural qualities that need to be preserved.""/There is an even more serious consequence. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has recently published its study of air pollutants in Pune. Dr Gufran Beig, Principal Lead Author of the report cautions, ""The Emissions Inventory study shows a very high level of emission in Pune's core city. Pune's high-altitude location helps in slower conversion of emissions to pollutants as compared to plain areas. However, looking at the high emission level and rate of increase, the time is not far when the advantage of being high altitude would be lost after emissions cross a tipping point and Pune will also witness high air pollution. Transport is the source of over 45% of emissions of most toxic PM2.5. Better to act now to reduce emissions./Tiny pollutant particles enter the lungs, causing respiratory illnesses. Some particles are small enough to pass through the lungs into the bloodstream affecting the brain, heart and kidneys. Children, pregnant women, older people, those with cardiovascular ailments are at greater risk. Air pollution is also known to increase the severity of the Covid-19 disease./Pune Municipal Corporation and Traffic Police must take note of the IITM Emissions Inventory and take urgent steps to reduce air pollution in the core city./Fortunately, the PMC, with great foresight, has already got a few different plans - the Comprehensive Mobility Plan, Bicycle Plan, Parking Policy, Pune Streets Programme, and Urban Street Design Guidelines. Initiatives introducing minibuses and electric vehicles have been in the news recently./Imagine the attractive, calmer, and healthier environment the core city could have with these provisions implemented in true letter and spirit:/Attractive street design/Beautiful designs for about 25 km of core city streets were prepared under the Pune Streets Programme with footpaths, vending zones, rickshaw stands, and easy bus movement. In addition, a walking plaza, greenery and neatly arranged street vending zones were designed reflecting the unique character of Laxmi Road./Architect Prasanna Desai and PVP College Architecture students had conceptualized an ""open-air mall"" design for Laxmi Road. If traffic-clogged roads can be freed up, people can enjoy the core city ambience, its cultural activities, restaurants, and of course, shopping!/We can learn from similar projects at Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh in Delhi, which are more crowded than Pune's core city. Amsterdam, London, Paris, Stockholm and many others have decongested inner-city areas to improve liveability and economy./Shuttles/Shuttle services with CNG or electric minibuses or share-rickshaws would help cut the noise and air pollution. Shuttles would ease mobility within the core city and connect to the metro, major bus stops, and parking lots./Traffic re-routing/The Comprehensive Mobility Plan recommended an inner ring road of sorts by streamlining traffic movement along JM Road, Shastri Road, Shankar Sheth Road, Nehru Road. As a result, traffic that is not destined for the core city need not enter it but can go around. Traffic re-routing and restricted timings for vehicle movement would be a boon for residents in the Peth areas to reduce vehicular pollution./Parking management/Vehicles parked on the road eat up one or two lanes of precious road space, making bus movement, cycling and even walking difficult./Studies show that most of the parked vehicles are of shop employees, leaving very little for customers. Pay-n-park can ensure that long-term parking is shifted to parking lots and on-street parking is utilized efficiently./Paid parking facilities exist in and near the core city. With free parking available on the road, they are not much used. In some parking lots, other businesses have come up! This situation should be corrected as recommended in the CMP./With good bus connectivity, shuttles and cycle-safe roads in place, people coming to the core area every day for work could leave their bike or car behind. It is an adjustment people will have to make not to increase pollution and cause health problems for themselves and others./All we need is for PMC to implement these projects already envisaged in city plans. Public deliberations among residents, businesses, institutions, the wider public and PMC are needed so that proposals are well-understood, tried out and fine-tuned for the public's needs./Lockdown losses, urgent health concerns, and the longer-term need for heritage-sensitive modernization call for authentic leadership from elected officials and the administration. Such a project to heal, nurture and celebrate Pune's historical core city must find a place in election manifestos./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

""Why were environmental laws flouted, and what is the outcome of the crores of taxpayers' money spent on study tours for waste management?"" the petition has asked./107% more cases of pneumonia in Dadumajra/The petitioner stated that Dadumajra/Dhanas had 107% more cases of pneumonia in 2020 as compared to all the other colonies in Chandigarh./The petitioner pointed out that the ""wretched quality of air and life in the area is further aggravated by the frequent toxic fires in the mountain of garbage that is only getting higher by the day. With the MC able to process a mere 13.36% of the waste dumped here last year, and only 16.09% from January to May in 2021, the problem of unprocessed garbage is threatening to swamp the Dadumajra area""./""It is also leading to increased incidents of fire in the dump that the office of the medical officer of health (MOH) is neither able to prevent nor explain. The fire in March this year lasted a week and covered the entire city in a haze, hindering visibility and causing respiratory issues among people in the vicinity,"" said the petition./The petitioner accused the MOH of ""willfully failing"" to manage the waste, the fires, and the health of the people in the area./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

System to give Delhi precise data on air pollution sources,"India, July 23 -- This year, a new system is likely to begin pinpointing the precise sources of air pollution in Delhi, which can potentially help authorities turn their attention to specific triggers, according to the people behind the project./The Decision Support System (DSS), a pollution tracking model developed by the scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, aims to identify the contribution of known sources, such as vehicle tailpipe emissions, road dust, and farm fires, in real time./The system will plug into existing networks of air quality monitors, and leverage tagging of pollution sources - including details of where they are - to determine previously unknown details about Delhi's air./Sachin Ghude, in-charge of IITM's air quality early warning system and the head of the DSS project, and Gaurav Govardhan, who has developed DSS, said that this will be the first real time pollution source monitoring system to be used for Delhi./""Currently, we are conducting trials to further advance the accuracy of this source monitoring model. Our aim is that it starts producing realtime data by October this year, when the stubble burning season starts,"" Ghude said./Explaining how the model will work, Ghude said each pollution source in Delhi has been tagged with details of how much pollutants they contribute in Delhi's air in real time./""We have tagged each pollution source in Delhi. With this, at any given time we will be able to know which pollution sources are acting up and how much are they contributing. We will also be assessing where these sources are located,"" Ghude said. This, for instance, will help determine if the air is bad due to traffic or because of smoke from farm fires at a particular time, he said./Every year, from October to November, fumes from crop residue set alight by farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh engulf the national capital and its surrounding areas, making the air hazardous to breathe. This has required the Capital to issue restrictions on construction work and halve the number of private cars on the roads via the odd-even system./The problem becomes acute during and in the run-up to winter, when winds die down and pollutants settle closer to the city's surface, invariably manifesting as a brown haze./Despite mitigation measures that have intensified over the past five years, the region has made little improvement in being able to control the problem. In March this year, a report by Swiss technology company IQAir ranked Delhi as the world's most polluted capital in the year 2020./Last year, Delhi recorded 92 ""severe"" and ""very poor"" air quality days during winter, compared to 80 in 2019./Last year, the central government formed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi and adjoining areas to tackle the problem and create a unified mechanism. But the measure made little difference and the body was disbanded earlier this year./The most significant movements in understanding Delhi's pollution problem came in 2016, when a source apportionment study was conducted by IIT-Kanpur and in 2018, in a study by The Energy Resources Institute (TERI) to identify major pollution contributors./But these were still not dynamic. IITM scientists said eight pollution sources identified by TERI in a report in 2018 have been tagged and contributions of these will be monitored./The model will also identify pollution sources from 19 districts across NCR./""This model was developed on the request of CAQM but since that has seized to exist, the developments highlighted through our system will be monitored by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Realtime data will be available for policy makers as well as the public. They can keep a tab on it through our existing air quality early warning system,"" Ghude said./A senior CPCB official said the body is trying to improve the mechanism of identifying the pollution sources in Delhi-NCR so that a holistic winter action plan can be executed based on these inputs. ""It is a little early to comment on this from our end, but we are getting the best minds on-board so that the action against pollution sources can be quick and effective during winter season.

Delhi working to set up over 37k Covid-19 beds for next wave of infections: Satyendar Jain,"New Delhi, Aug. 6 -- The national capital will have over 37,000 dedicated beds in hospitals, makeshift facilities, and Covid Care Centres (CCC) for Covid-19 patients in the event of another wave of the infection, state health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday, as he outlined the Delhi government's plans to scuttle any further outbreak of the disease, and warned that the city will be put under lockdown if the test positivity rate crosses 5%./Speaking at a virtual discussion organised by ASSOCHAM on preparations for the third wave of the infection - which would be Delhi's fifth, Jain said the state is conducting 75,000 Covid-19 tests a day and 'aggressively' tracing contacts to keep another outbreak at bay./""All measures necessary are being taken, and health infrastructure is being ramped up to unprecedented levels, with more than 37,000 dedicated beds being built for the fight against Covid-19,"" said Jain. Makeshift hospitals have been set up in Chhattarpur, Sant Nirankari Colony, and Ram Leela Maidan, which will add more than 1,200 intensive care unit beds, with and without ventilators./In documents submitted to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal in the third week of June, officials of the Delhi government reassessed their projections for potential infections during the next possible wave of Covid-19, and divided the outbreak into two scenarios -between 37,000 and 45,000 new infections in the city every day./Since then, the state government has also outlined a colour-coded graded response action plan, which sets clear thresholds for curbs that kick in from a test positivity rate as low as 0.5% in order to thwart an outbreak./The plan harks back to a similar mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months and classifies outbreak severity into four bands - yellow, amber, orange and red - with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it./The government is also taking measures to ensure that there is no shortfall in oxygen, and said the state is building and supporting infrastructure such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and other oxygen plants in Delhi hospitals, Jain said during the discussion on Thursday./He said that the Delhi government is providing subsidies to build oxygen plants and facilities to store liquid medicine oxygen./Speaking about the second wave, he said, ""We were caught off guard because of oxygen shortages and logistical issues of procuring it. But now, over 50 oxygen plants have already been built and more are coming up so that such a problem doesn't rise again.""/He said, ""In Delhi, 75,000 tests are still being carried out every day and aggressive contact tracing is still on to ensure that the situation remains under control. We have made public what our response will be. If the positivity rate now goes up to 5%, then we will go for an immediate lockdown without delay,"" said Jain./To be sure, the test positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% for 77 days, going back to May 20, when the city's fourth wave of infections began to ebb, and cases began to fall./Experts regard the test positivity as an essential statistic to gauge the spread of an infection in a region, and the trajectory of this number can indicate if cases will rise or fall in the future./""Cases are increasing again in the United States, so we must not drop our guard at this point. All possible efforts are being made to ensure that a third wave doesn't come and if at all it comes, we are to be prepared for the worst,"" Jain added/./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

IPCC report on climate: The five big takeaways,"India, Aug. 10 -- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s latest report on the physical science of the climate crisis has evoked a sense of fear and hopelessness among both the scientific community and people in general./IPCC's findings, put forth in over 3,949 pages of analysis from over 14,000 scientific papers, holds up the mirror on how human influence alone has caused the present crisis and there is no getting away from future warming of at least 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 10 to 20 years./IPCC's report is based on robust science with attribution studies that clearly link human influence to extreme weather events; paleoclimatic data that help understand how climatic changes in the 21st century are different from the past; and advanced models which tell us how once-in-50-year heat extremes will jump by 8.6 times at 1.5 degrees Celsius warming./This is why most findings and projections in the IPCC report are ""high confidence"". Coming ahead of the United Nations (UN) Climate negotiations in November, world leaders can be squarely blamed for catastrophe if they fail to collectively respond to IPCC's report./HT lists five key takeaways from the IPCC report which make it ""code red for humanity""./Why one cannot doubt IPCC's projections anymore/IPCC's sixth assessment report on Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis is the most updated science on climate crisis. IPCC is highly confident of its findings because observational capabilities have vastly improved since the AR5 cycle in 2014./The AR6 has used several recently instigated satellite measurement techniques - for example, high-vertical-resolution profiles of temperature and humidity in the upper troposphere and stratosphere from the early 2000s using global navigation satellite systems, which provide estimates of most recent atmospheric warming. There are improved measurements of ocean heat content, warming of the land surface, ice sheet mass loss, and sea level changes./Developments in the latest generation climate and Earth system models, which include representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, have led to better simulation of climate crisis indicators./IPCC has also used reconstruction of past climate trends from paleoclimatic archives. Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates, prior to the widespread availability of instrumental records according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Various evidence from the environment is studied for this such as skeletons of tropical coral reefs, glaciers and ice caps, laminated sediments from lakes etc./One of the most interesting features of IPCC report is however attribution. The attribution of extreme weather events to human influence (including greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and land-use changes) has substantially advanced. This basically means that the scientific community can now attribute extreme precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones etc to human influence./Some recent hot extreme events would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system, the IPCC said. A few events, for example, extreme rainfall events in the United Kingdom (UK), heat waves in Australia, or Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas in 2017, have been heavily studied./Many highly impactful extreme weather events have not been attributed, particularly in the developing world where studies are generally lacking. ""Scientists at IPCC are no longer coy about telling us clearly that climate change is caused by human activities. In fact, they go as far as to 'attribute' climate change to specific extreme weather impacts. This is important because till now we have only been able to understand climate change impacts in terms of the increased frequency of such events in the world. But now, we know with greater certainty the role of climate change in, say, the extreme heat event in Canada or wildfire in Greece or the floods in Germany. No more ifs or buts,"" said Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment in a statement./Fossil fuel emissions have already irreversibly impacted the planet/Each of the past four decades has been warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850./Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 degrees Celsius higher than 1850-1900 and global surface temperature was 1.09 degrees Celsius higher in 2011-2020 than 1850-1900 or the pre-industrial period. ""It is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions contributed to a warming of 1 degrees Celsius to 2 degrees Celsius, other human drivers, principally aerosols, contributed a cooling of 0.0 degrees Celsius to 0.8 degrees Celsius,"" the IPCC report said. It added that it was extremely likely that human influence led to global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019; changes in rainfall patterns, seal level rise and warming./The report has also flagged that the climate crisis has caused certain impacts globally which are irreversible and will continue to affect us in future. Greenhouse gas emissions since 1750 have already committed the global ocean to future warming including upper ocean stratification (vertical changes in sea water density), ocean acidification (decrease in ph value of oceans) and ocean deoxygenation (low oxygen zones in the oceans) - this will continue to increase in the 21st century. The rate at which these intensify will depend on emission trends./Mountain and polar glaciers will also continue melting for decades or centuries, the IPCC said with ""very high confidence"". Continued ice loss over the 21st century is virtually certain for the Greenland Ice Sheet and for the Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is also certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century./IPCC has also attributed all of these changes to human influence without mincing words. The basic physics underlying the warming effect of greenhouse gases on the climate has been understood for more than a century, and our current understanding has been used to develop the latest generation climate models. Like weather forecasting models, climate models represent the state of the atmosphere on a grid and simulate its evolution over time based on physical principles. They include a representation of the ocean, sea ice and the main processes important in driving climate and climate change. Results consistently show that such climate models can only reproduce the observed warming when including the effects of human activities, in particular the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, IPCC explained./IPCC warns of extremely rare but catastrophic events for the first time/For the first time, IPCC has also warned of some high impact events which are unlikely but if they do occur, they will be catastrophic. Low likelihood, high-impact outcomes may arise from a series of very large volcanic eruptions that could substantially alter the 21st century climate trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections that the IPCC has considered. IPCC considers five socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) which are essentially possible paths of growth human societies could follow over the next century./These are events whose probability of occurrence is very low but whose potential impacts on society and ecosystems are very high. To better inform risk assessment and decision making, such low likelihood outcomes are described as they may be associated with very high levels of risk, the report said./Even at levels of warming within the very likely range, global and regional low-likelihood outcomes might occur, such as large changes in rainfall patterns, additional sea level rise associated with collapsing ice sheets, or abrupt ocean circulation changes. For example, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation (AMOC), which also influences the southwest monsoon, is unlikely to experience an abrupt collapse before 2100. ""If it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle.the probability of these low-likelihood outcomes increases with higher global warming levels.""/With increasing global warming, some very rare extremes and some compound events (multivariate or concurrent extremes) with low likelihood in past and current climate will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance that events unprecedented are recorded./India is facing a unique situation due to air pollution particles/It is very likely that anthropogenic aerosols weakened the regional monsoon circulations over South Asia, East Asia and West Africa during the second half of the 20th century, thereby offsetting the expected strengthening of monsoon rains in response to global warming. The present trends in monsoon rains are dominated by the effect of aerosols./Anthropogenic aerosols are nothing but air pollution particles which scatter solar radiation. They decrease evaporation and have a cooling effect on surface temperatures. The aerosols are masking the effect of global warming on rise in monsoon rain and surface temperatures./When asked if air pollution over the South Asian region including India is reducing the severe effects of climate crisis, R Krishnan, Director, Centre for Climate Change Research at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and IPCC author said: ""Air pollution has huge implications for health, monsoon and air quality. So, I will not say they are good for us."" It is, however, certain that when the impact of aerosols wane, the surface temperature will spike further and monsoon rains will increase in quantity. Hot extremes will increase and erratic rains with a rise in extreme rainfall events and flooding will continue in the meantime, IPCC has said./Is India ready for more extremes?/Heatwaves and humid heat stress will be more intense and frequent during the 21st century all over South Asia. The IPCC has simulated what are these heat extremes./For example, one in ten-year heat extreme events already occur 2.8 times globally in the present. They will increase to 4.1 times in 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming and 5.6 times in 2 degrees Celsius global warming. Once in 50-year heat events are occurring 4.8 times in 50 years and will occur 8.6 times in 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and 13.9 times at 2 degrees Celsius warming. The challenge of heat and humidity extremes are already being felt but will spike very rapidly in the next 10 to 20 years because it is very likely that the world will warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in the next 20 years./""The global projections will also apply for India. We are already seeing a rise in extremes but they will go up further in coming years which is certain,"" Krishnan explained during a media briefing./Globally, also, for 1.5degC of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons as well as changes in precipitation patterns affecting flooding and drought occurrences. At 2degC of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said responding to the IPCC report./""The extreme heat we have witnessed in 2021 bears all the hallmarks of human-induced climate change. British Columbia in Canada recorded an incredible temperature of 49.6degC - breaking all previous records - as part of an intense and extensive heatwave in North America./Fires in North America stoked by heat and drought have sent plumes of smoke across the Atlantic. In recent days, we have seen devastating fires in Turkey and Greece amid an intense and long-lasting heatwave in the Mediterranean. Siberia - a region traditionally associated with permafrost - has once again seen huge wildfires after exceptional heatwaves, fires and low Arctic sea ice in 2020,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

No evidence of lasting lung damage in Covid-19 survivors: Study,"India, Aug. 19 -- None of the Covid-19 survivors included in a Loyola University Medical Centre and University of Chicago Medicine study had any lasting lung damage directly attributable to the disease. The study published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery on July 31 said the finding fills an important gap in the understanding of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in the survivorship phase./""Clinicians and patients alike now have observational evidence that once the patient recovers from their disease, it is unlikely to have permanent lung parenchymal sequelae at least up to four months from their infection, which was the maximal duration of this study.""/India currently has the second-highest caseload of Covid-19 cases after the US.

Obesity correlated to pollution: Study,"India, Sept. 2 -- It is not just what you eat, what you breathe might also cause obesity. Long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution is strongly co-related to obesity, found a study of over 3,000 schoolchildren from Delhi, Kottayam, and Mysuru. This was a surprise finding by the researchers trying to understand the impact of air pollution on the lung health of children in Delhi./The study found 39.8% of the children in Delhi were obese or overweight as compared to 16.4% in Kottayam and Mysuru (which have better air quality). The researchers found the children, who are obese, or overweight, are at a 79% higher risk of developing asthma across all three cities as compared to their healthy weight counterparts. Obese children in Delhi were at a 38% higher risk of developing asthma than their counterparts in Kottayam and Mysuru./""The burden of asthma is also much higher than anticipated. Usually, we say that the prevalence is between 8 to 12%. Some studies have shown a prevalence of up to 20%. But our study shows a prevalence of nearly 40% among boys,"" said Arvind Kumar, founder of Lung Care Foundation, which conducted the study in association with Pulmocare Research and Education./""What this essentially means is that pollution not only leads to a higher burden of asthma, but it also correlated to increased obesity which then leads to asthma. The correlation between air pollution and obesity was a surprise finding for us. The question on BMI (body mass index) was included along with all other demographic parameters, but when we looked at the data, we were shocked. That is when we went back to the medical literature and found that a few recent studies have called pollution an obesogen.""/The study did not specifically look at the mechanism by which pollution leads to obesity./Kumar said the toxins in the air either act on the fatty cells making them resistant to insulin or they affect endocrine axis leading to binge eating. ""Larger studies are needed to conclusively prove the link.""/The study also found a very high incidence of asthma in children in Delhi./The prevalence of asthma confirmed through on-the-spot spirometry tests, which determine the amount of air a person breathes out, was found to be 29.3% in Delhi children as compared to 22.6% in those from Kottayam and Mysuru./This was despite a higher prevalence of predisposing factors such as a history of smoking and asthma in the family. Only 29.8% of the children in Delhi had a history of asthma as compared to 33.7% in Kottayam and Mysuru. In Delhi, 13.9% of the children reported smokers in their families as compared to 18.8% in Kottayam and Mysuru, according to the study./""What this shows is pollution has a higher impact on asthma than known risk factors such as the history of the illness in the family or a smoker in the family. We found that boys were twice as likely to have asthma as girls across the cities. What was worse was most of the children were not aware of their asthma and hardly any of them were on proper treatment. One of the reasons for higher diagnosis in the control cities could be that there were more cases of asthma in the family leading to discussions about the disease and health-seeking behaviour. Conversely, with many allergic symptoms already reported in a high proportion of children in Delhi most people think it is part of life,"" said Kumar./Only 12% of the Delhi children, who were found to be asthmatics, had been diagnosed and 3% were under treatment. In comparison, 27% in Kottayam and Mysuru had been diagnosed and 8% were under treatment./""This study has shown that around 85% of adolescent children who were found to have asthma in Delhi, did not know that they had asthma, and less than 3% of them were receiving appropriate treatment. Clearly, we need to create more awareness about asthma among parents and teachers, so that under diagnosis and under treatment of asthma can be significantly overcome,"" said Anurag Agarwal, one of the authors of the study paper and director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, in a statement./The researchers reported higher allergic symptoms in Delhi children. This included sneezing in 52.8% of children in Delhi over the last 12 months as compared to 39.3% in the control cities./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

IIT-Delhi to assess Noida's pollution sources,"Noida, Sept. 6 -- The Noida regional office of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has approached IIT-Delhi to assess the sources of air pollution, a first for the city, in a bid to deploy effective control measures before October when the air quality starts deteriorating in the National Capital Region./Despite the city figuring among the most polluted in the country in several surveys, there is yet to be a survey to assess the source of emissions and the kind of aerosols so produced. Noida, like other cities in the NCR, suffers severe levels of air pollution from October through February, due to several artificial and meteorological factors./Officials from UPPCB said they will soon start field inspections and check hot spots [where pollution levels are generally high] for better remedial actions./IIT-Delhi is the knowledge partner and institute of repute (IOR) for Noida and Ghaziabad. In March, the cities and IIT-Delhi signed a memorandum of agreement to this effect wherein the institute will help them with technical support, identifying sources and methods to tackle air pollution./UPPCB Noida regional officer Praveen Kumar said the board will soon sign a contract with the IIT to conduct the survey./""The conditions of the contract are being formalised for the study that will measure emissions, inventory development and source apportionment for Noida. After that we will be in a position to assess the actual sources so that we can take remedial actions accordingly. We will also keep an eye on the violations related to the construction and demolition waste,"" said Kumar./According to the IIT Delhi, centre for atmospheric sciences, associate professor Sagnik Dey, while there could be many sources of emissions in both Noida and Ghaziabad, a big chunk of pollution comes from Delhi./""Both Noida and Ghaziabad are on downwind of Delhi, so emissions from there end up in the two cities, just like Delhi receives emissions from Haryana and Punjab. There would certainly be other sources of pollution as well in Noida, which would be almost similar as those in Delhi. So far, we have very little knowledge about Noida in terms of sources, so this study would be a first. In fact, no other NCR city, other than Delhi, has had such a survey done,"" said Dey ./The study Dey is referring to is one that was done by IIT Kanpur in 2015, which found that in winter vehicles contributed nearly 25% of the PM2.5 (particulate matter of size 2.5 microns or less that can enter bloodstream and penetrate organs leading to higher risk of cancer and other diseases) and biomass burning contributed 26%./Noida is among 132 cities in the country selected for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) - a long-term and time-bound national level strategy to tackle air pollution across the country in a comprehensive manner. It has targets to achieve 20% to 30% reduction in particulate matter concentration by 2024 with 2017 as the base year./According to a 2020 report by IQAir, a US and Swiss-based air quality solution company, which has assessed a total of 98 countries and over 600 cities, Noida and Greater Noida were the fifth and ninth most polluted cities, respectively, based on the annual average concentration of PM2.5./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Next month, air pollution will be back","India, Sept. 13 -- The past year has been a stark reminder about the links between environment, health and prosperity. Climate action - cleaner power, industries and transport - will greatly help with air quality/Amid growing concern about the climate crisis, the pervasive problem of air pollution has not gone away. Air pollution is costing India lives and livelihoods: 1.67 million killed in 2019 (according to the Global Burden of Disease report) and caused a loss of $95 billion annually to Indian businesses (according to consulting firm Dalberg, Clean Air Fund and Confederation of Indian Industry). Improving the life chances of our citizens needs more dedicated and precise interventions./Climate action benefits air quality. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted recently, under low and very low greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, net warming from reduced aerosol emissions is counterbalanced by net cooling from reduced methane and other ozone precursor emissions. Lower methane emissions also improve air quality by reducing surface ozone concentrations. As India considers long-term climate actions, it must also leverage them for near-term clean air gains./North India will enter another high-pollution season next month. Despite the pandemic-induced economic slowdown, for more than half of 2020, Delhi residents breathed air that did not meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards. A Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) analysis finds that Delhi had worse air in winter 2020 (92 severe and very poor days) compared to 80 such days in winter 2019./Delhi must take pre-emptive action. Cities such as Beijing introduce emergency measures in advance. Delhi's Graded Response Action Plan kicks in only when pollution rises above certain thresholds. Instead, air quality forecast must be used to issue health warnings and clamp down on polluting sources before the air worsens. Transport curbs, for instance, should be announced in advance of high pollution days. We tolerate security checks when there are credible threats of terrorist attacks. Similarly, pre-emptive emission controls will need mutual trust between citizens and authorities./Another crucial intervention is tackling farm fires. Between mid-October 2020 and mid-November, farm fires were responsible for 30% of Delhi's air pollution. Meteorological conditions - winds were calmer for 70% more time than the same period in 2019 - exacerbated the impact of those emissions. We cannot bet on wind speeds. Crop residue burning must stop. But rice dominates the Kharif crop in Punjab. With farmers favouring late-maturing varieties, there will not be too many days between the rice harvest and wheat planting. Once again, there could be a spate of farm fires./Unfortunately, the challenges with in situ crop residue management (CRM) are likely to continue this season as well. In a forthcoming report, my colleagues note that Punjab has 76,626 CRM machines, such as super seeders, happy seeders, zero-till drills and paddy straw choppers. These are insufficient. The existing happy seeders and super seeders can at best cover two-thirds of the total area sown under non-basmati paddy in 2021. The existing stock also remains underused because of unproven fears that wheat yields would drop. The custom hiring and rental models have not worked and the rise in diesel prices is an added disincentive against using this farm equipment./The other option - ex situ - is far from reaching scale. Less than 6% of paddy residue in Punjab is managed this way. The supply chain needs to be strengthened. Collecting residue, baling and transporting it to the nearest straw bank (storage) costs Rs.1,330 per tonne bale. These temporary storages are needed to get the residue off the farm before the next planting season begins. But transporting it further (say 50 km) to an end-user raises the cost to Rs.2,500-3,000 per tonne bale - and to Rs.4,000-5,000 for densified biomass briquets and pellets./Despite challenges, efforts must continue. Apps to connect farmers with a dense network of straw banks and end-users can reduce transaction costs. Demand for biomass must also be raised. Punjab recently allowed industries to use crop residue in boilers. Mandates to increase biomass pellet use in coal power plants could help. Just 10% co-firing biomass pellets with coal in Punjab would generate demand for 7.4% of paddy residue. Although sound steps, they are unlikely to have a significant impact this season./In the near-term in situ solutions need support. This could include compensation for higher diesel prices, delivery of CRM machines before the harvesting and residue burning season begins, active campaigns to mitigate misinformation about happy seeders, and using apps and awareness to improve use of custom hiring centres./Indoor air pollution is another major concern. The government's big push to connect households to cleaner cooking fuels meant that, by March 2020, 85% of Indian homes had an LPG connection. Still, latest research suggests that 38% of Indian homes used polluting solid fuels along with LPG because of their inability to afford cylinder refills. Last winter, when the crop burning season tapered off after mid-November, household emissions (burning biomass for cooking, space heating, water heating) became the main driver of poor air quality in Delhi. Sustainable solutions are needed to ensure that cleaner fuels are used regularly for cooking and heating./The past year has been a stark reminder about the links between environment, health and prosperity. Climate action - cleaner power, industries and transport - will help greatly with air quality. Meanwhile, authorities must take pre-emptive action, help farmers tackle farm fires and support the poor with cleaner fuels. All are citizens who have a right to breathe./Arunabha Ghosh is CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water and Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Clean Air/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Bio-decomposer in fields by Oct 5: Gopal Rai,"New Delhi, Sept. 21 -- Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday said that the government is set to prepare a bio-decomposer solution to be sprayed on paddy fields to organically decompose stubble. The process will begin on September 24 and the solution will be sprayed across fields by October 5, said Rai./""Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will initiate the process of preparing the bio-decomposer solution in Delhi on September 24. We will spray the solution for free across Delhi's farmlands by October 5. This will give enough time to farmers to sow the next crop,"" Rai said during a press conference./The solution will be prepared by the horticulture department nursery in Najafgarh's Kharkhari Nahar./So far the agriculture department has estimated that about 4,000 acres of farmland need to be sprayed./""This is double the demand from the previous year. In case the demand increases, we are prepared to take care of it as well.

"WHO revises global air quality, sets new quality levels for protection of health","New Delhi, Sept. 22 -- The World Health Organisation (WHO) released a revised Global Air Quality Guidelines on Wednesday, announcing more stringent limits for six pollutant categories -particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO)./The latest WHO guidelines provide clear evidence of the damage air pollution inflicts on human health, at even lower concentrations than previously understood. The guidelines recommend new air quality levels to protect the health of populations, by reducing levels of key air pollutants, some of which also contribute to climate change./""Air pollution is a threat to health in all countries, but it hits people in low- and middle-income/countries the hardest,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the virtual launch of the guidelines. ""WHO's new Air Quality Guidelines are an evidence-based and practical tool for improving the quality of the air on which all life depends. I urge all countries and all those fighting to protect our environment to put them to use to reduce suffering and save lives,"" he further said./Since WHO's last 2005 global update, there has been a marked increase of evidence that shows how air pollution affects different aspects of health. Taking cognisance of these factors, the WHO has adjusted almost all the air quality norms downwards, warning that exceeding the new air quality guideline levels is associated with significant risks to health. At the same time, however, adhering to them could save millions of lives./""Since the last update in 2005, a substantial new body of evidence has accumulated, further demonstrating the degree to which air pollution affects all parts of the body, from the brain to a growing baby in a mother's womb, at even lower concentrations than previously observed,"" the WHO Director-General stressed./WHO's revised guidelines prescribe annual PM2.5 average at 5 ug/m3, bringing it down from 2005 limits set at 10 ug/m3. PM10 annual average is now 15 ug/m3 in comparison to the earlier norm of 20 ug/m3. NO2 levels, which are primarily attributable to vehicular emissions, have been revised to 10 ug/m3, in comparison to 40 ug/m3 in 2005./""These new guidelines will have major implications for public health. They provide a practical tool for improving air quality around the world, and a robust evidence-base for developing national and local air quality standards,"" Ghebreyesus said./While these guidelines not legally-binding, the WHO recommendations on air quality are an evidence-informed tool for policymakers to guide legislation and policies, in order to reduce levels of air pollutants and decrease the burden of disease that results from exposure to air pollution across the world./""It is common knowledge that lesser the exposure, the healthier is the outcome. WHO by reducing the PM2.5 and 10 exposure levels under the new air quality guidelines has reemphasised the need for putting in more efforts to control particulate matter concentration in air. But for countries like India, it is a huge challenge to meet these guidelines. Nonetheless I hope that efforts by all stakeholders will be intensified so as to make honest efforts to aim towards the revised levels,"" Dr Arun Sharma, director of ICMR's National Institute for Implementation Research of Non-Communicable Diseases said./As low-and-middle-income countries like India experience increased disparities in air pollution exposure due to large-scale urbanisation and economic development which has largely been driven by fossil fuels, it has resulted in an unequal burden of disease and mortality for its population./India last revised its National Ambient Air Quality Standards in 2009 -setting annual averages for PM2.5 (40 ug/m3), PM10 (60 ug/m3) and NO2 (40 us/m3) - which were more relaxed in comparison to WHO's 2005 guidelines and other South Asian countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. The WHO guidelines, also often referred to as 'safe levels', ring the assumption that they will lower the risk of disease or death.In 2013, outdoor air pollution and particulate matter were classified as carcinogenic by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)./An analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, Sunil Dahiya stressed the need for India to revise it air quality standards in view of the elevated pollution level in the country./""It's been more than a decade that India notified the national ambient air quality standards in 2009 and lot of new evidence on impacts of different pollutants on human health at lower pollution levels have come into existence necessitating it for Indian government to revise the standards similar to WHO's action,"" Dahiya said, adding, ""The good thing is that India is already working on revising the standards, we just need to make sure we make use of evidence gathered by WHO and others on increasing and severe health impacts of pollutants at lower levels and try to aim towards moving closer to WHO prescribed levels for pollutants.""/Both PM2.5 and PM10 are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs but PM2.5 can even enter the bloodstream, primarily resulting in cardiovascular and respiratory impacts, and also affecting other organs. PM is primarily generated by fuel combustion in different sectors, including transport, energy, households, industry, and from agriculture. While these guidelines are not legally binding for countries, the new recommendations for air quality standards,if adopted by nations, can save millions of lives and contribute to climate change./Out of 100 global cities in 2020, 92 exceeded WHO's revised 2021 air quality guidelines, which include 5 Indian cities as well. Delhi's annual PM2.5 trends in 2020 was 16.8 times more than WHO's 2021 guidelines of 5 ug/m3, while Mumbai's exceeded 8-fold, Kolkata 9.4, Chennai 5.4, Hyderabad seven-fold and Ahmedabad exceeded 9.8-fold./Professor SN Tripathi of Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and a steering committee member of the National Clean Air Programme said there is no two ways about the need for revising India's air quality standards to make them more stringent./""Even at the current relaxed standard of 40 ug/m3 for annual PM2.5 averages in India vs WHO's 2005 annual limit of 10 ug/m3, most Indian cities failed to meet even those levels. In parallel, we have to strengthen our health data and revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standards accordingly. Raw health data is required to conduct a large range of health studies vis-a-vis air pollution impacts for India's varied demography, exposure and differing PM2.5 composition. A single exposure prevention response will not suit the Indian population,"" he said./Air pollution is considered the greatest environmental threat to health, and it disproportionately affects vulnerable populations:91% of deaths from ambient air pollution occur in low-income and middle-income countries. In India,116,000 infant deaths in 2019 are attributable to air pollution, while burning coal combustion resulted in100,000 deaths and ambient air pollution killed 16.7 lakh Indians. Children are also especially vulnerable, as exposure to air pollution in early childhood can lead to reduced lung capacity. Globally, approximately 15% of deaths from Covid-19 are linked to PM2.5 air pollution./Every year, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause 7 million premature deaths and result in the loss of millions more healthy years of life. In children, this could include reduced lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. In adults, ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the most common causes of premature death attributable to outdoor air pollution, and evidence is also emerging of other effects such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions. This puts the burden of disease attributable to air pollution on a par with other major global health risks such as unhealthy diet and tobacco smoking./Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change. Improving air quality can enhance climate change mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions will in turn improve air quality. By striving to achieve these guideline levels, countries will be both protecting health as well as mitigating global climate change./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Indian cities may struggle to meet new WHO pollution standards, experts say","New Delhi, Sept. 22 -- The revised pollution guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO), tightening the acceptable levels of pollutants might be a difficult feat to achieve for Indian cities, considering geographical and meteorological factors, but it draws attention to the high level of exposure to hazardous particles and gases that residents in Delhi face,environment and health experts said on Wednesday./They added that with Covid-19 pandemic posing a public health hazard, the agencies should intensify action to combat air pollution./The World Health Organization has tightened its air quality guidelines bringing down the annual PM 2.5 (respirable pollution particles) guideline from 10 micrograms per cubic metres to 5 micrograms per cubic metres and the 24-hour PM 2.5 limit from 25 micrograms per cubic metres to 15 micrograms per cubic metres. It has also tightened norms for five other pollutants based on recent evidence of health impacts associated with them, a WHO report released on Wednesday, said./Experts said the new levels show how even the slightest increase in pollution levels in a city can impact the health of its residents, especially the vulnerable sections./""By reducing the ambient levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) under the new air quality guidelines, WHO has re-emphasised the need for putting in more efforts to control particulate matter concentration in air. Though it would be a huge challenge to achieve those levels, but it should be taken as a wake-up call. Efforts by all stakeholders needs to be intensified in order to control pollution levels,"" said Dr Arun Sharma, director, National Institute for Implementation Research of Non-Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)./Releasing its revised air quality guidelines, the WHO in a statement highlighted that in recent years several studies have established how even a slight increase in pollution levels in a region can adversely impact the health of its residents. A 2013 assessment by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) highlighted that outdoor air pollution is carcinogenic to humans, with the particulate matter component of air pollution most closely associated with increased cancer incidence, especially lung cancer. An association also has been observed between outdoor air pollution and an increase in cancer of the urinary tract, the 2013 report said./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said that while it might be tough to conform to the new WHO guidelines for a city like Delhi, where even the baseline pollution levels are just short of meeting the national annual standards of 40ug/m3, it is important to scale up action to reduce pollution levels as much as possible./""What we saw during the Covid-19 lockdown, when all pollution sources in the city were shut, there was a reduction of 40-45% in pollution levels. This was a little close to our own pollution standards. While the WHO standards are tough to meet but we need to come up with tighter and stricter action plans for pollution management. Action should not just be localised, we need regional action plans as well,"" Roychowdhury said./Delhi, because of its landlocked geography and its weather conditions, faces a year-long pollution problem that reaches emergency levels every winter. Delhi's baseline pollution study, the minimum pollution when major polluting sources are shut, which was conducted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) during the Covid-19 pandemic last year shows that the baseline levels of PM10 and PM2.5 were found to be 38ug/m3 (+/- 8) and 22ug/m3 (+/- 6) respectively. The baseline value of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) was found to be 8 parts per billion (+/- 3), which is also considered to be very high./Dr Arvind Kumar, founder, Lung Care Foundation and chairperson of Institute of Chest Surgery (chest onco-surgery and lung transplantation), said all possible efforts should be made to resolve the crisis. ""As doctors, we see the effects of air pollution on people every day. This is a public health emergency, impacting the lives of people but its worst impacts are seen in South Asian countries like India. For the sake of our future generations, we need to commit to doing anything and everything it takes to solve this crisis,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The battle against air pollution,"India, Sept. 23 -- The World Health Organization (WHO), on Wednesday, released its revised Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs), its first update since 2005. The new AQGs provide an assessment of the health effects of air pollution, set new thresholds for key air pollutants, and provide recommendations to improve air quality. The revision was necessary because, since 2005, there has been fresh evidence that shows harm from air pollution begins at much lower levels than previously thought. According to the new metric, the average 24-hour exposure to PM2.5 must remain below 15 micro g/m cube, down from 25 micro g/m cube. In the case of PM10 particles, the safe threshold has been lowered from 50 to 45 microg/m cube. The AQGs report adds that air pollution causes seven million premature deaths annually. Disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide; low- and middle-income countries have growing levels of air pollution because of urbanisation and economic development that relies on the burning of fossil fuels./The release of the WHO report has raised questions on whether AQGs can be implemented, especially in challenging geo-climatic zones such as India. It is certainly not going to be an easy task, even though air pollution has become politically salient. In comparison to the AQGs, India's threshold levels are many folds higher. According to the 2009 National Ambient Air Quality Standards, the acceptable PM2.5 exposure limit over 24 hours is 60 microg/m cube (four times the new WHO limit), and for exposure over a year-long period, 40 microg/m cube (eight times the revised WHO threshold). The 2019 National Clean Air Programme does not have a legal mandate, but aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 concentrations over 2017 annual levels in over 100 cities by 2024./There is enough scientific evidence that shows air pollution is not just a health problem but also impacts economic growth. For example, a study published in The Lancet in 2020 said that Delhi, which faces an annual catastrophe post-Diwali, suffered the highest per-capita economic loss due to air pollution in 2019, eroding 1.08% of stage GDP. Uttar Pradesh (2.15%) recorded the highest loss to GDP, followed by Bihar at 1.95% and Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan lost 1.70% each. In addition, overall deaths and disease due to air pollution is linked to a loss of 1.36% of India's GDP. India must focus on cleaning up its power, industry, and transport sectors, set up interim targets, and plan a more nuanced regional approach to provide the clean air to its citizens./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Armed with microbes, India prepares to fight season of deadly farm fires","India, Sept. 23 -- Northern India, including Delhi, are bracing for an annual spell of notorious winter smog caused by agricultural fires, but authorities say they are ready to put up a novel fight, armed with a liquid concoction swarming with microbes./A proprietary microbial solution developed by the state-run Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), known as Pusa decomposer, is the best bet yet to prevent fires set by farmers to millions of acres of crop residue after summer paddy harvests, experts say./Farmers are reluctant to use machines to clear rice stalks because it pushes up post-harvest costs by 11-12%, Hukum Singh, a rice-grower in Haryana said./Last year, the Delhi government devised an elaborate plan to distribute several hundreds of litres of the solution to farmers within its territory. Official results reported to a top anti-pollution commission showed the solution was ""effective""./The Delhi government is preparing to treat at least 4,000 acres of crop residue this year too. On Monday, the Delhi government's environment minister Gopal Rai announced it would start spraying the decomposer from October 5 to prevent stubble burning./Farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop./The burning of crop residue in more than seven million hectares has emerged as a deadly cause of winter pollution, resulting in weeks-long smog in New Delhi during October and November. The fires are so widespread that they are visible from space./Westerly winds carry the smoke from burning fields towards the national capital. Air pollution in Delhi typically spikes to alarming levels, breaching the ""severe"" level./Air pollution kills up to an estimated 30,000 people in Delhi annually, according to a 2015 report of New Delhi's Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./Burning paddy straw has emerged as a big problem in the past two to three decades as farmers have shifted to mechanized combine harvesters, which cut the grainy part of a rice plant, leaving the stalk intact./A special mix of microbes in the decomposer developed by the IARI gorges on any kind of organic biomass. In the process, it turns rice stubble into fluffy manure./""The technology has been given to several agritech firms, which will distribute it to farmers in these northern states free,"" said YV Singh, IARI's principal scientist of microbiology./Yet, this is a modest beginning. Authorities in Punjab are preparing to use decomposer technology in about 700,000 acres to begin with, while officials have identified another 600,000 acres in Uttar Pradesh, Singh, the top IARI scientist, said. About 100,000 acres in Haryana have been targeted too./Private firms see a big potential and are harnessing big data and artificial intelligence to bring efficiency in using the decomposer under technology-sharing deals./Nurture.farm, a Bangalore-based agritech firm, is targeting 500,000 acres in Punjab and Haryana through its platform. The company says its platform has the potential to reach 1 million farmers./""We are using satellite mapping to identify farms where crop burning has been carried out. Using a shared-economy platform, we are spraying farms with the decomposer for free,"" said Dhruv Sawhney, the business head of nurture.farm./For now, the cost of production of the decomposer, which is a bioenzyme, is Rs.35 per acre, which is ""nominal"", said Sawhney./The decomposer comes in the form of capsules that contain an activated package of eight strains of fungi, Singh said. To prepare a solution of 25 litres, farmers need to add 5 capsules of the decomposer, along with jaggery and checkpea flour, to water. Within a week, a good layer of fungi admixture is formed. To decompose paddy stubble in one hectare, farmers need to spray 25 litres of this solution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi govt urges neighbours to switch to CNG for public vehicles, ban crackers","India, Sept. 23 -- Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday suggested that the neighbouring states should consider implementing a complete ban on firecrackers, and shift all public vehicles to CNG for a robust anti-pollution plan for the national capital region./Rai also stressed on the need to promote the use of bio-decomposers by farmers to tackle crop stubble, and prevent them from burning it./After participating in a meeting convened by the Union environment ministry on Thursday, Rai told reporters that Delhi's air pollution crisis cannot be resolved in isolation, and it will need cooperation from all neighbouring states./Environment ministers of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan and chief secretary of Punjab attended the meeting, which, the union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said focussed on the ways to prevent farm fires./Delhi has been at the centre of India's air pollution crisis for years now, which particularly worsens every winter season. The landlocked demography of the national capital also puts it at a disadvantage, as winds carrying pollutants from neighbouring states also impacts its air. Experts have time and again pointed out that sharing a common air shed with the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the issue of Delhi's pollution cannot be tackled in isolation, and the governments will have to come up with a holistic plan to bring down emissions in the entire region./The stubble fires in the neighbouring agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana are a case in point. Every year, when farmers burn stubble after harvest, the smoke carries dangerous particles measuring less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) to Delhi. Last year, according to Safar -- an agency under the Union ministry of earth sciences, the contribution of farm fires to concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) in Delhi's air reached up to 40% in November./Every winter, Delhi's air quality nosedives with pollution levels reaching emergency levels on several days. The deterioration starts around mid-October with the fumes of stubble burning in the fields of Haryana and Punjab and gets worse with cracker bursting during Diwali and Delhi's own local pollution sources. The unfavourable weather conditions including a change in wind direction and slow wind speed also add to the Capital's problem./Rai on Thursday said that Delhi's pollution can be attributed more to external factors than its own sources. He said that on September 18, the reading of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) pollutants was 67ug/m3 and that of PM2.5 was 27ug/m3. On September 19, it was 85ug/m3 and 35ug/m3 respectively, on September 20, it was 78ug/m3 and 31ug/m3 respectively, on September 21, it was 81ug/m3 and 31ug/m3 respectively and on September 22, it was 64ug/m3 and 27ug/m3 respectively./""Last year, I saw from the war room that the PM10 and PM2.5 graph was increasing. We specially monitored how Punjab and Haryana were contributing to the pollution of Delhi through stubble burning. As the quantum of stubble burning increased in these states, the air quality worsened in Delhi. In today's meeting, we appealed to the central government and the government of the neighbouring states to eradicate the stubble burning practices as soon as possible,"" Rai said./He added that no extension should be given to thermal power plants in NCR that are operating without emission control devices.""These plants are to be retrofitted with new technology to control emissions but they operate without it after paying a penalty. The gases they emit are the most harmful,"" Rai said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

US engineers create 'smallest-ever human-made flying structure',"India, Sept. 24 -- Engineers from Illinois' Northwestern University have created an electronic microchip or ""microflier"" with flight capabilities, which can help monitor air pollution levels and airborne diseases, the university said in a press release. The ""smallest-ever human-made flying structure"", which is about the size of a grain of sand, does not require an engine or a motor. Instead, it catches flight on the wind - much like a maple tree's propeller seed - and spins like a helicopter through the air toward the ground./The engineers behind this micro flier optimised their design by studying maple trees and other types of wind-dispersed seeds and fashioned the micro flier such that when dropped from a height it would fall at a slow velocity in a controlled manner. This helps stabilise its flight, ensures dispersal over a broad area and increases the amount of time it interacts with the air, making it ideal for monitoring air pollution and airborne diseases, the team behind it said./""We were able to do that using ideas inspired by the biological world. Over the course of billions of years, nature has designed seeds with very sophisticated aerodynamics. We borrowed those design concepts, adapted them and applied them to electronic circuit platforms,"" John A Rogers, who led the team behind the device's development, said in the release./""Evolution was likely the driving force for the sophisticated aerodynamics. These biological structures are designed to fall slowly and in a controlled manner, so they can interact with wind patterns for the longest possible period of time. This feature maximizes lateral distribution via purely passive, airborne mechanisms,"" he added./The team also drew inspiration from children's pop-up books. ""We can thus exploit the most advanced materials and manufacturing methods used by the consumer electronics industry to make completely standard, flat, chip-like designs. Then, we just transform them into 3D flying shapes by principles that are similar to those of a pop-up book,"" said Rogers./The team designed many different types of micro fliers, including one with three wings, resembling the wings on a tristellateia seed. The team said that some of the micro fliers, which were created using computational modelling to allow a rapid design optimisation, come with properties that can ""give nature a run for its money""./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi urges neighbours to switch public transit to CNG, ban crackers","New Delhi, Sept. 24 -- Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday suggested that the neighbouring states should consider implementing a complete ban on firecrackers, and shift all public vehicles to CNG for a robust anti-pollution plan for the national capital region./Rai also stressed on the need to promote the use of bio-decomposers by farmers to tackle crop stubble, and prevent them from burning it./After participating in a meeting convened by the Union environment ministry on Thursday, Rai told reporters that Delhi's air pollution crisis cannot be resolved in isolation, and it will need cooperation from all neighbouring states./Environment ministers of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan and chief secretary of Punjab attended the meeting, which, the union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said focussed on the ways to prevent farm fires./Delhi has been at the centre of India's air pollution crisis for years now, which particularly worsens every winter season. The landlocked demography of the national capital also puts it at a disadvantage, as winds carrying pollutants from neighbouring states also impacts its air. Experts have time and again pointed out that sharing a common air shed with the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the issue of Delhi's pollution cannot be tackled in isolation, and the governments will have to come up with a holistic plan to bring down emissions in the entire region./The stubble fires in the neighbouring agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana are a case in point. Every year, when farmers burn stubble after harvest, the smoke carries dangerous particles measuring less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) to Delhi. Last year, according to Safar -- an agency under the Union ministry of earth sciences, the contribution of farm fires to concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) in Delhi's air reached up to 40% in November./Every winter, Delhi's air quality nosedives with pollution levels reaching emergency levels on several days. The deterioration starts around mid-October with the fumes of stubble burning in the fields of Haryana and Punjab and gets worse with cracker bursting during Diwali and Delhi's own local pollution sources. The unfavourable weather conditions including a change in wind direction and slow wind speed also add to the Capital's problem./Rai on Thursday said that Delhi's pollution can be attributed more to external factors than its own sources. He said that on September 18, the reading of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) pollutants was 67ug/m3 and that of PM2.5 was 27ug/m3. On September 19, it was 85ug/m3 and 35ug/m3 respectively, on September 20, it was 78ug/m3 and 31ug/m3 respectively, on September 21, it was 81ug/m3 and 31ug/m3 respectively and on September 22, it was 64ug/m3 and 27ug/m3 respectively./""Last year, I saw from the war room that the PM10 and PM2.5 graph was increasing. We specially monitored how Punjab and Haryana were contributing to the pollution of Delhi through stubble burning. As the quantum of stubble burning increased in these states, the air quality worsened in Delhi. In today's meeting, we appealed to the central government and the government of the neighbouring states to eradicate the stubble burning practices as soon as possible,"" Rai said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

N India armed with microbial liquid to fight farm fires,"New Delhi, Sept. 24 -- Northern India, including Delhi, is bracing for an annual spell of notorious winter smog caused by agricultural fires, but authorities say they are ready to put up a novel fight, armed with a liquid concoction swarming with microbes./A proprietary microbial solution developed by the state-run Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), known as Pusa decomposer, is the best bet yet to prevent fires set by farmers to millions of acres of crop residue after summer paddy harvests, experts say./Farmers are reluctant to use machines to clear rice stalks because it pushes up post-harvest costs by 11-12%, Hukum Singh, a rice-grower in Haryana said./Last year, the Delhi government devised an elaborate plan to distribute several hundreds of litres of the solution to farmers within its territory. Official results reported to a top anti-pollution commission showed the solution was ""effective""./The Delhi government is preparing to treat at least 4,000 acres of crop residue this year too. On Monday, the Delhi government's environment minister Gopal Rai announced it would start spraying the decomposer from October 5 to prevent stubble burning./Farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop./The burning of crop residue in more than seven million hectares has emerged as a deadly cause of winter pollution, resulting in weeks-long smog in New Delhi during October and November. The fires are so widespread that they are visible from space./Westerly winds carry the smoke from burning fields towards the national capital. Air pollution in Delhi typically spikes to alarming levels, breaching the ""severe"" level./Air pollution kills up to an estimated 30,000 people in Delhi annually, according to a 2015 report of New Delhi's Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./Burning paddy straw has emerged as a big problem in the past two to three decades as farmers have shifted to mechanized combine harvesters, which cut the grainy part of a rice plant, leaving the stalk intact./A special mix of microbes in the decomposer developed by the IARI gorges on any kind of organic biomass. In the process, it turns rice stubble into fluffy manure./""The technology has been given to several agritech firms, which will distribute it to farmers in these northern states free,"" said YV Singh, IARI's principal scientist of microbiology./Yet, this is a modest beginning. Authorities in Punjab are preparing to use decomposer technology in about 700,000 acres to begin with, while officials have identified another 600,000 acres in Uttar Pradesh, Singh, the top IARI scientist, said. About 100,000 acres in Haryana have been targeted too./Private firms see a big potential and are harnessing big data and artificial intelligence to bring efficiency in using the decomposer under technology-sharing deals./Nurture.farm, a Bangalore-based agritech firm, is targeting 500,000 acres in Punjab and Haryana through its platform. The company says its platform has the potential to reach 1 million farmers./""We are using satellite mapping to identify farms where crop burning has been carried out. Using a shared-economy platform, we are spraying farms with the decomposer for free,"" said Dhruv Sawhney, the business head of nurture.farm./For now, the cost of production of the decomposer, which is a bioenzyme, is Rs.35 per acre, which is ""nominal"", said Sawhney./The decomposer comes in the form of capsules that contain an activated package of eight strains of fungi, Singh said. To prepare a solution of 25 litres, farmers need to add 5 capsules of the decomposer, along with jaggery and checkpea flour, to water. Within a week, a good layer of fungi admixture is formed. To decompose paddy stubble in one hectare, farmers need to spray 25 litres of this solution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi to prepare bio-decomposer solution from today to fight stubble burning,"New Delhi, Sept. 24 -- The Delhi government will start preparing a bio-decomposer solution from Friday for spraying across farmlands in order to stop stubble burning which leads to air pollution in the national capital. The bio-decomposer solution will be ready by October 5 and the government will spray it free of cost. The expenditure of this drive will be around Rs.5,000,000./According to news agency ANI, the government, in association with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, developed the bio-decomposer capsule. This capsule can be converted into a solution that can be sprayed on crop stubble in farmlands. Once sprayed, the solution decomposes the stubble into compost in 20 days, ANI added./""Last year, the Delhi government, in association with Pusa Institute, sprayed bio-decomposer on the fields. We got a lot of positive responses. We presented that entire report to the Central Commission for Air Quality Management and they asked for a third-party audit. The audit has been done and the report has been handed over,"" Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said while addressing a press conference on Monday./Pointing out that stubble burning contributes to the national capital's pollution which reaches a dangerous level; Rai said that previously, many laws were made to deal with this problem. ""Penalties were imposed on the farmers but no solution was found,"" the environment minister also told reporters on Monday./The solution was sprayed only in fields growing non-basmati rice last year. However, this year the government will spray it in all fields including those that grow basmati rice./A committee of 25 members has been formed to approach farmers and carry out the drive. The Delhi government also said that farmers will only have to fill a form and the bio-decomposer solution will be sprayed in their fields free of cost./Hindustan Times earlier reported that farmers in Delhi only burn only 1% of stubble and the smoke from stubble burning in states such as Haryana and Punjab contributes majorly to the winter pollution in the national capital./Environment minister Gopal Rai said on Thursday that neighbouring states are willing to experiment with the bio-decomposer solution to combat stubble burning, adding that such states and the Centre should prepare to spray the solution on a war-footing./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World Lung Day 2021: How to protect your child's lungs from damage,"India, Sept. 25 -- Childhood is considered a golden time for most of us. From learning and growing each day to enjoying time with the peers without significant responsibilities, childhood memories perhaps stay with us for longest. It is also the time when one is growing physically and mentally at a rapid pace. From cognitive, social and emotional skills to physical growth, a lot of things are at a development stage./Childhood is also an important time for lung development. From birth to when we are in early twenties, our lungs are still developing. It is during our early years that we lay foundation for healthy lungs and if babies or children are exposed to second hand smoke and pollutants at this tender age, they are at risk of early heart disease as adults due to poorly functioning and stiffer blood vessels./Children who are exposed to passive smoking can develop cardiovascular troubles apart from respiratory and other health issues, said a study./""At birth the baby has 20-50 million air sacs. But they are still not fully developed. The child's lung volume increases a lot in the first two years of life, owing to the fast growth in the number of air sacs in their lungs. By the time the child is three, their lungs look like a mini version of adult lungs. Adult lungs have around 300 million air sacs. Did you know that your lungs are still in the process of maturing even in your early twenties!"" says Dr Shalini Joshi, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road, Bengaluru./This is the reason early smokers are at severe risk of lung damage, breathing issue and respiratory illnesses./""Cigarette smoking during childhood and adolescence can adversely affect lung growth and function, cause breathing issues, and increase the severity of respiratory illnesses leading to decreased physical fitness. People who start smoking at an early age are more likely to develop a severe addiction to nicotine than those who start at a later age. Young people watch celebrities smoking in the movies and consuming gutka (chewing tobacco) as part of ad campaigns. These teens are more likely to start smoking themselves. It is normal for your lung function to decline gradually as you go beyond the age of 35,"" adds Dr Joshi./Dr. Joshi also suggests measures that parents can take to prevent lung damage in children:/1. Avoid smoking during pregnancy./2. Make sure your child does not breathe in smoke as second-hand smoking at home. Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals. Cigarette smoke contains free radicals and other oxidants in abundance./3. Create a ""no smoking zone"" around your child./4. Avoid busy roads and junctions and being stuck in traffic where air pollution can quickly build up./5. Beware of indoor air pollution as well. Avoid use of air fresheners, disinfectant aerosols, incense sticks and mosquito repellent chemicals as much as possible./6. Do regular exercise to keep your lungs healthy. Playing outside with friends is excellent for your child's lungs and their physical, social, emotional, and mental development./""If you notice any sudden difficulties in breathing, chronic cough, mucus production, wheezing, coughing up blood or chest pain talk to your doctor right away. It is important to pay attention to these symptoms as they could be the first signs of lung disease, including COPD, asthma, and lung cancer and not the normal process of aging,"" says Dr Joshi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Clearing the air through the revised WHO guidelines,"India, Sept. 25 -- Earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced new air quality guidelines that aid countries in defining air quality levels that protect public health./The first revision of the guidelines since 2005, this review benefited from a wealth of new scientific evidence generated in the interim period across developed and developing countries. The data showed that severe impacts of particulate and gaseous pollutants on health occur even below levels previously considered acceptable by health scientists./The result of these new guidelines is a reset in our understanding of what we consider safe and breathable air. Under the previous guidelines, over 90% of the global population was exposed to air that was considered unhealthy. With this revision, that number will only grow./For India, this is a reminder of the folly of neglecting everyday air pollution and fixating on seasonal peaks in the national Capital. Tens of crore are being spent on ineffective boondoggles such as smog towers in Delhi, while other cities are receiving paltry budget allocations, reflecting the disconnect between intent and action. While the action plans submitted by the over 100 non-attainment cities under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) are a useful exercise, these are not legally binding. In addition, rural areas are neglected./These new guidelines also come weeks after the government announced the formation of a panel under the environment ministry to review India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Last revised in 2009, NAAQS, as they stand, are exceedingly lenient, given what we have learnt in the last decade about the impact of air pollution on premature death and illness in India and elsewhere. Compared to the updated WHO guidelines, NAAQS levels for PM2.5 alone will be eight-fold higher for 24-hour exposures, and four-fold higher for annual exposures. Indian lungs are no different from any others, so there is no scientific rationale for such a vast discrepancy./There are key process lessons that can be learnt from the way the WHO and other agencies around the world, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency, conduct such reviews. At the centre is scientific evidence that is factored into decision-making and the role of key stakeholders at various stages in the process./It has not been clear what scientific and epidemiological evidence was considered in decision-making for the previous revision of NAAQS in 2009. While this may have been due to a dearth of local data on the health effects of air pollution at the time, the last 12 years have yielded considerable evidence on the impact of air pollution exposure on cardiovascular and metabolic diseases./Health impact studies, led in part by the Indian Council of Medical Research, have shown that ambient PM2.5 was responsible for almost a million premature deaths in India (2019). Clarity on how these significant scientific advances will be factored in must be an essential aspect of this process./NAAQS revisions must also ensure that a diversity of voices are represented in deliberations, including from atmospheric science, public health, policy, law, and civil society. Greater inclusivity and transparency must be the hallmarks of this process./WHO guidelines are a clear nudge from the health sector towards the deep decarbonisation of our economy necessary to achieve both climate and air pollution goals. However, as things stand, most - if not all - Indian cities struggle to meet NAAQS, let alone the updated WHO guidelines. Even the targeted 30% reduction from 2017 levels under NCAP, if met, will only provide marginal benefits in improving health./To ensure air pollution no longer remains the single-largest risk factor for ill-health in India, we must commit to ambitious policies with time-bound targets. Placing public health at the centre of air quality management, coupled with a commitment to accountability and transparency in standard-setting, is the only way to ensure that the goals we set do not remain solely aspirational./Bhargav Krishna and Santosh Harish are fellows at the Centre for Policy Research.The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"World Heart Day 2021: Know all about the date, history, significance and theme","Delhi, Sept. 28 -- As per the World Heart Federation, World Heart Day is important as cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the world's number one killer, resulting in 18.6 million deaths a year. Covid-19 has only been more heartbreaking for this figure as it has made 520 million people living with CVD, more vulnerable to developing severe forms of the coronavirus./Smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, air pollution and less common conditions like Chagas disease and cardiac amyloidosis are all causes of cardiovascular disease. Hence, it is important to look after our heart by eating a healthy diet, saying no to tobacco and getting plenty of exercise./Remember, missing medical appointments, lack of contact with family and friends or reduced physical exercise can lead to CVD. So, don't let Covid-19 stop you from attending your regular check-ups especially if you have underlying health conditions like heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure or obesity./Date:/To increase public awareness of cardiovascular diseases, their prevention and their global impact, World Heart Day is observed and celebrated annually on September 29./History:/World Health Day was first founded in 1999 with the World Heart Federation (WHF) collaborating with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The idea of an annual event was conceived by Antoni Bayes de Luna, the president of WHF from 1997-2011. Originally, World Heart Day was observed on the last Sunday of September, with the first celebration taking place on September 24, 2000./Significance:/According to the World Heart Federation, ""World Heart Day informs people around the globe that CVD, including heart disease and stroke, is the world's leading cause of death claiming 18.6 million lives each year, and highlights the actions that individuals can take to prevent and control CVD. It aims to drive action to educate people that by controlling risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, at least 80% of premature deaths from heart disease and stroke could be avoided.""/Theme:/This year, the theme of World Heart Day is ""Use Heart to Connect"". The idea is to find different and innovative ways to connect people to heart health, especially in lower resource areas and communities by ""using your knowledge, compassion and influence to make sure you, your loved ones and the communities you're part of have the best chance to live heart-healthy lives. It's about connecting with our own hearts, making sure we're fuelling and nurturing them as best we can, and using the power of digital to connect every heart, everywhere.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"World Heart Day: Rise in heart attacks among under-50s, say doctors","India, Sept. 29 -- Doctors and experts have pointed to a worrisome trend on the occasion of World Heart Day celebrated on September 29. They have warned against an increasing number of young people (below 50 years of age) being diagnosed with heart issues. While developing blockages in arteries is natural above 50 years of age, people below 50 years of age developing blockages has become a cause for concern today./Food habits like eating packaged and baked foods containing palm oil, lack of exercise, stress, air pollution etc. are contributing to the early onset of heart-related diseases, doctors said./Dr Sujit Sawadatkar, interventional cardiologist from Noble hospital, said that almost 50% of the heart patients that visit him are youngsters. ""When I say youngsters, I mean people who are less than 50 years old. This is a worrisome trend that we are seeing. Building up fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls is natural in the 50+ age group. But witnessing heart issues before 50 years of age is the contribution of certain factors,"" he said./Dr Sawadatkar said that most of the packaged food industry uses palm oil. ""You take bakery items, icing on cakes, chocolates, or any other packaged food, it has cheap alternatives to healthy oil options and that is not good for heart health. High content of saturated fatty acids and cheap alternatives to healthy oil is damaging to heart health. Also, the younger generation is following a sedentary lifestyle with no proper exercise routine. Factors like stress and air pollution are also contributing in a big way to the early onset of heart diseases. Rampant use of some supplements also has a negative impact on the heart.""/Sharing greater insights, Dr Benny Jose, consultant and interventional cardiologist at Jupiter hospital said that heart attacks among youth are on the rise due to lifestyle issues. ""A sedentary lifestyle is a major cause for the younger population getting more heart attacks. And this includes food habits. But a person should focus on having a culture of exercise in their daily routine. And with this, healthy food is also important. Risk factors like diabetes, hypertension should not be neglected as these conditions can cause irreversible damage to vascular health,"" Dr Jose said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Electric buses spark hope for sustainable transport in Bengaluru city,"India, Oct. 1 -- Bengaluru/The Karnataka government on Thursday received the first of its planned 90 electric buses to ply as Bengaluru Metro feeder service, a move that is seen as part of the larger initiative to introduce more sustainable technologies to bring down pollution in the public transport sector./""Our government is dedicated to ensure people get the best transport facilities. In addition, electric buses are being introduced in larger numbers to protect the environment. Request all people to make best use of this transport facility and also help reduce traffic congestion,"" B Sriramulu, Karnataka's minister for transport and scheduled tribe (ST) welfare said in a post on Twitter on Thursday./The Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. will provide financial assistance of Rs.50 crore for the operation of 90 electric buses and an incentive of Rs.50 lakh per bus have been provided to the bidder, Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) said, adding an additional Rs.5 crore is set aside to set up charging infrastructure./""The tender has been finalised and letter of award has been issued to M/s. NTPC Vypar Vidyut Nigam at GCC rate of Rs.51.67/ km with electricity for 180 assured km for a period of 10 years. The buses have a seating capacity of 34 persons and can operate 120 kms on a single charge,"" the BMTC said in a statement on Thursday./People aware of the developments said the buses would begin in a phase-wise manner from next month when the government will flag off these services. The 90 buses will be operate in Yeswanthpura, KR Puram and Kengeri./The EV (electric vehicle) initiative in the intra-city bus services is part of a larger plan of the state government to introduce more eco-friendly commute options for the public in a city that has seen its quality of air and water deteriorate in recent years, amplified by the intensifying construction and road repair works./Experts said that ever since the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown were lifted, the AQI (air quality index) has oscillated more sharply than before, HT reported on June 25./In the 13 monitoring stations across Bengaluru, only one station near Mysuru Road had a rating of 'good' in the AQI index in August while most others were 'satisfactory' while two were in 'moderate' category, according to the Karnataka state Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) data./Bengaluru has 9.4 million vehicles and pollution caused by them is the biggest reason for the deteriorating AQI in the city and its over 12 million residents./The KSPCB claims have been contested be experts in the past as most of the monitoring stations are placed away from high-density roads and tucked away near lakes and open spaces that lead to inaccurate findings./""If they acknowledge the problem then there has to be an intervention, action, followed by more work which they don't want to do,"" Madhusudhan Anand, chief technical officer at, Ambee, a Bengaluru-based startup that works to find solutions for air pollution earlier told HT./For instance, the air monitoring centre in BTM Layout, one of the most congested localities in Bengaluru, is placed around a canopy of trees near Madiwala lake, away from the main road, which is unlikely to capture the true extent of the pollution./According to KSPCB, in its revised action plan for the control of air pollution in Bengaluru, the city's AQI -- a metric of daily air quality -- has fallen from 107.1 in 2014-15 to 88.1 in 2018-19, which shows a decreasing trend in the five-year annual average./This data has been disputed even by elected representatives, apart from scientists and experts on the subject./A 41-point action plan to mitigate air pollution, introduced by the state government, includes the implementation of LPG and bio-fuels, promoting battery operated vehicles, effective disposal of construction debris and operations of the metro among other measures to decrease the harmful pollutants entering the air./Electric vehicles are a way forward but the lack of infrastructure and government support has led to hesitancy among the public who still prefer vehicles that use fossil fuels./On September 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union cabinet approved a $3.5-billion incentive scheme aimed at boosting electric and hydrogen fuel powered vehicles production in the country./But the difference between announcing a policy and implementing it has been the biggest challenge in cities like Benglauru, experts said./The government has set a target of one charging station in a 3km radius grid in Bengaluru, as part of its 2017 EV Policy./Companies like Ola, Uber, Bounce, Vogo and several others are looking at increasing EVs in their respective fleets to bring down capital and operational expenditure for service providers, reduce cost per km for users and help bring down pollution by keeping out smoke-emitting gasoline vehicles off the road. But none of this has come with government support and has been an investment of the private sector, according to people familiar with the matter./Ola is investing Rs.2,400 crore to set up a two-million per annum EV plant in Tamil Nadu. The Karnataka government earlier this year approved investments of Rs.22,419 crore in three different proposals involving EV and lithium-ion battery manufacturing that has the potential to create nearly 5,000 new jobs.

Kejriwal unveils plan to combat winter pollution,"New Delhi, Oct. 5 -- The national capital has drawn up an action plan to tackle the severe air pollution in the winter months, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday, announcing alternatives to stubble burning, measures to control road dust and vehicular emissions, and urging governments of neighbouring National Capital Region (NCR) states to adopt similar steps./As part of its 10-point plan, the Delhi government will help spraying a bio-decomposer -- developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR -- also known as Pusa Institute) -- which converts paddy stubble into manure without burning, in rural areas in the Capital. The burning of farm residue in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh ahead of sowing the winter crop releases large amounts of smoke, leading to an annual air emergency in the NCR. Kejriwal said these states must use the bio-decomposer as well./Except November, December and January, Delhi's air quality is usually under control, Kejriwal said. ""But this will change in a few days because the Centre and the neighbouring state governments have not done anything to prevent stubble burning in the region,"" he added. ""This will lead to Delhi's air quality deteriorating in the coming days.""/Besides steps to prevent stubble burning, authorities in Delhi will ensure dust from construction sites is kept to a minimum. There will be increased vigilance to keep vehicular emissions in check, the CM said./The action plan details steps such as forming pollution-monitoring teams and increased checks at hot spots. The government has formed 75 teams to ensure dust control at construction sites, 250 teams to prevent open burning of waste and leaves, and nearly 500 teams to ensure all vehicles comply with pollution under control rules. No diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years will be allowed to ply./The action plan has also identified 64 congestion-prone stretches in the Capital, where long traffic snarls resulted in a spike in pollution levels./Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai early last month promised the city will have a detailed winter action plan. To formulate it, multiple agencies such as the municipal corporations, the public works department, and Delhi traffic police, were asked to submit their proposals to manage air pollution./The winter action plan will be implemented in tandem with the Supreme Court-mandated Graded Response Action Plan (Grap)./""The Grap measures will be enforced strictly this season across Delhi NCR. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) will be the overarching body that will monitor the situation and will call in the measures listed under the Grap,"" Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said./Delhi is on the right track in its strategy to control air pollution, but it needs concerted efforts to show results, an expert said./""In addition to the sources that the winter action plan tackles, the government should also ensure that Delhi's urban poor have access to alternatives to using biomass for their space heating requirements,"" said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a think tank. ""One way could be through the creation of clean and warm night shelters.""/""Given that Delhi now has a functional decision support system to pinpoint sources of pollution, the government should ensure that insights provided by it are used to plan and roll out actions in advance to prevent severe air quality levels in the city,"" Ganguly said./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), said that such focus on pollution will help Delhi bring down winter season emissions but there needs to be year-long action for noteworthy results. ""The focus areas that the government has laid out are on-point, but we have discussed this before that Delhi needs action. We will have to ensure that not only do agencies in Delhi work but even other states in the region work together to find a lasting solution for the pollution problems,"" Roychowdhury said./Air pollution has been a stubborn crisis for the Capital and adjoining areas. Meteorological parameters typical for pre-winter months, when wind speed slows down and colder, heavier air drifts settles closer to ground-level, stops tailpipe emissions, road and construction dust, and industrial gases from dispersing./To add to it, smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana catches the north-westerly winds to reach Delhi and other NCR towns, where they push the air quality index into dangerous levels./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

SC on firecracker ban,"New Delhi, Oct. 7 -- No celebration can be allowed at the cost of life of others, said the Supreme Court on Wednesday as it justified the ban on the manufacturing and sale of traditional firecrackers, and implored people to shift to noiseless festivities ahead of Diwali./""We are not averse to celebrations, but we cannot celebrate at the cost of life of others. Where do we get that a celebration must happen by bursting crackers, making noise and pollution? We can have celebrations without noise too,"" said a bench of justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna./The bench added that there are now green crackers that do not make noise. ""Celebrations can also be from fuljhadi (sparkler), etc. It does not need to be noisy crackers only,"" it remarked, when senior lawyers appearing for the firecracker manufacturers talked about striking a balance between celebrations and the right to life of people./The court was considering a clutch of applications for the implementation of its October 23, 2018, judgment that took note of the deteriorating air pollution in major cities and prohibited the production of all traditional firecrackers, including the joined crackers, also known as series crackers or laaris, using barium or its salts. Instead, only green crackers and improved crackers with reduced emissions were allowed to be manufactured and sold./Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for his minor son Arjun Gopal, who is one of the petitioners in the case, also pressed for contempt action against some manufacturers, citing alleged violations of the 2018 order by them./On the other hand, certain firecracker manufacturers came before the bench seeking approval from the central government authorities on their improved crackers ahead of Diwali in November./Typically, levels of air pollutants shoot up on the evening of Diwali as people set off firecrackers that often have compounds such barium that create a toxic smoke when ignited. This lingers due to meteorological conditions typical for this time of the year: low winds. To add to it, for close to a decade now, the air in the National Capital Region is usually laden with PM2.5 pollutants from fire fires, resulting in conditions that expert say is hazardous to breathe in./A report submitted recently by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the use of toxic chemicals in producing firecrackers informed the court that six manufactures had used banned chemical barium or its salt, following which the bench on September 28 issued show-cause notices to the manufacturers./Responding, most of these six manufacturers, including Hindustan Fireworks and Standard Fireworks, claimed that they had purchased barium and its salts but did not use it in manufacturing firecrackers./""What they say is very surprising. They say that they purchased such a huge quantity of barium only to keep it their godowns but not to manufacture. They would not purchase it only for a show...they cannot even keep it in godowns,"" observed the bench./It reiterated that the court's earlier orders on a crackdown on the use of barium and its salt in firecrackers must be complied with by every state, as it wondered how the authorities have not been able to stop the laaris that are still burst in almost all celebrations./Sankaranarayan submitted that the CBI report has put forth a very disturbing picture where manufacturers can be witnessed breaching the law with impunity./At this, the court said that it will hear the issue in detail on October 26 after all the parties go through what the manufacturers have said in their replies to the show-cause notices./States such as Delhi and Odisha have already announced a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers during the upcoming festive season. The Delhi government has also prohibited the storage of firecrackers. This pre-emptive ban was imposed given the city's deteriorating air quality over the past three years, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a series of tweets on September 15./While banning the use of firecrackers through its judgment in 2018, the top court had encouraged the community bursting of crackers within fixed timings: from 8pm to 10pm on Diwali and festival days, and for half-an-hour after midnight on Christmas and New Year's Day. It had held that only green crackers and improved crackers with reduced emissions will be allowed to be manufactured and sold./Barium and its salts in the making of firecrackers were banned owing to poisonous gases causing respiratory problems. The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization was further directed to review the chemical composition of the firecrackers and submit its report to the court to guide on the chemicals that could be used to produce green crackers. During the last hearing on September 28, the court had observed that it cannot let people suffer because of air and sound pollution caused by firecrackers and that its ban must be implemented by all the authorities in letter and spirit./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air quality slips to 'poor' zone at some stations in the Capital,"New Delhi, Oct. 11 -- Air quality in Delhi has started deteriorating, as seven localities out of 36in the national capital fell to the 'poor' category, Central Pollution Control Board data show./Although air pollution is likely to remain in the 'moderate' category because of reasonably strong winds, a rise in is expected in the coming weeks, a scientist at the India Meteorological Department said./The air quality index (AQI) for the city as a whole was 166 on Monday, but it was worse in Shadipur (211), Lodhi Road (231), Jahangirpuri (218), Wazirpur (223), Mundka (256), Anand Vihar (281) and Chandni Chowk (236). A value between 201 and 300 is considered poor, affecting the elderly, children and people with heart and lung problems. A value between 101 and 200 is termed moderate./The last time the city's AQI rose above 200 was on July 2./The impact of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana is still negligible because the winds changed from easterly to northeasterly from October 6, when the southwest monsoon withdrew from the region, explained the Met scientist./""This is likely to remain the case through this week, and because of this the AQI is also expected to remain in the moderate zone,"" the weather scientist said, requesting anonymity./The burning of farm residue, which sends up clouds of smoke into the atmosphere that then descends over the capital, is one of the reasons for the annual bad air crisis that marks autumn in Delhi. The transition to winter also weakens winds, which means local pollutants are not blown away as they usually do during other times of the year./The predominant pollutant in Delhi's air on Monday was PM 10, which is particulate matter less than 10 micrometres thick, or dust, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the air quality monitoring system run by the Union ministry of earth science./""Delhi's AQI is in the moderate category with PM10 as the main pollutant. Due to very dry conditions, local dust gets re-suspended, leading to high PM10,"" Safar's air quality assessment said.

Lockdown data to serve as baseline for India's new air quality standards,"India, Oct. 12 -- The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is working on revising the air quality standards in India with data from the Covid 19 lockdown last year serving as the baseline, Sudheer Chintalapati, joint director at ministry of environments and forest and climate change (MoEFCC), said on Tuesday./""We now have baseline data to show what air quality can be like when anthropogenic emission sources are either absent or very low. The Central Pollution Control Board is now working on revising the air quality standards in India with National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI),"" Chintalapati said at a webinar on 'WHO's revised Air Quality Guidelines: A Health Sector Perspective.'/Last month, the World Health Organization tightened its air quality guidelines last month bringing down the annual PM 2.5 (respirable pollution particles) guideline from 10 micrograms per cubic metres to 5 micrograms per cubic metres and the 24-hour PM 2.5 guideline from 25 micrograms per cubic metres to 15 micrograms per cubic metres. It has also tightened norms for five other pollutants based on recent evidence of health impacts associated with these pollutants./Sagnik Dey, associate professor at Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi who was associated with the baseline study during Covid 19 lockdown said the new standards should have intermediate targets so that implementation can happen in a phased manner./""WHO guidelines also have intermediate targets to help countries and regions achieve the guideline. We do have a baseline now as to how long pollution levels can go when urban air pollution sources are curbed, but we have to remember that household air pollution sources such as cooking and open biomass burning continued during the period which are also major sources of pollution. Now there is enough evidence on the massive health burden of air pollution, so I hope that is studied and incorporated,"" Dey added./Rakesh Kumar, former director of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)- NEERI, said India must work on setting ""achievable"" targets since the ones fixed by WHO were guidelines only. ""Our air pollution levels particularly PM 2.5 levels reduced by 40% to 60% in most regions during the complete lockdown period (March-April 2020). But even then, levels were not close to the WHO standards and often did not meet our national standards. Let's not jump at numbers from the WHO guidelines. Those are only guidelines. We have to develop standards that are achievable in India and are closer to our baseline,"" Kumar said./Maria Neira, Director, Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health Department (PHE), World Health Organisation who also spoke at the webinar said that if the revised WHO guidelines are met globally 80% of the 7 million premature deaths and loss of millions more healthy years of life can be prevented./Dr Arun Sharma, director, National Institute for Implementation Research for Non-Communicable Diseases said the revised WHO guidelines should be taken as a warning.

"High metal concentration in Delhi air putting residents at risk, says TERI study","India, Oct. 13 -- Delhi has a high concentration of heavy metals in its air, exposing the residents, specially the children, to a range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, a study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has said./The study was carried out in six cities across India, with different air pollution ecologies-Delhi (megacity), Ludhiana (high industrial activities), Patiala (high agricultural and biomass burning), Panchkula (PM 2.5 attained city), Vishakapatnam (coastal region) and Jaisalmer (desert). The researchers analysed air quality levels in October 2019./The study showed that in October 2019, when Delhi's pollution levels start getting worse, the concentration of zinc in the city's PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) was 379 ng/m3 (nanogram per cubic metre of air), this increased to 615 ng/m3 in September 2020. Similarly, the share of lead in Delhi's air was 233ng/m3 in 2019, which increased to 406ng/m3 in 2020, the concentration of arsenic increased from 3ng/m3 to 11ng/m3 and cadmium increased from 8ng/m3 to 21ng/m3./Scientists who conducted the study said that some of these metals were extremely toxic for human health and regular exposure to it can lead to fatal health consequences. For instance, increased concentration of cadmium and arsenic in the air can overtime result in higher risk of cancer, kidney issues and, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases./According to experts, the primary sources of metals in Delhi's air is vehicular exhaust, open fires and fumes from industrial operations in neighbouring states./""Factors such as high traffic volume in Delhi and industrial activities in areas surrounding it, leads to increased share of heavy metals in the air. We all are aware of the how PM 2.5 and PM10 levels are monitored and how its fluctuation can hamper us, but it is also very important to understand the chemical make of the pollutants that you are being exposed to. For instance, the PM 2.5 levels in your city could be under 60ug/m3, which is considered an acceptable standard, but if the air has high concentration of toxic metals then your health is at a higher risk,"" said Kanhaiya Lal, associate fellow (environment and health), TERI./Lal said that one of the motives behind this study, apart from breaking down the pollution profile of different cities and highlighting its health impacts, was also to push for better policies prioritising action on air pollution and the formulation of a new heavy metal exposure index (HMEI), which will help monitor the share of metals in a city's air./Children at higher risk/The study also highlighted the impact of high pollution levels and constant exposure on children. Scientists conducted a detailed health survey of 413 children in the national capital between the age group of 14-17 years, and also put them through lung function tests, to assess how rise in pollution levels, especially during the winter season, impacts children's health./Findings show that out of the 413 children surveyed in Delhi, 75.4% complained of breathlessness, 24.2% complained of itchiness in eyes, 22.3% reported regular sneezing or runny nose, 20.9% children complained of cough in the morning.

Grap curbs may kick in even if air not poor,"New Delhi, Oct. 14 -- Curbs like bans on diesel generators and the use of coal-fired ovens, and activities such as routine mechanised sweeping should begin in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) on October 15 irrespective of the air quality at the time, suggested the members of an air quality commission in a meeting on Tuesday, recommending that all 'poor' and some 'very poor' protocols of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) be activated./The recommendations were by a subcommittee of the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM), according to documents seen by HT.

The first of these is the 'moderate to poor' range, when the use of coal and firewood in restaurants and open kitchens is banned, strict checks are carried out to control garbage fires and regular mechanised sweeping is done./These restrictions and pollution-control measures become stricter and more intense as the different thresholds are crossed./The Capital and its adjoining areas are plunged into a health crisis in the days leading to winter as winds bring in toxic smoke from farm fires in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab. Local pollution, such as dust and transport emissions, as well as a dip in the temperature, make the problem worse, often pushing pollution levels to alarming levels./On Tuesday, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was at 171, a marginal improvement from 177 a day ago. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.

What are green crackers? Know which states imposed rules on fireworks this year,"India, Oct. 16 -- In view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) related situation and concerns surrounding the rising level of pollution due to firecrackers during the festive season, several states have imposed certain rules on fireworks this year. These vary from either a complete or a partial ban on firecracker sales in these respective states to permitting the sale of 'green crackers' instead. Here are the various mandates imposed in states across India over the use of firecrackers amid the ongoing festive season:/What are green crackers?/'Green crackers' are low-emission fireworks permitted by the Supreme Court for celebrations to a moderate degree during festivals, relaxing the 'complete ban' on fireworks previously imposed in 2017. These green crackers, researched and developed by experts at the CSIR-NEERI (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute), a government-funded research instutite in the field of environmental science, have a small shell size compared to normal crackers./These green crackers are produced with less harmful raw materials, in accordance with instructions issued by the top court, and are made in a way that suppresses the dust when they are burnt - thus reducing emissions. They also do not contain harmful chemicals such as lithium, arsenic, barium, and lead and instead release water vapour that does not allow the dust to rise. Although still impactful on the climate to an extent, these green crackers are believed to cause 30 per cent less particulate matter pollution than traditional crackers and are thus considered generally less harmful than their conventional alternatives./Rajasthan to allow 'only' green crackers/The Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government on Friday reversed a decision to ban the sale and use of crackers in the state and instead in a revised advisory said that ""only"" the green crackers would be allowed. The government also issued the restricted timing for the bursting of crackers during the festive season./According to the revised advisory, green crackers can be burst from 8pm to 10pm during festivals like Diwali and Guruparb, from 6am to 8am on Chhath puja, and from 11:55pm to 12:30am on Christmas and New Year. The use of crackers would continue to be banned, however, at places having air quality index in the ""poor"" zone or below. The advisory further informed that the crackers could be verified as ""green"" by scanning the QR code on the box issued by the CSIR-NEERI./Complete ban on bursting, sale of firecrackers in Delhi/The Delhi Pollution Control Committee has ordered a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1, 2022. According to the order, several experts have indicated a possibility of another surge of Covid-19 and largescale celebrations by bursting of firecrackers will result not only in agglomeration of people in violation of social distancing norms but also a high level of air pollution leading to serious health issues in Delhi./The bursting of firecrackers under the prevalent pandemic crisis is not favourable for the cause of larger community health given the significant relationship between air pollution and respiratory infections, it said./Meanwhile, the Delhi Police was reported to have initiated crackdowns on the distribution of illegal fireworks, the sale of which has increased as Diwali is just around the corner. According to the ANI news agency, the cops raided a godown in north Delhi's Sadar Bazar area this week seizing more than 470kg of illegal fireworks, arresting the owner of the property in the process./Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin urges counterparts to relax ban, allow green crackers/Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, on the other hand, has urged his Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Odisha counterparts to seriously consider the sale of green crackers in their respective territories, following which Rajasthan eased its norms./In a letter to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Stalin had requested to lift the ban and allow the sale of firecrackers that fall within the norms set by the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal./What did the Supreme Court say?/Earlier in July, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea challenging the National Green Tribunal's order for the imposition of a complete ban on the sale and use of all firecrackers during the Covid-19 pandemic in cities and said that no further clarification or deliberation was required. The apex court said that the authorities may permit the sale and use of firecrackers as per the category of AQI in the cities./The bench said that manufacturing or production of firecrackers was allowed and those who wanted to use firecrackers could do so with permission depending upon the category of AQI. It clarified that the ban is in places where air quality is poor and there is no ban on the manufacture./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi's air quality 'steadily deteriorating', says Kejriwal; reason to worry","New Delhi, Oct. 17 -- Delhi's air quality has dropped to 'very poor' levels and is ""steadily deteriorating"", Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, raising the alarm for the national capital as a thick blanket of the dreadful smog envelopes the city sky. With winter approaching and pollution levels rising to dangerous levels like every year, people have turned their attention towards the air quality index (AQI), largely affected by unfavourable environmental factors, along with vehicular fumes and stubble burning./According to the pollution data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 4pm today, Delhi's air quality slipped to 298 in the 'poor' category, deteriorating day by day. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai earlier pointed out that the AQI in the city was 171 till October 13 that rose to 284 due to stubble-burning in the neighbouring states./Hitting out at the neighbouring states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the Kejriwal blamed them for the rise in pollution now and appealed to them to ""understand"" their responsibility and help the farmers dispose of their stubble./The chief minister said that the Delhi government controlled the air pollution and the rise in the air pollution in the city now is because of the stubble burning in the neighbouring states. Kejriwal had on Saturday shared a map showing stubble fires across north India./""Delhi's own pollution, including vehicles and industries, is within the safe limit. I have been tweeting pollution data in Delhi for the last 1 month. Pollution has started increasing from the last 3-4 days, it is the pollution of stubble, which is burning in the surrounding states,"" Kejriwal said while inaugurating a hospital in Shalimar Bagh./The chief minister further highlighted the Delhi government's efforts to control the pollution and said that the government made a solution which ""if you sprinkle it on the stubble, there is no need to burn it thereafter""./How to measure air quality index (AQI)/In India, air quality is measured on a 500-point scale where a 0-50 rating is considered good, while anywhere between 301-500 is considered dangerous. Here are the categories:/0-50: Good - None to minimal impact/51-100: Satisfactory - People prone to health conditions may experience slight difficulty in breathing/101-200: Moderate - People with asthma, lung and heart diseases and other health conditions may experience difficulty in breathing. Children and the elderly may also face slight discomfort./201-300: Poor - Can cause breathing difficulties in people if exposed for longer durations. People with asthma, lung and heart diseases and other health conditions are advised to stay indoors as much as possible./301-400: Very poor - Prolonged exposure to these AQI levels can cause respiratory diseases. People with asthma, lung and heart diseases and other health conditions are particularly affected./401-500: Severe - Extremely unhealthy air, can cause breathing difficulty while light physical exertion too. It can cause respiratory diseases in healthy persons as well as people with lung and heart conditions. Best to stay indoors./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

And the air in Delhi was 'good' - after 413 days,"New Delhi, Oct. 19 -- Residents of Delhi breathed good air after 413 days on Monday as heavy downpours through the day settled down pollutants. It was the first time since 2015 that the air in national capital has been so clean in October./The overall Air Quality Index in Delhi fell to 46, categorised as 'good' by the Central Pollution Control Board, a drop of over 250 in just a day. The index on Sunday had shot up to 298 on Sunday, which is categorised as 'poor' that leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure./The relief might be short-lived as winds from the northwest blow in smoke from the farm stubble fires in Haryana and Punjab in the coming days, experts said./Monday was Delhi's first spell of good air not just in 2021, but since August 31 last year, data from the federal pollution watchdog showed. Delhi has not breathed good air in October since at least 2015, when the agency started keeping AQI records./The drastic fall in pollution levels was more due to the duration of the rains, scientists of the Indian weather office said, as well as showers in neighbouring states, potentially negating the effect of smoke from the burning of farm residue./""Delhi has received some intense rain spells this year, but this time, there was a drastic fall in pollution levels because the rain was widespread throughout Delhi and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and others, and it also lasted for a longer duration,"" said VK Soni, head of the environment and research department at the India Meteorological Department./""We have seen that intense rain spells during monsoon this year were usually shorter spells, which lasted between two and three hours, because of which pollution levels did not drop as drastically as they did on Monday,"" Soni said./Delhi this year saw one of the most erratic monsoons ever, Met department data show. It started off with an unusually delayed arrival. Instead of it normal arrival date of June 27, monsoon this year entered the capital on July 13, 16 days behind schedule. This was the most delayed arrival in 19 years. In 2002, monsoon hit Delhi on July 19./The city progressively broke a slew of monsoon-related weather records. The rains in Delhi broke records in July, August and September. Most of the city's rainy days saw showers concentrated into a few hours, battering the city's infrastructure and throwing normal life off kilter./The capital's air quality has steadily dropped all month, a decline that accelerated on Friday, when AQI reached the far end of the 'moderate' zone at 198. On Saturday, as winds calmed, air pollution got worse and reached 284, before climbing to 298 the next day./Delhi in 2020 recorded five good air days, the most since AQI recordings began. This, however, was likely due to curbs on social and economic activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The restrictions have largely been lifted now./In 2015 and 2016, Delhi did not record a single good air day. In 2017, two such days were recorded - July 30 and July 31. After another year of no good air day in 2018, Delhi in 2019 recorded two good air days on August 18 and 19, official data reveal./This respite from severe air pollution will be short-lived and air quality will start getting worse under the impact of northwesterly winds from October 21, Soni said./The winds will blow from the northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday but will change to northwesterly from Thursday, when air quality will again deteriorate, Soni said./Easterly winds on Monday ensured the share of stubble fires in Delhi's air was only 1%, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) of the ministry of earth science. The rains also kept local pollutants in check, it said./""Local land surfaces are wet and so dust re-suspension is minimum; this is also keeping the PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) levels low. The presence of western disturbance has led to scattered rainfall over north India, leading to low biomass burning. This condition improved the AQI with low PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels. Fire counts reduced to 170 and its share was only 1%,"" Safar's air quality analysis read./""Moist surfaces inhibit re-suspension of dust, which will keep the AQI in 'good' range for the next 24 hours and after that it will degrade to the 'satisfactory' category,"" the analysis predicted./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Health camps, awareness drives for patients of respiratory diseases in Noida","India, Oct. 20 -- Amid the rising air pollution in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district health department has appointed a nodal officer who has been tasked to hold health camps and awareness drives across the district and to maintain proper stock of medicines and medical equipment for people with lung diseases who are at a greater risk from air pollution./According to health officials, accredited social health activists (ASHAs) and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) workers have been instructed to carry out awareness drives in rural areas./""The health workers will inform and educate patients at risk of aggravating respiratory illnesses like bronchitis and asthma on precautions to be taken by them in order to avoid air worsening conditions. Besides, people will be advised to wear eye protecting glasses in order to avoid allergic conjunctivitis,""said Dr Amit Kumar, nodal officer appointed for the purpose by the district health department./The officials said that since people working in industrial sectors are exposed to more pollutants, the health department will also hold health camps in those areas./""The health camps will be organised in the industrial areas for those at the risk of respiratory issues due to high concentration of pollutants in the air. Besides, awareness campaigns will also be carried out to inform the workers about preventive measures to be taken in order to avoid any health issues due to pollutants,"" said Dr Kumar./The officials will also carry out inspections at government hospitals and health centres in the district to ensure availability of medicines and medical equipment. ""During the inspections, we will ensure medicines required for treatment of patients of respiratory illnesses and equipment such as inhalers and nebulisers are in sufficient quantity,"" he said./Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, ""The health department has been tasked to take curative measures in case pollution levels in the district increase and respiratory issues among patients are reported. These are precautionary steps and no such cases have been reported so far.""/On Wednesday, the air quality of Noida dipped to the 'poor' category.

"Good to poor in 48 hours: Bad air back in Delhi, and set to get worse","India, Oct. 21 -- Air pollution levels rebounded sharply into the poor zone on Wednesday after unseasonal rains and strong winds led to a rare 'good' Air Quality Index (AQI) day for this time of the year earlier this week, a turn for the worse that experts fear will only deteriorate in coming days./Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed the 24-hour average AQI at 4pm on Wednesday at 221 - a drastic worsening from Monday's 46 (good) and Tuesday's 69 (satisfactory)./Experts said the sharp fall in air quality was due to the impact of smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states, and calm local winds./Pollution levels started rising from Tuesday night when the wind blowing into Delhi changed direction from northeast to northwest, bringing in plumes of smoke from agrarian states upwind - Punjab and Haryana./After an AQI of 69 at 4pm on Tuesday, the index deteriorated to 184 on Wednesday at 11am. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe""./As of 7pm on Wednesday, the average AQI in 26 (out of 36 localities with pollution-monitoring stations) was in the 'poor' category. Two areas - Dwarka and Anand Vihar - slipped into the 'very poor' zone, with readings of 311 and 348 respectively./Senior scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the spike in pollution levels was primary because of the large number of farm fires in neighbouring states and calm local winds, which had a relatively higher share of moisture, enabling local pollutants to hang close to the air near the ground levels instead of being dispersed higher in the atmosphere./They also warned that the situation is likely to get worse in the coming days./On Wednesday, the humidity levels in Delhi were 53%./""The air quality is expected to remain in the 'poor' category this week,"" said VK Soni, head of IMD's environment and research department./The Capital's air quality had steadily worsened all month, a decline that accelerated on Friday, when the AQI reached the far end of the ""moderate"" zone at 198./On Saturday, as winds calmed, the AQI reached 284, before climbing to 298 the next day. It then fell by over 250 points on the back of a record October rain on Monday./Between Sunday and Monday, the national capital recorded 87.9mm rainfall, the fourth highest in a day ever in October, and the highest since 1956, when the city received 111mm rain, according to IMD data./This resulted in the first good AQI day since August 31, 2020./An analysis by the Union ministry of earth science' air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research's (Safar) shows that 746 fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana on Wednesday, contributing to 12% of Delhi's PM 2.5 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres)./""Fire emission from upwind region enhances PM2.5 concentration as winds at transport level are from northwest region. Stubble burning share is likely to increase in next two days if there is no rain. The overall AQI is likely to further degrade to higher end of poor for next three days,"" Safar's air analysis for Delhi read./Their analysis also attributed the pollution spike to high stubble fire count, calm winds and low ventilation and local dust./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Green infra is the health insurance Delhi needs,"India, Oct. 25 -- For long, Delhi learnt to associate even moderate spells of downpour with waterlogged roads. But last Monday, few seemed to resent traffic snarls triggered by the heaviest 24-hour rainfall recorded for October since 1956. The intense shower washed away pollutants that were setting the stage for the city's annual choking season, giving Delhi its first ""good' air day of 2021./Ironical as it may sound, it took extreme rain to offer relief from high pollution. But two wrongs don't make a right and the respite was temporary. Soon enough, the wind pattern changed and smoke from the stubble burning on the paddy fields of Punjab and Haryana combined with local pollutants started fouling up the air in the national capital. In 48 hours, ""good"" category air entered into the ""poor"" zone on the national air quality index, only to fall into the ""moderate"" zone with a change in wind direction, followed by another spell of unseasonal rain this Sunday./But controlling farm fires and baseline local pollution will still require combined administrative action and citizen participation from Delhi and its neighbouring states. Just as we need to rethink our development strategies to cope with severe weather conditions than can no longer be dismissed as seasonal vagaries./Erratic weather trends/In 15 months, Delhi's weather has thrown up many surprises. An exhaustive list of meteorological trends compiled by my colleague Soumya Pillai showed a succession of extreme rainfall, heat and cold events./If August 2020 recorded the highest rainfall since 2013, October witnessed the lowest average minimum temperature in 58 years. In January 2021, Delhi received the highest rainfall for the month in 21 years. February, a winter month, was the second warmest in 120 years. While March 29 was the hottest March day in 76 years, at 11.7 degrees C, April 4 recorded the lowest minimum temperature for April in at least a decade. The first few days of July were unusually hot, registering four heatwave days. In the much-delayed monsoon season that followed, Delhi not only saw prolonged dry spells, but also recorded the second-highest rainfall since 1964 and the wettest September since 1944. The post-monsoon downpour in October is already the highest monthly rainfall since 1960./Weather scientists have attributed the current set of extreme events to ""temporary atmospheric conditions"", but the future looks worrisome. The Delhi action plan on climate change, which was submitted in 2019 and expired soon after, in its chapter on vulnerability assessment states that by 2050, the annual temperature of Delhi is slated to increase by 1-4 degrees Celsius and rainfall too would intensify, and these changes in climate can lead to large-scale damage to life and property./Delhi is not alone/Like Delhi, numerous cities across the world and many within India have witnessed extreme weather events. Inundated by record-breaking rain, the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou had cars swept away and passengers trapped inside the mass transit this July. Videos of a stream of water gushing down an underground subway station in New York City last month triggered debates on whether Big Apple's infrastructure was designed to withstand such events./A heatwave gripped North America this summer as the temperature peaked at 49.6 degrees Celsius in British Columbia's Lytton village. In the United States, Portland suspended streetcar services and Seattle ran light rail at reduced speeds because of overheating of infrastructure. Closer home, Nanital, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar and Bengaluru have recorded unusually heavy rain in short spells./Cause and effect/As Delhi jumps from one seasonal meltdown to another, it has only bad planning to blame for the mess - a manifestation of haphazard urbanisation, mindless tendency to overbuild, inadequacies in the city's basic infrastructure and poor civic upkeep. Fixing accountability for any of these has remained a challenge due to the national capital's complicated governance structure and multiplicity of authority./Unsurprisingly, for a city that gets waterlogged after every shower, Delhi's water table has sunk dangerously low. The obsession with brick and mortar and excessive use of asphalt and concrete - 21% of Delhi's land area is roads - leave little space for rainwater to percolate underground and replenish the aquifers. Sealed with concrete, even trees and plants are choking./Concretisation, emissions from vehicles - Delhi has 11.9 million registered vehicles - overuse of air-conditioners, and closely-packed, poorly-ventilated buildings in dense neighbourhoods have turned many pockets in the city into heat islands, characterised by a localised increase in air and surface temperatures chiefly due to heat absorption./Cost of urbanisation/The National Capital Region (NCR), which has 20 cities and towns including Delhi, has seen a 17-fold increase in urban and built-up areas between 1972 and 2014, stated a 2018 study by IIT-Delhi's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences' Ankur Prabhat Sati and Manju Mohan./Another study by Manju Mohan et al published in Urban Climate last year said that in NCR areas, where cropland was converted to the urban landscape, the surface heat island saw an increase of 4 to 6 degrees Celsius, and canopy layer heat island intensified by 2 to 4 degrees C at night. The daytime temperature saw an increase of 2 degrees Celsius at the surface and 1 degree C at the canopy level./Specifically, in Delhi, increased urbanisation and modification of land surfaces pushed up the average ambient temperatures by 1.02 degrees Celsius in these five decades. Around 500 sq km area, experienced an increase in night-time canopy level heat island of more than 4 degrees Celsius, which the study stated was non-existent 50 years ago. Within this pocket, 23 sq km has in the last decade seen a canopy heat island effect of 5 degC and more./Consequently, ""thermally uncomfortable"" hours increased from an average of 10 to 13 hours a day and comfortable hours decreased from around three hours to around one hour per day, the study said, adding that the heat island intensity would exacerbate after anthropogenic (caused by human activity) heat, greenhouse gases, and other pollutant emissions are factored in./This month, another study ranked Dhaka, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangkok and Mumbai as the top five settlements with the highest annual increase in extreme heat exposure. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by researchers from UC Santa Barbara and Columbia University, tracked urban population exposure to extreme heat from 1983 to 2016 in more than 13,000 settlements and calculated the share of exposure from population growth versus total urban warming (from urban heat island effect and anthropogenic climate change). While the exposure trajectories for Delhi and Kolkata matched, Delhi's population growth contributed to nearly 75% of the increase in the city's heat exposure, while population growth accounted for only 48% of the annual rate of increase in exposure in Kolkata./Of the 1,483 sq km of Delhi's total area, 977 sq km is built up or proposed for urbanisation; 200 sq km is kept for public utilities; 195 sq km is forest, ridge, floodplain, water bodies and drains; and 110 is agriculture land and greenbelt. As much as 97.5% of Delhi's population lives in urban areas, which is the highest among all Indian states and UTs./A health warning/Plummeting water tables, rising temperatures and frequent flooding have obvious consequences for health and Delhi is already showing serious symptoms./The Yamuna water is over-extracted, leaving little to maintain the minimum flow required to keep the river alive even as the city continues to bank on borrowed water. The demand-supply gap stands at 300 million gallons per day against the daily supply of 935 MGD from the Delhi Jal Board. With unpaved surfaces shrinking, precious rainwater, which can recharge groundwater, is lost in run-off, flowing directly into stormwater drains, which are already filled with sewage, and reaching the Yamuna as a toxic mix./Delhi's clogged, encroached and, in many places, absent drainage is not just an eyesore but a disease factory throughout the year. In 2010, for instance, when Delhi saw a prolonged monsoon, as many as 6,259 cases of dengue were recorded. This year again, record rainfall combined with general civic apathy is being blamed for a spurt in dengue cases as Delhi reported the season's first fatality on Monday./The health woes don't stop here. Heatwave-triggered cramps and heat strokes are commonly reported in Delhi throughout the summer even as the rising levels of air pollution are suppressing the immunity of Delhi residents, leaving them vulnerable to lung and heart diseases, and even cancer./Inequality makes it worse/Those who can afford have made all efforts to weather-proof their living environment. A study by researchers Santosh Harish, Nishmeet Singh and Rahul Tongia published in Energy Policy last year shows that with the temperature rising from 30 degrees Celsius to 39 degrees Celsius, the aggregate demand for electricity in Delhi shoots up from 30 to 43%. It also increased from 2 to 12% as the temperature dropped from 12 degrees to 6 degrees Celsius. This is mainly on account of the use of air-conditioners in summers and heating equipment in winters./""As temperature extremes worsen due to urban heat island effects and over the long-term climate change, households respond through increased use of electricity. Unsurprisingly, wealthier households have a much greater ability to respond to extreme temperatures, hot or cold. Our analysis shows how lower-income households are unable to respond beyond a point, due to the limitations of fans and coolers compared to ACs,"" explained Harish, fellow at Centre for Policy Research./He pointed to a ""feedback loop"" between increased AC use and increased local temperatures in cities such as Delhi, which further worsens this inequity./In unauthorised colonies and informal settlements that house one-third of Delhi's population, buildings are so tightly packed that they block sunlight and air coming into the homes./Greenery mitigates air pollution, absorbs stormwater run-offs locally, and is known to have a cooling effect. But a park, or even a tree, is a luxury in most of Delhi's working-class neighbourhoods. Clearly, reimagining Delhi will require reasonable democratisation of public infrastructure as well as green and open spaces./The way out/The past year's weather events are a wake-up call and Delhi must do all it can to safeguard against their unpredictability./After a series of urban flooding episodes this monsoon, the Delhi government has decided to implement the drainage master plan. Prepared by IIT-Delhi, the plan calls for overhauling the faulty drainage system and expanding the network. It also sets some ground rules for housekeeping - garbage and sewage should not enter stormwater drains, construction should not block or encroach upon critical infrastructure, and desilting must be efficient./But an overhaul of the city's drainage will require big funds and coordination between as many as 11 agencies. Putting in place an institutional mechanism will require administrative unity and a political will./Harvesting rain is the cheapest and fastest remedy for urban flooding. The drainage plan itself recommends ""low impact development"" options such as creating infiltration trenches, rain gardens, bio-retention ponds, bio-swales, which can absorb rainwater right where it falls, and incorporating water bodies and other water retention zones into the drainage system./Delhi government's ""city of lakes"" project, which aims to restore 255 water bodies and 23 lakes in the next two years, and Delhi Development Authority's move to acquire and restore 650 water bodies located in 168 rural-turned-urban villages is a good complementary initiative, provided they keep up the momentum and maintain the right ecological balance in the restoration process./As for fighting the summer heat, Delhi could start by losing some concrete, asphalt and dark surfaces. Building permeable pavements that allow grass and trees to grow freely offer the twin benefits of cooling and stormwater absorption./Many cities across the world are experimenting with cool roofs. Use of highly reflective paint or reflective tiles reduces heat absorption and cut energy use by up to 20%. New York City even offers free installation of cool roofs in lower-income housing and community building. Building codes in certain specified building types in Philadelphia, Washington DC and Los Angeles require the use of cool roofing materials, states a resource guide of C40, a cities climate leadership group./Nature-based infrastructure is not just good aesthetics, it is also a city's best health insurance against the human-induced crises of air pollution, overheating and flooding./HT's metro editor and one of the most perceptive and experienced journalists covering India's capital region, Shivani Singh, resumes her column, Metro Matters exclusively for HT Premium readers/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

West Bengal allows green crackers on Kali Puja and Chhath; PIL seeks blanket ban,"India, Oct. 27 -- The West Bengal government on Wednesday allowed bursting of green crackers for around two hours during Kali Puja and Chhath Puja and for about 35 minutes on Christmas and New Year's Eve./This comes at a time when the Centre has warned the state of rising Covid-19 cases in Kolkata after Durga Puja festivities./Recently a section of Kolkata's leading doctors, environmental experts and medical associations jointly submitted a letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee requesting a blanket ban on firecrackers. A PIL has also been filed in the Calcutta High Court seeking a complete ban on firecrackers. The matter will be heard on Friday./The order issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board says that there has been a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers, except green crackers in the state. During Kali Puja bursting of green crackers has been allowed from 8 pm to 10 pm, and on Chhath Puja it has been allowed from 6 am to 8 am. During Christmas and New Year green crackers have been allowed from 11:55 pm to 12:30 am. Diwali will be celebrated across the country on November 4 this year./In 2020, the Calcutta High Court had banned the use and sale of firecrackers on Kali Puja to curb pollution amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government too had appealed to the people to avoid bursting firecrackers during Kali Puja and Diwali in order to check air pollution./""Much damage has been caused by the rampant violations of Covid-19 safety protocols during Durga Puja. Cases have started rising once again in the city and across the state. We should at least show some restraint during Kali Puja by not bursting crackers and fireworks this time. The smoke and pollution would cause more harm to patients who are suffering from Covid-19 or are recovering from the disease,"" said Manas Gumta, general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors in the state./The Durga Puja, the biggest festival in the state, ended on October 15 and the daily count of Covid-19 cases is once again hovering around the 1000-mark after a gap of more than three months. Nearly 974 new Covid-19 cases were detected in the state on Saturday, and on Sunday the number shot up further to 989. On Monday and Tuesday, it remained a little above the 800-mark./The Kolkata Police have started intensifying action against citizens for violating Covid-19 safety protocols as the daily count of cases has shot up in the city after the festivities./With the daily count of Covid-19 cases shooting up in West Bengal after the festive season, the state administration has started re-introducing containment zones to check the spread of the virus. Containment zones have already come up in Howrah, North 24 Parganas - the district with the highest number of daily cases after Kolkata, Jalpaiguri and Hooghly. In Kolkata, however, no such zones have been declared./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi air pollution: Heed the warnings,"India, Oct. 27 -- Rain and favourable wind might have delayed the onset of winter pollution in Delhi, but air quality forecasts for the coming days suggest that the Capital is headed towards an air emergency, this newspaper reported on Wednesday. This expected change in the air quality has been attributed to two reasons: A spike in stubble fires and Diwali (November 4). The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's forecast said the contribution of stubble smoke in Delhi's PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels is expected to reach around 65% by the first week of November. The current contribution of farm fires to Delhi's PM is about 40%. The delayed withdrawal of monsoon from north India and the heavy post-monsoon showers in October resulted in the slow start to the stubble burning season this year. However, this does not indicate that there will be a drop in the cumulative numbers of fires in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers carry out the practice to clear their fields quickly for the next cropping season./The warning about the beginning of another round of this annual crisis shows that there has been no concerted and united effort by the Centre (to bring all airshed states together to find a solution to the stubble burning problem) and the Delhi government, which has been promoting the Pusa bio decomposer, to tackle the issue. The ongoing farmers' protests have added to the challenge. On Wednesday, the Delhi government launched the 'Patake Nahi, Diye Jalao' (Light diyas, not crackers) campaign to implement the Supreme Court ban on the use of conventional firecrackers./As in every year, this winter will demonstrate whether the city government has done anything at all to tackle the other sources of pollution (industrial pollution, garbage burning, leaf burning, and dust control), and the effectiveness of its pollution surveillance system. Only deeper and timely emission cuts across sectors can keep pollution levels under check in the Delhi-National Capital Region./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi's mercury falls below 15, bad air rises","India, Oct. 27 -- /<a href=""mailto:letters@hindustantimes.com"">letters@hindustantimes.com</a>/The mercury fell below the 15-degree mark on Wednesday morning for the first time this winter, with the minimum temperature recorded at 14.6 degrees Celsius - two notches below normal -- as Delhi's air quality deteriorated sharply in the last 24 hours, and was expected to get over the rest of the week./Delhi's overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 232 (poor), from Tuesday's reading of 139 (moderate), largely owing to a rise in farm fires across the northern plains as the contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's overall PM 2.5 concentration touched a season high of 16%, data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) showed./Safar, which comes under the Union ministry of earth sciences, has forecast that the air quality will further deteriorate ""rapidly"" in the next 24 hours to touch ""very poor"" by Thursday, and then hit the higher end of the ""very poor"" category by Friday./""Delhi's AQI is in the 'poor' category. The effective fire count of stubble burning in the northwest region of Delhi is 656 and its share in PM2.5 is 16% as transport level winds are north westerly. AQI is now forecasted to deteriorate rapidly and slip to the 'very poor' category by Thursday and deteriorate further to the higher end of the 'very poor' category by Friday,"" SAFAR said on Wednesday, stating that calm local winds, along with highly favourable transport-level winds (northwesterly winds that will bring pollution from Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi) are expected to enhance stubble-burning related intrusion./""Any increase in fire counts in the next three days would increase the finer particle levels of Delhi,"" it added./Prior to Wednesday, the highest contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's air was 15% on October 21./Two stations - Shadipur and Anand Vihar were in the ""very poor"" category, with readings of 316 and 313 respectively./An AQI between 51 and 100 is classified as ""satisfactory"", between 101 and 200 is ""moderate"", between 201 and 300 is ""poor"", and between 301 and 400 is ""very poor"". An AQI over 401 is meanwhile classified as ""severe"" by the Central Pollution Control Board. The Capital's air quality deteriorates to hazardous levels every winter, plunging the city into a public health emergency./Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says while a delayed monsoon has helped control pollution spikes, historical data shows an episodic smog event is generally seen in late-October and early November, coinciding with stubble burning peaks and Diwali./""With the current meteorological conditions, we may see another such event before or around Diwali and the exposure to air pollution during this period is at its peak. With Covid-19 still around, as a community, we may have to avoid exposure to outside air and this is generally seen each year when regulatory agencies ask people to avoid stepping out or exercising during smog events,"" she said./Safdarjung,Delhi's base station recorded a maximum temperature of 28.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday - three notches below normal, while the minimum was recorded at 14.6 degrees. Mayur Vihar recorded the lowest maximum temperature on Wednesday at 26.8 degrees, while the lowest minimum across Delhi was 14.1 degrees Celsius at Mungeshpur./A Met official says local winds are becoming calm at night, which coincides with a drop in temperature, leading to a spike in pollution late at night and in the morning. ""Following the rain, there is also moisture in the air and you are now seeing a slight haze at night. Calm winds mean the contribution from stubble burning and local pollutants are now becoming trapped and similar conditions are expected in the next few days,"" said the official who asked not to be named./IMD has forecast the minimum temperature to remain around 14 degrees Celsius for the next two days, and said it could dip to 13 degrees by Saturday.

Playing the field: Meet the earth warrior who has won a &#163;1 million global prize,"India, Oct. 29 -- Had it not been for the pandemic, Vidyut Mohan would have been shaking hands with Prince William and Kate Middleton, chatting with naturalist David Attenborough, and attending an ultra-exclusive concert by Ed Sheeran two weeks ago./Instead, the co-founder and CEO of the social enterprise Takachar had to make do with a virtual broadcast as he sat in his Delhi home./It's still a pretty big deal. Mohan, 30, is one of first five winners of the Earthshot Prize, the 1-million-pound ( Rs.10.33 crore) award instituted by the Duke of Cambridge to reward solutions to climate change. Its name is a take on US President John F Kennedy's 1960s Moonshot project to put a man on the moon./Winners for the Earthshot prize were chosen from about 750 nominations worldwide. Already, the prize is being dubbed the Eco Oscars. And Mohan says his inbox is now flooded with offers from companies and government agencies hoping to partner with him. ""Suddenly, there's a lot of outward-facing attention,"" he says, new to the spotlight./Takachar is new to everything. It was only set up in 2018. The name combines the words for money (taka) and carbon (char) and aims to help farmers find lucrative uses for their crop waste after the harvest, so that they don't end up burning the waste and smoking out the skies for miles in every direction. Most solutions involve sending the biomass - heaping piles of wet leaves, stalks, rotting husks, coconut shells and grass - to a treatment centre. There, it is incinerated using oxygen-lean torrefaction - ""like roasting coffee beans,"" Mohan says -producing fertiliser, fuel or low-smoke activated-carbon pellets./""The process worked. It was just hard to implement and scale,"" says Mohan. Setting up such a plant costs about Rs.3 crore, much more than small rural communities can afford, and farmers must take on the additional cost of transporting their waste to the site. ""Instead of sending the biomass to the plant, what if we modified the equipment so it could come to the fields?"" says Mohan./His solution: a smaller, cheaper, low-maintenance reactor that can be towed by tractors or transported inside a shipping container and processes field waste on site. ""At harvest, farmers in a 1- or 2-km radius can take all their waste to one man in the village and dispose of it safely,"" says Mohan./They're paid for the waste too. Rice straw can fetch Rs.1,800 to Rs.2,000 per tonne; pine needles go for Rs.2,500; coconut shells can command as much as Rs.15,000. Takachar also helps the operator of the reactor find a market for the pellets or the fertiliser, creating more wealth in the village, and, crucially, cutting out crop burning./The reactor has been developed and patented by Takachar's co-founder, Kevin Kung, an American with a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who is also president and CTO. The company has worked with 150 of the machines and 4,500 farmers across Haryana, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu and Kenya to process 3,000 tonnes of crop waste since 2018. At Earthshot, it won the award in the Clean Our Air category./***/Mohan has had a lifelong interest in technology and the environment. His uncle, an eco-hydrologist, got him interested in the subject as a child. He has designed solar-powered homes for areas with no or low electricity. His 2013 Master's thesis at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands researched disposal of bio-waste. It showed him how communities in Uttarakhand doubled their monthly incomes by collecting and selling pine needles from the forest floor, unwittingly also preventing forest fires. He lived through what he calls ""the great smog of 2016"", when air pollution levels in Delhi hit 16 times the safe limit, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency./Takachar plans to use the prize money to convince more farmers to adopt the on-site torrefaction model. ""No farmer wants to burn crop waste in the open,"" Mohan says. ""They're wired to protect the Earth. It's in their music, their local gods. They're open to options.""/However, he adds, that technology alone can't solve the Earth's many crises. Even tech, for instance, costs energy. ""Any long-term solution to the climate crisis will have to focus on how all of us live. We must differentiate between needs and wants. And it's human wants, going unchecked, that will continue to be the challenge to overcome.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Diwali 2021: How asthma patients should take care of their health,"India, Oct. 31 -- It is that time of the year when people soak themselves completely in the spirit of festivities and may fail to exercise caution when it comes to tackling respiratory diseases like asthma, lung fibrosis, allergic rhinitis and bronchitis. It is also the time when Diwali pollution raises its ugly head and leads to many health troubles. However, precaution is always better than treating the flare-ups of these disorders./Steps must be taken to limit one's exposure to pollutants and it is best for people with respiratory conditions or asthma to stay indoors as far as possible./Wearing N95 masks in case of stepping outside could prevent toxic smoke from entering the nose. Apart from medication, nebulization could also be given to children suffering from respiratory troubles post consultation with their doctors./People suffering from asthma must also keep the inhaler handy and avoid involving themselves in Diwali cleaning or inhaling fresh paint smell./Dr Harish Chafle, Senior Consultant - Pulmonology and Critical Care at Global Hospitals suggests the following tips for asthma patients to deal with Diwali pollution:/""Air pollution in the ambient air inside home as well as outside home causes a wide array of health problems, including asthma, lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, etc. Increase in air pollution levels can result in a number of symptoms such as constant cough, breathing difficulty, eye burns, running nose, skin allergy and rashes,"" says Dr Chafle./Stay indoors/People with pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, and breathing problems must stay indoors and limit their exposure to smoke as far as possible. They should also take medications as directed by their respiratory physicians prior to prolonged exposure to fumes and smoke. ""It is advisable to seek immediate medical help in case of extreme breathlessness which doesn't come under control. One should not wait too much for the symptoms to progress to a serious form before seeking medical help. Always remember 'Prevention is better than Cure'./Wear N95 mask/If you are planning to burst crackers, always wear protective eye gear to help prevent entry of particles into the eye and irritation by fumes. Also wear N95 mask so that fumes don't enter nose and cause irritation which can precipitate an asthma attack very easily./Medicine and nebulization/Prepare in advance if your child is prone to any breathing ailments like asthma, which can get aggravated during this time, then check if the paediatrician recommends increasing the dosage of the medication. Consider nebulization, too, after consulting your paediatrician if in case required, says Dr Chafle./Wash eyes and hands frequently/""Pay attention to the hygiene by asking your child to wash the hands frequently with soap and water and gently wash eyes. Ask the child to blow the nose if he or she is feeling any sort of irritation./Avoid stepping out in evenings/Avoid going outdoors in high pollution times during this time. Evenings are generally a time when the air is highly polluted, so avoid taking your child outdoors. Instead, plan play dates for them indoors in safe environment./Avoid Diwali cleaning/In an attempt to get ready for this festive season almost everyone cleans their house before Diwali. All those having respiratory illness or allergies, however, must stay away from the house-cleaning process, as dust can trigger breathing problems and can very easily trigger an asthma attack. ""Also stay away from fresh painting smell as it is another thing done to help look our homes new in this festival which proves dangerous for asthmatics,"" says Dr Chafle./Eat balanced food/Go easy on food as overeating is very common during Diwali, which in itself is a harmful habit. However, binge eating and eating oily food can pose a greater threat to asthma patients. ""Avoid overeating and include a balance of fruits and vegetables to reduce the possibility of a sudden asthma attack,"" says the doctor./Keep the inhaler handy/Keep the inhaler always near you as apart from maintaining the regular dosage of asthma medicines, it can be useful in decreasing the chances of getting an asthma attack./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Smog can clog your lungs! Use these tips to beat the winter blues,"India, Nov. 1 -- Winter is synonymous with smog. Unfortunately not just that, but also pollution, respiratory disorders like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, cold, cough, lung fibrosis, and even cardiovascular problems. Smog and air pollution during winter can certainly give you a tough time, and impact your overall well-being./It will steal your peace of mind by further aggravating your health problems. When it comes to existing lung and heart patients, smog and pollution can be a matter of concern, as they can worsen their health. It is the need of the hour to stay hale and hearty during the winter season, and take care of your well-being./In this article, we give you a lowdown on the effects of smog and pollution, and share tips on how to keep your lungs healthy during the winter season. Read on to know more about this, and try to adhere to the vital tips. After all, it is a matter of your lungs, and you cannot take it lightly./WHY IS WINTER A NIGHTMARE FOR SOME PEOPLE?/As mentioned above, smog and air pollution during the winter season can lead to various health problems. For the unversed, smog can be described ashazy air that tends to hamper breathing and invites health issues, due to different pollutants containing fine particles and ground-level ozone. It is formed as a consequence of air pollution. So, when pollutants released in the air react with sunlight and heat, smog is seen in the air./THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SMOG/Did you know that smog tends to take a toll on the human body, right from head to toe. It can give a tough time, since it can cause infections, chest pain, stroke, asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia,bronchiolitis, eye, nose, and throat irritation, lung fibrosis,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), lung cancer, and emphysema./Ultimately, there will be lung damage and increased mortality and morbidity due to these ailments. Those with existing lung conditions, elderly, pregnant women, and senior citizens are at greater risk and need to take care of themselves./THE DANGERS OF AIR POLLUTION/This is a common problem that needs to be addressed on priority. Poor air quality can wreak havoc on an individual's overall well-being. It can cause lung, and heart problems, dizziness, headaches, nausea, damage to cells in the respiratory system, decreased lung function, and a shorter span of life./ASTHMA AGGRAVATES DURING WINTER/Those with existing lung problems like asthma that cause the inflammation of the airways may suffer during the winter season. Those with asthma tend to experience worsened symptoms during winter, or are more likely to have an asthma attack, because they spend more time indoors. They can get a cold or the flu, since the air outside is cold and dry./Even when staying indoors, the windows are closed so the dust mites, mold, pet dander, and other allergens can cause asthma to flare up, and one may get an asthma attack.

"City faces key pollution fight as fires rise, mercury drops","New Delhi, Nov. 2 -- : The cleanest October in years is likely to be followed by heavy air pollution days in November, weather experts have predicted, as the Capital faces its most crucial bad air challenge over the next two weeks with winter conditions setting in ahead of Diwali, and farm fire starting to surge in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana./The air quality index (AQI) on Monday was 281, in the same range as the 289 the day before. The city recorded its lowest temperature of the season at 13.6degC on Monday morning - cold conditions cause winds to die down, trapping pollutants - and the number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana crossed 3,000 on Sunday./The Capital breathes its most polluted air between November 1 and November 15, when the smoke from stubble fires and illegal firecrackers plunge the city into a health emergency, a Delhi government analysis of average PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels over the last five years showed./Though firecrackers are banned in the Capital, their illegal use during the festival (November 4 this year) leads to a peak in pollution levels, with people breathing poisonous air amid a thick blanket of smog./Experts also warned that, till now, Delhi has benefitted from south-easterly winds not typical for this time of the year but that could change around Diwali when toxic emissions form firecrackers is also expected to linger in the air./""Temperatures have dropped and this was the coldest morning of the season so far, but a change in wind direction has helped as emissions from stubble burning are not reaching Delhi completely. The minimum is expected to be around 15 degrees Celsius for the next couple of days and wind directions will primarily stay easterly and south-easterly,"" said a meteorological department official, asking not to be named./The change to north-westerly winds is likely around November 4./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a body under the ministry of earth sciences, the contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's overall PM 2.5 concentration was just 7% on Monday, down from 8% on Sunday and 12% on Saturday. According to Safar's estimates, there were 3,971 farm fires in and around NCR - in Punjab and Haryana, according to data accessed by HT, Nasa satellites recorded 3,140 farm fires./Fires in these areas particularly impact Delhi since they lie upwind when the direction of north-westerly./Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says more farm fires are expected in November now, as farmers will get a shorter window to clear their fields and plant the next crop. ""Rains which have continued till late October have disrupted the burning pattern too and it is possible we may record incredibly high farm fire counts in a short period,"" she said./Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 31.2degC on Monday - one degree above normal, while the minimum was of 13.6degC, two notches below normal. Ayanagar was the coldest location across Delhi, recording a minimum of 13 degrees./Another forecasting system - the Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi meanwhile predicted air quality is expected to deteriorate slightly in the next 48 hours, with a possibility of touching the 'very poor' category./""Air quality over Delhi is likely to remain in the 'poor' category on Monday and be between 'poor' and the lower end of the 'very poor' category on Tuesday and Wednesday. For the subsequent five days, air quality is expected to deteriorate by November 5 and 6 and may reach upper end of the 'very poor' category, with PM 2.5 to be the pre-dominant pollutant,"" it said./Grap, a set of emergency measures approved by the Supreme Court in 2016, kicks in from October 15 and continues to be in force till March 31 depending on the air quality of the region.

"November woes begin: Delhi AQI enters red zone, climbing","New Delhi, Nov. 3 -- Pollution levels in the Capital entered the red zone on Tuesday and weather experts warned it will only get worse, potentially deteriorating to the ""severe"" category from ""very poor"" if the ban on use of firecrackers is flouted./The air quality index (AQI) was 303, according to the 4pm bulletin, breaching the threshold from poor to very poor for the first time this season. Over the next couple of days, wind directions are likely to change in a way that they bring in smoke from farm fires that have recently been raging in parts of Punjab and Haryana./An analysis by a government forecasting body on Wednesday said these two factors alone are enough to keep pollution levels in the upper ""very poor"" range - the AQI is likely to be in the high 300s in that case - as long as people do not burst any firecrackers during Diwali on Thursday./But if people burn even half the amount of firecrackers they collectively did in 2019, the AQI will slip into the severe category, the forecast by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said./""We have identified three factors which could play a role around Diwali - stubble burning, which could touch a peak of around 4,000 fires and a share load of 40% on November 5, calm local winds over Delhi, and the third is how many firecrackers are burst. If no firecrackers are burst, Delhi's air will be very poor, but even if some firecrackers are added, the air could be pushed to the 'severe' range,"" said Gufran Beig, founder and project director at SAFAR./The analysis added that the ""AQI is predicted to enter into the severe category from the night of November 4 (Thursday) onwards and will remain severe until November 5. It is predicted to improve slightly in November but will fluctuate between higher end of very poor to the severe range""./Environment minister Gopal Rai said the Delhi government has given directions to increase vigilance across the city to check the sale, purchase and burning of firecrackers. Rai said till Tuesday, 12,957-kg of firecrackers had been seized by the Delhi Police and 32 people have been booked since October 27./""A special vigilance campaign would be run in the border area of Delhi so that illegally, there is no purchase, sale, movement, and storage of firecrackers anywhere. In this context, instructions have been issued to Delhi Police and SDM on behalf of DPCC today,"" said Rai./The last time Delhi's AQI slipped into the ""very poor"" zone was on June 9, when the AQI was 305 following the onset of strong, dust-carrying winds blowing into Delhi from the desert in Rajasthan./But winter pollution is a more stubborn problem due to a perfect storm of factors: the typical meteorological conditions characterised by low temperatures and calm winds prevent local pollutants from dust, smoke and tailpipe emissions to be dispersed and farm fires in Punjab and Haryana bring in ultra-fine particles that originated as smoke./The first half of November is particularly bad every year - in 2020, the month had nine days of severe category air pollution, of which six days were at a stretch between November 5 and 11./Sharing satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, said a thick layer of smoke and dust was seen in Delhi and parts of north India on Tuesday morning./Ashim Mitra from the satellite division of the India Meteorological Department also said that dense haze was captured via satellite images on Tuesday morning. He said that forecasts suggest that the air quality in Delhi, Punjab, and parts of Uttar Pradesh is likely to deteriorate further between November 5 and November 6./A SAFAR analysis of the day's pollution suggested Tuesday's deterioration was primarily due to local pollution sources and weather conditions in Delhi. The share of pollutants from farm fires was 6% but it would shoot up to 20-40% between November 4 and 6./Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune's Decision Support System, too, indicated that the share of stubble fire in Delhi's pollution is expected to peak to around 55% by November 6./But there may also be some silver lining. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), said that an increase in wind speed is forecast from November 5. ""While there might not be a major impact but it will still help the city from entering the severe AQI zone,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Diwali 2021: How to take care of cancer patients during Diwali,"India, Nov. 3 -- While Diwali is the festival of lights and spreading joy and cheer, the elevated levels of air and noise pollution could be troublesome for some people including cancer patients. Diwali time fills our hearts with a lot of happiness, but one must make sure to safeguard the health of cancer patients who are in our family or among friends./Our eating and resting routine goes for a toss in the hectic week of Diwali. It is however important for cancer patients to eat healthy and timely meals and take their medication on time to avoid any health trouble. Care must also be exercised when it comes to consuming unhealthy processed snacks and desserts./""Cancer patients should adhere to healthy eating habits as suggested by the experts. Indulging in sweets, desserts, and namkeens is a strict no no. Include all the essential nutrients in the diet. Say No to junk, oily, and processed foods. Drink a lot of water to stay energized throughout the day,"" says Padmshri Dr. Ramakant Deshpande, Oncosurgeon & Chairman of ACI Cumballa Hill Hospital./In the times of pandemic, special care must be taken by those suffering from cancer to keep infections at bay./""People suffering from cancer need to wear masks even at home, avoid crowded places, have proper ventilation at home, maintain a safe distance from people, avoid visitors at home and do not be around sick people, wash their hands from time to time,"" says Dr Deshpande. He also recommends a good night's sleep./Diwali evening witnesses increase in noise and air pollution levels and it is advised to keep the vulnerable group safe from it./""People with cancer need to wear earplugs if the sound of crackers is too high. Avoid going in the place where one is bursting firecrackers. Keep the windows and doors close while people are bursting firecrackers outside,"" says Dr Deshpande./One must take out time for the loved ones who are suffering from this deadly disease during festival time and keep them engaged with television programmes, movies or music so that they don't feel neglected./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Farm fires till Nov 2 half of those reported last year: CAQM,"India, Nov. 3 -- The incidents of farm fires in parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi reported between September 15 and November 2, just about halved this year compared to the same period last year, according to the data provided by the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM)./The data shows that 21,364 stubble burning instances were reported between the period this year compared to 43,918 fires -- a drop of 51.35%. Correspondingly, the contribution of farm fires to the overall pollution in Delhi has stayed up to 20% this year so far, even though experts have warned that it may see a spike soon./If the CAQM data is juxtaposed with the average air quality data provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), it can be seen that Delhi's AQI has stayed mostly in the moderate and satisfactory zone between September 15 and October 26. To be sure, this included three poor air days on 16, 17 and 20 October; and an unprecedented good air day on October 18. However, since October 27, the air quality stayed in poor or very poor zone./Farm fires are a major contributor of the particulate pollutants to Delhi's air during the winters when thousands of farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh set the stubble on fire after harvesting the paddy./""To curb and abate air pollution from stubble burning, the commission has prepared a detailed framework and pursuant to that, action plans have been finalised by the government of Punjab, NCR state governments and the government of Delhi,"" the CAQM said on Wednesday./The commission also pointed out that this season, the major hot spots of paddy residue burning in the state of Punjab were Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Firozpur, Patiala, Ludhiana and Kapurthala. In Haryana, maximum stubble fires were reported from Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Ambala and Jind./""This season, 8,575 fields where stubble burning was reported, have so far been inspected by the state enforcement agencies and officials of the respective states and environmental compensation (EC) of about Rs. 58,05,000 has been imposed on violators,"" the statement by CAQM said./It added, ""Concerted efforts are being taken by the state governments, departments and various other stakeholders towards better in-situ management of crop residue through the use of CRM (crop residue management) machinery, PUSA bio-decomposers and facilitating various options for ex-situ utilization of paddy straw, besides large number of IEC (information, education and communication) activities, educational campaigns, awareness camps and publicity through print, electronic and social media.""/The CAQM said that the air quality in Delhi was comparatively better this time compared to last year. ""The hazy layer is fog and not smog as is being mistaken. There is comparatively less smoke and pollution share in the air now,"" the statement said./Environment experts said that while the efforts of the commission and the government agencies were in the right direction, it was also important to note that this year because of a late monsoon withdrawal the stubble fires started late and the spike has only started from October-end./""Between September 1 and November 2, over 18,747 and 4,842 farm fires were spotted in Punjab and Haryana. Yesterday (Tuesday) alone, more than 2,500 farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana. As we are in peak stubble burning window, fires are likely to go up to 3000-4000 per day in the coming days. While the current share of stubble burning on Delhi's particulate levels is less than 10%, it is expected to reach 35-45% on November 5 on account of northwesterly winds,"" LS Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)./She added, ""Furthermore, since Diwali coincides with the peak stubble burning window this year, forecasts suggest that the additional load from firecrackers could further deteriorate the air quality in Delhi NCR. Taking cues from these forecasts, cities in the Indo-Gangetic Plain should execute pre-emptive measures controlling emissions from local sources in advance to avert severe air quality conditions.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Crackers or not, air quality in Delhi likely to continue downward slide: IMD","India, Nov. 3 -- Slow winds, a change in the wind direction, drop in temperatures and high humidity -- weather conditions conducive for slow dispersal of pollutants -- will ensure very poor air quality in Delhi on the occasion of Diwali on Thursday even if people do not burst firecrackers, weather scientists have said./According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), from Thursday, the wind direction will change to northwesterly which will bring more particulate pollutants from the farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. On Wednesday, the overall contribution of a total of 3,271 stubble fires to the pollution in Delhi was recorded at 8%. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth science, this contribution may go up to 40% on Thursday./RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said temperatures are currently staying near normal, and will remain in the same range for the next few days, but calm wind conditions are expected on both November 4 and 5. There will be high humidity too./Jenamani, however, predicted that things may improve Friday night onwards. ""Relief is likely only from the night of November 5 and the morning of November 6 onwards. Wind speeds will pick up and touch 30 km/hr and help disperse pollutants,"" Jenamani said./On Wednesday, ahead of Diwali, a meeting of the sub-committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) was also held during the day, with experts warning of air quality deteriorating to the higher end of the 'very poor' category between November 4 and 6. However, no fresh directions were issued./Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said forecasts by Safar, Urban emissions and Delhi's new air quality decision support system (developed by IITM) all suggest air quality will be in the higher end of the 'very poor' category on Diwali, even if crackers were not used./""If people burst firecrackers, we may see 'severe' air -- levels of air pollution which especially impact the health of children, elderly, and those with existing health problems. Delhi's forecasting systems have a clear message for all of us. If we want to protect the health of our family and neighbours, we must refrain from using firecrackers,"" said Ganguly./According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, air quality in Delhi last month remained uncharacteristically decent till October 26. However, from October 27, the air quality stayed in the poor zone till November 1. On November 2, the city recorded AQI in the very poor zone for the first time since the last 146 days. On November 3, the air stayed in the same zone, indicating it may worsen further./To be sure, the Delhi government has imposed a complete ban on sale, storage and use of firecrackers with teams being formed to ensure that people do not violate the rules on Diwali./On the eve of Diwali on Wednesday, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai urged the citizens to shun firecrackers, asked political parties not to link cracker bursting with religious traditions and appealed to the Centre to issue and advisory to the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to stop stubble burning./Polluted Diwali, a norm/CPCB data shows Delhi recorded its most polluted Diwali day in 2016, when the AQI touched 431 (severe) on October 31. In 2020, despite a complete ban on firecrackers, an AQI of 414 (severe) on Diwali day made it the second most polluted Diwali in the last six years. Last year, Diwali was celebrated on November 14./Around the festival, the impact of smoke from farm stubble burning is usually at its peak, the effect of which is amplified by the low temperatures and emissions from firecrackers./Over the last two years, weather has come to Delhi's rescue during Diwali. While pollution levels have spiked on Diwali night and the day after, strong winds and rain have helped disperse the cracker smoke./In 2020, despite recording the worst pollution spike on and post-Diwali because of an increase in cracker bursting, heavy rain and strong winds the day after, helped clear the pollution levels in the city. On November 14, Diwali day, the AQI hit 414. A day later, it increased further to 435. But by November 17, the AQI had improved to 171./""A western disturbance crossed the national capital on Diwali night last year, which led to an increase in the wind speeds. Though the impact was not seen immediately in the next day's data because it is a 24-hour average, the AQI in the next few days reached the moderate level,"" a senior Met official said./In 2019 too, high wind speeds helped disperse the cracker emissions quicker than it had in 2018, environment experts pointed out. That year, Diwali was celebrated on October 27./""The dispersion of pollutants was as fast as the build-up. This is because of the stronger winds compared to 2018 ,"" an analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) that year said./While there was a complete ban on firecrackers last year, only green crackers were allowed in 2018 and 2019 - with violations being reported in both years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution: All round failure,"India, Nov. 5 -- The Delhi government's complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers, including green crackers, on Diwali, went up in smoke on Thursday, with citizens refusing to abide by the government order. The situation was not significantly different in the other states of the National Capital Region (NCR), despite near similar bans on the sale and bursting of crackers. And this year, like in many preceding ones, the administrations of states such as Punjab and Haryana have been loath to crack down on stubble-burning by farmers, who continue to flout orders banning the practice, sending noxious fumes towards NCR./The impact of such irresponsible behaviour on the Delhi-NCR's air quality was immediate. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 24-hour average concentration of lung-damaging PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR shot up from 243 micrograms per cubic metre at 6 pm on Thursday to 410 micrograms per cubic metre at 9 am on Friday, around seven times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The PM10 levels crossed the 500 micrograms per cubic metre mark about 5 am on Friday. Delhi's neighbouring cities of Faridabad (454), Greater Noida (410), Ghaziabad (438), Gurgaon (473), and Noida (456) also recorded severe air quality on Friday morning. An Air Quality Index between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe. Air quality experts have been warning that emissions from firecrackers and farm fires, if unchecked, could exacerbate already unfavourable meteorological conditions - including slow winds and below-normal temperatures. This year, a delayed monsoon, farm fires have peaked around Diwali. And firecracker bans have proved ineffective./Delhi was the most polluted capital city in the world in 2020 for the third consecutive year, according to the World Air Quality Report, 2020. It is clear that despite people being fined (for farm fires) or booked (for smuggling firecrackers), the political class and administrative machinery (including the police) have no capacity or intention to implement such bans in letter and spirit. And farmers and those celebrating Diwali with fireworks have simply refused to listen to reason. The Central and state governments now need to rethink what went wrong, and come up with a unified strategy for containing air pollution, including the Diwali spike./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Should wear a mask as it will help in protection from both Covid-19 and pollution. It has a huge effect on respiratory health especially on people with lung diseases, asthma as their disease worsens,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI./The AIIMS director also talked about the World Health Organisation's (WHO) emergency use listing of Covaxin calling it a ""proud moment for our country"". ""We've got approval for a made in India vaccine. Earlier India was a vaccine manufacturing hub but in the last 18 months, we've shown that we can do a lot of high-quality research also,"" Guleria said./Delhi witnessed a record rise in air quality index (AQI), which rose to 462, on Friday evening, the highest since 2016. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) blamed opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for encouraging people to burst crackers despite a blanket ban being put in place by the government./Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai also accused Opposition parties of giving a ""religious colour"" to the issue of a cracker ban. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier urged people to not burst firecrackers till January 1./The BJP, however, hit back at AAP, alleging that Delhi's pollution levels were in the ""hazardous zone"" before Diwali and the current predicament is not due to bursting firecrackers./""Delhi's AQI was in a hazardous zone even before the crackers came out. Anyone suggesting otherwise is trying to make Arvind Kejriwal look good, who has unleashed a diabolical campaign to dissuade Delhiites from bursting crackers. Poor air quality is a result of anything BUT Diwali,"" BJP's national IT in-charge Amit Malviya wrote in a tweet on Friday./Air quality in the national capital was expected to drop rapidly as stubble burning in the neighbouring states coincided with Diwali. Around 9pm on Thursday the national capital's AQI dropped to 'severe' for the first time this year./An analysis done by Hindustan Times suggested that air quality will marginally improve from Sunday evening and fluctuate within the 'very poor' range.

Brace for bitter cold and high pollution this winter,"India, Nov. 6 -- India's northern plains are expected to get a colder winter than normal because of the La Nina effect, and experience a longer than usual spell of toxic air as stubble-burning may continue till early December, according to weather and pollution experts./Rise in air pollution levels is directly related to local weather conditions, such as wind speed and ground temperature, with farm fires contributing to the pollution load. Good wind speed coupled with higher ground temperature helps in quicker dispersal of pollutants from ambient air. Pollution levels in Delhi and other areas in northern plains reached ""severe"" levels on Diwali night, bringing the season's first smog./A Climate Trends analysis on Friday said that air pollution in the northern plains may linger for longer than normal even as La Nina, a complex weather pattern caused by variations in ocean temperatures in the equatorial band of the Pacific Ocean, is likely to cause intense winter conditions in the northern plains, especially the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) for a second year in a row./According to the India Meteorological Department, La Nina was reason for a surge in monsoon rains this year./""With second consecutive La Nina, north-west India is gearing up for intense chilly weather this season. Meteorologists have been forecasting record low temperatures across northern plans this year, with November and December expected to be colder than usual,"" the Climate Trends analysis said, adding that the temperatures are expected to drop to 3 degree Celsius in some northern areas in January and February./G P Sharma, President- Meteorology and Climate Change, Skymet Weather, said there was high probability of second back to back La Nina that can cause an intense cold wave from December 2021 to February 2022. ""With El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) getting colder than earlier estimates, the confidence in this forecast has grown off late,"" he said, but added that the winter weather is affected by several other factors./IMD director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra on Wednesday said that La Nina conditions are likely to prevail over Indian Ocean till March and expected a colder winter this time. He added that IMD would come up with a detailed winter forecast by November-end./Although data from the Indian Agriculture Research Institute shows that crop residue burning recorded in six states across India including Punjab and Haryana till November 4 was half of the same period in 2020, a delay in harvest season due to extended monsoon rains could prolong the farm fires to December, said Tanushree Ganguly of Council for Energy, Environment and Water./This could, in turn, contribute to high local pollution load. Farm fires this year started late because of delay in paddy harvest in six paddy cultivating states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, the climate trends said./In any case, the relationship between colder winters and high pollution level in the region is well known. The dip in temperature slows down the wind speed, causes inversion that leads to haze setting in, and the colder ground pulls pollutants towards it. Inversion is when cold air gets trapped under a layer of warm air and cannot rise, leading to pollutants getting trapped near the ground level./""In a nutshell, all else remaining constant, cooler conditions inhibit vertical mixing within the atmosphere. Therefore, possibilities are higher for poor air quality,"" said Dr V Vinoj, assistant professor, School of Earth Ocean and Climate Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar./Prof S N Tripathi, head of department (civil engineering) at IIT Kanpur and member of the steering committee of the National Clean Air Programme of the Environment Ministry added that intense winters would mean more haze which would lead to increased trapping of pollutants available over the surface./""All these conditions would result in a vicious smog circle, wherein we would not see clearance for some days,"" he said, adding that present forecasts raise the possibility of longer fog period this winter./.../Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Without any more firecracker emissions, AQI is likely to improve to 'very poor' category by tonight (Friday night) although stubble contribution is expected to remain almost the same as today,"" said the Safar forecast on Friday./It added relief from ""severe"" pollution is expected only from the evening of November 7, but the air quality might remain in the ""very poor"" range./According to CPCB, on Thursday, the AQI of Ghaziabad and Noida was recorded in the ""severe"" category with readings of 419 and 404, respectively. Greater Noida had ""very poor"" air with a recording of 322./Last year on Diwali (November 14), the AQI of Ghaziabad and Noida was recorded in the ""severe"" category, with readings of 456 and 425 respectively, while Greater Noida's air quality was in the ""very poor"" category with a recording of 394./Despite no licences, residents buy firecrackers/In both Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, authorities did not issue any licence for the sale of firecrackers. However, residents managed to buy crackers and burst them till late Thursday night in both districts./Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2 in Noida's Sector 78, said a number of people burst firecrackers on Thursday night./""The police and administration had informed people that firecrackers were not allowed. However, people managed to get firecrackers and burst them from 8pm till midnight. This led to a rise in pollution levels and poor visibility in Noida,"" said Sharma./He said on Friday morning, he drove to his office in Delhi amid such low visibility that he was hardly able to see anything even 50 metres ahead. ""I was not able to clearly see the Yamuna river while driving on the DND flyover,"" said Sharma./""Residents burst a lot of crackers despite the fact that no licence was issued this year or last year. There was no enforcement and the bursting of firecrackers went on until very late at night,"" said Alok Kumar, a resident of Arihant Harmony in Indirapuram./According to official statistics from the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, there were 3,032 fire counts reported from Punjab, 228 from Haryana, 123 from Uttar Pradesh, 19 from Rajasthan and 123 from Madhya Pradesh on November 4./Authorities in both districts admitted people burst firecrackers on the night of Diwali but emphasised that they did enforce rules./""We will recover environment compensation cost from erring persons, who are being identified with the help of video records. There was some bursting of crackers but residents in most localities celebrated the festival peacefully. The spike in pollution is also because of the high volume of traffic on roads during the festival,"" said Rakesh Kumar Singh, district magistrate of Ghaziabad./Love Kumar, joint commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the commissionerate had not issued licence to any vendor to sell firecrackers this year./""The police deployed enforcement teams and registered cases against five vendors for unauthorised sale of crackers. In some cases, police also stopped people from bursting firecrackers. It seems somehow people managed to get firecrackers and burst them on Diwali,"" he said./Health experts said with the spike in pollution levels, health ailments are expected and may include burning of eyes, watering and redness of eyes, nasal congestion, runny nose, frequent sneezing, headache, breathlessness, cough and chest heaviness among others./""The effect that air pollution has on lungs depends on the type and mix of pollutants in the air, the concentration of pollutants and how much of the pollutant gets into the lungs... the deteriorating AQI makes even non-smokers highly susceptible to the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other life-threatening lung diseases,"" said Dr Sharad Joshi, principal consultant (pulmonology), Max Hospital, Vaishali./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Ludhiana's air quality falls to 'poor' as stubble burning cases see spurt,"Ludhiana, Nov. 8 -- While pollution caused by bursting of crackers is yet to subside, the spurt in stubble burning cases is compounding the problem of air pollution in the city. A day after the city reported slight improvement in the air quality index (AQI), it went from 159 points on Saturday to 240 (poor category) on Sunday. As per the national agency tracking air quality, the particulate matter (PM) 2.5, which directly affects the lungs, remained the prominent pollutant./""Due to cold conditions, the earth's surface cools down rapidly and the air near the ground gets condensed. Because of cold conditions, smoke particles get locked, which is leading to hazy weather. Only western disturbance coupled with rain can bring respite,"" said Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head department of climate change and agricultural meteorology./Gagnish Khurana, a social activist, said that stubble burning during the evening causes more injuries not only to the people living in the city but also for the residents of the village where the farm fires are taking place./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution-check measures amped up in Delhi as AQI improves marginally,"India, Nov. 8 -- The authorities on Monday upgraded pollution control measures in Delhi on Monday and introduced differential rates for public transport to encourage off-peak travel mandated under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) as Capital's air was recorded in the very poor zone after remaining severe for three consecutive days./The steps that also include closure of brick kilns and optimising power generation by gas-based plants are mandated under the Grap when air quality turns severe (when AQI value is more than 400 or ambient PM2.5 concentration 250 microgram per cubic metre of air)./The sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM) met on Monday, and decided to upgrade the Grap measures from the current steps that were being enforced under the 'very poor' air category./Delhi's air quality plunged into the severe category on November 5, a day after Diwali, with an AQI of 462 -- the highest for a day after Diwali since the records of AQI are being maintained. Scientists blamed blatant violations of the ban on bursting of firecrackers and the increase in the number of farm fires for the sudden spike in air pollution. On Saturday, Delhi reported an AQI of 437 and that of 428 on Sunday, when the share of the stubble fires reached the season's highest at 48%./On Monday, the air improved a bit at AQI of 390 with wind speeds picking up and the share of stubble fires to Delhi's PM2.5 pollution dipping to 30%, according to CPCB and Safar data./VK Soni, part of the sub-committee on Grap, said wind direction is expected to remain northwesterly over the next five days with local wind speed ranging between 6-10 km/hr. But, the share of stubble burning will remain high during this period. ""Wind speeds will be between 6-10 km/hr over the next five days, but will become calm at night, causing air quality to decline. The air quality will fluctuate between the higher end of the 'very poor' category and the 'severe' category over these next five days,"" said Soni./Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB and chairperson of the sub-committee, said frequency of mechanized sweeping and road cleaning needed to be increased during this period. ""The directions issued include the need to identify roads with high dust generation. We have also asked the NCR states to disseminate information on air pollution so that citizens can take steps to reduce air pollution,"" he said./The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) did not comment on the latest directions to introduce differential rates./Forecasting agencies said while wind speed over Delhi remained around 10 km/hr on Monday, there was a drop in the speed of winds blowing from Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi, thereby reducing the contribution of farm fires to 30%. In contrast, the contribution of farm fires was 48% on Sunday, the highest so far this winter season./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a government forecasting body, around 4,189 fires were recorded in the northern plains on Sunday as compared to 5,430 fires on Monday. However, slow 'transport level' winds are playing a role in the reduction in AQI, the agency said./""Parameters have largely remained the same, but wind speed at the higher-elevation - which transports pollutants from Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi, is slow and has reduced the impact of stubble burning. If wind speed is slow, these pollutants are unable to complete the journey to Delhi and disperse during the journey,"" said Gufran Beig, founder and project director at Safar./In its daily forecast, Safar said that the air quality in the national capital may improve slightly in the next 24 hours, but will still remain in the 'very poor' category./R.K Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said visibility ranged from 1000 to 1800 metres at both Palam and Safdarjung, with wind speed remaining around 8-10 km/hr during the day. ""Like Sunday, visibility remained similar, but the minimum temperature was just 13.6 degrees Celsius. Local wind speed will remain in a similar range, with north-westerly winds continuing to prevail over the next 48 hours,"" he said./Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 13.6 degrees Celsius, and the maximum temperature was recorded at 29.2 degrees Celsius./Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB's air laboratory says the problem is not limited to Delhi, but the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain region, which needs to be treated as one large air-shed. ""Emissions can travel a long range and distance if wind speed and wind direction are ideal. Satellite data will show a thick haze over not just Delhi NCR, but it spreads across the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain region,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Respiratory illnesses on the rise due to post-Diwali toxic air,"Gurugram, Nov. 9 -- Due to the worsening of air quality since Diwali, cases of respiratory diseases in out-patient departments (OPDs) of hospitals across the city have gone up in the last few days. Doctors said that most complaints pertain to asthma attacks, breathing difficulties, bronchitis and burning sensation in the eyes, among other issues./""Post Diwali, the air quality index jumped to very dangerous levels, which is leading to spike in respiratory cases. The respiratory OPD footfall has increased by 40% with people presenting with increased cough, chest congestion, breathing difficulty, runny nose and fever. There is increase in asthma attack cases by 25% and lung infections by 20%. The emergency admissions due to the acute respiratory illness has spiked also by 30%,"" said Dr Manoj Goel, director of Pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute./He advised residents, especially those who have pre-existing lung diseases and those who have had severe Covid-19 infection, to avoid going outdoors./For three consecutive days following Diwali, Gurugram had a 'severe' air quality index, which implies that the air quality is hazardous and may cause respiratory effects even to healthy people and serious health impacts to people with lung or heart diseases. Over the past two days, there has been a marginal improvement in air quality, which is currently classified as 'very poor', also harmful for residents. Amid such high levels of pollution, those suffering from heart diseases, asthma, and other respiratory diseases are advised to avoid undue and prolonged exposure, under the Graded Response Action Plan to control air pollution./Paras Hospital in the city has witnessed about a 10% rise in new patients in emergency and OPDs with chest congestion symptoms, with some who have no history of respiratory illnesses, said Dr Arunesh Kumar, head of the department of pulmonology at the hospital./At Civil Hospital in Sector 10, doctors said that over 350 patients have visited the hospital with issues of acute respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute bronchitis, bronchial asthma and fever./""In the past three days, maximum cases in the medicine OPD are of patients with respiratory issues. This will continue for a few days as pollution levels had spiked a lot. The temperatures are also dropping, so that also impacts recovery from such infections,"" said Dr Manish Rathi, deputy medical superintendent of Civil Hospital./Doctors also said that many patients are those who have recovered from Covid-19 earlier this year./""We see a rise in such cases every year around this time, but this year, it is on a higher scale as many are Covid-19 recovered patients, whose lungs are already compromised. These patients were fine after recovery, but as they got exposed to high levels of pollution, they had worsening of shortness of breath and we had to give antibiotics and use nebulizers in emergency cases between 40 and 70 years of age,"" said Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director of internal medicine at Max Hospital./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi's high pollution levels pose health risk, experts suggest precautions","India, Nov. 10 -- The continued bad air run in the capital entails health hazards for its citizens, doctors and health experts said on Tuesday, suggesting a series of precautions such as not venturing out early in the morning, wearing a mask and avoid construction sites./Doctors with at least three city hospitals said they have been getting more patients with exacerbation of respiratory conditions such as asthma, respiratory infections, heart attacks and stroke./Delhi's air quality has stayed in the poor or worse zone since October 27. It stayed in the severe zone for three consecutive days since November 5, improved slightly to very poor on Monday, but worsened to return into the severe category on Tuesday./Experts say long term exposure to the toxic air can lead to several health problems to people of all age groups, including increase in blood pressure, under-development of lungs in infants, chronic lung conditions in adults, cancers, low immunity, and depression./Air pollution was the top risk factor for death in India in 2019, killing an estimated 1.67 million people, according to the Global Burden of Disease report./Over half the cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in India is attributable to ambient and household air pollution, according to a 2018 Lancet Global Health research paper. In developed countries, 80% of COPD is caused by smoking./""I don't think there is exact data for Delhi, but it appears reasonably certain that this level of exposure for this duration is associated with significant damage. There will be earlier onset of COPD, more asthma exacerbations, and more lung fibrosis. Ageing will be faster,"" said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology who has worked on asthma and lung health. He is himself an asthmatic./A study from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) shows that there is a nearly 20% increase in the number of patients seeking emergency care for acute respiratory symptoms even when the air quality is slightly bad with PM2.5 levels recorded between 50 and 100 micrograms. At its peak -- between October and January when Delhi records a PM2.5 levels of around 400 micrograms - this number goes up to 40%, according to the study./High-risk group/The highest risk from air pollution is to those whose lungs are already compromised, and people in jobs such as the traffic police, street vendors, and delivery personnel who have very high level of exposure. High levels of pollution have also been linked to pre-mature births and deaths due to pneumonia in children./Over 116,000 infants in India died within a month after birth in 2019 because of exposure to high levels of pollution, estimates the State of Global Air report. When it comes to the death of children below the age of five, pneumonia is the most common cause after malnutrition, killing an estimated 126, 535 children in India in 2017. Of this, 27% of the deaths were attributable to outdoor air pollution and 22% to indoor air pollution, according to the report titled Fighting for Breath - Call to Action./How to keep yourself safe/Not only might those with chronic conditions, even seemingly healthy people start experiencing symptoms when the pollution levels shoot up, experts say./""Even those without any history of chronic condition may experience symptoms such as dryness of throat, itching in the eyes, cough, feeling tired and disturbed sleep with such high levels of pollution. Those who already have lung disease may land up in the emergency department. Some of them in our experience, respond to only cortico-steroids,"" said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at AIIMS and chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care./""Everybody should take precautions. Healthy people should not go for walks or jogs early in the morning; the pollutants are at the breathable height at this time. Go for an exercise only when there is bright sunlight, when the temperature goes up, the pollutants also rise up. The masks that we use for Covid-19, has little or no value against Covid-19. If at all, people have to use an N95 mask,"" he said./Dr Khilnani added, ""Those who already have a history of respiratory conditions should avoid going out at all. They should also ensure that they take their medicine regularly to avoid emergency episodes. Those with severe asthma or COPD may consider the use of air purifiers; there is no conclusive evidence that they help but they do reduce the levels of PM2.5 etc.""/He said that people should consult their doctor if they get fever, start coughing up phlegm, get breathless, or experience moderate to severe chest pain./Pollution and Covid-19/Doctors said the high levels of pollution can be bad news for those who have recently recovered from Covid-19./""If we see the post-Covid-19 scenario, there is a large proportion of people who have post-pneumonic pulmonary fibrosis and long Covid-19. These people are more likely to get cough, breathlessness, chest discomfort, lung infection just like those with other chronic respiratory conditions when the pollution levels shoot up,"" said Dr Khilnani./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution can play havoc with your eyes. Here's how,"India, Nov. 10 -- As post Diwali air pollution continues to make news and raise concerns, it is important to safeguard ourselves from the side-effects of toxic pollutants that can cause respiratory disorders, lung cancer, brain or kidney damage and heart disease in long run./Higher levels of air pollution in general can lead to eye conditions like conjunctivitis, eye irritation or dry eye. Dry eye is a condition where your eyes don't produce enough tears to lubricate your eye./""Effect of air pollution or eyes manifestation of air pollution can range from minimal symptoms to chronic discomfort and eye irritation. Common symptoms include itching, irritation, chronic discomfort, dry eye syndrome,"" says Dr Sheetal Balla, consultant- Ophthalmology, Manipal Hospital, Old Airport Road./Symptoms are higher among contact lens wearers. Poor air quality can accelerate pre-existing dry eye disease, she says./Apart from the above-mentioned eye conditions, high levels of air pollution can also increase risk of age-related macular degeneration as the pollutants may enter bloodstream and damage the small blood vessels within the eye. Studies also suggest that pollution can increase our risk of developing an eye condition called glaucoma that can cause blindness./Can pollution lead to permanent loss of vision?/There have been instances when people have lost their eyes due to eye allergies, one of the conditions that occur due to air pollution./""Pollutants are very common causes for eye allergies and dry eyes. Disruption of protective atmospheric UV layer increases risk of retinal damage (ARMD) and visual loss. One of my young patients, an 18-year-old girl lost one eye permanently. She had developed eye allergies. She had shifted to Mumbai from her hometown. We had asked her to use steroid eye drops for 1 week and to follow up but she self-medicated and came after 6 months with glaucoma and permanent loss of vision in one eye,"" says Dr Sandeep Kataria, Consultant Opthalmologist, Wockhardt Hospital./Moving away from the polluted environment can improve eye health and benefit people with eye allergies./""I see patients' eyes getting better when they go to their home town during summer vacations. That's a real powerful proof. I also saw a marked decrease in eye allergies during the covid lockdowns,"" he adds./Protecting eyes from air pollution/Dr Kataria and Dr Balla suggest ways to protect your precious eyes from the harmful effects of pollution/* Simple home remedies like frequent cold eye compresses reduce symptoms of eye allergies./* Switching to electric vehicles and solar energy are long term solutions to avoid pollution in general./* People wearing contact lenses should be more careful since they are more prone to develop additional eye problems./* Wear good quality protective glasses to prevent pollutants from entering the eye/* Avoiding outdoors when pollution is at high peak like early morning/* Avoiding contact lens use when air quality is poor washing hands frequently, avoiding rubbing eyes using lubricating eyedrops as prescribed by the eye doctor./* Detailed eye check is recommended in case there is constant eye irritation./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

South Malwa chokes as farm fires rage in Punjab,"BATHINDA, Nov. 10 -- The seven districts in southern Malwa belt of Punjab have contributed over 40% cases of paddy stubble burning reported across the state this kharif season./The number of farm fires across Ferozepur, Moga, Bathinda, Faridkot, Muktsar, Mansa and Fazilka has climbed to 19,383, with as many as 15,537 recorded in November, according to figures available with the Punjab Pollution Control Board./Meanwhile, the state has recorded 47,409 incidents of stubble burning, of which 5,079 (10%) were reported on November 9 alone. The south Malwa belt accounted for 2,276 (45%) of them./These farm fires have been choking the region, with hazy conditions persisting throughout the day. At the continuous ambient air quality monitoring station (CAAQMS) in Bathinda, which is the lone centre to assess air pollution in the region, the air quality index (AQI) was rated ""poor"" (231) on Tuesday./According to the Punjab Agricultural University's observatory at the regional research centre in Bathinda, even bright sunshine hours have been reduced by 50% due to the haze./""An average bright day in winter lasts for 8-10 hours, but due to ongoing smog conditions, sunshine hours have dropped drastically in the last few days. Hazy conditions are expected to continue for a few more days,"" said Raj Kumar, an agrometeorology scientist at PAU./No means to monitor air pollution/Despite stubble burning being an annual affair, Punjab has no CAAQMS in 16 out of its 23 districts. Such centres to record air pollution have been set up at only eight places in six districts - three in Ludhiana (Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh and Ludhiana City) and one each in Bathinda, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Patiala and Rupnagar./Meanwhile, districts such as Ferozepur and Moga in south Malwa, which are reporting a high number of farm fires, have no means to know the extent of air pollution being caused by the unscientific disposal of crop residue./This season, Ferozepur has reported 4,505 farm fires, the highest in the belt, followed by 4,008 in Moga and 2,841 in Bathinda. Fazilka, where the maximum land is under cotton cultivation, has reported 855 cases of paddy stubble burning, lowest in the region./Officials attribute a sharp spike in fire incidents to the delayed paddy harvesting in south Punjab. ""Untimely rains last month forced farmers to suspend harvesting of paddy. Incidents of farm fires are likely to continue for another two weeks,"" said an official of the agriculture department./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

AQI 'severe' again as farm fires hit record,"New Delhi, Nov. 10 -- Delhi's air quality index (AQI) slipped back into the ""severe"" category on Tuesday after relenting to ""very poor"" a day before, coinciding with a spike in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana that has not been seen this late in the month of November since at least 2012./The AQI on Tuesday, according to the 4pm health bulletin, was 404, worse than the 390 on Monday. The number was above 400 for three consecutive days following Diwali, as emissions from fireworks and smoke from paddy stubble burning combined to create a toxic haze that has persisted since./At 5,382 and 4,859, instances of fire detected by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) mission were at their highest for November 8 and 9 since the satellite began recording this data in 2012./""We have been demanding a bonus of Rs.200 per quintal to enable farmers for disposal of crop residue. Most farmers in Punjab have landholdings of up to three acres and they are not in a position to invest in stubble management. They are left with no alternative than to burn residue,"" said senior vice president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), Jhanda Singh Jethuke, while adding that farmers were sensitive to the environmental impact but have been left with little choice./The average of fire instances recorded between the November 7-9 period was over 5,000 - highest since the 5,481 recorded in 2016, when the Capital faced its worst spell of toxic smog./A high number of farm fires in the second week of November is noteworthy since, by this time, farmers should have cleared their fields and begun sowing winter crops. Monsoon has been delayed this year, pushing back summer harvest, and reducing the window that farmers have to clear the fields for the next cycle./Another possible reason for the delay in harvest could be that the central government had postponed paddy procurement from October 1 to 11./The improvement in AQI seen on Monday was merely numerical, with conditions outside as hazy as they have been since the day of Diwali. Wind speeds picked up to 8-10 km/hr on Monday during the afternoon but began to drop by late evening and had become ""calm"" in the early hours of Tuesday./This pattern is likely to be repeated for the next 4-5 days, which will mean the air quality will range between ""very poor"" and ""severe"", a subcommittee of the Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR warned./According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), the share of farm fires in Delhi's air was 27%, down three percentage points from Monday's 30%./Safar's estimation of farm fires based on satellite data varies marginally to the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) data accessed by HT./Delhi recorded the season's lowest minimum temperature of 13.5degC on Tuesday, and IMD forecasts show the minimum could drop to 10 degrees by November 15 as cold northwesterly winds continue to blow. This means a pollution double whammy for the Capital -- not only does particulate matter settle near the ground when the temperature falls, northwesterly winds carry smoke from stubble fires towards the city from Punjab and Haryana while the more favourable easterly winds carry it away./Hourly PM 2.5 data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) shows peak pollution levels occurring between 3am and 5am at most stations in Delhi, crossing 500 micrograms per cubic metre in concentration - eight to nine times the national safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre./Dr Pratima Singh, who leads the Air Pollution Studies at the Center for Study of Science, Technology & Policy (CSTEP), said as the temperature starts to drop at night, the air becomes cold, and restricts movement of pollutants. ""The mixing layer comes down and traps pollutants closer to the surface and relief is only seen when the sun is out and temperatures increase, allowing this mixing layer to lift up,"" said Singh, stating a peak in pollution levels can occur around 6-7 am, with a second peak generally observed after 9am, when emissions from vehicles are usually at their highest./""There is more accumulation of pollutants taking place than there is dispersal and this is building up, particularly in the early morning hours and late at night,"" said Dipankar Saha, formed head of CPCB's air laboratory./The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), in their own analysis of the spike in pollution, said on November 8 the wind speed was 13 km/hr at 5pm as PM 2.5 concentration dropped to 154 micrograms per cubic metre. However, when wind speeds dropped by 5am the next day, Delhi's PM 2.5 concentration was at its peak of 352 micrograms per cubic meter./""Meteorological parameters like wind speed and direction significantly influence air quality. While faster surface winds as observed post-noon favour dispersion of pollution, lower wind speeds typically observed early in the morning prevent dispersion of pollution. This results in higher concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in the early morning hours and declining values as we approach noon,"" said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at CEEW./Dr JC Suri, senior pulmonologist and director, respiratory diseases at Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj, said pollution levels beyond ""satisfactory"" begin impacting high-risk groups such as children and those suffering from respiratory diseases; however, air between ""very poor"" and ""severe"" impacts all age-groups and puts even healthy people at risk. ""High-risk people should particularly not venture out in such air quality and if one needs to, wearing a mask is a must. One can check out air quality and head out when pollution levels are at their lowest, with morning and evening time generally considered the worst,"" he said./Suri also warns that, in the short term, exposure to such air can lead to irritation in the eyes and throat and if levels are particularly high, can even precipitate acute heart attacks. ""In the long run, one can develop cancer, diabetes and polluted air also impacts brain development,"" he warned./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

First time this season: Minimum temperature dips below 20 degrees Celsius in Mumbai,"Mumbai, Nov. 11 -- The onset of winter in the city became more pronounced on Thursday, with minimum nighttime temperature falling below the 20 degrees Celsius mark for the first time this season - settling at 19.8 degrees Celsius. This was down from 21.4 degrees Celsius a day earlier, and 23.4 degrees Celsius on Monday. A minimum temperature in the city have remained below normal for the past two days, and is likely to stay below normal through the weekend, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials have said./This is as per data from the IMD observatory in Santacruz, taken as representative of Mumbai. Colaba in south Mumbai, on the other hand, remained relatively warmer with a minimum temperature at 22.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday. As per IMD's seven-day forecast for the city, thunderstorms coupled with light showers could occur early next week./""There is a depression which is moving northwest and will emerge as a low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea. Due to changing wind patterns and availability of moisture, there will be increased convection with a chance of thunderstorms and this will bring down temperatures further,"" said a meteorologist with IMD's regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. These showers will be felt not only in Mumbai city and suburbs but also in parts of Thane, Kalyan, Panvel and the larger MMR region./Air quality in the city, meanwhile, has remained in the 'moderate' category of the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin - settling at 174 on Thursday. This was up from 164 the day prior, also in the 'moderate' category, which cautions against ""breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases""./PM2.5 (small respirable particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, or a hundred times thinner than a human hair) were observed to be the most prominent pollutant in the city, as per the CPCB./""If it rains next week there may be some relief from air pollution, but it will be short-lived. Temperatures will reduce due to the rains and this will again cause a spike in pollution,"" said IMD official cited above. The maximum daytime temperature on Thursday, meanwhile, settled at 34.5 degrees Celsius (one degree above normal) and is expected to remain thereabouts for the next week, forecasts suggest./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Checks on paper, city chokes on toxic haze","New Delhi, Nov. 12 -- Air pollution reached the season's worst levels on Friday as the toxic smog that has persisted for over a week thickened and emissions breached ""emergency"" level thresholds that would have normally led to a host of curbs like a ban on construction work, the entry of heavy vehicles, and odd-even car use limits./Instead, this year has seen a new record for farm fires this late in the year as the enforcement of a ban on the practice collapsed, and has exposed the futility of the mainstay pollution response mechanism known as the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) despite advance predictions that meteorological factors will exacerbate the problem./The air quality index (AQI) was 471, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, having risen by 100 points within 48 hours. The number surpassed the 462 recorded the day after Diwali, when a double whammy of firecracker smoke and farm fires pushed up pollution levels./Doctors urged people to stay indoors, and parents have begun keeping their children at home as the days remain particularly dangerous for those with respiratory conditions like asthma./Like each year for nearly a decade now, man-made factors have combined with pre-winter weather conditions to create the perfect storm of conditions that has led to the crisis. ""This spike in pollution levels is an amalgamation of many things. Delhi already saw peak pollution levels after firecracker bursting on Diwali and the high stubble count in Punjab and Haryana. Because of slow winds, the pollution load is not being eased, and every day more pollution is being added. All this is being recirculated in the air,"" said VK Soni, head of IMD's environment and research department./Data from heat-sensing satellites analysed by HT show that, this year, there have been 24,694 incidents of fire recorded since November 8. This number is the highest for the second week of November since 2012, the earliest year for which data was available./The later farm fires take place, the harder it is for the smoke to be dispersed in the atmosphere since this is the time of the year when weak pre-winter winds set in over the region./Officials in Punjab, where most of the farm fires take place, told HT earlier in the week they are not prosecuting farmers for violating a Supreme Court-ordered ban on burning crop residue./Authorities have also dragged their feet on factors they can control within the National Capital Region (NCR), largely as a consequence of how Grap is designed - the curbs designed for most impact do not kick in unless pollution has remained in the emergency level for 48 hours./The subcommittee of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a new body that now is responsible for the implementation of Grap, met on Friday and reiterated that the measures listed under the severe category will be implemented. They advised government and private offices to reduce the use of private vehicles by at least 30% by encouraging practices such as work-from-home and carpooling, and urged residents to limit outdoor activities./""We have also asked the state pollution control boards of Delhi and NCR to closely monitor the action being taken by enforcement teams and submit reviews to the CAQM and CPCB,"" said Prashant Gargava, chairperson of CAQM subcommittee for the implementation of Grap and member secretary, CPCB./The most strict curbs under Grap are a ban on the entry of trucks, shutting down of schools, halting all construction work, and allowing cars with odd and even number plates to be driven only on alternate days. But these come into force only if the PM10 levels and PM2.5 levels have remained above emergency levels for 48 hours./Till 10pm on Friday, PM2.5 levels were above the 300ug/m3 mark (the emergency threshold) for 22 hours and PM10 levels were above 500ug/m3 mark for 20 hours./Experts said the recurring crisis is evidence that the plan to fight air pollution simply does not work. ""Grap has been in place since 2017, but we have not seen any impact of from implementing the measures listed under it. So, if these measures have not worked, it means that it has not been effective and we need to look at alternatives. It's not just Grap, our governments need to revisit their overall approach to pollution management,"" said environment issues lawyer Rahul Choudhary./The Supreme Court is likely to discuss the issue on Saturday when it will continue hearing a public interest litigation filed by a 17-year-old Delhi student, Aditya Dubey, who has alleged that authorities have failed to protect his fundamental right to clean air and health by not controlling air pollution./A bench, comprising Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, will take up the latest affidavit filed by the Union government on steps taken to reduce air pollution due to various factors, including crop residue burning./As the crisis persists, doctors warn the air outside can leave immediate as well as lasting health impacts, particularly for people's lungs, heart and even brains./""When we say PM 2.5 or PM 10, it's just the particle size that we are talking -- the kind of damage depends on what creates the particle such as firecrackers, fuel combustion, stubble burning etc. The particulate matter from diesel or kerosene burning can even cause lung cancer... and the finer the pollutant, the deeper it penetrates,"" said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, AIIMS, Delhi./""What nobody talks much about and does the maximum damage is ultrafine particles of 0.1 micron or less. These penetrate the lung and reach the blood stream, and once in the blood, these can reach anywhere- the brain, the heart, kidneys etc. Even perfectly healthy people can experience short-term symptoms such as breathing issues, sore throat or red eyes,"" added Dr Khilnani,/For now, experts warned the problem is going to persist, which means the Grap's 48-hour requirement will be met./""As per IITM's Decision Support System for air quality management, a significant share of pollution comes from local transport-related emissions, in addition to farm fires. The Delhi government should focus on offsetting the additional load from farm fires by cutting down local emissions by imposing vehicle restrictions in the city, ensuring that open burning of waste is prevented at all cost and rigorous inspection of all construction sites in Delhi-NCR,"" said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)/(With inputs from Abhishek Jha)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

AQI rebounds to severe zone as pollutants linger in Delhi's air,"India, Nov. 12 -- Pollution levels rose sharply on Thursday as winds died down, pushing the air quality index (AQI) back into the severe category after a day of slight respite when it was still very poor./The AQI was at 411 when the Central Pollution Control Board released its 4pm pollution bulletin, and by 10pm, it had risen to 431 with average PM10 and PM2.5 pollutant levels nearing the emergency threshold./The emergency threshold is when PM10 concentrations cross 500ug/m3 and PM2.5 300ug/m3./Weather experts attributed the deterioration to a drop in wind speed, which was caused by unusual circulation patterns over the country: a depression over the Bay of Bengal stretching into southern India and over parts of the eastern coast has blocked winds that sweep in from the northwest, flow over the Indo-Gangetic plains./The north-westerly winds are what bring in the smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, and as they flow further over the Indo-Gangetic plans, they eventually disperse these pollutants away as well./""South-easterly winds (due to the depression) have reached central India, up to Madhya Pradesh, and are stopping the stubble smoke-carrying north-westerly winds from passing freely. Since the winds are getting trapped over Delhi and adjoining areas, pollution is also concentrated over this region leading to high AQI recordings,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet weather services./Such formations are unusual but they occur this time of the year every few years./Weather forecasters said such conditions could persist over the region for the next 24-48 hours./Thursday's was the sharpest fall in air quality since the day after Diwali, when the AQI shot up to 462 from 382 a day before./The AQI remained in the severe zone for two days after that, relenting only on November 8 briefly when winds picked up./Now, with wind speeds in single digits, local pollutants are being trapped and mixed with emissions from farm fires. The Union ministry of earth science' air quality early warning system said that the surface wind speed in the city on Thursday was only 4-8kmph, and this further dropped after sundown./The mixing depth-the height above the surface throughout which pollutants can be dispersed-in Delhi was 1,400 metres on Thursday. According to Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, the ventilation index-a measure of air pollution based on the speed of the wind and the height of the column of air in which smoke or other pollutants mix-was also as low as 6,000m2/s./Experts say a ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s, along with an average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants./""Slow winds during daytime and calm winds during evening/night are extremely unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the very poor category on Friday and further deteriorate from November 15, and may reach the severe category. The predominant pollutant is expected to be PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres),"" a senior official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a central air quality monitoring centre, on Thursday 3,914 fires were reported from Punjab and Haryana, which contributed to 26% in Delhi's PM 2.5 levels. This was only a notch down from the last two days when the share of stubble smoke in the air was 27%./""Fire pollution plume (carbon monoxide from the last two days of heavy stubble burning in northwest India is now spreading across the Indo-Gangetic Plains and parts of Madhya Pradesh...,"" said Sachin Ghude, scientist and project lead at the IITM./This year, farm fires are taking place later than usual due to a delayed withdrawal of the monsoon rains./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi schools prohibit some activities, attendance drops","India, Nov. 12 -- Attendance has begun falling amid growing concerns that the worsening air quality can impact the health of children, the administrators of several schools have said, barely a fortnight after children began in-person learning after a gap of over one-and-a-half years./Children are among the most vulnerable to air pollution, which is at its worst - the air quality index was at 471 at 3pm and the concentrations of poisonous PM2.5 particulate matter has been above the ""emergency"" threshold of 300 micrograms per cubic metre of air since 1am on Friday. PM2.5 pollutants, which are now over five times the safe limit, can penetrate deep into the lungs and lead to lasting health damage./Parents are now worried students will be more vulnerable to respiratory diseases. ""Parents in Delhi are facing two kinds of dilemma. First are existing concerns of Covid-19 infection and now it is the severe air quality. Many schools are still holding unit tests and parents are forced to send their children to school despite not wanting to. Many children have asthma, allergies, or even allergic bronchitis which worsens during the pollution season. Going to school in such a scenario is harmful to their health but there is little that parents can do,"" said Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents' Association./A Commission for Air Quality Management(CAQM) sub-committee, after a meeting on Friday, advised citizens to limit outdoor activities and exposure./The Delhi Disaster Management Authority, which issues guidelines pertaining to Covid-19, has encouraged schools to continue with online learning. Several schools said they are working on reducing the number of classes and in-person lessons till the pollution levels are in control./""We had resumed in-person classes only for classes 9 to 12 so far and classes 6 to 8 will start on Monday. Even in middle school, less than 50% of the parents agreed to send their children to school due to several factors including pollution. While deciding on reopening, we had kept various factors in mind including the pollution levels and the Covid-19 situation after Diwali,"" said Madhulika Sen, senior adviser at Tagore International School, where several parents approach school authorities thanking them for not reopening completely./The school is planning to reopen for nursery to class 5 in January and is holding staggered in-person only for the middle school and senior section./School administrators said they have limited some activities but closing schools may not be on the radar for now. ""We have reduced physical activities such as yoga and others in our playground. But when children have come back to school after nearly 20 months, it would not be prudent to close schools and send them back home. We are not planning on closing schools for now because addressing the learning gap is extremely important right now,"" said Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools' Conference which has over 120 top Delhi schools under it. Schools have reduced the duration for which students would have to stay on school premises, she added./Laksh Vir Sehgal, principal of Bal Bharati Public School, GRH Marg, said, ""The attendance in classes 4 and 5 is around 20-25%. The dip in air quality affects the health of children and in the previous years too, if the pollution levels increased, the attendance would decrease. This time around the attendance is low across all classes and the pollution levels are one of the reasons among it along with Covid-19 concerns. Since schools are working for a shorter period of time, there are no outdoor activities and we are ensuring that students say in the classrooms.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Low wind speed, dip in temperature push Gurugram pollution into 'severe' category","India, Nov. 12 -- A combination of low wind speed, dip in temperature and farm fires led to a steep rise in pollutants on Friday, with Gurugram recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 448 in the ""severe"" category. This is a deterioration from an AQI reading of 378 in the ""very poor"" category a day before, according to official data./In fact, all four air quality monitoring stations in Gurugram recorded ""severe"" air quality on Friday--the TERI Gram station recorded an AQI reading of 430, the Gwal Pahari station recorded 430, the Vikas Sadan station near mini-secretariat recorded 452, and the Sector 51 station recorded 447./An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe""./Gurugram's air quality plummetted into the ""very poor"" AQI on Diwali, which was celebrated on November 4, and the day after. For three consecutive days after, Gurugram had a ""severe"" AQI, which implies that the air quality is hazardous and may cause respiratory effects even to healthy people and serious health impacts to people with lung or heart diseases. Gurugram's air improved slightly to ""very poor"" on November 9, and has now deteriorated again into the ""severe"" category./The Haryana Pollution Control Board said the Commission of Air Quality Management met on Friday to discuss measures to combat the situation and is likely to announce certain measures on Saturday. Officials also said that all steps recommended to combat ""severe"" air pollution are already in effect and they are keeping a watch on the situation./The Haryana Pollution Control Board said that they have implemented Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures and all steps required to meet the ""severe"" AQI have been put in place. ""A meeting on the emerging situation was held on Friday and additional measures to curb pollution are likely to be announced soon,"" said S Narayanan, member-secretary, Haryana Pollution Control Board./Even as government officials mulled different strategies to manage the pollution situation, experts on Friday said that people in Delhi-NCR were facing an air emergency and the situation was likely to deteriorate further as pollutants were not going to dissipate soon./""The wind is very calm and the temperature has also dipped, while the number of farm fires has increased this year as compared to last two years. A few days ago, the situation had relatively improved because of a depression in the Bay of Bengal. The wind had caused a dissipation of pollutants. But for the next 15 to 20 days, no change in weather is likely, which will make things worse,"" said Dr Anurani Sharma, associate professor, Teri School of Advanced Studies./According to the experts, the low temperature and lack of wind create an inversion layer resulting in the non-dissipation of pollutants, which remain stagnant within the atmospheric boundary layer. ""This is what is happening in Delhi-NCR and there is likely to be no let-up in pollution. To improve the situation, the government should work on reducing local-level pollution,"" said Dr Sharma./According to the India Meteorological Department, the temperature is likely to dip further as snowy winds from northernmost states like Himachal Pradesh and Jammu Kashmir reach the plains. On Friday, the maximum temperature of Gurugram was 28 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.4 degrees Celsius./Air quality experts, meanwhile, said that immediate steps were required to curb vehicular, construction-related, and industrial pollution. ""A substantial amount of pollution in Delhi-NCR is caused by vehicles and it is time emergency measures were taken to reduce it. Construction sites must be inspected and all materials covered. Fuels which are not clean should not be allowed to be used by industries,"" said Anumita Roy Choudhary, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./She also called upon people to refrain from waste burning and ensure that they remain indoors and don't get exposed to pollutants. ""The government must take immediate measures in Delhi and other NCR districts,"" she said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
