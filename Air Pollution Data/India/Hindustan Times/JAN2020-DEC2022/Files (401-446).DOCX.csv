96% Indians breathe hazardous air: Study,"Mumbai/New Delhi, May 24 -- At least 200 million in India live in extreme poverty and are exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution, a recent study by World Bank experts estimates, also projecting the country to account for close to 47% of the 2.8 billion people exposed to hazardous quality air./The report offers the first estimates of how many people are exposed to bad air based on the World Health Organization's new thresholds released last year. The thresholds identify concentration of ultra-fine PM2.5 particles above 5microgram per cubic metre of air (ug/m3) as unsafe and 35ug/m3 as hazardous - exposure to hazardous air is linked with an over 24% increase in mortality rate./In absolute terms, 1.33 billion (96%) of India's estimated 1.39 billion people breathe hazardous air, the report said. Of these, ""over 202 million"" people were those that lived on a daily wage of less than $1.9 ( Rs.145) -- or in extreme poverty./Most of the world does not meet the 'safe' standard of the WHO, with 96.4% of the global population exposed to air with a PM2.5 concentration above 5ug/m3./But it is the hazardous level exposure, most of which is in people in middle income countries like India and China, that is more dangerous. And among these, the extreme poor are most at risk./""For them, the same air pollution level is likely to imply more severe health risks than for higher income households. Among low-income population groups, high proportions of physical and outdoor labour mean that they are faced with heightened exposure and intake of pollutants. Constraints in terms of the accessibility, availability and quality of health care provision further increase air pollution-related mortality among poor people,"" said the report, a policy research working paper -- separate from official reports of the World Bank./Experts in India concurred. ""This is the double burden for public health. The poorer population is more vulnerable due to lower level of nutrition and health. They have a range of underlying diseases that enhances their risk. They also have a higher exposure to toxic air pollution because they reside in areas where air pollution control is very weak. So, a combination of factors increases their exposure and makes them more vulnerable to health impacts,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./Therefore, Roy Chowdhury added, ""an environmental justice framework is being discussed for air pollution control to reduce the disproportionately high risk for the poor""./While the report did not go into indoor air pollution, a second expert flagged it as another significant risk. ""Not having access to cleaner fuels increases the exposure of poor people to hazardous air pollution. The Ujjwala scheme is there but we know that a majority of rural families are not able to afford refuelling cost and are continuing to depend on freely available solid biomass fuels,"" said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Planet politics in the era of climate crisis,"India, May 24 -- Ever since recorded history, human beings have taken the planet for granted. While droughts and fires might affect one region, it was assumed that life on earth was much the same year after year. That's no longer true in multiple ways, as the pandemic is showing us today and the climate crisis will show us again and again at much more regular intervals, in an irreversible way./March 2022 was the hottest March on record in India. Many parts of India will become uninhabitable if average global temperatures increase by 2 degrees Celsius, which is very likely if business continues as usual. The climate crisis is an existential threat of a kind we have never experienced as a species. We have had an extractive relationship with the earth and have not given back at all. We need to create a system which leaves space for the earth to regenerate on its own so that it can continue to nurture future generations. Inter-generational equity can only be ensured if nature is looked after in every aspect of natural resources--land, water, forests and the communities' relationship towards all of these./To take the example of water, the United Nations has estimated that more than five billion people will be affected by water scarcity by 2050. This is already evident in India which is heavily dependent on agriculture. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 2021, India is at the topmost hotspot of terrestrial water storage loss (TWS), having lost TWS at a rate of three to four cm each year, the highest loss recorded after Antarctica and Greenland. If this situation prevails, India will continue to face extreme water stress./To address these concerns, we need a new politics, a planetary politics that takes the flows of carbon into account in the formulation of policy at every level: District, state and country. The second thing is to make use of new technologies, both of the usual energy saving devices kind but also local innovations such as grassroot practices drawn from our own traditions which can meet the need for growth without affecting the environment and the resource base of communities./All of these interventions, however, need a baseline of measurement for whatever can't be measured or evaluated for efficiency and performance. Consider the issue of air pollution. While it's true that air pollution causes ill health and death, the causal relation is poorly established and even more poorly communicated. Our goal should be to make the dangers of air pollution clear to people in local languages; that it can kill them or increase their vulnerability to other health issues. Once that message is sent out, the people themselves will act on the issue. We saw that communication in the case of the pandemic. As a result, everyone, including people in the remotest villages were stringent in applying regulations because they believed that the disease was going to kill them otherwise. In the absence of that communication, causal relationships are hard to establish and communicate when we discuss environmental issues and the harmful effects are likely to manifest themselves after a few years by which time it's will be too late to rectify them. The absence of data platforms that help establish causation is hurting our capacity to be sustainable and to make visible progress on our climate commitments./Therefore, we need an accounting system of capturing and measuring carbon data for all human activities. We are all familiar with financial balance sheets with their sources and their applications. What if the same thing is done for carbon? Once we are able to do that, every company should be able to produce along with their financial balance sheet their carbon balance sheet also. When we file income tax returns, we should file carbon tax returns. Once we have such an accounting system, we can set targets, make predictions about future emissions reductions and track our progress against those goals. Once such a platform comes into play, we will have the opportunity to reimagine the entire economy, including new technologies and new forms of collective action./Carbon politics will not only help us meet our commitment to becoming net-zero by 2070, it will also help us create new livelihoods and new forms of organising our economy and society. Everyone understands Gross Domestic Product growth and more recently, alternative measures such as Gross National Happiness are also becoming popular. By making transparent the carbon footprint of human activities, we open up the possibilities of new forms of public discourse and an alignment between development and ecological sustainability./India's future tied to the planet's future and we have the opportunity to enact policies and create infrastructure that will make us a world leader in climate management. If we manage to do so while also fulfilling the aspirations of our young population we will have achieved an enviable outcome. We are at the threshold of a profoundly transformed society, in which the earth is no longer the passive background against which human dramas are played but an active agent in influencing the future of human civilisation./Can India take the lead in this transformation?/(The article has been authored by Amar Patnaik is a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha, from Odisha)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Asthma in kids: Know the symptoms and how the lung disease affects children,"India, May 29 -- Asthma can impact people of all age groups including children. If you child is coughing, wheezing, finding it difficult to breath, play outdoors, or sleep at night, you must immediately take your little one to their pediatrician. The recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD, 1990-2019) estimated the total burden of disease in India as 34.3 million, accounting for 13.09% of the global burden. It also attributed those 13.2 thousand deaths were due to asthma, three times higher compared to the global proportion of burden. (Also read: Asthma Awareness Month: What to do in case of an asthma attack; steps to follow)/Though asthma is the most common chronic disease among children, doctors usually can't make a diagnosis until children are older, by about age 4 or 5./""Young kids are more at risk for wheezing as their airways are very small. When they get a cold or other respiratory tract infection, these already small passages swell and fill with mucus much more easily than an older child's or an adult's. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and other symptoms that people with asthma do,"" says Dr Ankur Rajvanshi Consultant Neonatologist & Pediatrician, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Whitefield, Bengaluru./What is asthma and what are its symptoms/Asthma is a common chronic (long-term) lung disease in which the lungs' bronchial tubes, or airways, become inflamed. When the air passages in the lungs become narrow due to inflammation and tightening of the muscles around the small airways, it causes asthma symptoms: cough, wheeze, shortness of breath and chest tightness./Causes and triggers of asthma/The exact cause is unknown, although it tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic component. Exposure to allergens also triggers symptoms. The main triggers include pollen, air pollutants, smoke, foods, respiratory infections, and medications./How to manage asthma in kids/Monitoring and Assessment: Asthma symptoms frequently change over time. So regular visits with the healthcare provider who manages your child's asthma are necessary. It is important to schedule visits at least every three months, more often if things are not going well./Education: It is crucial for parents of children with asthma to understand the disease and how it is treated. This education may be provided by the pediatrician, a respiratory therapist or an asthma educator, but it is crucial that someone does it. Parents need to know and understand how to administer medications, which inhalers to use and when to use them and how to recognize worsening symptoms and visit ER as required./Controlling environmental and comorbid conditions: Properly addressing any comorbid conditions as well as removing potential triggers from the child's environment play a huge role in improving asthma. Worldwide, India has one of the highest concentrations of air pollution caused by biomass, fossil fuels, and vehicular exhausts and the use of mosquito coils, incense and dhoop sticks is an important cause of indoor pollution. By making a few changes sometimes a child can go from needing one or more medications to being medication-free./Medication: Most kids with asthma need to take medicines. Some are daily medicines (called long-term control medicines) to help keep airways from getting irritated. Others are used only during a flare-up to help open the airways (quick-relief medicines)./Most medicines call for the use of a nebulizer or inhaler to help get medicine into the lungs. The doctor will tell you which medicines your child needs and how to take them. Inhalers and orally administered medications aren't addictive. Make sure your child gets a yearly flu vaccine. If kids with asthma contact flu they're at risk for flare-ups and developing a more serious illness./""It's important to tell the doctor about any family history of allergies, asthma, eczema, and sinus problems. This information and careful monitoring of your child over time will help the doctor decide if the symptoms are due to asthma or another problem. The primary goal for children with asthma it to allow kids to be just like the other kids. Allow them to play soccer and keep up with their peers. They should be able to sleep at night without waking up coughing. And a simple cold should not land them in the hospital,"" says Dr Ankur Rajvanshi./Does asthma last forever?/""One of the most common questions parents have when a child is diagnosed with asthma is whether asthma medication will be a lifelong necessity. The simple answer is that we do not know. There is no way to know if your child will outgrow his symptoms. Do children that outgrow asthma still have the disease? No one is sure. They certainly are at risk to develop symptoms again in the future, but until then enjoy living asthma-free,"" concludes Dr Rajvanshi/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Recovering from the effects of air pollution: Expert shares insights,"Delhi, June 1 -- The air quality of the country keeps dropping by the day. The industrialisation and the change in people's lifestyle have created more booming pollution. Around 100 percent of the country, in the present era, breathes in air that falls short of the quality standards. Speaking to HT Lifestyle, Gagan Dhawan, Founder and CEO, The New Me - a series of books and kits that urges people to shift to a healthy lifestyle, said, ""Out of the world's 10 most polluted cities, 3 are from India. Air quality directly impacts our eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. In such a scenario, it is pivotal to take enough preventive measures to reverse the harm.""/Gagan Dhawan further noted down the prevention measures that can be taken in order to recover from the effects of the pollution. Take a look:/Air quality index: It is important to check the air quality index before stepping out of the house. In cities, the air quality index usual peaks during early morning and afternoon. For exercise, Gagan Dhawan recommended that we should choose lush green areas with more trees than main roads. In case of not being able to avoid polluted areas, a N95 respirator should be used at all times./Indoor pollution: We always think that pollution is outside and our homes are safe haven free from pollution. But sometimes, indoor pollution can be a health hazard. Purifiers and humidifiers can be installed at homes in order to keep it free from pollution. Active and passive smoking inside the home should be discouraged and avoided as much as possible./Diet shifts: Watching what we eat can help us in combating the effects of pollution. ""Detoxifying foods like ginger, citrus fruits and Tulsi can act as protective agents. Jaggery helps the body flush out toxins from the respiratory tract. A diet rich in vitamin D is anti-inflammatory that can help boost immunity levels and support the body's natural healing processes. In addition, vitamin D has protective properties against respiratory tract infections. Also, taking steam regularly can cleanse the entire respiratory path,"" said Gagan Dhawan./Exercise: Exercising regularly helps the body to fight chronic illnesses. Aerobic exercises helps the body to enhance the oxygen levels in the bloodstream, rejuvenate the organs and reverse the effects of pollution. Exercises such as running, swimming, stretching, cycling and jogging also helps in boosting the overall immunity of the body./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World Environment Day: 5 ways climate change is affecting your health,"Delhi, June 3 -- Climate change is real. And it is not just affecting our planet in unimaginable ways. At present, it is one of the single biggest threats facing humanity. Apart from soaring temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the number and intensity of extreme weather events, it also negatively impacts social and environmental determinants of health, including clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, health facilities and secure shelter./While climate change has a different impact on people's health depending on their age, gender, geography, and socioeconomic status, that doesn't mean it isn't severe. Moreover, vulnerable and disadvantaged sections in this group are women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced people, the older population, and those with underlying health conditions. According to a report by World Health Organisation, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 2,50,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. (Also Read: World Environment Day 2022: Lifestyle tips to contribute to sustainability in small swaps)/So, on this World Environment Day, we decided to list down a few ways climate change has an effect on your health. Scroll ahead to know more./Heat-Related Illness: Our bodies can efficiently adapt to the local climates. However, when the temperature shifts above or below those norms rapidly, it has a negative impact on our health. Studies show that extreme temperatures can lead to an increase in deaths and mild to severe illnesses. These include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, hyperthermia from extreme heat, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes-related conditions./Respiratory Illness: Increasing air pollution levels have become the cause and aggravating factor of many respiratory diseases, some of them being chronic. The main diseases of concern are asthma, rhinosinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory tract infections./Water-borne Diseases: Water scarcity or flooding because of harsh weather conditions is already a concerning issue in many parts of the world. Additionally, diseases caused by pathogen transmitted through water also creates a fundamental threat to human health and well-being. Some of these diseases include diarrhoea, neurological disorders, liver damage, fever and other flu-like symptoms./Mental And Psychological Health: Trauma from surviving extreme weather events, like floods, droughts, cyclones, heat waves and more, could lead to mental health issues like anxiety and depression. Many people who survive or lose loved ones in such extreme conditions can have lifelong Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)./Malnutrition: Severe weather conditions, like floods or heat waves, have a direct impact on crop production. Crop declines could lead to undernutrition, hunger, and higher food prices. Additionally, a World Food Programme report says that by 2050 climate change could increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by 20 per cent./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution reducing life expectancy in India by 5 years: Study,"India, June 14 -- Air pollution is the greatest threat to human health in India reducing life expectancy by five years with Delhi, the most polluted state, standing to gain it by 10 years on average if annual average pollution levels did not exceed five micrograms per cubic metres, according to Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC)'s Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) released on Tuesday. In contrast, child and maternal malnutrition reduces average life expectancy by about 1.8 years and smoking by 1.5 years, it said./Delhi was also the most polluted state with around 9.7 years of life expectancy lost on average as per AQLI's analysis last year based on the old revised World Health Organisation (WHO) target of 10 micrograms per cubic metre for reducing the burden of disease. As per this year's analysis, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana and Tripura are among the top five polluted states, which stand to gain the most in life expectancy if the pollution levels are met./Globally, India is the second most polluted country preceded by Bangladesh, where life expectancy reduced by 6.9 years in 2020 due to poor air and followed by Nepal (4.1 years), Pakistan (3.8 years) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (2.9 years)./The AQLI found that particulate air pollution takes 2.2 years off global average life expectancy, or a combined 17 billion life years. The impact on life expectancy is comparable to that of smoking, more than three times that of alcohol use and unsafe water, six times that of HIV/AIDS, and 89 times that of conflict and terrorism, the analysis said./""It would be a global emergency if Martians came to Earth and sprayed a substance that caused the average person on the planet to lose more than two years of life expectancy. This is similar to the situation that prevails in many parts of the world, except we are spraying the substance, not some invaders from outer space,"" said Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics Michael Greenstone, the AQLI's creator along with his colleagues at the EPIC. ""Fortunately, history teaches us that it does not need to be this way. In many places around the planet, like the United States, strong policies, supported by an equally strong willingness for change, have succeeded in reducing air pollution.""/All of India's 1.3 billion people live in areas, where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO limit.

Study shows alarmingly high pollution level in Dahanu eco-fragile area,"India, June 23 -- A study conducted in the Dahanu eco-sensitive zone (ESZ), in the Palghar district, has revealed that the region suffers from alarmingly high levels of air pollution. Air samples collected over a 24-hour period, from 12 locations in the area in January this year, showed PM2.5 levels between 117.9ug/m3 to 637.9ug/m3, a range that is between 2 to 10.6 times more than the 60ug/m3 threshold prescribed in the Centre's National Ambient Air Quality Standards./Such high levels of air pollution, the study suggests, are contributing to the woes of chikoo farmers in the region, whose crops are becoming increasingly vulnerable to a 'black fungus', causing the fruit to exfoliate from the tree before ripening./The total area of Dahanu is about 2,45,000 acres of land, of which 32% is used for agriculture and horticulture. Of this, 6% of the land is used for chikoo cultivation exclusively. Farmers are reportedly facing a 40-50% decline in their yields over the last decade due to the occurrence of fungal diseases./""The most affected were situated in the Northeast direction of the (Dahanu Thermal Power Plant). During monsoon, the North-Northeast farms experience the wind flow from Southwest to the Northeast i.e from the TPP side to the Chikoo cultivation fields. Coal fly ash and fugitive emissions from TPP are carried by the stronger winds and get stopped by the Kainad-Kosbad hill ranges. The trapped pollutants get settled on the trees present in this region. Once the Southwest monsoon kicks in, rain washes away the pollutants from the tree and flows down to the land area affecting the pH of the soil and making it more acidic. Thus, facilitating the incidence of Phytophthora fungal disease in the Chikoo trees. The infected Chikoo becomes black and exfoliates from the tree,"" notes the study./Prit Patil, a farmer and chikoo trader who grows crops on around 44 acres of land in close proximity to the TPP, said that this phenomenon, though first reported in the area more than a decade ago, has become exacerbated in the last three to four years./""In 2004-5, I was able to produce 300 kilos of chikoos in a year. Last year, my annual yield was only around 125 kgs. The combination of high temperatures and humidity is perfect for this phytopthora fungus, and we start worrying about it every rainy season. The pollution blocks the pores of the leaves and prevents the fruit from getting any nourishment,"" he said./The study was conducted by two Chennai-based organisations, the Coastal Resource Centre (CRC) and the Health Energy Initiative (HEI), at the behest of the Dahanu Taluka Environment Welfare Association (DTEWA), a civil society organisation based in Dahanu./Samples from all 12 locations also revealed a high concentration of silica dust, which is a component of coal ash and construction sand. The top three most polluted samples, in terms of PM2.5, were located 4-6kms upwind from the Dahanu Thermal Power Plant. Between 9 to 36% of the PM2.5 concentrations at these 12 sampling locations comprised coal ash./Though India does not have any prescribed standard for silica dust in ambient air, the 12 samples analysed contained this harmful substance in excess of the standards prescribed by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Air from four sampling locations also had high levels of heavy metals, namely manganese (a neurotoxin) and nickel (a carcinogen). An additional two locations also reflected high hazardous quantities of nickel alone./""Possible sources of air pollution can be attributed to the increasing density of industries around Dahanu, that includes the Adani-Dahanu Thermal Power Project, industrial clusters in the north and south, construction of roadways and rail corridors, and increasing concrete built-up area,"" the report notes./Commenting on these findings, public health expert Dr Adithya Pradyumna, said that these findings are an urgent cause for worry. ""At these high pollution levels of PM2.5, even healthy individuals would be affected, let alone vulnerable elderly and young children. PM2.5 is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease (such as coronary artery disease and stroke) and respiratory disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Local people in these areas have surely been exposed to this hazard at dangerous levels, as the measurements have been made at their residences and places/of work,"" he said./Dr Pradyumna also emphasized that silica dust can cause permanent lung damage through silicosis, often leading to premature deaths among exposed individuals. The combination of silica dust, PM2.5 and trace elements like nickel and manganese, are likely compromising the respiratory and cardiovascular health of the population in Dahanu, despite being declared a 'green zone' by the state government in 1988./Dahanu was further notified by the Centre as an 'Ecologically Sensitive Area' in 1991, and then as an 'Ecologically Fragile Area' in 1999, through amendments to the original notification. In 1996, the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority (DTEPA) was constituted as a quasi-legal, regulatory body to enforce the mandate of the notification./Despite these steps, the area is surrounded by polluting industries to the west (the Dahanu Thermal Power Station), the north (Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation campus in Vapi) and the south (Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation campus at Tarapur)./A string of linear intrusions including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train, Mumbai-Vadodara expressway, and the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor is also coming up in the area, and will further fragment the ecology, as per experts./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mahabaleshwar municipal council propose the use of EVs for sight-seeing,"India, June 23 -- Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani municipal councils have sent a proposal to the state tourism ministry to ban petrol and diesel vehicles for sight-seeing as it is causing air pollution. The proposal was sent on June 20./The tourist will have to use electric vehicles (EV) which will be made available by the administration at entry points of the hill stations./The proposal has been prepared jointly by the municipal council of Mahableshwar and Panchgani./One can take fuel-run vehicles to entry points where the administration will be constructing parking spaces./""The number of vehicles are increasing every day at both the hill stations. To control air pollution, electric vehicles are a good option. We want the state tourism ministry to approve this proposal. It has many benefits for the long term,"" said Pallavi Bhore Patil, chief officer, Mahableshwar municipal council./However, the proposal was not welcomed by local cab drivers. ""Majority of taxi drivers have petrol, diesel or CNG-run cars and electric vehicles are costly, so how will we survive? We also care about the environment and we maintain our car in such a way that it does not emit smoke,"" said Atul Shinde, a private cab owner from Mahabaleshwar./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

High pollution and extreme temperatures in Delhi can severely impact health in outdoor workers: IIT study finds,"India, June 25 -- Prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures and high pollution severely impacts people's health in the national capital, a study led by scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati has found./People who have to work outdoors for long periods in Delhi complained of health complications, including breathing difficulties or acute lung function impairment, irregular heartbeat and chest discomfort, back, shoulder, and joint pains, eye redness and irritation, skin rashes, headaches, and overall weakness, said the study - Health impact assessment of Delhi's outdoor workers exposed to air pollution and extreme weather events: an integrated epidemiology approach - released on Saturday./""Over the years, air pollution in Delhi has become a significant concern. The city's geographical location renders it particularly vulnerable to air pollution events such as smog, as well as harsh weather conditions in both summer and winter,"" said co-author Suresh Jain, professor at IIT Tirupati. ""Outdoor workers are among the hardest hit in such scenarios.""/Other authors of the study included Vaishnavi Barthwal, Ayushi Babuta and Chubamenla Jamir from TERI School of Advanced Studies, Dr Arun Kumar Sharma from the University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi University, and Dr Anant Mohan from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences./Researchers surveyed 283 people for the study, which included auto-rickshaw drivers, street vendors and sweepers, who have to spend the most part of their day outdoors and are constantly exposed to pollution, Jain said. The study also took into account the impact of factors such as age and smoking on lung impairment among the participants so that the actual impacts of high pollution and extreme weather conditions can be analysed better./As much as 47% of the auto-rickshaw drivers, 47% of street vendors and 48% of sweepers reported major health impacts of prolonged exposure to outdoor pollution levels, the study found. Auto-rickshaw drivers reported the highest incidence of vision related symptoms such as redness of the eye (44%) and eye irritation (36%), while most street vendors reported headaches (43%). This could be attributed to constant exposure to vehicular pollution, the researchers said./The lung function tests conducted during the study revealed that the majority of respondents (39% sweepers, 33% vehicle drivers and 27% street vendors) had limited lung function./Sweepers had a higher rate of lung impairment than the other occupational groups due to the nature of their work, which involved frequent exposure to dust and particulate matter, Jain explained. ""Dust inhalation during sweeping caused immediate lung function impairment and raised the risk of pulmonary disease progression. The risk increased as the period of exposure increased,"" he said./The findings of the study are important because Delhi is known to record high pollution levels, which worsens during the winter time when the air quality index in the national capital peaks several times higher than the healthy limit./Toxic air pollution in Delhi cuts people's lives short by roughly 10 years, making it India's biggest threat to human health, according to the latest Air Quality Life Index report released in June 2022. Child and maternal malnutrition, in comparison, reduces average life expectancy by 1.8 years, while smoking reduces life expectancy by 1.5 years./Health conditions of outdoor workers were also found to deteriorate because of extreme temperatures in both summer and winter, the IIT study found./The majority of these symptoms were common among vendors (75% reported headache and giddiness, 36% rapid heartbeat, and 20% experienced fainting spells), followed by sweepers (60% had headaches, 34% had palpitations and 15% experienced fainting spells), and auto-rickshaw drivers (54% experienced headaches, 27% reported rapid heartbeats and 5% complained of fainting spells)./""We concluded that while personal habits and influencing variables such as age, smoking, tobacco use, pre-existing health disorders, and a lack of usage of acceptable safety measures might raise these workers' sensitivity to occupational health risks, lack of proper mitigation measures and policies, long working hours, and varying work locations exacerbate their exposure to air pollution and harsh conditions,"" said Jain./Outdoor workers and people who were forced to spend long hours outside were at a greater risk of health problems owing to constant exposure to extreme weather conditions and high temperatures, other experts concurred./""Poor people are definitely more vulnerable to the impacts of high pollution and extreme temperatures. The more your body is exposed to the toxic pollutants and very high or low temperatures, the sooner it will start showing visible health problems,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, an advocacy group. ""That is why we keep stressing that government strategies should focus on the most vulnerable.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"In revamped Grap, ban on diesel car when air severe+","New Delhi, July 13 -- Diesel vehicles not conforming to BS-VI will be banned in the National Capital Region (NCR) if the Air Quality Index (AQI) rises above 450, construction work will be halted above an AQI of 400, and diesel generators cannot be run if the index breaches 300, according to a revised Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to combat air pollution./Released by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Wednesday, the new Grap will now take into account the index of air pollution, which reflects the concentration of several pollutants, and not just PM2.5 and PM10 as triggers for the curbs. More importantly, the imposition of restrictions under the three most serious levels will be pre-emptive instead of after pollution levels have spiked./Grap is a set of progressively stricter list of curbs on the type of vehicles, or the types of works or business that lead to air pollution when air pollution levels hit certain trigger points./The plan first came into force in 2017 but has been criticised for being ineffective, especially since it was considered reactive as stricter curbs were enforced 48 hours after pollution had already worsened./""Actions under stages II, III, and IV shall be invoked at least three days in advance of the AQI reaching the projected levels of that stage, based on the dynamic model and weather/meteorological forecast... on a day-to-day basis,"" the policy document said./Previously, as per policy, agencies waited until PM 2.5 or PM 10 concentration crossed particular threshold for two consecutive days./""The idea is to not wait and then take action, but to take action in advance and when Grap was formed, we did not have forecasting models. Now, these models will be used to forecast in advance and therefore these peak pollution events can be prevented in advance,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at CSE and part of the expert member./According to officials, the CAQM will receive reports from the Early Warning System for Delhi, a forecasting mechanism developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) along with the ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) in 2019, and its Decision Support System (DSS), which was launched in 2021./The DSS takes into account multiple readings and observations, including pollution data from across northern India, satellite data of aerosols and of farm fires. Forecasts can be made up to 10 days, with accuracy fairly high for up to a week./A CAQM official said the policy was formulated keeping states in consultation and the final policy has been shared with the chief secretaries and the state governments. ""There is no requirement of a notification of the policy and since the states were stakeholders in its formation, they can begin working on it. The policy will also be shared with the Supreme Court soon and if there are any changes that are required, fresh directions will be issued again.""/A subcommittee will meet frequently and issue necessary orders for invoking provisions of Grap based on the prevailing air quality and forecast, the document added./The revised policy involves short-term (within 1 year), mid-term (within 2-3 years) and long-term (3-5 years) action plans across NCR with immediate effect, the commission said./Under the new plan, stage I is when the AQI is in ""poor"" range (between 201 and 300), stage II when it is in ""very poor"" (between 301 and 400), stage III when it is ""severe"" (between 401 and 450), and stage IV when the AQI is in ""severe plus"" (above 450)./For stages II, III and IV, the curbs will be invoked three days in advance if there are predictions for AQI thresholds being breached./Among the other key change is the limit on diesel private cars. In stage IV, the use of these will be banned unless they conform to the Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) standard - the first time private cars will be banned on the basis of the fuel. Additionally, state authorities can also announce these curbs, as well as on BS-III petrol vehicles, in the third stage if they wish to, the policy says./To be sure, AQI hit the ""severe plus"" stage on only four days in 2021 - twice in November, once in December, and once in January./A second significant change is in allowing construction and demolition work to continue until AQI hits (or is predicted to) 401 or more. Last year, AQI was in this range for 20 days, but construction work was banned for 38 days in keeping with the earlier parameters./Another relaxation for the construction sector applies to what has been defined as linear projects, which are mostly public use work such as for highways, roads, flyovers etc, which will need to stop only in stage IV./The curbs on diesel generators will take effect in stage II - last year, the air quality was in this range for 64 days. The use of coal or wood-fired ovens in restaurants will also kick in from stage II./Every year, for close to a decade now, the Capital and much of north India is plunged into a public health crisis in the run-up to and during most of the winter. The crisis begins when these regions are shrouded in smoke from farm fires in states of Punjab and Haryana, where farmers set fire to miles and miles of paddy fields after harvest to clear them of residue./It is then precipitated by meteorological conditions marked by a lack of wind that would have otherwise blown local pollutants away, and festival fireworks during Diwali, creating the perfect storm of factors that lead to conditions that leave India's Capital with no option but to shut schools, halt construction work, limit businesses and advise children and the elderly to stay indoors./""The Commission has comprehensively revisited the contours of the Grap in vogue, towards an effective implementation mechanism and control on the adverse air quality scenario that generally persists in the entire NCR during the peak winter months,"" said CAQM in the new policy released on Wednesday./The policy was framed after the commission in December last year invited suggestions from the public and experts for a permanent solution to the air pollution problem. It then formed a nine-member expert group on January 7 to frame the policy focusing on five broad areas, including ensuring widespread access to affordable clean fuels and technology to the industry./SN Tripathi, Steering Committee member of the National Clean Air Programme of the Union environment ministry, said the new policy should help control peak pollution events while gradually acting on different pollutants across different sectors. ""AQI consists of gases too and we have seen gases leading to the formation of secondary particulate matter. If action is taken in advance, the peak will come down considerably and over time, Delhi-NCR can see an improvement in the pollution levels, both in the short-term as well as long-term.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

New Grap curbs likely to impact more than 950K diesel vehicles in Delhi-NCR,"India, July 15 -- Close to 950,000 diesel vehicles, including private cars, could be banned from the roads if air pollution levels are projected to cross the air quality index of 450, an analysis of government data shows, suggesting there could be a crisis for commuters if adequate arrangements are not made./Authorities on Wednesday unveiled a revision to the Graded Response Action Plan to fight air pollution, which includes a direction to authorities to stop all but a few diesel vehicles - whether cars, SUVs or trucks - from being used in Delhi and adjoining NCR cities if the AQI is projected to rise above 450, a scenario when the fourth and the final stage of restrictions will be activated./An analysis of vehicle data showed that there are 942,447 of these vehicles in Delhi alone.

Diesel vehicles typically emit significantly higher amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) compounds, which have a significant impact on human health. In BS-VI standards, diesel vehicles will need to emit less than a third of the volume of NOx they were allowed to under the BS-IV standard./Overall, however, only a tenth of all 10 million vehicles registered in Delhi comply with the new, less-polluting BS-VI standard./The Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM), which revised the Grap, has also allowed National Capital Region (NCR) states to ban the use of BS-III petrol and BS IV diesel cars in the third stage of curbs, which is meant to be activated if the AQI is projected to go beyond 400./As per government records, Delhi has 2,957,630 registered BS-III (BS3) vehicles.

"Delhi, Punjab govts working on joint proposal to pay farmers for not burning paddy stubble","India, July 19 -- The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) governments in Punjab and Delhi are proposing a scheme that would give Punjab's farmers Rs.2,500 per acre as an incentive for not burning crop residue during the upcoming kharif harvest season, people familiar with the matter said. The move is aimed at tackling paddy stubble fires - a major contributor to severe air pollution in the National Capital Region before the advent of winter./HT learns that the AAP government in Delhi has agreed to share a part of the cost for the scheme, which may also require a significant contribution from the Union government. Punjab chief secretary VK Janjua confirmed that the proposal is being fine-tuned. The scheme involves an expenditure of Rs.1,875 crore.The Punjab and Delhi governments may contribute Rs.375 crore each, and the two governments are hoping that the Centre will contribute the remaining Rs.1,125 crore, officials indicated./""The proposal will be shortly sent to the finance department and subsequently it will be forwarded to the Delhi government. We are also writing to the Centre to allocate funds for its share of promised incentives,"" said a senior officer in the agriculture department, asking not to be identified./The previous Congress government in the state had sought Rs.100 per quintal as incentive from the Centre to check stubble burning in 2019. Punjab's farm unions have also been demanding a direct cash incentive instead of subsidy for machines for in-situ management of paddy straw. The funds, however, did not come through./"" In case the Centre doesn't accept our demand for its share in cash hand-out scheme, the AAP governments in Chandigarh and Delhi will still go ahead with their plan and will give at least Rs.1,000 acre to farmers,"" says a senior bureaucrat in Chandigarh in the know of matter./A spokesperson for the Delhi government on Tuesday refused comment when asked about the scheme./During the kharif season, paddy is sown over 29-30 lakh hectares (70-72 lakh acres) in Punjab. According to the proposal, all farmers who desist from burning paddy residue will be covered under the incentive plan./The state produces roughly 185 lakh tonne of paddy crop residue every year. Of this, 49% is managed in-situ (mixing the residue in the soil) and ex-situ (used as fuel) methods and rest is set ablaze./After the paddy harvest, the window for rabi (wheat) sowing is very short. The farmers prefer to burn the stubble as it is the cheapest method to ready their farms for next sowing./In the past four seasons, at least 90,000 machines have been supplied to farmers in Punjab, with the Centre releasing Rs.269 crore, Rs.273 crore, Rs.272 crore and Rs.331 crore in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively./The Centre has allocated Rs.275 crore (against a demand of Rs.474 crore) to Punjab for in-situ management of stubble for the current kharif harvest season. All these grants, however, have failed to bring down the raging farm fires, with 2021 alone reporting a total of 71,246 incidents during the paddy harvest season./The Punjab government, according to officials, will ask the Centre to be a contributor in the proposed scheme of cash incentive instead of funding the existing scheme of subsidy for machinery for stubble management./""It's a good step if the government is serious to lend support to the farmers. I believe Punjab farmers are eager to do their bit for the environment and if they are offered an incentive, they will readily do so,"" said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Balbir Singh Rajewal. However, he was sceptical about the funds. ""From where will the government bring funds? An incentive of Rs.1,500 per acre to farmers for adopting sowing of direct-seeded rice (this doesn't require transplantation) is already pending,"" he said./The Punjab government has kept an outlay of Rs.200 crore in its budget this year to check the menace of stubble burning./In Delhi and its surrounding areas, pollution becomes the focal point of the discourse around public health every year as winter sets in as the area becomes one of the most polluted regions in the world owing to a series of factors such as stubble burning by neighbouring states, emissions from millions of vehicles, construction and road dust./Data collated by pollution monitoring bodies show that anywhere between 25%-40% of pollutants that form the toxic haze over Delhi between the months of September and November are caused by paddy stubble fires./In previous years, the AAP government in Delhi has blamed the public health emergency on inaction by neighbouring governments, particularly Punjab, often leading to Twitter battles between Kejriwal and former Punjab CM Amarinder Singh. But with the AAP in power in both states now, the pressure has built on the party to find a solution to the crisis./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

NGT forms panel after Kolkata residents allege air pollution due to cats,"India, July 20 -- The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has set up a three-member committee to find out if droppings, hair and dander of dozens of cats were causing air pollution in an apartment in Kolkata after allegations from the residents of the complex./A section of residents of an apartment in south east Kolkata, comprising around 80 flats in four blocks, moved NGT's eastern bench alleging that a flat owner has kept dozens of cats in her second floor flat and feeds a few more in the vicinity./""The owner feeds around 40-45 cats every day. While 20-25 cats stay in her flat, she feeds another 15 - 20 stray cats in the corridor. They litter everywhere and the smell of animals, their scat and urine make it very uncomfortable. This is causing air pollution as their hair and dander floats in the air which may trigger diseases,"" said a resident of the apartment, who didn't wish to be named./The residents said that they had earlier moved the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, which referred the case to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. But to date no actions have been taken, they alleged./NGT first heard the case in May this year and directed the respondents to file their affidavits within four weeks./""It is stated that due to the presence of these cats inside the flat as well as in this housing colony there is immense air pollution due to scat (animal droppings) and foul smell along with hair shed by the cats which is causing immense harm to the residents of the area,"" an NGT bench said, adding, ""In our opinion, the matter requires consideration.""/Last week, the NGT bench comprising Justice B Amit Sthalekar, judicial member and Saibal Dasgupta, expert member formed a three-member committee to look into the allegations./""We are also of the view that it would be appropriate to constitute a committee to inspect the site in question. We, therefore, constitute a committee comprising the following members - senior scientist of West Bengal Pollution Control Board, senior official from Kolkata Municipal Corporation and officer-in-charge of Gariahat Police Station,"" the bench ordered./The committee has been asked to inspect the spot and submit its report within four weeks. NGT is likely to hear the matter again on August 17./""There is no scientific evidence which claims that cats cause air pollution. If cat droppings are being blamed, then at the most the owner can be asked to maintain cleanliness. Infact cats are known to be rat killers which are disease carriers and it is beneficial to have them around in housing complexes. Under no circumstances should the idea of cats as air pollutants be entertained which will send a wrong message to citizens and proliferate misconceptions,"" said Tiasa Adhya, a small cat specialist./Even though the flat owner, who feeds the cats, could not be contacted till the time the report was filed, animal rights activists have rubbished the allegations./""It is ridiculous to say that the scat, hair and danders of a few dozen cats are triggering air pollution in a housing campus located in a polluted city like Kolkata which has dozens of other polluting agents. Our Constitution says that it is our fundamental duty to have compassion for animals. So no one can object to keeping a pet. However, the pet owner must ensure that the animals are vaccinated and sterilised. If a state government or the civic body doesn't operate any animal shelter or the shelters are all full, animal loving residents have no option but to keep rescued animals like cats and dogs at home. It is, however, advisable that cleanliness must be maintained to the extent possible,"" said Gauri Maulekhi, an animal rights advocate./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Climate and Us | Giving our big cats a sustainable home,"India, Aug. 2 -- The first batch of cheetahs is likely to arrive in India from Namibia and South Africa during India's ongoing 75th Independence month. Though the dates haven't been confirmed yet, it will be a historic moment for several reasons./One, after a 75-year gap, we will see cheetahs back in India. This will be the first intercontinental wild-to-wild transfer of cheetahs in the world, according to officials of the environment ministry./Cheetahs used to thrive across the central Indian landscape, but disappeared in the late1940s due to large-scale sport hunting and a loss of habitat. The cheetahs that are arriving are not Asiatic cheetahs, but African cheetahs. This means that India will be introducing a genetic sub-species and not re-introducing the Asiatic cheetahs that went extinct in India, experts have said. India has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Namibia on cheetah translocation, while the agreement with South Africa is in its final stages, and will be signed in a few days./The other reason why it is a significant moment is that the Kuno National Park, where these cheetahs will be naturalised, was initially identified for the Asiatic lion. In the 1990s, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) worked on finding an alternate home for the lions and identified the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary as the perfect habitat for them. Again in 2020, when the Centre announced Project Lion, there were talks of the translocation of lions from Gir in Gujarat to other sites, including Kuno Palpur in Madhya Pradesh. But now, the Centre has confirmed that they will focus on the natural dispersal of lions./Asiatic lions are vulnerable because they have an isolated population in Gujarat. In 2018, canine distemper disease killed at least 28 lions in Gir. There are over 600 lions in Gir, according to the state government./On July 25, while answering a question raised by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Kaka Patil on whether the government has been trying to translocate Asiatic lions into different parts of the country, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, minister of state for environment, informed the Lok Sabha that ""a Committee was constituted by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change to assess the suitability of habitat for lions in potential sites in Gujarat and make recommendations regarding the facilitation of natural dispersal of lions and the modalities for the establishment of the lion population in newly identified sites in the state of Gujarat.""/""The committee has recommended a participatory management approach for expanding lion population, greater involvement of communities and awareness and sensitisation programmes, especially in newly occupied territories. The ministry is providing financial assistance to the state of Gujarat for lion conservation activities including habitat improvement, water management, grassland development, and prey augmentation. These activities will also facilitate the natural dispersal of lions beyond the Gir landscape,"" he added. This means that it's unlikely that the lions will be translocated to other states./But why isn't the government keen on translocating lions?/""That's a political issue. It's completely hypothetical with no science to explain it. We can only say that natural dispersal is a good idea. If their numbers grow and they move to say Rajasthan, who will stop them? Nobody will stop lions from dispersing. I think some experts are making an issue out of nothing,"" said a senior official of the environment ministry during a discussion on the matter./African cheetahs are going to be also naturalised in an area of 748 sq km in Kuno. Other areas for their introduction have also been identified, such as the Nauradehi and Gandhisagar reserves./The key challenge for the Asiatic lions and the South African cheetah will be how to ensure that they sustain in islands or pockets of suitable habitat. What is the government's strategy to ensure a healthy, viable population and connected habitats for these species? Tiger numbers may be increasing, but molecular ecologist, Uma Ramakrishnan's crucial comment in The Hindu on what tiger numbers do not reveal about tiger conservation speaks volumes. ""Decades of research in ecology and evolution suggest that numbers are critical to avoid extinction. Populations that are smaller than 100 breeding individuals have a high probability of extinction. At the same time, for populations to persist, they should be part of larger landscapes with other such populations that are connected. Small and isolated populations face a high probability of extinction. This is because small populations are subject to chance/random events,"" she writes./The same is true for the Asiatic lion and the African cheetah. They need space and safe habitat to prevent extinction. The politics on which state the lion or the cheetah stands for will push them further towards disappearance or vulnerable, isolated populations. India also needs an assessment of how it will balance the massive pressure of diverting forests for infrastructure projects and providing a haven to wildlife. Or, the chances of survival of these unique, charismatic species will be at high risk./From the climate crisis to air pollution, from questions of the development-environment tradeoffs to India's voice in international negotiations on the environment, HT's Jayashree Nandi brings her deep domain knowledge in a weekly column/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Travel-friendly skincare ingredients that are a must for your next vacation,"Delhi, Aug. 2 -- Anyone who thinks travel doesn't kick your skin's butt is obviously God's favourite but if you're like us (God's second favourite), it can really take it out of you since any change in your environment like air quality, humidity or extreme sun exposure can make your skin dry/red and cause you to break out. Not to mention your skin, in general, is more dehydrated on a long flight but deep breaths friends, as we got a few beauty and skincare experts on board to put together a skincare routine with ingredients that leave the skin feeling like jello and can withstand stressful airports, jetlag, call sheets, crafts tables, sun and so on./It's difficult enough to determine what clothes to bring on the next vacation and then there's skincare. Everyone has heard how damaging a weird, new environment can be to the skin and this is why it is critical to have certain, travel-friendly skincare ingredients and products throughout the vacation since even the most travel-obsessed among us can keep up skincare while away./In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Romita Mazumdar, Founder and CEO of Foxtale, shared, ""The first rule is to stay hydrated at all times. If one wants to be that person whose skin looks radiant and feels beautiful during the holiday, the first rule to follow is to keep the skin hydrated internally as well as externally. This is especially crucial when traveling to a dry location. Carry more hydrating and emollient products that will ensure the hydration needed at the location. Gel-based products with a lightweight consistency may not be effective here, so look for products with ingredients that will give more moisture.""/She listed what to carry to stay hydrated:/1. Hyaluronic acid-based cleanser - Traveling can cause your skin to sweat more than usual. To remove all of the filth and grime, a thorough cleaning regimen is required. Choose a cleanser that will cleanse the skin without removing its natural moisture. A hyaluronic acid-based cleanser will prevent breakouts and keep the skin bouncy during the trip./2. Peptides based serum - Peptides occur naturally in the skin, therefore using a peptide-based serum will ensure that the skin receives all of the necessary proteins. Peptides also serve an important function in strengthening the skin barrier and keeping natural moisture, which is essential when traveling./3. Ceramides based moisturiser - There's nothing better than a moisturizer that mimics your skin. Ceramides are the building blocks of the skin, therefore they are best at strengthening the skin's barrier from harmful irritants and supporting it at hard times such as traveling. Not only this, but a ceramide moisturizer can be highly moisturizing and act as a great makeup base!/Romita Mazumdar added, ""The second rule is to protect the skin. When on vacation, it is very tempting to simply hop out of the hotel bed and go sightseeing. This is why it is critical to protect the skin from damaging UV rays. Nobody knows what environmental aggressors will attack the skin, so it is critical to be protected at all times to avoid dull skin woes.""/She revealed the following tips to carry to protect the skin:/1. Niacinamide based sunscreen - A sunscreen that nourishes, repairs, heals and protects the skin all at the same time; what else would one need after that? Applying and reapplying SPF every 2-3 hours is a must when on vacation. Even better, opt for a sunscreen with niacinamide as it makes the formula easy to blend, absorb and work with. Niacinamide-based sunscreen is also said to deliver a dewy glow without a white cast or greasiness./2. Antioxidant serum - In case someone didn't know, free radicals are fairly frequent when traveling. Air pollution, UV radiation, smoking, and other environmental irritants are all sources of free radicals. If the skin is not adequately protected, free radicals may infiltrate the skin and cause damage such as premature aging and dull, sagging skin. Antioxidant serums, such as vitamin C serum combined with vitamin E or ferulic acid, can not only defend against free radicals but also brighten the skin. Aside from this, a hydrating face mist and nourishing lip balm should be carried to increase hydration. Reapply as needed and remember to travel safely and happily!/Bringing her expertise to the same, Eman Batliwalla, Co-Founder of By The Gram (BTG), said, ""Of course, washing your face (especially during your summer adventures) is the first step to avoiding breakouts. So start with a gentle squalene cleanser that removes all the dirt and impurities from skin, leaving it super moisturised. It's so important and I can't stress this enough to use a cleanser that doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped off/ dry. Squalene, when applied topically, mimics your skin's natural oils so when used in the form of a face wash/cleanser it acts as an excellent moisture retention agent. It also is a natural antioxidant.""/Asserting that it works wonders on long flights for those who tend to have dry to normal skin, Eman Batliwalla advised, ""Usually, the squalene cleanser is all to use unless you are wearing makeup. If you are wearing makeup, go in for a double cleanse first with a cleansing balm containing sunflower, ginger root and papaya extract that moisturises and gently exfoliates the face without stripping, drying or leaving any residue and then with the squalene cleanser. Quickly follow this up with a vitamin C serum while the face is still damp.""/Gushing over the benefits of this ingredient, Eman Batliwalla explained, ""Vitamin C is the MVP of every skincare routine but this one ingredient gets that much more important when you're traveling. It's safe for most skin types. It's hydrating, it's brightening, it helps reduce redness, evens out your skin tone and the list quite literally goes on."" Next, she suggested, ""Go ahead and lock in all that moisture and goodness with a moisturising cream. It contains propylene glycol and urea which is a hydro-nourisher that restores the natural moisture balance. Make sure to use a non-greasy formula because no one needs to look oily on vacation. Top it all off with a hyaluronic acid sunscreen which, surprise surprise, is another hydrating and soothing step for skin to breeze through all of the travel adventures and gives that fresh vacation glow.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The link between women's health and clean energy,"India, Aug. 6 -- The link between clean energy use in homes and women's health is indisputable. The use of solid fuels for cooking in homes contributes significantly to air pollution, a major contributor to the disease burden in India. According to the government, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) has improved LPG coverage and as of January of this year, 90 million connections have been distributed across the country. But many households have still not shifted to this clean energy option for cooking./Rekha Devi, a homemaker from Bokaro in Jharkhand says, ""We are using chulha (woodfire stove) as the primary source of cooking as our monthly income is Rs.8,000 and we can't afford an LPG connection. I face severe eye irritation and coughing while cooking on a chulha, but have no other alternative.""/Surveys done by the Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) and Warrior Moms, a Mothers for Clean Air initiative, show that even in many homes with an LPG connection, women continued to use chulhas for various reasons. In Nagpur, 43% of women continued to use the chulha despite having an LPG connection. There are several other factors which prompt the use of chulhas, among them availability, affordability, accessibility and socio-cultural norms. ""We surveyed 1,500 households across urban slums in Nagpur, as the issue needs to be prioritised. The city's action plans to control air pollution should provide for adequate budgets to shift households from solid fuels to cleaner cooking alternatives,"" says Leena Buddhe, director, CFSD. The story is similar in most other towns./Much more needs to be done to shift attitudes in households and remove barriers in accessing and using clean fuels in households. First, the government has to identify vulnerable households from a lens of socioeconomic status and health indicators to provide subsidies for LPG. It also needs to, with the help of experts, look for alternatives that would both work for women and reduce the family's financial burden. Behavioural change campaigns can address the myth that certain foods taste better when cooked on a chulha and impress upon households the benefits of a transition to clean energy both in terms of cost and health, especially for women./""Burning solid fuels results in household air pollution that has an average contribution of 30-50% to ambient air quality in India and research has established that women and children are disproportionately impacted. The problem is more complex than we think and is rooted in patriarchal norms, social and economic status and accessibility to alternatives, "" says Neha Saigal, head of programme for the NGO Asar./Adopting clean cooking fuel could work wonders to reduce the gender gap, if time spent on fuel collection and cooking time is reduced. This would have a domino effect on the empowerment of women in terms of possible access to education and employment, as well as for more leisure time - a concept that is virtually overlooked in most Indian households - and improvements in health./The pandemic has exacerbated economic hardship and, therefore, the government must come up with a bouquet of options to get people to opt for clean fuel. While further subsidies may not be feasible, the government could look at micro-payment schemes for clean cooking fuel. The key lies in improving women's access and agency when it comes to clean fuel as a way of preserving their health and freeing them up for productive, paid work./<a href=""mailto:lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.com"">lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.com</a>/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi tops list of world's most polluted cities,"New Delhi, Aug. 17 -- Delhi and Kolkata are the two most polluted cities in the world in terms of average annual population-weighted PM 2.5 exposure, according to a new report, Air Pollution and Health in Cities, released by the Health Effects Institute's (HEI) State of Global Air Initiative./Mumbai was ranked 14th. No other Indian city features in the top 20. In terms of the highest disease burden from a PM 2.5-related ailment, though, Beijing, with 124 attributable deaths per 100,000 people was the worst. Delhi came in at 6th, with 106 deaths per 100,000 and Kolkata at 8th with 99. Five Chinese cities were in the top 20./A total of 7000 cities were covered by the study, although only 103, the most populous across six regions were considered for the ranking./In terms of NO2 exposure, Shanghai was the worst in terms of average exposure, and no Indian city was in the top 20./A large number of global cities across the world exceeded the World Health Organization's (WHO) norms for both PM 2.5 and NO2. The report found Delhi's average PM 2.5 exposure to be 110 micrograms per cubic metre in 2019, which is 22 times the WHO benchmark of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. Kolkata had an average exposure of 84 micrograms per cubic metre./Shanghai had average NO2 exposure of 41.6 micrograms per cubic metre, followed by Moscow in Russia (40.2 micrograms per cubic metre). The WHO standard for NO2 exposure is 10 micrograms per cubic metre. The report said in 2019, exposure to pollutants in 86% of the more than 7,000 cities included in the report exceeded WHO's standard, therefore impacting around 2.6 billion people./In terms of absolute numbers, the study attributed 29,900 deaths in Delhi in 2019 to be due to PM 2.5 exposure; 21,380 in Kolkata; and 16,020 in Mumbai. In comparison, Beijing saw 26,270 deaths in 2019 on account of PM 2.5 exposure./The report, which used data from 2010 to 2019, also found that global patterns for exposures to the two key air pollutants , NO2 and PM 2.5 were strikingly different. While exposures to fine particulate matter was found to be higher in cities located in low and middle-income countries, exposure to nitrogen dioxide, or NO2 was high across cities in high-income as well as middle-income countries. NO2 is primarily released in the form of emissions from vehicles and through power plants./""As cities around the world rapidly grow, the impacts of air pollution on residents' health are also expected to increase, underscoring the importance of early interventions to reduce exposures and protect public health,"" said Pallavi Pant, a Senior Scientist at HEI, involved in the study./The analysis also highlighted data gaps in low and middle-income nations. Referring to the WHO's Air Quality Database, it said only 117 nations currently have ground-level monitoring systems to track PM2.5, and only 74 nations are monitoring NO2 levels. ""Strategic investments in ground-level air quality monitoring systems and expanded use of satellites and other emerging technologies in targeted regions can provide critical first steps toward cleaner air,"" it said./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says that Delhi continues to rank as the most polluted city in terms of PM 2.5, and that while it is making gradual improvements, much more is required./""The study takes 2019 levels into consideration and we saw a drop in 2020 in all cities, but saw it increase once again in 2021. Another aspect is deaths linked to PM 2.5 and Delhi is actually ranked sixth in comparison to Beijing in first, which has actually seen a considerable drop in PM 2.5 concentration. This is largely down to Beijing's aging population and for them, the disease burden is high. We need to ensure for Delhi and other Indian cities, the disease burden does not increase similarly,""she added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

5 anti-smog guns to be installed in Ludhiana city,"Ludhiana, Sept. 3 -- At a time when the rising pollution is taking a toll on the health of the public in the industrial hub of the state, anti-smog guns will be installed in the city to bring down the pollution levels./In a first-of-its-kind initiative, five anti-smog guns have been purchased by the Municipal Corporation (MC) at a cost of Rs.85 lakh under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)./Civic body officials claim that the Ludhiana Municipal Corporation (MC) is the first to introduce anti-smog guns in the state and the project is expected to bring huge relief to the residents especially when stubble burning is witnessed in the state./The authorities have received the delivery of five machines which have now been kept at MC's workshop and trials will be conducted in the next week./An anti-smog gun is a device to combat air pollution which will spray atomised water to settle the dust and other suspended particles in the atmosphere. The MC officials stated that the guns can spray water up to a height of 100 meters to settle dust particles and PM 2.5./The officials stated that the guns can be transported to any part of the city using tractors and the machines will be operated with the help of a generator./One of the senior MC officials stated that the MC had tested the anti-smog guns in February last year, following which a proposal was made to install these in the city. Now five anti-smog guns have been purchased for the city and a trial will be held in the presence of senior officials next week./Ludhiana is one of the nine non-attainment cities in Punjab according to the NCAP norms, which means it has over a five-year period not consistently met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for harmful PM 10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter), PM 2.5 or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)./PM 2.5, a prominent pollutant in the air, is produced by burning, construction works and vehicles.

"Startup Mantra: Tapping hidden treasures from agro waste, crop residue","India, Sept. 3 -- While you get to read this story today, Govinda Hari Sonawane, an aspiring-entrepreneur from Nimbhora village of Raver tehsil in Jalgaon district of Maharashtra - about 1,100 kilometres from Delhi - is awaiting a call to get his startup shortlisted for incubation in IIT Delhi./Govinda has made a portable machine named ""BioChar"" that converts agricultural waste and crop residues into valuable products like bio-incense sticks, paper plates and ""vegan leather"". Interestingly, the machine does not require any kind of external source like electricity for its operation. Govinda's startup ""Agri Waste Pvt Ltd"" is helping farmers earn additional income from agri-waste; reduce air and soil pollution due to burning of this waste; and create employment and income opportunities in rural areas and for small-scale entrepreneurs./Hard lessons/Govinda comes from an economically-stressful background. He completed his schooling and college education in Jalgaon itself, while his father did furniture work to sustain the family. Govinda did his MSc Electronics from Kavayitri Bahinabai Chaudhari North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon, and later moved to Talegaon Dabhade in Pune for a job./Govinda said, ""I worked in the company till 2014-end and returned to my village. I was looking for options when the thought of starting my own business came to my mind. I had the experience of making CFL bulbs and decided to do something in a related field. I began with CFL bulb assembly and mobile charger circuit business. I took a loan of Rs.5 lakh under the PM Employment Guarantee Scheme in March 2015 for this business./""However, a few months later, I ran into losses. The bulb performance guarantee provisions were not sustainable and hence all profit and the capital invested was lost. It was a hard lesson learnt, but I did not lose hope. I realised that the non-functional bulbs will have either the tube or circuit in good condition and thought of repairing such faulty bulbs and resell it. I used to collect such non-working bulbs, repair it and resell it. I did this business for about two years till I repaid the loan amount in 2019.""/Pivot/While touring for the bulb business, Govinda spotted opportunities to diversify and start new business of incense sticks (agarbatti). Since many small and big players are already set in this market, Govinda was in search of having some product-differentiation./""I had presented an idea of making incense sticks from flowers and based on this I was hoping to get incubated under the Start-up India Scheme at the North Maharashtra University. My mentor Manveen Chaddha persuaded me to do more research on this business. A few startups were already doing some work in agri-waste processing and I went through the patents and IP rights,"" he said./""While watching videos of some machines on an online platform, I realised that either electricity or huge amount of wood or charcoal is required for the machines to produce incense sticks. I visited one such unit at Nagpur and they told me that the machine costs around Rs.10 lakh. So, I started researching about the machine and its design. Short of money and resources, I took a 200-litre capacity drum and made a prototype. It was designed in such a way that no electricity was needed to operate it and any kind of waste, including dry leaves of plants, would be turned into charcoal in a few hours. The machine was a success and I invited my mentor to check it,"" Govinda said./Resistance/Initially, Govinda's family opposed his business. However, his wife Manisha not only supported, but also decided to share responsibilities in his enterprise./Govinda said, ""While touring for the bulb business, I used to meet many shop owners in and around my village. Their acquaintance helped me get initial traction for the incense sticks business. But I was wary of suffering financial loss while doing business. It also happened that due to incomplete documentation, an award remuneration of Rs.85,000 from KCIIL Incubators (North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon) was delayed. Hence, I did not register the company nor did I seek funding from any external investor. In fact, no one from my family or village had ever heard of funding or venture capital and they could not believe that a person or institution can actually help monetarily to do business. Later, I received another award worth Rs.75,000 from MIT ADT University in Pune and also the first award amount. That's when my family started believing in my entrepreneurial spirit, and now, they completely support me.""/Prototype to final product/The prototype to final product journey has been a long one for Govinda. During the Covid lockdowns in 2020, Govinda's business flourished because other companies were unable to provide their products in villages. But in 2021, during the second wave of coronavirus infection, Govinda and his entire family was affected and hospitalised./""Business took a hit for about six months due to Covid. Whatever gains we made in 2020 were wiped out in 2021, but we did not lose hope. We started again with the same zeal and are still running. The company was incorporated in February 2022. The prototype was made with just Rs.9,000. With certain design changes, we were able to make the final product in March-2022 at a cost of just Rs.90,000,"" recalls Govinda./BioChar: How it works/Govinda's BioChar is a low-cost product designed for rural entrepreneurs and farmers to generate additional income and employment opportunities./For readers convenience, Govinda explained how the machine works. ""Typically corn cobs (bhutta) and cotton stalks (cotton crop waste) are either thrown away or burnt by farmers. Industries looking for biofuels are interested in larger farms (5 acre or more) and hence small farmers (less land holdings) are ignored by them. This is the raw material that is required to put into BioChar machine./If the raw material is put into the machine and ignited it will burn into ash. So, we need to control the oxygen levels and keep it at lower levels. We also need to keep the smoke in control. For that, we have put a filter and the carbon particles help achieve higher temperatures in the range of 800-900-degrees Celsius. Corn cobs usually take 90 minutes to turn into charcoal while dry leaves of plants or cotton stalks take less time. Cotton stalks are chopped to 4-5-inch size which helps to input more raw material at any given time. Once the charcoal is ready, the flame is reduced and charcoal blocks are removed from the lower side of the machine,"" Govinda said./Feedback/Govinda started making use of social media to create awareness about his BioChar machine and agri-waste recycling. Elated over the response, Govinda shared that he is receiving calls from across India about the machine and its applications./""One such caller gave me an idea to tweak the design to process paper plates as raw material. Another such variation we are working on is for processing turmeric. The machine flame can be used to heat water required for turmeric processing. This new design of our machine would cost up to Rs.2.5 lakh but it will help farmers get their dry turmeric product in just few hours instead of weeks,"" he said./Govinda said, ""I am often asked by investors if we are going to sell our machines (B2B model) or the products derived from it (B2C or D2C model). In our case, if the customer doesn't understand the charcoal production process, then the model would fail. Hence, we have not gone into it. Instead, we have focussed on the B2B2C model wherein we sell the incense sticks produced at our unit to small shop owners who in turn sell it to the end consumers. Since big shop owners demand credit, we are not targeting them now. We may even give franchises in future. We are receiving a lot of interest from various groups, including farmer self-help groups.""/No ecommerce/Ecommerce business lures everyone, but Govinda has a different take on it. ""Attractive packaging is very expensive and most small businesses fail due to these additional costs. Since there are variety of products, we can't make heavy investments in such activities. With local packaging and unfavourable return policies, small entrepreneurs end up with less margins on products sold through ecommerce websites. Besides, they have to also advertise on those platforms to improve their ranking. Considering all these factors, we have decided to stay away from ecommerce platforms at least in the near term.""/Future plans/Agri Waste Solutions plans to expand its operations and target urban population for its product consumption as well. Govinda said, ""We are a team of four members at present. We are continuously researching about the newer possibilities with our machine design. One such effort is towards building a product which can use the carbon particles to drive pumps used by farmers at their farms.""/Recognition/Cofounder Manisha Sonawane selected in top 6 of 800 women in Maharashtra for MSINs empowering programme of Startup Nexus America/Selected for NSRCEL women startup program at IIMB, a CSE initiative by Kotak Mahindra Bank/Received prestigious Late Pankaj Mahajan Krushi Sadhana Award 2022 by Krushi Vigyan Kendra, Pal at the hands of MLA Shirish Madhukarrao Chaudhari for introducing best practices in waste management technologies at grassroots level./Socio-economic impact/Generated employment for four self-help group women and planning to create more jobs by empowering women/Fight climate change by transforming massive amounts of waste biomass into marketable products around the world./Increase farmers income by creating a market for crop residues./Biochar improves water and fertiliser holding capacity in the soil, which provide essential nutrients to crop and promote plant growth.

Reasons your eyeballs feel like they are on fire,"Delhi, Sept. 4 -- Burning eyes are not a pleasant feeling as the sensation can often be accompanied by other symptoms including eye pain, itching, discharge or watery eyes. Burning eyes can have several possible causes, ranging from the simple to the complex and frequently, burning eyes are caused by unavoidable environmental influences, such as strong winds or high pollen counts but similar sensations can be symptoms of a more serious eye problem that requires medical attention./In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Parikshit Gogate, Associate Professor, Department of Ophthalmology at Dr DY Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, revealed, ""The eye has a natural moisturizing and cleansing mechanism. This gets disturbed when the eyes are used excessively, leading to a condition called as dry eye. It's usually common after people turn 40 or 50 years but is being increasingly seen in younger age group however, the good news is that most of the causes of burning eyes are mild and won't affect your eyes much but if the burning sensation doesn't go away, it could be a serious problem worth the doctor's attention.""/He listed the causes of dry eyes as:/1. Hot and dry weather - It may lead to eye allergies and dry eye syndrome/2. Dusty conditions - The wet layer of tears that coats your eye, your tear film, can become encrusted with tiny, solid particles from smoke, dust, and air pollution./3. Staring at screens for long time - Brightness or glare that reflects from our screens leads to eye strain/4. Air Pollution - Pollutants are a major contributor to dry eyes and eye allergies./5. Dry air in air crafts, places with de-humidifiers/6. Use of anti allergic agents, beta blockers commonly used for heart diseases, hypertension, other medication./7. Rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions./Dr Shazia Shafi, Senior Consultant at Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals, explained, ""Eye allergies, also called ""allergic conjunctivitis,"" occur when irritating substances get into the eye. Also, your eyes may burn due to many different reasons including the weather, allergens, and even diseases."" She shared that some of the most common causes of the eye allergies include:/1. Blepharitis - Blepharitis is an eye condition in which the eyelids get inflamed or infected as a result of irritants, bacteria, or even parasites. With this condition, your eyelids will be swollen with the eyes being dry and itchy and with a burning feeling. The base of the eyes will have some greasy discharge in the form of oily flakes./2. Dry eye - Dry eye disease is an eye condition that occurs when your tears aren't able to provide adequate lubrication for your eyes. It occurs also when your eyes do not make the right type of tears or tear film./3. Allergies - Eye allergies that can trigger eye burns include pollen, mites, smoke, and dust. Besides eye discomfort, you may also experience other allergy symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, cough, and a sore throat./4. Snow blindness - Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun may cause sunburn to your eyes. It may also lead to eye burns, redness, sensitivity to light, headaches, blurred vision, and temporary vision loss./5. Ocular rosacea - Ocular rosacea is a common condition that causes inflammation around the eyes, and eye burning, itching, and redness. A blocked eyelid gland or eyelash mites can lead to Ocular rosacea. This condition can occur in people with rosacea of the skin, and in those who do not./6. Conjunctivitis - Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin layer of clear tissue covering the white part of the eye. This disease is generally caused by a viral or bacterial infection./7. Eye fatigue - If your eyes burn after looking at a digital screen, you could be eye strain. Other symptoms which may include are double vision, watery eyes, dry eyes, and sensitivity to light./Even if none of these additional symptoms occur, you should contact your eye doctor if your eyes continue to burn for more than a few days. If you feel like your eyes are generating heat which leads to discomfort, frequent blinking, rubbing of eyes or blurred vision, do visit your nearby Ophthalmologist to get immediate help. When diagnosed and treated in time, your eyes will start feeling better and longtime damage can be prevented./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi, Punjab may jointly pay incentive for stubble","Chandigarh, Sept. 10 -- The governments of Punjab and Delhi are working on finalising a monetary incentive for farmers if they do not burn their paddy residue after harvesting, a top official said on Friday, after the Union government turned down their request to chip in with funds./As a result of the Centre's decision, the incentive, which was initially set at Rs.2,500 per acre, is likely to come down to Rs.1,000 per acre. The scheme will be crucial for attempts to discourage farmers from burning crop residue after harvest, an easy way for them to clear fields but a method that sends up clouds of smoke that trigger the world's worst air pollution crisis in much of North India./""We had sought a support of Rs.1,125 crore from the Union government in the total outlay of Rs.1,875 crore while Rs.375 crore each was to be contributed by Punjab and Delhi governments. Now, we have received a communication from the ministry of agriculture that our proposal has been rejected,"" said Punjab chief secretary VK Janjua./The chief secretary added that the states are still trying to work out the incentive, which could be now come down to Rs.1,000 per acre. The Punjab government has kept an allocation of Rs.200 crore in its budget this year to check stubble burning./HT reported in July that the two state government - both now controlled by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) -- had written to the Centre seeking for it to chip in with Rs.1,500 per acre as incentive to help end farm fires./The Union agriculture ministry did not immediately respond to requests for a comment on Friday./Officials in the Delhi government too did not share details on how they planned to incentivise farmers to not burn the residue./But officials, who asked not to be named, said they have already begun preparations to spray a bio-decomposer solution free of cost across Basmati and non-Basmati fields in Delhi. The solution, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in Pusa, decomposes paddy straw naturally within 15-30 days, thereby removing the need for it to be burnt./Delhi's environment and development minister Gopal Rai had on Thursday chaired a review meeting to assess preparation for the same, with the agriculture department had asked to get farmers in Delhi to fill a form at the earliest to identify fields that need to be sprayed./Stubble burning and finding a solution to it is one of the 15-key-focus areas identified by the Delhi government, based on which it will be preparing its winter action plan for air pollution./But the most pressing issue appears to be convincing farmers in Punjab to give up the practice./During the kharif season, paddy is sown over close to three million hectares in Punjab. The state produces roughly 18.5 million tonne of paddy crop residue every year. Of this, 49% is managed in-situ (mixing the residue in the soil) and ex-situ (used as fuel) methods, while the rest is set ablaze./Most farmers burn the residue because it is a quick and cheap way to clear the fields for the sowing of rabi season wheat crop, for which the window is often very short./The result is that Delhi and its surrounding areas report hazardous levels of air pollution./An official in Punjab's agriculture department, who was part of the meetings with central officials, said: ""The agriculture ministry has rejected our proposal citing that Rs.275 crore have already been sanctioned for supplying subsidised machines for in-situ management of paddy straw"". With the allocated funds, 32,100 more subsidised machines will be supplied to the farmers./In the past four seasons, at least 90,000 machines have been supplied to farmers in Punjab, with the Centre releasing Rs.269 crore, Rs.273 crore, Rs.272 crore and Rs.331 crore in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively./The previous Congress government in the state had sought Rs.100 per quintal as incentive from the Centre to check stubble burning in 2019./All these grants, however, have failed to bring down the raging farm fires./Janjua added that in the upcoming kharif harvest the focus would be on optimum use of machines for in-situ management of paddy stubble. ""We will make sure all machines are put to best use and arrangements are being made to tack these machines by a GPS system,"" he said./""I have no hope from any government. The Centre has backtracked and very soon, the Punjab and Delhi governments will also put a lid on the scheme,"" said Bharatiya Kisan Union president Balbir Singh Rajewal./(With inputs from HTC in Delhi)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Climate and Us | Two dire warnings that India can't sweep under the rug,"India, Sept. 12 -- Two research papers published last week should wake central, state and city level authorities up from their slumber./PM2.5: The elephant in the room/Air pollution is deadlier than we understand, and in particular PM2.5 particles (tiny, respirable pollution particles that can get lodged in the lungs) are threatening the lungs of millions of non-smoking children and adults in India./Research by the Francis Kirk Institute and the University College of London found that PM2.5 pollution causes the growth of cells in the lungs, which already carry cancer-causing mutations. This is the first time a research paper has revealed the pathway by which air pollution particles can cause cancer among some people./The research team examined data from over 400,000 people and also found higher rates of other types of cancers in areas with high levels of PM2.5. They speculate that air pollution could promote the growth of cells carrying cancer-causing mutations elsewhere in the body. The research was presented at the ESMO Congress in Paris, a conference of medical professionals in the oncology sector on September 10./""Although smoking remains the biggest risk factor for lung cancer, outdoor air pollution causes roughly 1 in 10 cases of lung cancer in the UK. An estimated 6,000 people who have never smoked die of lung cancer every year in the UK, some of which may be due to air pollution exposure. Globally, around 300,000 lung cancer deaths in 2019 were attributed to exposure to PM2.5,"" researchers wrote./While public health professionals and scientists in India have already acknowledged the role of PM2.5 particles in endocrine disruption causing insulin resistance and aggravating diabetes; complications associated with chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder; depression; compromised heart function and strokes, this research paper once again drives home the fact that air pollution needs to be addressed on a war-footing./The paper is significant for India because the country is presently implementing the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) - which was launched in 2019 by the Centre to curb air pollution in Indian cities. NCAP has an aim to reduce PM10 and PM2.5 pollution by 20 to 30% over 2017 levels by 2024. It is being implemented in 131 cities covering 124 non-attainment cities, which did not meet air quality standards for five consecutive years./Last week, the ministry said, of the 131 cities covered under NCAP, 95 cities are showing an improvement in air quality. And of the 95, Varanasi has recorded the highest improvement, with a 53% decline in PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) concentrations in 2021-22 compared to the baseline of 2017, officials said./In 2017, Varanasi's annual PM10 concentration was 244 micrograms per cubic metres. It declined to 114 micrograms per cubic metres in 2021-22. Delhi has improved too, as per assessments made by the Central Pollution Control Board recording a drop of 18.6% since 2017. In 2017, Delhi's PM10 annual average concentration was 241 micrograms per cubic metres in 2017, which declined to 196 micrograms per cubic metres in 2021-22, officials said./But the catch is that while reviewing the performance of NCAP, the ministry is considering only PM10 emissions and not PM2.5 emissions. To assess effectively whether NCAP is able to reduce the health risk from air pollution in Indian cities effectively, the criterion should be PM2.5./PM2.5 emissions are mainly generated from various combustion processes like industry, waste burning, stubble burning and transport. These activities will have to be controlled and shifted to cleaner fuels if PM2.5 emissions have to reduce. A cursory reading of some of the city based air pollution action plans shows that they are focused on dust control, paving of roads and solid waste management. These actions are important considering that road dust is very high and waste segregation hasn't taken off in most cities and towns. But overlooking PM2.5 would be ignoring the elephant in the room./Climate: Tipping over/Another research paper on climate tipping points is telling us what we know but try to shove into the background. A research paper led by Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University published in Science journal on September 9 provides an updated assessment of the most important climate tipping elements and their potential tipping points, including their temperature thresholds, time scales, and impacts. Their analysis indicates that even at global warming of 1deg C, a threshold that we already have passed, puts the planet at risk of triggering some tipping points. For example, the Greenland Ice Sheet; the Boreal Permafrost; the Barrents Sea Ice; the West Atlantic Ice Sheet; the low-latitude coral reefs are reaching the tipping points before the 2deg C global warming threshold is breached./""Our assessment provides strong scientific evidence for urgent action to mitigate climate change. We show that even the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2deg C and preferably 1.5deg C is not safe as 1.5deg C and above risks crossing multiple tipping points. Crossing these CTPs can generate positive feedbacks that increase the likelihood of crossing other CTPs. Currently the world is heading toward ~2 to 3deg C of global warming; at best, if all net-zero pledges and nationally determined contributions are implemented it could reach just below 2deg C. This would lower tipping point risks somewhat but would still be dangerous as it could trigger multiple climate tipping points,"" the team concluded./The fact that we are reaching a point of no return is obvious from the scale of floods in Pakistan, Indian states like Assam, Karnataka and Odisha this year. Earlier in the year, India and Pakistan experienced unprecedented heat stress that triggered forest fires; extreme heat also reduced India's wheat crop yields, causing the government to stop wheat exports; shortage of coal led to power outages./From the climate crisis to air pollution, from questions of the development-environment tradeoffs to India's voice in international negotiations on the environment, HT's Jayashree Nandi brings her deep domain knowledge in a weekly column/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Things you should know about household air pollution,"Delhi, Sept. 22 -- The air quality in India is deteriorating due to anthropogenic activities, massive industrial expansion, population density and increased automobile use. There is evidence that air pollution both outdoor and indoor are on the rise in India and is the cause of higher rates of morbidity and mortality hence, effective interventions are required right now, from awareness to stringent standards to altering fuel usage patterns./According to the World Health Organization, nearly 4 million people die prematurely each year as a result of illnesses caused by household air pollution, especially from the inefficient combustion of solid fuels, which badly impacts health equity and climate change. In addition to the significant health impacts, carbonaceous aerosols released from solid fuel combustion contribute significantly to global climate impacts by exerting a direct as well as indirect radiative effect./In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Kartik Singhal, Founder of O2 Cure and Managing Director at Zeco Aircon Limited, highlighted that under IAQ, we need to look at factors that combine to provide healthy air:/1. Fresh air is of utmost importance as it treats pollutants like CO2 and replaces stale air by increasing air changes. It can be done by installing fresh air filtration systems in households./2. Increasing humidity levels during dry winters helps reduce PM levels as they get heavy and settle down on surfaces./3. Effective passive air purifiers with H13 HEPA filters help reduce PM10, 2.5 and 1, every particle smaller than 0.3 microns./4. Adding an active air purifier with PHI, BPI technology reduces cross-infection bacteria, TVOC, formaldehyde, NO2, SO2, etc and chances of infection./5. Further monitoring of IAQ levels through applications and smartphones is also critical./Talking about the things you should know about household air pollution, Gaurav Kedia, Chairman of Indian Biogas Association warned, ""The ill effects on human health from indoor air pollution include strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, and other deadly ailments. Unclean fuels, which are used in household activities, affect the brain, causing developmental delays, behavioral problems, and lower IQ in children, which is the established reason for poverty and inequality.""/He suggested, ""Household air pollution can be reduced by avoiding the use of unprocessed coal and kerosene and by adopting cleaner fuels like biogas, LPG, and PNG.

How indoor air quality affects your thyroid health; know from expert,"Delhi, Sept. 23 -- We are regularly exposed to unhealthy air. This daily exposure to outdoor pollution, heavy metals, wildfires, indoor air pollution, synthetic fragrances and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can significantly impact our health, especially over time. Infections, lung cancer, and chronic lung disorders like asthma or thyroid issues can all be caused by or made worse by poor indoor air quality. Indoor air quality (IAQ) and wellbeing are closely related. Humans frequently spend their time indoors. A higher quality of life, a decreased chance of respiratory infections, and a lower risk of developing a number of chronic ailments can all be attributed to the availability of clean, healthy air to breathe.

"Air pollution is a pandemic now, says Jonathan Demenge","India, Sept. 23 -- LUCKNOW Each one of us is already paying the price for air pollution as our lungs bear the brunt of the air we breathe, feels Jonathan Demenge, head of international cooperation at the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) in New Delhi./He completed his PhD in development studies from the Institute of Development Studies, United Kingdom. Demenge's major publications focus on human-environment relationships in Ladakh region of north India. In Lucknow, he shared his views on 'clean air' in Uttar Pradesh. Excerpts:/Where do we stand when we talk about air pollution?/Air pollution is a pandemic now. I can say the quantity of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 (fine inhalable particles) in the air has multiplied two times over the past 20 years. About 8.1 trillion dollars are spent on illness due to air pollution, which is 6% of the GDP. About 0.5 million premature deaths among infants happen around the world due to air pollution related illness, and in this, India's share is one-fourth. Out of 20 most polluted cities, 14 were identified in India./Where do we need to reach in terms of good air quality?/In a situation where 8 million die a premature death across the globe and 1.7 million in India due to air pollution related illnesses, we need to take air pollution to a level where the air can be said safe for the people to breathe. Pollution levels more than WHO prescribed limits is a reason for cardio-vascular diseases, premature deaths and lung problems. There are Indian standards too, and we need to reach those levels by reducing air pollution./What steps, you feel, are required?/There are three major steps. First, is research and measurement of air pollution along with methodology to find sources of pollution, which may be different region wise or even city wise. Once the source is identified then each city has to come up with their own/indigenous 'clean air plan.' The third and the most significant will be awareness where masses are made aware and involved in such a manner that they themselves demand clean air and contribute to the same./Why each city needs separate plan?/In Lucknow, road dust is the biggest contributor to air pollution, followed by industry. Likewise, each city will have different pollution contributors. As I said, each city needs to have a separate 'clean air plan' of action that needs to be endorsed with technical/scientific ground work./Industry is a major contributor to pollution?/Industry and public transport are an integral part of the clean air campaign. But changes to bring in clean air should not just be forced upon the industry. It needs our support too. Being a job creator, the industry should be given due regard and technical support. Similarly, public transport needs to be made better so that people actually leave their vehicles and use public conveyance. But this is possible only if air pollution is in safe zone and people are sure of not breathing in pollutants while commuting on a bus./Have we achieved something in the past years?/Yes. It is important to reverse the trend and what we have achieved can also be quantified. The level of PM10 pollutant in the air has reduced by 34% in 2021-22 as compared to 2020-21. Significantly, Varanasi has shown one of the best efforts and results in reducing PM10 levels. This task of bringing down pollution levels to a safe limit is significant. It has to actually benefit people who may leave behind two and three-wheelers and take a bicycle to office or for shopping willingly and not just to save fuel expense./What are doable approaches?/While we work to reduce pollution, e-vehicles and pedestrian road stretches can be introduced to bring about awareness. Make one or two road stretches vehicle-free and allow people to experience no pollution zone. And while we talk about e-vehicles, they won't be the ultimate solution unless we keep track of used batteries and make sure they are recycled under best possible options. Also charging e-vehicle batteries if done on energy ,which is not from coal, will be a good option as we need to make sure what kind of energy we consume./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Tender floated for adding 3,980 more electric buses to Delhi's fleet","India, Sept. 23 -- New Delhi The process to add 3,980 electric buses to Delhi's existing fleet has been kicked off, with a tender floated to procure 5,690 electric buses for the national capital and four other states./Last year, the Delhi government had decided that it will only procure electric buses, as it aims to eventually phase out internal combustion engines from its fleet in a bid to control the Capital's pollution levels, to which vehicular emissions are a significant contributor. DTC has already added 250 e-buses to its fleet of around 7,200 buses./Delhi has subscribed to the National Electric Bus Program (NEBP) -- which seeks to aggregate demands from bus transport agencies and conduct tendering on an aggregated basis -- to induct electric buses too its fleet and recently submitted a proposal for 3,980 electric buses./The Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), a subsidiary of the Energy Efficiency Services Limited -- a joint venture of four PSUs under the Union power ministry -- has been requested by government think tank NITI Aayog and the Union ministry of road transport and highways to scale up the model and to play the role of program manager to deploy electric buses under NEBP, with an aim to give a big push to transform the public transportation to electric./Subsequently, the CESL has floated a tender to procure 5,690 electric buses for Delhi and four other states, of which a majority will be deployed in the national capital. The tender is for three types of e-buses -- 7m, 9m and 12m -- on a gross cost contracting basis, and it requests the bidders to a price per kilometre for operating buses for over 12 years./The tender, with a total value of around Rs.5,000 crore, was floated on September 21 and will close on November 4. The remaining buses will be deployed in Telangana, Haryana, Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh./As per the terms of the tender, the Delhi government will not purchase the buses or make any upfront payment, but will pay the private players who are selected through the bidding process on a per kilometre basis for the running cost. The Delhi government, however, will provide depots and charging infrastructure for the smooth running of the buses./Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said: ""In January, Delhi was one of the biggest purchaser of electric buses under the grand challenge done by CESL, onboarding 1,500 out of 5,450 buses. This time again, when CESL has come up with NEBP - Phase 1 with a tender for 5690 e-buses, Delhi has been the frontrunner, procuring 70%... Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi is committed to providing convenient, zero-smoke and 100% electric public transportation. This is another milestone for the Delhi government towards their mission of plying more than 10,000 buses on the city roads by 2025 with 80% of the bus fleet being electric.""/Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said that the model of buses engagement is quickly becoming the standard of bus procurement in the country and the Delhi government has also put up demands under it for the buses. ""Previously the Delhi government put up demands for 300 electric buses, of which 250 buses have already arrived and the remaining 50 buses are likely to be inducted into the DTC fleet in a fortnight. In the next phase, 1,500 e-buses will be inducted into the DTC fleet in multiple phases and in the phase after that, 1,990 buses will be introduced to the streets of the capital in 2023-24,"" said Kundra./Mahua Acharya, the managing director and CEO of CESL, said: ""Delhi is certainly moving to electric very seriously. The induction of 3,980 e-buses under the latest tender is a very important move towards shifting the public transportation to electric in the national capital. Overall, it will lead to reduction in air pollution, fuel bills and reduce financial load on the state transport utility.""/Buses are still the most popular form of public transit in Delhi, with around 4.2 million people using the system every day. DTC alone ferries 3.3 million passengers on an average, almost a million more than the Delhi Metro./The Capital currently has around 7,200 buses under DTC and the cluster scheme. The state government aims to increase the strength of the fleet to 11,000, and to ensure that 70-75% of all public buses in Delhi are electric by 2025-26./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World Lung Day 2022: Yoga and Ayurveda tips to keep your lungs healthy,"India, Sept. 24 -- Our lungs are one of the most crucial organs and helps in elimination of harmful carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the body while aiding oxygen supply to all other organs of our body. Covid-19, rising air pollution and exposure to other toxic chemicals are some of the external factors that could impact our lung health adversely. According to Ayurveda, lung is the reservoir of Prana Vaha Srotas, or channel of breathing. The Vata and Kapha entities are responsible for the adequate functioning of the Prana channels. For this very reason, it is essential to maintain both entities together without enabling a surge in either of them for optimal respiratory functions. (Also read: Asthma: Foods to eat and avoid when suffering from the lung disease)/On the occasion of World Lung Day (September 25, 2022) Dr Archana Sukumaran, Ayurveda doctor (BAMS) at Kerala Ayurveda, suggests some Ayurvedic and Yoga tips that one can incorporate into their daily life to improve respiratory health./Here are a few Ayurvedic tips you can incorporate into your daily life to uplift your respiratory well-being./""A faulty diet and regimen could lead to dosha imbalance and respiratory disturbances. So, proper diet and regimen are necessary for attaining respiratory wellness,"" says Dr Archana./Here are a few tips by Dr Archana according to the classics of Ayurveda and Yoga for attaining optimal lung health./DIETARY TIPS/Ahara, the food you consume, is a crucial aspect for maintaining lung health, says Dr Archana./* Satmya Bhojana: Consuming a proper diet at the proper time keeping in mind quantity of food as it impacts functionality of your Agni or metabolism and is an essential indicator for lung health. According to Ayurveda, the Udana Vata that controls adequate respiration originates from Amashaya or the gut. So having proper food aids in better lung well-being./* Diet not influenced by any predominant taste: A diet that is not overly Katu (Pungent) and Madhura (Sweet) has to be consumed, for these qualities bring about a surge in Vata and Kapha doshas./* Control your unctuousness factor: While consuming food, it is crucial to keep a check on reducing the unctuous factor in the diet. Foods that are neither too dry nor too oily are preferred for lung health./* Eating in a clean environment: An environment that is free from dust and smoke while having food is equally important./TIPS FOR A HEALTHY ROUTINE FOR LUNG HEALTH/Dr Archana says Vihara, or daily regimen, is equally important in maintaining the body's equilibrium./Pranayama: The breathing techniques mentioned in yoga, including the various pranayama methods, are great options to purify the channels of the respiratory system and clear Prana Vaha Srotas./Nasya: The nose is also the entry point of the vital breath or Prana Vayu, which is crucial in maintaining lung health. According to Ayurveda, the instillation of herbal oils or Nasya is one of the most crucial holistic self-care practices that encourages healthy Prana flow and internal detoxification. Nasya helps to lubricate the nasal passages and clean out excess mucus from the sinuses. Anu Thailam, an ancient Nasya oil, is made with Kapha balancing herbs that help clear the accumulated doshas to breathe better./Dhumapana: In Dinacharya, Acharyas mention the need for Dhumapana as medical fumigation or medicine-infused inhaler to clear the pathway from pathogenic innervation./Control over exercise: While exercise is essential, overdoing it - mostly heavy cardio workouts, can trigger Vata abnormalities and thus a deranged respiratory system./Control on the exposure to air conditioners: Air conditions clean and purify the air, but continuous exposure without proper ventilation can trigger Vata and Kapha abnormalities and other lung maladies./HERBS FOR LUNG HEALTH/Dr Archana suggests few herbs that enhance the functioning of the respiratory system./Vasa: Adhatoda vasica is identified as the supreme medication for all complaints associated with the lung. It is consumed as a decoction with honey or as a delicious, fermented herbal preparation- Vasarishta./Shunthi: Zingiber officinale, the dry ginger, is an excellent kitchen source that, when incorporated into your diet as ginger-infused tea is effective in maintaining the respiratory system./Dasamoola: Dasamoola combines ten Vata balancing herbs- Agnimantha, Bilwa, Bruhati, Gokshura, Kantakari, Kashmari, Patala, Prushniparni, Shaliparni, and Shyonaka. It reduces inflammation and improves lung health. Agasthyarasayanam is a potent herbal jam preparation with dasamoola and other herbs in a delicious jaggery base to improve respiratory health./Haridra: The golden spice turmeric, Curcuma longa can be consumed with honey to manage the levels of both Vata and Kapha. It also has antimicrobial action and helps to fight off disease-causing pathogens residing in the channels of respiration./""Ayurveda strictly mentions the need to follow Dinacharya (Daily regime) and Ritucharya (Seasonal regimen) to maintain the system's quality of life and wellbeing. Along with these principles and the tips mentioned above, you can attain perfectly optimal lung health amidst the buzz and stress of this generation,"" concludes Dr Archana./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air quality deteriorates,"India, Sept. 26 -- After recording its cleanest air spell over the last three days, Delhi's air quality slightly deteriorating on Monday even though it stayed within the satisfactory category. However, a haze hung over the city in the morning giving an impression of the smog that envelops the city during winter months when air quality enters the emergency zone./Experts attributed the haze to a combination of dry northwesterly winds with the moist air that was blowing through the city till Sunday evening./Forecasts by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi show that with no rain expected in the capital over the next six days and dry northwesterly winds persisting, Delhi's air quality is likely to deteriorate to the 'moderate' category, with this haze to disappear again./""There has been a change in the wind direction from easterly to northwesterly, which are dry winds that carry dust and cause uptick in pollution levels. The morning haze on Monday was mostly due to a combination of high moisture and these winds combining. The high moisture content was only due to the after-effect of easterly winds and the rain that Delhi saw over the last few days, but such a haze is not expected in the next few days now,"" said VK Soni of IMD, who is also part of the sub-committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which has been appointed by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)./Delhi recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 100 (satisfactory) as per Central Pollution Control Board's daily national bulletin which is released at 4 pm. In comparison, it was 52 (satisfactory) at the same time on Sunday, 54 (satisfactory) on Saturday and 57 (satisfactory) on Friday. This clean spell of air was largely down to spells of rain since Thursday, which saw Safdarjung receive 111.6mm of rainfall over the last four days./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) classifies AQI as 'good' when it is 50 or lower, as satisfactory when it is between 51 and 100 and as 'moderate' when it is between 101 and 200. It is 'poor' when between 201 and 300, as 'very poor' when between 301 and 400 and 'severe' when it is over 400./CPCB data shows there was a significant increase in the 24-hour average PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentration in the capital on Monday. While the average PM 10 concentration rose from 37.5 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Sunday to 94.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Monday, the average PM 2.5 concentration rose from 15.9 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Sunday to 40.3 micrograms per cubic metre at 7 pm on Monday. The 24-hour permissible limits for these particles are 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre respectively./Agencies forecast air quality to hover between 'satisfactory' and 'moderate' over the next three days, with an increase in temperature allowing greater ventilation for pollutants./""The AQI is in the satisfactory category and dust (size > 2.5 micrometer) is currently contributing to around 57% of PM10. For the next three days (27th, 28th, 29th) peak wind speed is likely to be around 8-16 km/h, causing moderate dispersion and AQI is likely to be within 'satisfactory' or lower end of the 'moderate' category,"" said Safar, an air forecasting body./Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 33.4 degrees Celsius on Monday, one degree below normal, and the minimum was 22.7 degrees Celsius, also one degree below normal for this time of the season. IMD has forecast clear skies on Tuesday, with the maximum and minimum is likely to be around 34 and 23 degrees Celsius respectively./No meeting on GRAP until forecasts show air will turn 'poor'/While the revised Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to tackle air pollution spikes this winter will come into force from October 1 onwards, the CAQM sub-committee formed to execute Grap says no meeting has been planned as of now, until forecasts by the Early Warning System (EWS) shows air quality turning poor./According to the revised Grap, forecasts for air quality for the 'poor' category or higher need to be made at least three days in advance of the projected AQI./""While the EWS forecasts are up to a period of 10 days, we are relying on forecasts for the next 3-4 days and taking action accordingly. As of now, forecasts show air quality is only likely to be within satisfactory or the moderate range. Until forecasts show it will reach poor, a meeting will not be called.

Punjab facing gamut of problems in combating farm fires,"Chandigarh, Sept. 26 -- Widespread rain across over the past week has delayed paddy harvesting in Punjab by 10 days, leaving farmers with a smaller window to ready their fields for winter sowing, in what will likely compel them more to burn crop remnants, and, yet again, trigger a pollution crisis./Experts say that a host of unresolved issues going back decades are anyway likely to make farm fires inevitable, despite Punjab now being run by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) that is also in power in Delhi, where the winter air pollution crisis is a massive public health issues./At the heart of the problem are two core issues: First, a large part of the state's agriculture sector sticks to a rice-wheat formula for farming. Rice, sown in summer season, and wheat, sown in the winter, are covered under the government's minimum support price (MSP) guarantee. This effectively leads to farmers choosing paddy over other crops in the kharif, or summer, season./The second concerns how farmers harvest paddy, using a machine known as the combine harvester. This farm machine slices away the part of paddy that contains the rice grains, leaving a roughly 12-inch stalk, or stubble, embedded in the field. Most commonly used seeding machines are then unable to navigate a farm full of stubble to sow the winter (rabi) crop, in most cases wheat, which has to be put in the ground by the second week of November. This leads to the farmers setting the stubble on fire./Over the years, the Punjab administration has tried to address these issues, especially the second one. But a combination of bad planning and lack of political will have ensured they have not come to fruition. Listed below are some of the measures and why they failed. The question is, will the AAP, with higher stakes than previous regimes because it is also in government in Delhi, do better this year?/1. Stubble-free machines Between 2018 and 2021, a total of Rs.1,145 crore has been spent to distribute 90,422 subsidised systems to farmers and to centres from where farmers hire farm equipment. These include machines and attachments that deal with the stubble in-situ, or in the field itself. Some of these, like the paddy straw chopper, shred the stalks, while others, like the happy seeder, help plant seeds even when the ground is covered in paddy stalks./But in those four years, there was little difference in the number of farm fires. A part of the reason was that many of these machines never made it to the farms -- a survey of such machines carried out by the Punjab government in July and August this year, after being prodded by the Enforcement Directorate, found that 14% of these machines never reached farmers or were disposed off as junk./Even the machines that were found were likely not used. ""There were about 78,000 operable machines but results were not encouraging. It seems these were not used optimally as the farmers who were given the machines restricted the usage to their farms and did not help others,"" an official in state agriculture department said, asking not to be named./An officer at the helm when the in-situ stubble programme was started in 2018 said the approach itself may be flawed. ""In my opinion, we are barking up the wrong tree. Managing a whopping 20 million tonnes of stubble in just 20 days is impossible,"" he said, asking not to be named./2. New varieties of seeds/To address the failure of the stubble-free machines, experts said that farmers must be transitioned away from paddy or, at least, from the late-growing varieties such as PUSA-44, which takes 160 days to harvest, to those with a shorter, 120-130-day lifecycle. This could allow for the harvesting to be done sooner, leaving farmers with more time to clear their fields before they need to sow wheat./Former agriculture secretary KS Pannu said, in particular, nine districts may hold the key. ""In my opinion the problem of stubble burning is more pronounced in the nine districts of Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala, Mansa, Bathinda, Muktsar, Ferozepur, Faridkot and Tarn Taran since these districts grow PUSA-44 variety that has higher biomass content and is a late maturing variety,"" Pannu, who cited it as among the major reasons why efforts to curb farm fires have failed so far. ""Farmers are left with no option but to burn it to ready their fields for the next crop,"" Pannu added./PAU vice-chancellor Dr Satbir Singh Gosal said that work on such varieties are underway. ""We are doing research and have launched short duration varieties such as 125 days-PR 126.' But, Gosal added, ""simultaneously, efforts for in-situ (mixing in soil) management of stubble should continue as it improves soil fertility and saves water""./Gosal suggested innovation to bring simpler and cost-effective happy-seeders for sowing wheat directly after harvesting paddy without tilling and setting crop residue on fire./3. Off-farm solutions/Off-farm, or ex-situ, measures -- a scenario in which the stubble is removed and sold for other uses -- was among the solutions suggested, especially by directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)./Latest data by Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), analysed by HT, shows that there are 11 privately owned biomass-based power generating plants in the state, which are the only ones that will process the crop remnants. Their capacity of 0.8 million tonne is enough to process only 6% of the total stubble generated in the state./Gosal told HT last week that the state needs an infrastructural push to improve ex-situ methods. ""It's a cheaper proposition but needs infrastructure for which big budget is required,"" he said, adding that the state needs more biomass-based power generating plants, pellets making industry, bio-CNG plants, fast transportation to evacuate stubble from the farms and storage godowns./4. Incentive schemes/The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government too sought to give cash incentives of Rs.100 per quintal of stubble from the Centre to nudge farmers into giving away the crop remnants for a profit. Those funds too, however, did not come through./The Union government pointed to the funds it provides for the subsidies of the farm equipment to defend its decision to not offer any of the other incentives as sought by the states./This year, The AAP government attempted to offer farmers Rs.2,500 per acre, of which Rs.1,500 was to come from the central government, as cash incentive for farmers to turn over their paddy stubble. But the proposal was turned down by the Union government over cost factors. The plan has now been abandoned altogether./5. Punitive action/Efforts by the erstwhile Congress government to curb farm fires by taking punitive action against farmers also proved futile. In 2019, 327 cases were registered against farmers under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (for violating government orders). A total of 196 farmers were arrested and 850 red entries were made in their revenue records for burning crop residue. But the problem persisted, forcing the government to pull back owing to the fear of a backlash, especially ahead of elections./""There is always a political angle attached to the problem. Whenever we try to tighten the noose, political considerations come into play. In such a scenario, why should government employees put themselves at risk,"" said a second retired officer, asking not to be named./During the 2018 kharif harvest, enforcement was relaxed since the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were around the corner. The following year, farmers were protesting at Delhi's borders against the (now repealed) three farm laws, which too prompted the state to go easy on its crackdown. In 2021, a similar attitude was in play since the state headed for polls in early 2022./This season, paddy was cultivated in over three million hectares and as a season's average, about 18.5 million tonne stubble is likely to be produced./State agriculture minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said he was the number of farm fires will be drastically lower this time. The minister cited the state government's initiative to give 32,100 machines for in-situ management, which is more than the number distributed in the previous four years, and an aggressive campaign to dissuade farmers from burning the crop remnants. ""At least 5,000 officers of the agriculture, rural development and revenue departments besides students of four state universities are reaching out to rural Punjab to dissuade farmers from burning paddy stubble,"" he said./The AQI numbers this season, and the share of stubble smoke in the pollution levels, will reveal the real story./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Stubble fires rising in Punjab, may impact Delhi after Oct 10","India, Oct. 3 -- Farmers have started burning crop stubble across the northern plains, with Sunday recording this year's highest single-day fire count of 130, data collated from satellite images showed./As in the previous years, Punjab is again the primary culprit with the state accounting for 83 fires on October 2 (Sunday); Haryana had seven fires and Uttar Pradesh 36./Data compiled by the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS), a centre under the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), shows that between September 15 and 30, 147 farm fires were recorded in Punjab. Compared to that, in just the two days of October 1 and 2, the state recorded a total fire count of 128 -- a clear indication that the annual exercise to rid the field of crop stubble has started to pick up./This does not bode well for Delhi, which every year suffers hazardous levels of air pollution as wind blows the smoke and pollutants towards the capital city. Making matter worse is the fact that the stubble burning season also coincides with unfavourable meteorological conditions in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region), which keep the pollutants trapped near the surface./CREAMS, which is currently collecting data from all NCR states said this year, each state is following the ISRO protocol -- a standard protocol that has been developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for monitoring data on farm fires -- and that will help provide uniform data from each state to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), the agency tasked with managing pollution in Delhi-NCR. Earlier, states were reliant on different Nasa satellites, which meant that each had its own differing counts on farm fires./According to CREAMS data, between September 15 and October 2, Punjab saw 275 farm fires, which is slightly higher than the 228 fires in the state during the same period last year. It is, however, lower than the 1,331 fires recorded by Punjab during the same period in 2020./VK Sehgal, professor and principal scientist at IARI, and a part of CREAMS, said initial trends show a similar fire count to last year, and it appeared to be a considerable improvement over 2020./He also said the late monsoon rains played a key role this year as well as the last. ""We saw a spell from September 24 to 29, when no fire counts were recorded. This was mainly due to rains in Punjab and the fields remained wet for the next few days, so that paddy stubble could not be burnt,"" he said./Weather analysts have forecast a rain spell from October 5-9 across northern India, and Sehgal said it will provide another break from farm fires. ""We may again see a spike in the activity from October 10 onwards or a little later than that,"" he said./In Punjab, Amritsar and Tarn Taran have emerged the problem districts, with Amritsar accounting for 230 of the 275 fires so far, while Tarn Taran has recorded 27 of them./Sehgal said this could primarily be because these districts are also potato producers. ""They begin burning paddy fields early, by mid- or late-September, so that they can sow potato by early October,"" he said./While Punjab currently has a higher fire count than last year, Haryana is faring better than last year. So far, only nine fires have been recorded in Haryana between September 15 and October 2, while it was 13 during the same period in 2021 and 123 in 2020./Uttar Pradesh has recorded 49 fires so far, while it was 46 for the same period last year and 63 in 2020. Delhi is yet to record a single fire incident, while Rajasthan has recorded five fire events until October 2, the data showed./Pawan Gupta, a Universities Space Research Association (USRA) scientist at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center, who carried out an analysis using the VIIRS SNP 375m satellite, says a clearer trend will emerge only towards the end of October./""So far, the season in Punjab is similar to that of last year. We had around 250 fires in Punjab from September 1 to October 1 in 2021 and this year's numbers are about the same. Farm fires returned on October 1 and 2 this year, after a brief break, and a majority of them are either in Amritsar, or across the border in Pakistan,"" said Gupta./Even though the fire count is rising, experts say it has not impacted Delhi's air quality as yet, despite the winds being northwesterly./""The fire count is low and the wind speed is also not much at the moment. The fires are expected to start impacting Delhi only after October 10,"" said Gufran Beig, founder project director at Safar, a government body, which tracks the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's overall PM2.5 (fine inhalable particulate matter in air) concentration./Krunesh Garg, member secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board, said efforts on the ground are gradually showing results, but it is will take four or five years for a complete resolution of the problem./""Crop diversification is not a long-term solution as biomass will be produced by other crops as well. We need both in situ and ex situ solutions and they are already being implemented on the ground at the block and village level. But it will still take four or five years for a complete resolution,"" he said, adding that Punjab was faring better this year, despite an increase in the area under paddy cultivation./During the Kharif season 2022, paddy has been grown across approximately 3.11 million hectares in Punjab, as opposed to 2.96 million hectares in 2021, Garg said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Cremations should be allowed at Vaikunth 24X7, say residents","India, Oct. 13 -- As Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is considering a proposal to stop cremations post 6 pm at Vaikunth, city's oldest crematorium located in Navi Peth, residents have opposed the move./PMC has stopped issuing cremation passes at Vaikunth after complaints from nearby residents about health hazards and air pollution. The civic administration has claimed that residents can get passes from other locations where this facility is available 24x7./Vaikunth is one of the oldest crematoria developed by PMC in 1958, built adjacent to the river Mutha. Although there are 28 crematoriums across the city, the Vaikunth crematorium is a preferred facility due to its central location, spacious area and proximity to main city hospitals./According to the residents, the crematorium is an essential service and it should be open 24X7./Sharmila Lodhi, a city resident, said, ""Vaikunth is the oldest crematorium, the construction of residential units around the place came after it. It is important that performing the last rites should be open for 24 hours.""/Another resident Maithili Manekwad, said, ""Normally cremations are done in the daytime, but some cremations are carried during the night as it is not advised to keep the body overnight or the morgue facility maybe not be affordable.

"Crop cycle, quick field turnaround continue to be burning issues","Bajakhana, Faridkot, Oct. 17 -- Many of the farmers in this Punjab village admit that they are going to burn the paddy stubble left after the harvest - the main source of pollution in the National Capital Region in October and November./Most are also desperate to move out of the paddy-wheat cycle of cropping. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has warned them that they have groundwater left for 15 more years - at a stretch. As they prepare to harvest their nearly mature paddy crop, they say they have realised that farming has become unsustainable for several reasons: a water table that has fallen to the ""red"", or ""overexploited"" category; rising costs of pesticide and other inputs; extreme weather events such as unseasonal rain of the sort that hit all of northwest India in early October; and the problem of dealing with paddy stubble./CGWB's groundwater resource assessment for 2020 shows most blocks in Punjab are in the ""overexploited"" or ""critical"" categories. Bajakhana, a small village in Faridkot district, is in one such block. The entire region is also affected by water salinity, and high fluoride, nitrate and arsenic levels./""We have groundwater left for only 15 years in this village. What will our children do? They are already selling farmland to move abroad. Every farming family has suicide cases here driven by debt and every family here has at least one case of cancer. The issue of paddy stubble is linked to our farming practices in this region. If we did not practice intensive paddy-wheat farming, this problem would have never arisen,"" said Inderjeet Singh, farm leader, Bharatiya Kisan Ekta, Bajakhana./""We realise that the only solution to the problem is crop diversification. Farmers also want to diversify but government has to provide minimum support price and the crop has to be accepted in the market, otherwise how can farmers diversify confidently?""/Diversification comes with risks that many farmers aren't equipped to handle./For instance, this year, farmers who chose to grow cotton in Punjab and Haryana are devastated because entire crop has failed due to bad seeds. ""Since the implementation of Green Revolution 1960 onwards university scientists and government recommended that we follow extremely chemical dependent farming. We knew that during desi kheti (traditional agriculture) our grandparents used to grow 4-5 quintals of paddy in one acre. We were told by the government that if we adopt their methods each acre will produce 50 to 60 quintals. So, we adopted it and now we are in a vicious cycle of complete dependence on the market and universities for seeds, manure, pesticides, entire economics of what we are selling is dependent on them. Now this farming is unsustainable in Punjab,"" Singh said./He claimed that their demands for alternative crops have received no response from the government./Agriculture minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said that diversification is on top of the priority list of the state government. ""We actually need to stop growing paddy in Punjab as it is not a native crop and is also causing environmental hazard,"" he said./According to the minister, a policy on agriculture will soon be announced to address the issue. ""The Punjab government will also approach the Centre for support to help it pull the state out of the stubble trouble which is negatively impacting the north Indian states and nation's capital,"" he said./An official in the Union agriculture ministry, requesting anonymity, said, ""This is a complicated issue that needs a very detailed response. We have to look at what efforts are being made.""/The dependence on paddy (rice), especially, has ruined Punjab's water table, and with the availability of water (controlled by the government) governing cropping cycles, it is indirectly the cause for stubble burning./Unseasonal rain and prolonged extreme heat (of the sort seen earlier this year; and the climate crisis will increase the frequency of these events) have also increased input costs in these regions./Hira Singh from Sirsa used pesticides worth Rs.15,000 per acre this time for his paddy. ""The cost on pesticides is way too high for paddy because it is so vulnerable to pests. At least 7 different kinds of pesticide and insecticides are used. Over and above that due to unpredictable weather use of pesticides has gone up. Due to unseasonal rain like the one we saw in late September, the chances of fungal infestation is high. Extreme heat causes damage to wheat. In fact, too much difference in the day and night temperatures also affects the paddy crop. Now the days are extremely hot while nights are colder than expected. Over the years, this too has played a major role in the increase of agri-inputs used. We are now cultivating cotton also to see how we can diversify our crop,"" he said./Farm leaders said the government does not understand ground realities. ""When the government is not helping farmers diversify their crop, they should at least understand the compulsions for burning stubble. Nobody wants to expose themselves and their families to the smoke from stubble fires but the solutions provided by governments are not practical and I don't think they have tried it on ground. The decomposer for instance may work well in the lab but it takes at least 20 days to decompose and has led to pest infestation in many farms,"" said S Agrej Singh Khara, general secretary, BKE in Sirsa./Pusa decomposer, a consortium of seven fungi, has been developed on the basis of their lingo cellulolytic enzyme production potential. This composting technology has been recognized as the most suitable means to convert and decompose agro-wastes according to Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)./""We have always said that Pusa decomposer will take 20 to 25 days to decompose stubble. It cannot happen earlier. We haven't found any pest or fungal infestation issue. We will check if there is any such concern,"" said Trilochan Mohapatra, former DG, ICAR who was closely associated with development of the decomposer./There is a fear among farmers that their soil quality has irreversibly deteriorated and the rising cases of cancer and suicides in these districts are associated with increased use of pesticides and rising debt. In Kot Kapura, HT met more farmers whose paddy crop will be ready for harvesting after October 20. ""Most of us here suffer from mental health issues. The treatment costs are high. We believe that this has got to do with the mix of pesticides we use for paddy because the environmental conditions are not suited for it. Some farmers tried moong dal last year but did not get a fair price,"" said Sukhmandar Singh, farmer leader from Kot Kapura, another village in the ""overexploited"" zone./An additional challenge for the arid regions of Haryana and Punjab is the failure of the cotton crop and use of spurious DAP fertilizer in many places. ""In neighbouring Ellenabad we caught a huge consignment of spurious DAP but by then most farmers had already procured DAP for paddy. Then again the cotton seeds turned out to be spurious. We do not know whether they are in fact Bt Cotton seeds or not,"" said Khara./""The sustainable long-term solution will emerge from diversification of crops and reduction in non-basmati paddy. Currently, area under paddy continues to dominate Punjab's Kharif (monsoon) crop mix leading to enormous paddy residue generation. Setting of targets for eliminating incidents of fire count due to stubble burning shall help to guide the performance planning of in-situ and ex-situ measures,"" the Policy to Curb Air Pollution in NCR released by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in July states./CAQM, in its action plan, acknowledges that the practice of stubble burning continues despite several government and judicial interventions./""Apart from various directions from NGT, and former EPCA, there have been multiple advisories/directions from CAQM in 2021. There are policies and schemes from central government, which include National policy for management of crop residue (2014), Central scheme on promotion of agricultural mechanisation for in-situ management of crop residue in the states of Punjab, Haryana, UP and NCT of Delhi (2018 onward) - in this scheme a total amount of Rs.1,726.67 crore (2018- 2021) has been provided to state. Another scheme - the Sustainable Agrarian Mission on Use of Agro Residue in Thermal Power Plants (SAMARTH) - has been initiated in 2022. Plans and schemes to reduce the generation of paddy straw aim to promote basmati variety (some basmati varieties can be harvested early so the stubble can be allowed to degenerate); short duration and early maturing varieties; and crop diversification.""/According to the report, CAQM has planned to totally suspend certification and use of the PUSA 44 variety of paddy seeds. PUSA 44 is a long duration paddy and hence its stubble needs to be managed in a very short window so as to prepare the farmland for Rabi crops. Due to this, farmers often resort to burning the PUSA 44 paddy stubble. HT reported on June 19 that Punjab government plans to phase out this water-intensive non-basmati variety in the next three kharif seasons./Among several in-situ and ex-situ measures, CAQM has recommended schemes to reduce generation of paddy straw through crop diversification and diversification to short duration paddy varieties, in its policy to curb air pollution in Delhi NCR released in July. The BJP-JJP government in Haryana has set a target to diversify at least one lakh acre land under paddy cultivation to crops such as pulses, cereals, cotton and maize every year to check Haryana's rapidly deleting ground water table. Under the state's flagship 'mera pani- meri virasat' policy, farmers sowing alternative crops in place of paddy are paid Rs.7,000 per acre, of which Rs.2,000 is paid after first verification, and Rs.5,000 at the time of harvesting, HT reported on May 25./There is a push for crop diversification in Punjab as well. Market trends indicate that the Punjab government's push for pulse cultivation did not do well as most of the summer moong was being purchased up to 30% less than the MSP of Rs. 7,225 per quintal, HT reported on June 27./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Paddy straw: A hurdle in the clean air dream,"India, Oct. 18 -- The annual air pollution season has begun in the National Capital Region (NCR). Participating in the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment, forests and climate change's first review meeting of air pollution control measures, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said that the area under paddy cultivation in Haryana and Punjab increased this year and the generation of paddy straw is expected to be higher than 2021. But stubble fires this past month have been lower than 2021, possibly because of spells of rain in early October./A higher generation of paddy straw is likely to mean an uptick in air pollution. Some experts worry that the narrow turnaround period might translate to more intense bursts of stubble fire. CAQM also apprised the House panel about several steps taken to tackle pollution: A staggered harvesting schedule; the use of in-situ stubble management (Pusa Bio-decomposer); ex-situ utilisation of paddy straw; and extension of storage facilities. Also, 11 thermal plants within 300 km of Delhi have been asked to co-fire paddy stubble biomass./While the coming days will show whether these steps had an impact, the authorities must also listen to the farming community. Farmers told HT that the Pusa bio-decomposer takes 20 days to decompose the paddy straw and has led to pest infestation. They also want State help for diversifying into new crops. Air pollution is festering not just due to NCR's geography, unfavourable meteorological conditions, and local pollutants, but also due to unresolved farm issues. These need to be tackled or else, the dream of clean air is set to go up in smoke, again./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Calm wind, farm fires signal polluted Diwali","New Delhi, Oct. 22 -- The air quality in Delhi, which has been gradually deteriorating over the past few days, is set to worsen further on Diwali and the days after the festivities, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) predicted on Saturday, as smoke from farm fires, possible illegal use of firecrackers, and calm winds lead to noxious air settling over the national capital./The contribution of farm residue burning across the northern plains is expected to rise to 15-18% by the day after Diwali, causing air pollution levels in the ""very poor"" and ""severe"" categories, according to Safar, an arm of the ministry of earth sciences./The air quality index (AQI) could become ""severe"" on Diwali night, with illegal firecracker emissions and may remain in that range till at least October 26 till winds pick up speed, Safar said in its Diwali forecast. On Saturday, Delhi's AQI was in the ""poor"" category with a reading of 265, as per Central Pollution Control Board's daily national bulletin at 4pm, a deterioration from 262 on Friday./Poor air quality places the elderly at risk, according to Safar. Very poor AQI triggers a health alert due to significant increase in respiratory problems. Severe air quality is termed an emergency when the general public experiences breathing problems./Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh recorded 722 farm fires on Nasa's satellite imagery in the past 24 hours, up from 523 on Friday, although their contribution to Delhi's PM 2.5 worsening concentration was just 3%, Safar said. It is expected to rise to 5% on Sunday, 8% on Monday and reach up to 18% on Tuesday, as conditions become favourable for smoke transport, it said./Safar delineated two scenarios in its forecast. In the first scenario, even when no firecracker emissions are factored in, Delhi's AQI will be ""very poor"" on Diwali, owing to adverse weather conditions./""The transport-level winds reaching Delhi will be from the northwesterly direction, where large stubble burning hot spots are expected. In addition, calm local winds are expected in Delhi with little over the next three days. Under this zero firecracker emission scenario, the level of PM2.5 is predicted to be in the 'very poor' category on Diwali day,"" Safar said in its forecast. ""However, with adverse weather conditions, 15-18% of stubble contribution and possibly firecracker related pollution from surrounding parts of Delhi, the AQI could touch the higher end of the 'very poor' category and even the lower end of 'severe' by October 25.""/In the second scenario, where Safar assumes firecracker emissions to be the same as last year, which was around 25% of the long-term average of firecracker emissions Delhi has seen, these already adverse weather conditions and the additional firecracker load will send Delhi's air to ""severe"" on Diwali night and keep it there the day after as well./""AQI will start to improve to the 'very poor' category again only from the evening of October 26 onwards as surface winds pick up and stubble transport slows down,"" Safar said in its analysis./Even a little addition of firecracker emissions to Delhi's air was likely to be detrimental, sending it to the severe zone, said Gufran Beig, project director at Safar./""Calm local winds and an increase in stubble emissions are both expected to deteriorate the air at this time and Delhi just needs some additional firecracker emission to push it to severe,"" Beig said. ""We also have to understand that firecracker emissions from neighbouring places in Delhi will also eventually reach the capital.""/Delhi's AQI has been rising over the past seven days and has been poor since October 16, when it touched a value of 232. To control the rising pollution, the Commission for Air Quality Management had on October 19 imposed stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), which means 12 measures will be in place./These include a ban on diesel generator sets across NCR (barring emergency and essential service locations) and a ban on coal and firewood including in tandoors in hotels, restaurants and open eateries./Winds are becoming calm after sunset, leading to stagnation in the air, said VK Soni, scientist at the weather office and part of the commission's panel on Grap. Delhi also saw a slight haze on Saturday morning owing to mist./""While visibility was between 1,000 to 2,000 metres, meaning this was not fog, but there was a haze and there is a gradual accumulation of pollutants in early morning and at night. With winds expected to become calm during the day, too, the AQI is forecast to touch very poor by Diwali,"" Soni said./Cooler Lower temperatures were another factor contributing to worsening air quality, he said./Delhi recorded a minimum of 17.3 degrees Celsius on Saturday, one degree below normal, while the maximum was 31.7 degrees, also a notch below normal. While the maximum and minimum temperatures will be around 32 and 17 degrees on Sunday, it will be around 32 and 16 degrees on Diwali, the Met department said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi's poor air quality not Punjab's doing: PAU study,"Ludhiana, Oct. 22 -- Delhi's poor air quality index (AQI) in winter months is not due to stubble burning in Punjab but due to accumulation of its own pollutants, a study by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has found./The study was conducted by PAU climate change and agricultural meteorology department head Pavneet Kaur Kingra and meteorologists Harleen Kaur and Sukhjeet Kaur, in which they looked at the month-wise AQI of the National Capital over the last three years./""The data showed that Delhi's pollution levels remained significantly high throughout the year, except for the monsoon months of July and August, when atmospheric pollutants settled down owing to the rain,"" said Kingra. She, however, accepted that stubble burning does bring down the quality of air in Punjab and poses problems for the inhabitants here./Kingra cited the wind direction and speed to further substantiate the argument. She said that wind blows from the South-East, i.e, from the Delhi side towards Punjab. ""So there is no possibility of pollutants moving Punjab to Delhi. The wind speed is also low, around 6km per hour, during this period in the region, which is not enough to push the pollutants,"" she elaborated./Explaining the reasons behind the high pollution levels in winter months in Delhi, Kingra said, ""The poorest AQI is witnessed during the winter months of November to January. This is mainly due to festivities and stable weather conditions, which result in the accumulation and locking of pollutants in air till January and February.""/The researchers also pointed out that crop residue is also burnt during the wheat harvesting season, in April and May, but that doesn't seem to have any effect on Delhi's AQI, which, as per data, shows improvement from January till August./This indicates that degradation of Delhi's air quality from November to January is not due to the movement of pollutants and smoke from Punjab, but due to locking and accumulation of its own pollutants, further triggered by festivals under stable weather conditions./'Delhi has its own pollution sources'/""The fact cannot be denied that Delhi has its own pollution sources, in the form of vehicles/large population and industrial processes etc. During monsoon, AQI becomes better as these pollutants mix/settle down with rainwater. With the culmination of monsoon, these pollutants keep on accumulating in the atmosphere under stable winter weather conditions till January. Due to which we witness hazy conditions in the National Capital Region,"" said Kingra./As the temperature starts increasing in February and March, the pollutants start dispersing due to air movement and thus the air quality starts improving./A similar study had been carried out by the previous department head Prabhjyot Kaur by analysing data of three years from 2017 to 2019./This study too found that stubble burning in Punjab chokes locals, but is not the cause of pollution in NCR./Another study, which was carried out jointly by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, and Punjab Pollution Control Board had concluded that a significant contribution to Delhi's air pollution was from within the NCR or Uttar Pradesh./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
