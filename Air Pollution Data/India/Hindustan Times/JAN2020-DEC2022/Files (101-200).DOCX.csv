"Bird calls were sweeter this spring, thanks to lockdown, says Science journal","India, Sept. 30 -- Less noise during the lockdown restrictions, which were enforced in various parts of the world to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic during this spring, may have allowed birds to sing sweeter and softer songs, according to a study published in the journal Science last week./Ornithologists and birders reported hearing more bird songs and calls even from the species they had never heard before, but always knew were in the vicinity./Also read: Centre convenes meeting to review anti-pollution steps/The study found that sparrows in the United States of America's (USA) San Francisco Bay area responded to the new acoustic space during the lockdown in April and May by singing higher performance songs - those involving trills or other vocal ornamentation and at lower amplitudes./Despite the reduced amplitude, communication distances more than doubled, which could both reduce territorial conflicts and increase mating potential, the study suggested./Titled Singing in A Silent Spring: Birds respond to a half-century soundscape reversion during the Covid-19 shutdown. The study, led by the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee, USA, also found that the low-frequency noise generated by traffic and vehicle crossings in April and May returned to levels not heard since the 1950s./Usually, birds that have breeding areas, where ambient noise is high, sing higher amplitude songs. This is called the Lombard effect, an involuntary vocal response to the presence of background noise, because people tend to speak louder in noisy environments./The study revealed that male birds produce songs with higher minimum frequencies in areas with high energy. While low frequency noise is typical of traffic in urban surroundings./The study concluded that birds managed to maximise communication and salience. ""These findings illustrate that behavioural traits can change rapidly in response to newly favourable conditions, indicating an inherent resilience to longstanding anthropogenic pressures like noise pollution,"" it said./""This is interesting, but, perhaps, not unexpected. Birds can modulate their song amplitude in response to noise levels. One might expect them to lower amplitudes in quieter backgrounds. More interesting is that they could then use the energy saved to sing higher performance songs.we certainly had much less ambient noise in urban spaces in India as well, but to comment on how birds may have changed their amplitude or song structure will require quantitative data, which I do not have,"" said Professor Rohini Balakrishnan of the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, and a specialist in bio-acoustics./Veteran ornithologist Asad R Rahmani, a former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), said he could hear several species, despite living in a crowded part of Lucknow, where there are fewer trees, during the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions./""I live in a crowded area, where there are not too many trees, bushes or shrubs. Nevertheless, during the lockdown when there was no traffic on the streets, I could hear Indian Cuckoo because March to June is its breeding season so it is very vocal, Greater Coucal, Laughing Dove, Jungle Babbler, Golden Oriole, Peafowl, Brown Rock Chat, Rose-ringed Parakeet, House Sparrow, Spotted Owlet, Indian Scops Owl (both at night), Brown-headed Barbet, Coppersmith Barbet, Black-rumped Flameback (woodpecker), Red-vented Bulbul, Common Iora, and a few other species of birds,"" Rahmani said./""The initial months of lockdown --- from March to June --- were the main breeding season when the males call and become territorial. They must have had a peaceful breeding season in which their calls were not drowned by the incessant noise of traffic, loudspeakers, and horns, which are all human creations,"" he said./However, the calls have stopped following the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, he added./In Gurugram, author and ornithologist Bikram Grewal said he heard birds which he knew were in the vicinity but hadn't heard before the 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced from March 25./""It could just be that noise levels were low. As a result, we paid more attention. I heard the Ashy Prinia, Tailorbirds, Indian Grey Hornbill, Spotted Owlet and the Rufous Treepie from my house in Gurugram. We definitely heard bird calls and bird songs a lot more this spring,"" Grewal said./Some birders reported watching more birds in April and May./""I live in suburban Bengaluru, where birdlife is already quite rich. There has been a further spurt in bird activity since the lockdown restrictions were lifted. They were exhibited in two distinct phenomena - an increase in birdsong and also an uptick in their presence,"" said Ramki Sreenivasan, a Bengaluru-based wildlife photographer and co-founder, Conservation India./""Notable examples are grey francolins (partridge) and peahen. Both are large birds and are, otherwise, wary of human presence. The peahens made their first visible appearance in the neighbourhood, thanks to the lockdown. I could see and hear them from my balcony. Birdsong moved to another level during the onset of monsoon. Either, there were more birds calling or we had just not heard them due to the traffic and ambient noise. For example, Ashy Prinias is always vocal wherever it is. But this monsoon the species of the bird erupted with incessant and loud vocal battles,"" he added./Anand Krishnan, a scientist at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, who specialises in interdisciplinary studies of bird sensory signals, cautioned about several contradictory papers on the impact of noise on birdsong./""This paper's quantitative assessments are nice. However, the conclusions about amplitude changes are not novel in and of themselves. The effects of noise on birdsong are a field with many, often contradictory papers, and the effects on reproduction and behaviour are also still unclear. For example, it is difficult to tease apart the effect of noise on mating and reproduction versus say air pollution or other factors. Lower amplitude songs in lower noise are something called the Lombard effect, which is known in many birds. A lot more work is needed to show that birds are responding to the 'new acoustic space' versus other environmental changes. Where this paper differs is in taking advantage of a one-off 'noise reduction,' as opposed to comparing birds singing in more and less noisy areas,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution: North-western states to adopt hot spot approach,"India, Oct. 1 -- Union minister for environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) Prakash Javadekar said 50 Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) teams would be deployed this winter in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR) in a bid to rein in the worsening air quality index (AQI) level, which has become an annual health hazard./The CPCB authorities would also coordinate with some of the north-western states on a daily basis to monitor polluting emissions, Javadekar said./Also read: Delhi HC wants Centre's response on plea to stop stubble burning/The minister made the announcement following a review meeting with his counterparts from Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Delhi on Thursday./These north-western states have been recording some of the worst AQIs in the country during winter over the past few years because of the seasonal stubble burning. Farmers set their fields ablaze to clear excess crop residue in time for the wheat sowing season, which leads to poor AQI across the region./It was decided at the meeting that the north-western states will adopt a hot spot-based approach to control air pollution during the upcoming winter season./For example, Delhi will focus on controlling pollution sources in 13 of its hot spots such as Mayapuri, Bawana, Narela, Dwarka, Rohini, RK Puram, and Jahangirpuri./Similarly, Haryana will focus on Panipat, Sonepat, Jhajjar etc./UP will concentrate its actions on Bulandshahr, Meerut, Noida, Greater Noida etc and Rajasthan will lay emphasis on Bhiwadi./The trials of a microbial consortium -- also being called PUSA decomposer that has been developed by scientists at the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) -- have started in earnest across thousands of acres in all the stubble-burning states, Javadekar said./""We may see the results of the trials within a year. The Centre has disbursed Rs 1,700 crore in the past three years for subsidising straw management machinery to Punjab, Haryana and UP. The move has also resulted in the reduction of pollution in areas under stubble burning,"" he said./Punjab government officials have informed the Centre that they are trying to create awareness in the worst stubble burning-affected districts and also explaining the common link between the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and air pollution. ""Both these factors affect lungs. The Punjab government is communicating this common link to the farmers and the public,"" Javadekar added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

50 teams to check pollution in Delhi-NCR,"India, Oct. 2 -- Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said on Thursday that 50 Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) teams will be deployed starting on October 15 in the National Capital Region (NCR) to curb air pollution this winter./CPCB will also coordinate with north-western states daily to monitor emissions, Javadekar said following a review meeting with the environment ministers of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi./""The 50 teams will be on the ground monitoring polluting activities in Delhi-NCR. They will inform relevant government agencies immediately so that quick action can be taken {when air quality dips. In fact, we deployed the teams in a dry run between September 15 and 20, and did find several pollution sources such as dumping of waste, construction rubble and dust, unpaved roads,"" said Prashant Gargava, member-secretary of CPCB./The review took place as the capital and neighbouring towns in the NCR brace for the winter, when a thick smoky haze envelops the region mainly as a result of post-harvest stubble burning in northern Indian states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, disrupting air and train traffic. Ensuring farmers don't set crop stubble on fire may be more difficult this year because small farmers hurt by the Covid-19-led economic slowdown may not have the means to hire machines and tractors to clear their farmlands of stubble, experts have said./Till September 29, 520 crop fires have been reported in Punjab and 175 in Haryana till Thursday, according to CPCB./Rice and wheat that are the staples grown in the region are dependent on nitrogenous fertiliser that leads to soil degradation, an expert said. ""The key issue is linked to the cropping patterns. Unless the rice-wheat cropping system is broken, the ecological crisis of high groundwater use, high fertilizer use or stubble burning will not stop,"" said G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad. ""The gap between rice and wheat seasons is short, labour wages are high, which leads to stubble burning."" Given the short gap, burning is usually the quickest and cheapest way of ridding the fields of stubble./According to the index maintained by CPCB, air quality in NCR was ""satisfactory"" for just eight days, a level at which atmospheric pollution poses little or no risk, in September. On the remaining 22 days of the month, it was moderate. Comparatively, August saw four good air days; air quality was satisfactory over the rest of the month./At Thursday's meeting, the environment ministers decided to focus on so-called hot spots of air pollution. For example, Delhi will focus on controlling pollution sources in 13 hot spots, including Mayapuri, Bawana, Narela, Dwarka, Rohini, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri. Similarly, Haryana will focus on Panipat, Sonepat, Jhajjar and other areas; Uttar Pradesh will concentrate its anti-pollution effort on Bulandshahr, Meerut, Noida and Greater Noida; and Rajasthan will focus on Bhiwadi./Trials have begun on a stubble decomposer developed by the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) in all stubble-burning states, Javadekar said. ""We may see results of the trials in a year or so. The Centre has already disbursed Rs.1,700 crore in the past three years for subsidising straw management machinery to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. That has also resulted in reduction of area under stubble burning,"" he claimed./Punjab officials informed the Centre that the state was trying to raise awareness in the districts where stubble-burning is common on the link between Covid-19 and air pollution./""The Punjab government is communicating the link to farmers and locals,"" Javadekar said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Mercury drops, Delhi's air begins to worsen","India, Oct. 5 -- The Capital is inching towards an air pollution spike, with winds slowing down and the mornings getting colder. On Sunday morning for instance, winds in the city were calm and the minimum temperature was 18.5degC, three degrees below normal./The wind speed picked up to 12kmph only by noon, according to the regional weather forecasting centre./Air quality in the national capital begins to dip from October onwards every year, when temperatures begin to dip, winds slow down, and farmers in neighbouring states begin to burn crop stubble, smoke from which travels towards the city./According to the air quality early warning system under the Union ministry of earth sciences, air quality is likely to be 'moderate' (when the AQI is between 101 and 200) on October 5 and 6. However, it also noted that stubble fire points have been observed over Punjab, adjoining Pakistan, Haryana, as well as Uttar Pradesh, and are increasing over time - conditions that may adversely impact Delhi and the National Capital Region's air quality. Winds in this region travel mainly from the northwest at this time./Currently, the northwesterly winds travel at speeds of up to 14kmph and skies are mainly clear./""Nights and early mornings are getting colder, and wind speeds are reducing in the evening and early morning. We are expecting minimum temperature to hover around 18 to 19degC, but maximum temperatures will be moderate, around 35 to 36degC. Pollutants do not disperse easily when winds slow down,"" explained Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre./He last week told HT that ""there are clear skies now after the monsoon has withdrawn so day temperatures are high, but the heat is radiated back, so nights are cooler. The wind direction has changed from easterly during monsoon to north-westerly so the winds are blowing from the colder regions such as Jammu and Kashmir; Himachal Pradesh etc. If there is any rain or snow there due to western disturbance, it will get colder.""/The air quality index (AQI) on Sunday was 184 in the ""moderate"" category. The ventilation index was approximately 12,500m2/s on Sunday./The ventilation index is a product of average wind speed and mixing height, and a value on the scale lower than 6,000m2/s, with average wind speeds lower than 10kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./A large number of crop stubble fires were seen in satellite images over northwestern India on October 3 and 4./""As soon as we have a recommendation from the member secretary of the CPCB, the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) will kick in. We will immediately issue orders,"" said Bhure Lal, Chairman of Environment Pollution Control Authority (Epca)./""State governments will have to take action on crop stubble burning. There are both in-situ and ex-situ options available to manage straw. The Centre has given funds to subsidise stubble management machinery. Subsidy of 50% is being offered to individuals who buy the machine and 80% to cooperative societies or panchayats. We have suggested that the small and marginal farmers get the machinery at concessional rates - almost free,"" he added./Grap, drawn up in 2017, defines specific measures to tackle different levels of air pollution. The Supreme Court-mandated Epca is in charge of enforcing the Grap measures./When air quality hits 'poor' levels, under Grap, garbage burning is monitored and fines are levied on those caught burning garbage, apart from measures to control dust, increased focus on polluting industries, and others./Meanwhile Citizens for Clean Air, a group of citizens, environmentalists, waste management experts wrote to EPCA appealing that it issue advisories or orders prohibiting the sale and use of firecrackers during the pandemic as it could aggravate public health issues, including Covid-19./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi to begin production of stubble decomposing solution today,"India, Oct. 5 -- Beginning Tuesday, Delhi is set to start large-scale preparation of a biochemical solution, a new technology that decomposes crop stubble so that it doesn't need to be burnt. It could prove to be a solution for farmers who otherwise end up burning paddy stubble and causing air pollution during the winter. The solution will be ready within 3-4 days and the first set of trials could be expected over the weekend, said government officials./As per Delhi government, at least 800 hectares of farmland in Delhi's is under cultivation where crop stubble is burnt every year. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday while launching a mega campaign against pollution said that a centralised system to produce anti-stubble burning bio-chemicals has been set up at Najafgarh's Kharkhari Nahar village, under the supervision of scientists from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, Delhi. The plant will become operational on Tuesday and will be inspected by the CM./""Production of chemicals will start from October 6 at 400 different camps here under the supervision of IARI scientists, who have developed the technology. Within a few days of starting production, the first round of chemicals will be ready. Based on the demand, we will spray the chemical through tractors at the farm fields,"" said Kejriwal during a press conference./If the experiment is successful this year, the CM said, he will request neighbouring states like Haryana and Punjab to also adopt this strategy./Air pollution in Delhi spikes every winter, starting October when calmer winds and stagnant weather conditions do not allow dispersion of pollutants. This, coupled with stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, contributes to up to 40% of pollutants according to government data./Also Read | Farm fires growing in Punjab, plumes of smoke seen over Delhi in satellite images/Last week Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had said that once the solution is sprayed over the stubble, it will take at least 15 days for it to decompose and convert into manure after which farmers can treat the fields with it./An IARI scientist, who did not wish to be named, said that the solution decomposes into fertiliser over 20 days of being sprayed and can be used by farmers in the fields./However, farmers in the city said that the government has so far not started any awareness campaign about the new technology. Many of them also raised concerns over the long window of the chemical decomposing into manure, which may delay sowing. The window between the harvest of paddy and sowing of rabi crop is just about a week, the farmers said./""I have a 35-acre farm where I grow both paddy and rabi crops. The varieties grown in Delhi are harvested around the second week of November, after which there is just one week left for us to sow rabi crop. If we use the solution, it will delay the sowing while the long gap will also take away the moisture from the field. I don't know how feasible this technology will be,"" said Sukhbir Dagar, a farmer from Delhi's Dhansa village./Also Read | EPCA writes to Punjab and Haryana to act against stubble burning/According to Bhupender Bazad, member, Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, approximately 1 lakh acre farmland is under cultivation in Delhi. At least 165 of the total 360 villages in the city still practise farming. ""The government should have started an awareness campaign by now to make farmers familiar with the benefits of the technology. There is just about 10% stubble that is burnt every winter in Delhi. It is an experiment that we are yet to see. If it's beneficial for the crops and the fields, we will support the initiative,"" said Bazad./Rai had earlier said that last year there was zero stubble burning inside Delhi. But in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Western UP, massive stubble burning took place which contributed to 45% of overall pollution levels in Delhi. He also said that district officials will reach out to farmers to help them fill up forms to apply for the chemical to be sprayed in their fields./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How Delhi plans to combat pollution: All you need to know,"India, Oct. 6 -- Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a campaign to control pollution levels in the national capital. The campaign, 'Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh', will be run by a mobile application through which citizens will be able to lodge complaints about the pollution level in their area./Every year in the month of October, Delhi witnesses a steep increase in pollution level due to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, rise in vehicular activity ahead of Dussehra and Diwali, and crackers bursting in Delhi./""From today we are starting a campaign against pollution, ""Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh"" to reduce pollution levels in the national capital. As a part of the campaign, we will be using technology developed by PUSA Agriculture Institute, to curb the menace of stubble burning,"" Kejriwal added./Here are the points you should know about the campaign:/1. A photo-based complaint lodging mobile application 'Green Delhi App' will be launched before the end of October for the redressal of pollution complaints by citizens in their area./2. On the pattern of battling the coronavirus disease, 13 pollution hotspots have been identified. Customized actions will be taken in each hotspot according to the requirement and the cause of pollution in the area./3. The Delhi government has also initiated an 'anti-dust campaign' to settle dust, especially at construction sites./4. As a part of the anti-dust campaign, agencies that cut down the tree will be asked to plant 80% of trees that have been brought down./5. The Aam Aadmi Party-led government will pay heed to air-pollution hotspots like Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, RK Puram, among other areas, to boost air quality./6. It will spray 'bio-decomposer' invented by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa in the fields to deal with residue burning issue. The spray will decompose the stubbles and will turn it into manure./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air quality poor, may deteriorate further","India, Oct. 7 -- Delhi's air quality entered the 'poor' zone on the Central Pollution Control Board's air quality index on Wednesday -- the first time since June 28, according to the data maintained as per CPCB's daily AQI bulletin./When air is in the poor zone (AQI value between 201-300) most people can experience breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure, according to the central pollution watchdog./As per the CPCB bulletin, Delhi's average air quality index (AQI) was 215 on Wednesday with PM2.5 and PM10 being the prominent pollutants. If inhaled, the fine particulate matter can settle in the breathing tract and lungs and studies have shown that it is associated with increased cardiovascular disease./As the air quality in the Capital plunged, the CPCB wrote to Delhi chief secretary, stating that complaints of waste burning and dumping of construction and demolition waste are not being addressed expeditiously. ""As many as 1,228 (40%) of the 3,041 complaints regarding these issues received on social media portal are yet to be resolved. Please take swift action to address these complaints and abate air pollution in Delhi,"" stated the letter dated October 6./Bhure Lal, chief of the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), said, ""We are observing the air quality trends. A meeting regarding implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) with state governments of Delhi-NCR to curb the deteriorating air quality is scheduled on Thursday.""/Delhi witnesses a spike in air pollution every year during winter due to a combination of changing meteorological conditions which makes dispersion of pollutants difficult and burning of crop stubble in the neighbouring states. The Epca enforces several mitigating measures under Grap such as sprinkling of water on roads, ban on construction and use of diesel generator (DG) sets, depending on the severity of pollution levels./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the Central government's air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, Delhi's air may deteriorate further till October 10, still remaining in the poor zone though./""Further deterioration in AQI is expected by October 9-10 but it may stay in the poor category. An increase in stubble burning was observed yesterday (Tuesday) around Punjab and Haryana. The wind direction and speed are favourable for transport and accumulation of pollutants in Delhi and worsening of air quality in the coming days is expected,"" the Safar bulletin said./According to the Safar bulletin, 336 fire fires were reported across the northern region on Tuesday./This year, after January and February, which had several 'poor' days, only two 'poor' category days were recorded each in the months of March, May and June. Previously, Delhi had recorded 'poor' air quality on June 28 with an AQI of 209 and on June 29 with AQI value of 230. April, July, August and September had only 'satisfactory' and 'moderate' days. In fact, August was the cleanest month since 2015 when four 'good' air days were recorded./""The weather is slowly transitioning to winter. There are calm winds during the early morning hours. The wind speed picks up only during the day and gain slow down by evening. The average wind speed during the day was 15-16 kmph. The wind speed as well as both day and night temperatures will further reduce after October 15. The calm winds and falling mercury coupled with smoke from stubble burning is not favourable for dispersion of pollutants,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department's regional weather forecasting centre./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'War room' to keep an eye on air quality launched in Delhi,"New Delhi, Oct. 9 -- Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday inaugurated a centralised ""war room"" at the state secretariat to monitor to air pollution levels and coordinate efforts by different agencies to control a spike in bad air, a chronic problem that plagues the Capital and its surrounding areas every winter./A 10-member team of experts under senior scientists Dr Mohan George and Dr B L Chawla will lead the efforts to monitor real-time data of pollutants, the condition of pollution hot spots, stubble burning images and efficacy measures aimed at checking bad air, the government said./The war room is one of the seven measures of the Delhi government's action plan to fight air pollution, announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this week./Other measures include steps to control dust pollution, a mobile application to register complaints and hot spot-based pollution-control strategies./Rai said the control room will work towards ensuring stricter enforcement of guidelines to check dust pollution at construction and demolition sites, ready-mix concrete plants, and garbage burning. The team will keep an eye on the mechanised sweeping of roads and sprinkling of water to prevent dust pollution./""This fight will not be possible without the support of every agency and, therefore, we have set up and launched a centralised war room today in the Delhi secretariat. The war room is fully equipped with technology to monitor real-time pollution data,"" Rai said on Thursday./""Three large LCD screens are present across the room. Real-time pollution data, which includes air quality and data of PM 2.5 and PM 10, sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, ozone, and wind speed will be displayed will be shared in one of the screens. Through another screen, we will monitor the situation in the 13 hot spots. Through a third screen, we will monitor NASA and ISRO pictures of stubble burning in neighbouring states,"" Rai said./""We will monitor complaints filed by people through the Green Delhi app which the CM will launch in the coming days. We will monitor complaints and implement strict action.

"Mumbai witnesses haze-laden muggy Saturday, pollution levels worsen","India, Oct. 10 -- The city witnessed hazy conditions with high humidity levels and cloud cover allowing air pollution to rise further on Saturday./Some parts of the city recorded light rain on Saturday with thundershowers reported along the outskirts of the city. The absence of wind speed did not disperse pollutants leading to poor air quality, said researchers./The pollutant measuring indicator - air quality index (AQI) - was recorded at 121 (moderate) on Saturday, which was the worst AQI since March. It was 118 (moderate) on Friday./According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Saturday's AQI was an average of nine locations in the city as the station at Bandra Kurla Complex has been defunct for over a week./While major locations across the city recorded 'moderate' air quality, the most polluted location was Navi Mumbai (193), followed by Andheri (176) and Mazgaon (166). Colaba and Bhandup had the cleanest air with satisfactory air quality at 71 and 70./SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. An AQI of 111 (moderate) has been predicted for Sunday./Humidity levels were at 89 percent in south Mumbai and 81 percent in the suburbs. ""Owing to high moisture in the air, the city recorded higher pollution levels on Saturday as pollutant carrying capacity increases when there is more humidity. Also, wind speed is very low characteristic to the withdrawal period of monsoon,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR./Meanwhile, the suburbs and south Mumbai recorded 0.2 and 0.3 mm rain between 8.30 and 5.30 pm. Thane recorded 5.6 mm rain. The city and suburbs could expect partly cloudy conditions on Sunday with the possibility of light rain. ""The presence of low-pressure weather system over the Bay of Bengal is activating monsoon currents over central India leading to thundershowers for the coast and interior Maharashtra,"" said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

NW India could get a brief breather from dirty air due to changing winds,"India, Oct. 12 -- Several parts of north-west India have started recording ""poor"" air quality for the past four days because of north-westerly calm winds and crop fires flaring across Punjab and Haryana, but the region is likely to get a brief breather due to a change in wind direction./Crop fires are likely to peak next week, when the harvesting is midway, farm leaders said./Though National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite images show widespread fires in Punjab and Haryana, the impact from the smoke may reduce over the next three to four days because of a likely change in wind direction from north-westerly to easterly./Also Read: Delhi: Pollution levels likely to dip today, reach moderate level/Moisture in the air is also likely to increase for a few days until wind direction changes back to north-westerly./Delhi air quality index (AQI) at 216 was poor on Sunday./Agra, Bulandshahr, Bahadurgarh, Ballabgarh, Bhiwadi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Karnal and other north-western towns also recorded a similar poor AQI./""Winds were calm during the evening for the last four to five days. So even though the contribution from crop fires to air pollution isn't as high, air quality has worsened due to lack of dispersion. This will change due to the depression that has developed over the Bay of Bengal. Wind speed will increase and wind direction will change to easterly. We don't expect any adverse pollution events in the next seven days,"" said Vijay Soni, a scientist at the air pollution division of India Meteorological Department (IMD)./Also Read: Monsoon withdrawal delayed till October 20: IMD/Night or minimum temperature is also likely to rise as moisture laden, warmer winds enter the north-western region from Monday, said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC)./""Harvesting has started in Punjab. It will peak next week, when crop fires will also rise. We have been saying for a long time that in the absence of a direct subsidy crop fires will continue because a subsidy on the straw management machinery is not enough for small farmers,"" said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Punjab./According to the Air Quality Early Warning System under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), air quality in the national capital is likely to improve and reach in ""moderate"" category on Monday and Tuesday owing to the change in wind direction./The Supreme Court (SC) in an order dated October 7 had issued notices to the Centre and the north-western states on the issue of stubble burning of crops./The apex court had directed Solicitor-General (S-G) of India Tushar Mehta, who had appeared on behalf of the Centre, to file replies to an application on the issue./The SC has also summoned chief secretaries of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Delhi, Punjab and Haryana on the next date of hearing./Vikrant Tongad, the petitioner before the apex court, had sought to formulate a mechanism, where an incentive of Rs 100 per quintal would be part of the total minimum support price (MSP), which can be withheld until a farmer could assure that there was no stubble fire in his agricultural patch./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Sisodia says Centre, EPCA doing very little to control pollution in north India","India, Oct. 13 -- Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said air pollution across northern India was rising because of stubble burning and accused the Central government of 'completely failing' to implement anti-pollution measures in all states concerned, despite getting ample time to do so./Sisodia also criticised the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca), saying it could not get enough out of the neighbouring states to tackle air pollution, which peaks during winter and plunges Delhi into a public health emergency year after year./Both the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the Epca denied Sisodia's claims./Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Sisodia demanded immediate and concrete steps be taken to check pollution in north India./Sisodia's comments came on a day when Delhi's air quality index (AQI) settled at 300 on Tuesday, just a point short of slipping into the 'very poor' zone -- the worst this season so far./""Smoke from crop burning in the neighbouring states has started showing its effect this time also. The Delhi government has consistently been taking many concrete steps both this year and over the past few years to tackle pollution. But the Central government's concern about pollution is witnessed only for these three months every year,"" Sisodia said./He questioned the role of Epca and asked why it has been ""unsuccessful"" in controlling from other states./""Like those state governments, Epca also seems to failed in controlling pollution. The Central government will have to take the responsibility for preventing pollution throughout northern India. Due to inactivity of the Centre in cases of stubble pollution, smoke from Punjab or Haryana reach Delhi every year,"" he said./Countering Sisodia's allegations, an official spokesperson of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change said, ""The central government believes in working to end pollution and has taken various anti-air pollution initiatives in the last six years. To control stubble burning, machines for stubble cutting worth Rs 1,400 crore have been provided to Punjab and Haryana farmers, which has resulted in a reduction of about 15% and 20% pollution from stubble burning in these states, respectively.""/Bhure Lal, Epca chairperson, responded by saying that the monitoring body has been in touch with the state governments of Punjab and Haryana for nearly a month, ever since the first signs of farm fires were spotted through satellite imagery./""We have been in touch with the governments of Punjab and Haryana and have been taking regular updates of the work that they are doing to keep a check on the stubble burning instances,"" Lal said./The deputy chief minister reiterated that the issue was 'affecting crores of citizens living in North India'. ""The Central government cannot keep sitting idle throughout the year and engage in tokenism when pollution levels increase,"" Sisodia said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Dust bowls drown Delhi in pollution haze,"India, Oct. 13 -- On a day Delhi's air quality index (AQI) plunged to 300, just one point short of slipping into the 'very poor' category, major construction sites were spotted flouting pollution-control norms, enveloping the surrounding areas in clouds of dust, Hindustan Times found during a spot check./Despite directions issued by Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai to agencies and private individuals carrying out construction and demolition activities to follow guidelines or face action, work continued in blatant disregard of the rules and the dust generated, HT found during a visit to major construction sites across the city./On Tuesday, Delhi's overall air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 300, in the poor category, according to Central Pollution Control Board's evening bulletin. Data shows the prominent pollution on Tuesday was PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres), which is primarily dust./Data from the Union ministry of earth sciences' air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), showed that the average PM 10 levels in Delhi touched 239ug/m3. In India, the acceptable mark of PM 10 levels is 100ug/m3./The rules mandate covering of the construction site with nets and 10-metre-thick metal sheets to stop the dust from spreading to neighbouring areas, covering of the construction material in transit and regular sprinkling of water at the spot and on the roads outside./At Mathura Road, where the public works department (PWD) is building a tunnel road to ease traffic, metal barricades placed to separate the worksite were unevenly placed and were not enough to hold the loose dust and construction material from blowing all over the area./The constant movement of fast-moving vehicles on Mathura Road led to a cloud of dust, making matters worse./""From a few metres away, you can see the difference in the air around this area. It is hazy and dust keeps flying around. You cannot keep your window pulled down because of the dust,"" said 38-year-old Meera Mehta, who commutes on Mathura Road every day./The reporter noticed that while the main construction site was covered, the peripheries had mounds of loose soil, concrete waste and debris, which had become a cause of pollution./The nearby Ashram intersection -- one of the busiest roads in the city, where the PWD is constructing the 750-metre underpass that connects the Nizamuddin Railway Bridge -- was no different./The site was covered with metal barricades but the loose soil that was piled up was flying around, becoming a bane for commuters. While parts of the construction site were covered with green sheets, they were barely enough to cover the excavated soil. There were no signs of water sprinklers anywhere at the site./""We have directed all our contractors to ensure that all dust-control measures ordered by the environment ministry are followed. Water is being sprinkled regularly to ensure the dust does not fly around. Since we have a few sites where construction work is going on in full swing, there might have been some slip-ups. But if there are any lapses at any site, we will rectify that,"" said a senior PWD official, on the condition of anonymity./At Bhairon Marg near Pragati Maidan, where India Trade Promotion Organisation's (ITPO) building is being constructed, all dust-control rules went for a toss, with parts of the site along the main road left uncovered and dust flying around./As the excavator dug through the ground, forming knolls of soil, only a torn piece of a green cloth was seen-which lay as an ornamental piece on the side. Most construction sections adjoining Bhairon Marg were not covered with metal barricades./The construction agency, NBCC (India) Limited, did not respond to HT's queries on the measures being taken by them to abide by the Delhi government orders./Rai said the government will take action if rules are violated. ""We are going to be very strict in ensuring that dust-control measures are followed at all construction sites, government or private. If we find that the listed norms are not being followed at any site, we will take stringent action and work will be stopped,"" Rai said./Over the last four days, Rai has been inspecting major construction sites as part of the government's efforts to check dust pollution./During these inspections, big agencies such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have been slapped with hefty fines./An analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a Delhi-based think tank, showed that road dust was the second-largest source of air pollution in Delhi (18-38%), while construction contributed towards 8% of the city's pollution load. However, experts said these two were not mutually exclusive./Siddhartha Gauda, a Bengaluru-based air quality researcher, said uncovered roadside construction activity becomes a primary reason for increased dust or PM 10 levels in an area./""Cement, concrete particles and loose soil not only remain suspended in the air but when they slip onto kerb sides and onto the roads, the movement of vehicles keeps them suspended in the air. Vehicular movement keeps breaking this dust into smaller and more fine particles,"" Gauda said./While these big sites are in the government's radar, in many parts of the city, small-scale, private construction activities are also contributing to localised pollution./In parts of Laxmi Nagar, New Ashok Nagar and Seelampur, local residents and business owners were seen constructing houses or repairing shops./""For over three months, labourers could not be found and now many people are constructing houses or building additional floors or repairing shops. In these narrow roads, how do you expect us to put on metal sheets or cover construction material with nets?"" said Sardar Harinder Singh, a shop owner in east Delhi's Laxmi Nagar./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

IMD's new improved air quality models capture air pollution spike in Delhi,"India, Oct. 15 -- Air quality forecast models for Delhi -- and the rest of India -- have been enhanced, enabling more granular predictions this year with the identification of pollution hotspots in Delhi, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)./October 15 forecasts for the country show PM 2.5 concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 micrograms per cubic metre, much above the level deemed to be safe, in many parts of northwest India and the Indo-Gangetic Plains.. The 24-hour safe standard for PM 2.5, one of the main air pollutants, is 60 micrograms per cubic metres./When it comes to PM 2.5 in Delhi, the entire city seems to be enveloped by concentrations of over 250 micrograms per cubic metres, according to IMD's ENFUSER air quality forecast model launched on Wednesday. But sulphur dioxide hotspots can be easily identified in the model as the concentrations are variable in different parts of the city./""Forecasting is a very important part of emergency action. It helps in doing proactive planning. If there is good science, it certainly helps you refine your strategy. The graded response action plan (GRAP) which is currently in force will greatly benefit from it. If there is hotspot-based data, even vulnerable populations whose health could be impacted by high air pollution can be identified,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./GRAP, is a set of curbs triggered in phases as the air quality deteriorates, which is typical of the October-November period. Farm fires in neighbouring states and cooling weather typically combine at this time of the year to blanket the region in smoke./The air quality forecast model, System for Integrated Modelling of Atmospheric Composition (SILAM), meant for the entire country, has been improved by implementing global emission inventories for coarse and fine particulate matter at 10 km resolution./""Earlier we had 50 km resolution. Plus, we have also added land cover and land use data to obtain a better forecast,"" explained Vijay Soni, a scientist at the air pollution division of IMD./A very high-resolution city scale model has been operationalised for Delhi to identify the air pollution hotspots and pollution up to the street level. The model uses air quality observations, the road network, buildings, land use information, high resolution satellite maps and population data to generate forecasts./The results are being evaluated to capture pollution hotspots in Delhi, Soni said./Now the air quality warning system will also provide forecasts for Lucknow, Kanpur and Varanasi at 2 km resolution. ""For the Delhi model, we are using real time air quality data from ground monitors, traffic congestion data, road network data etc to identify hotspots. We will be able to share this information in our bulletins also,"" he added./The spike in Delhi's current air pollution levels is being attributed to calm conditions in the morning and evening hours and variable winds during the day. Widespread stubble fires are seen on satellite images from both Punjab and Haryana./""Whenever the wind direction is changing to north-westerly, the impact of stubble fires can be felt in Delhi. Plus, there is no dispersion of pollutants due to calm conditions,"" explained Soni./""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi pollution: What AAP government has done so far in 2020,"India, Oct. 15 -- During the 2020 Delhi Assembly election Arvind Kejirwal-led Aam Aadmi Party promised two-third reduction in Delhi's pollution. While the lockdown from March 25 to combat the spread of Covid-19 resulted in some marked difference in the capital city's pollution level, after unlocking, the air quality started worsening and in the last two weeks, it hovered between 'poor' and 'very poor' categories./Here is what the AAP government has done so far to handle the air pollution challenge through their campaign 'Yuddh Pradhushan Ke Virudh' (war against pollution):/1. The Delhi government has launched a 'Green War Room' which will be the centre for collaboration of different agencies that will work together to tackle air pollution./2. Arvind Kejriwal announced the launch of a mobile app called 'Green Delhi' in order to increase public participation and awareness./3. Delhi Pollution Control Committee has banned electricity generator sets of all capacities (diesel, petrol, kerosene) from October 15, except for essential or emergency services. This comes under Graded Response Action Plan, a set of anti-pollution restrictions that include pre-emptive measures to stop the air quality from deteriorating to emergency levels./4. The Delhi government will also be coordinating with the neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab in order to ensure that alternatives to stubble burning are found./5. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also focussing on increasing the green cover in Delhi with a plan called the 'Tree Policy', which will focus not only on preserving the existing tree cover but also on transplantation of new trees in order to increase the green cover./6. To ensure strict adherence to the rules, the Delhi Government has decided to impose heavy fines on those who are found violating the anti-pollution guidelines./7. Okhla Phase II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri have been deemed as pollution hotspots by the Delhi government./8. On Thursday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched a new anti-pollution campaign under which people will be encouraged to switch off the engines of their vehicles off while waiting at traffic signals./People are advised to wear face masks as it helps to protects from Covid-19 and also reduces exposure to air pollution significantly. People must also avoid outdoor exercise during peak pollution hours and children and people aged over 60 must avoid venturing out. Patients with chronic lung diseases must take extra precautions during this time./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi Pollution: Gensets banned, Grap rules kick in","India, Oct. 15 -- The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Wednesday announced a ban on the use of fuel-powered generators from October 15 under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), a set of anti-pollution restrictions that include pre-emptive measures to stop the air quality from deteriorating to emergency levels./On Wednesday, the overall air quality index (AQI) was 276 in the ""poor"" category, an improvement from the previous day's 300. However, a layer of haze hung over the Capital, leading to concerns of an impending bad air crisis like previous years. The AQI hit ""very poor"" on Tuesday morning, and touched 318, the worst level since February this year./""DPCC hereby bans the operation of generator sets of all capacities, run on diesel, petrol or kerosene in Delhi with effect from October 15 till further orders, excluding those used for essential or emergency services,"" an order read./Bhure Lal, chairperson of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), a Supreme Court-appointed body tasked with overseeing the implementation of the pollution control action plan in the National Capital Region (NCR), said that Grap will be enforced ""with no concessions"" to any state./Also Read: Smoggy Delhi struggles to shrug off toxic pollutants/This means that from Thursday, generator sets will not be allowed in Delhi and the neighbouring towns of Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Greater Noida and Faridabad. The only exception to this will be emergency services such as hospitals, elevators, airports, railway and Delhi Metro services./Grap lays down sets of curbs that are enforced when AQI crosses certain thresholds - the most serious of these include a ban on trucks, odd-even road restrictions, curbs on construction work, and an advisory to shut schools./Reminding the states to strictly enforce the genset ban, Lal on Wednesday wrote to the chief secretaries of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, asking them to issue directions to their respective state electricity boards to ensure 24x7 electricity supply to avoid the need for generator sets./""...As you are aware that any deterioration in ambient air quality in the region during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic would have considerable ramifications in terms of health of the residents of Delhi-NCR, sincere efforts must be made to ensure that the ban is effective and monitored rigorously in your area,"" Lal wrote./While Delhi has been enforcing a ban on diesel gensets before the winter season since 2017, last year, the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asked for an extension till October 2020 from Epca to ensure that all power grids are installed in areas that are completely dependent on gensets./On Tuesday, Haryana's additional chief secretary (power department), Trilok C Gupta wrote to the Epca chief, stating that as many as 14,000 residents in Gurugram and Faridabad will be affected by this ban as their residential societies are dependent on generator sets to meet power demands./""They (Haryana) have not asked for an exemption. I responded to their letter asking what they expected from Epca and I have not received any response,"" Lal said on Wednesday. Lal told ANI: ""Epca is not happy with the situation. We waited for one year. ""/Farm fires and emissions from firecrackers during Diwali result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 ultra-fine particles in the air, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs./Responding to Epca directions, DPCC issued its order stating that the ban will be implemented strictly across the Capital. The regional pollution control body directed all concerned agencies to comply with the order and submit a daily action-taken report. Violators will be prosecuted under the Air (Pollution and Control of Pollution) Act, with fines depending on the size of the gensets being used./Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that the ""abject inaction"" of the government in neighbouring Haryana was the prime cause for Delhi's increasing pollution. ""As Grap will come into force from October 15, the use of diesel gensets will be banned in the regions of Delhi-NCR. While Delhi government has dutifully followed the rules set forth by Epca, our neighbours in Haryana don't seem to want to take any action,"" he said./Also Read: Shut down thermal plants in NCR, Delhi tells Centre/Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said there could be challenges in implementing the anti-pollution curbs this year because of restrictions brought on by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. ""We will be working with certain limitations this year. This means, we will have to put into use what we have learnt from the (Covid-19) lockdown and ensure that the winter emergency action plan does not get affected by it,"" Roychowdhury said./""For instance, the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme might not be very easy to implement this time because we need have to ensure social distancing inside public transport systems and because of that buses and the Metro are operating with limited passengers. Unless we provide a viable public transport option for people, we cannot push private vehicles off the road.""/According to Grap, which was first implemented in 2017 through Epca, if the air quality continues to be in the ""severe"" category for 48 hours, measures such as traffic rationing and a ban on the entry of trucks are brought into force. Industries running on coal are also asked to cease operations. In previous years, schools in NCR have been forced to be close due to dramatic rise in air pollution, with people, especially the elderly and young children, being asked not to go out./The Epca chairperson conceded that there will be challenges this year. ""This does not mean we sit back and let pollution levels rise. This only means that we will have to increase monitoring and action on the ground so that the pollution levels do not rise to the levels where we have the need to take these measures,"" Lal said./A senior Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) official said on condition of anonymity: ""Last year, the CPCB in its list of suggestions had proposed that private firms should introduce measures such as allowing employees to work from home and introduce staggered timings; then it seemed like an unattainable task, but now we are all used to this set-up. Schools are also getting used to the online classes, so if need be, they can be asked to continue with it,"" the official said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Covid-19 deaths fuelled by 'perfect storm' of chronic illnesses: Study,"India, Oct. 16 -- The interaction of Covid-19 with the continued global rise in chronic illnesses and related risk factors such as obesity, high blood sugar and outdoor air pollution over the past 30 years has created a perfect storm, fuelling virus-related deaths in India and elsewhere, a new global study published on Friday says./The latest findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study published in The Lancet provide new insights on how well countries were prepared in terms of underlying health for the Covid-19 pandemic, and set out the scale of the challenge to protect against new pandemic threats./The study's key findings on India include the country gaining more than a decade of life expectancy since 1990, rising from 59.6 years to 70.8 years in 2019, but there are wide inequalities between states, ranging from 77.3 years in Kerala to 66.9 years in Uttar Pradesh./The increase in healthy life expectancy in India (60.5 years in 2019) has not been as dramatic as the growth of life expectancy, so people are living more years with illness and disability, it says./The largest contributors to increasing health loss in India over the last 30 years, it adds, were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, stroke, and a group of musculoskeletal disorders./The study says: ""In 2019, the top-5 risk factors for death in India were air pollution (contributing to an estimated 1.67 million deaths), high blood pressure (1.47 million), tobacco use (1.23 million), poor diet (1.18 million), and high blood sugar (1.12 million)""./""Since 1990, India has made substantial gains in health, but child and maternal malnutrition is still the number-one risk factor for illness and death in India, contributing to more than 20% of the total disease burden in several states in northern India (Bihar and Uttar Pradesh)""./""High blood pressure is the third leading risk factor (after air pollution), responsible for 10-20% of all health loss in eight states in India, primarily in the south"", it adds./According to the study authors, the promise of disease prevention through government actions or incentives that enable healthier behaviours and access to health-care resources is not being realised around the world./""Most of these risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits. We are failing to change unhealthy behaviours, particularly those related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and behavioural research"", says Christopher Murray of the University of Washington, who led the research./Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, adds: ""The syndemic nature of the threat we face demands that we not only treat each affliction, but also urgently address the underlying social inequalities that shape them-poverty, housing, education, and race, which are all powerful determinants of health.""/""Covid-19 is an acute-on-chronic health emergency. And the chronicity of the present crisis is being ignored at our future peril. Non-communicable diseases have played a critical role in driving the more than 1 million deaths caused by Covid-19 to date, and will continue to shape health in every country after the pandemic subsides.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Farm fires increase in Punjab, Haryana despite assurances","India, Oct. 16 -- This year, the stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has gone unabated primarily because of the reluctance of the local administration to act against offenders due to ongoing farmer protests in the two states./The result: Delhi and its neighbouring areas are grappling with deteriorating air quality that could aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic in the region, officials said./On Thursday, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh claimed that Delhi's air pollution problem was because of local factors, but data from the Punjab University's Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, shows a three-fold spike in stubble burning incidents in Punjab as compared to 2019 (3,996 incidents from September 21 to October 15 as compared 1,266 in same period last year), with just six farmers booked for farm fires. These numbers are higher than the India Meteorological Department's own, but are directionally similar -- that too points to a three-fold increase in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana this harvest season./Haryana has done slightly better that Punjab with 71% more stubble burning incidents for same period. According to Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), until October 15, 1,835 active fire locations (AFL) were reported from the state against 1,072 during the same period last year./Officials in the two states also said on condition of anonymity said stubble burning started at the time farmer bodies were protesting against three farm bills approved in the winter session of Parliament and any action against the stubble burners could have aggravated the situation on the ground./Also Read: AAP, BJP trade charges over farm fires, pollution/""We have to act with caution as tempers were high,"" explained a Punjab government official, when asked that why not many farmers were booked for stubble burning. A Haryana government official added that there was reluctance to act against the farmers as it could have added ""fuel"" to the farmers' ongoing agitation./Farmers burn paddy stubble to clear the fields for sowing of winter wheat crop, 90% of which is procured by the government to sustain the Public Distribution System (PDS). The fires send fumes into air causing massive pollution across the entire northern plains./Also Read| Residue to riches: Stubble no trouble for Punjab's change agents/Almost all of south Punjab, which includes districts such as Bathinda, Mansa and Fazilka, and Haryana's Rohtak, Sonepat and Panipat districts, abutting Delhi, showed a spurt in farm fires on the fire map of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration ./According to air pollution experts, the north easterly winds brings pollutants from farm fires in the two states and smoke, which mix with local emissions causing a spike in pollution levels in the National Capital Region. ""We are seeing a spurt as local emission load in area within a 70 km radius of Delhi is also very high,"" said an air pollution scientist at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, who asked not to be named. He added that the stubble burning has resulted in an increase in pollution levels across northern plains./On Friday, several NCR towns such as Baghpat, Rohtak, Faridabad, and Gurugram reported poor to very poor air quality. This was actually a marginal improvement from Thursday, as wind speed improved helping in quicker dispersal of pollutants. Delhi has been in the poor or very poor category for the past week./There are several reasons for the spurt in farm fires this year./The paddy harvest season this year in the two food bowl states of India started earlier than in 2019 because of long dry period that started in early September. Last year, the monsoon rains lashed the northern plains till October 15 delaying the peak harvest season to the first week of October. This year, harvest started from September 18 and procurement from September 26./Paddy procurement commenced in Punjab and Haryana from September 26 due to early arrival of the crop, while in other states, it started from October 1, said a food ministry statement. Until Thursday 4.358 million tonnes of paddy had arrived in the markets of Punjab, exactly double of the last year's corresponding arrivals In Haryana also, the paddy procurement is double of last year./The early harvest resulted in an early spike in farm fires. According to Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) the period from September 21 to October 5, saw a five-time increase in farm fires as compared to 2019. Haryana reported double the number of farm fires for same period./S Narayanan, member secretary Haryana State Pollution Control Board said the rise in farm fires was because of early harvest. ""We have issued advisories to district collectors to take action against offenders,"" he said./Punjab pollution board member secretary Krunesh Garg said that it is too early to reach a conclusion even though the present scenario was worrisome. ""I am sure the current season will end with fewer number of cases as compared to previous year,"" he said, adding that over 50,000 cases of stubble fires were reported from the state in the last two years./The reluctance of the two states to act against farmers shows in the number of those booked for stubble burning this year. In Punjab, only six farmers have been booked against 1,706 booked in 2019. According to officials, environment cess of Rs 21 lakh has been collected from 806 farmers as compared to 14,200 on whom this penalty was imposed last year. ""Police is not taking any chances especially when farm bodies are agitating in state over new farm laws enacted in the Parliament last month,"" said a senior agriculture department official./In Haryana, the number of farmers booked this year is about 60% less than last year. Even as 374 incidents of farm fires were reported from Karnal district, only two FIRs have been registered and around 30 farmers have been fined for Rs 68000./Local officials also said as ground level functionaries were busy in procurement of the record paddy harvest in the two states, the monitoring of farm fires was poor. Agriculture and revenue department officials are deployed to check farm fires but this year because of record harvest they were posted for quick procurement. ""Farmers were protesting and procurement was becoming a political issue,"" said a Haryana agriculture department official, pointing at farmer protest in Kurukshetra over delay in paddy procurement./But, then some farmers also cleared their fields quickly for growing vegetables which are fetching a good price in retail markets./""The increase in the prices of vegetables in retail markets have lured the farmers to burn the crop waste and prepare the fields to grow vegetables such as potato, cauliflower, reddish, peas and carrot,"" said Rajiv Kumar, a farmer from Haryana's Shahsbad./A farmer of Punjab's Bathinda district, Paramjit Singh, said he has already cleared farms to grow cabbage, which is fetching a good price in the market. The price of cauliflower in Delhi's Azadpur market on Friday was between Rs 30 to Rs 60 per kilogram and for potato it was between Rs 17 to Rs 40 per kilogram, about 40% higher than the price in the same period last year./However, officials in two states claimed that subsidised machines were provided to farmers for stubble management./Garg said the farmers were using machines supplied by the government for crop residue management to clear stubble and said the impact would be visible in the coming days. Punjab's former secretary agriculture Kahan Singh Pannu, said 23,500 machines were supplied to the farmers this season out of which 15,000 are super seeders. ""With this machine crop residue management would become very easy,"" said Pannu who retired on August 31, after working on stubble management since 2010./But some officials admitted that only big farmers were getting benefit of the subsdised machines. ""Providing subsidised implements will not help as most of the subsidies are being taken by the big farmers and the benefit does not reach small farmers. The government must reach out to small farmers who are around 80% (of all farmers),"" said a senior official of Haryana agriculture department, requesting anonymity./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Chanakya: The politics of Delhi's air pollution,"India, Oct. 17 -- It seems only apt that a column that usually restricts itself to politics, digressing occasionally into related areas such as economic affairs and foreign policy, focus on Delhi's bad air problem, which surfaces around this time every year. For, while the factors responsible for it may be meteorological, economic, and scientific, the reason it remains unsolved is entirely political./Delhi is unfortunately located from the perspective of air quality - at the foot of the hills and the head of the northern plains, and on the eastern periphery of a desert. The lower temperatures and non-existent winds of late autumn and early winter do not help./Then, there are the human interventions./Entire ranges of the Aravallis, which shielded Delhi from the dust and sand-laden winds from the Thar, have been ravaged by mining. There are far too many vehicles in Delhi - more than in all the other metropolitan cities in the country taken together. For two decades now, Delhi and other parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) have been one extended construction zone - thanks to the Delhi Metro (which helps in other ways by taking vehicles off roads), and the emergence of Gurugram, and to a lesser extent, Faridabad, Noida, and Indirapuram. Despite a late-1990s court order that moved industries out of Delhi, some continue to operate within it illegally. And like every other urban agglomeration in India, Delhi has a garbage (and a garbage burning) problem./The bottom line of all this is that the air quality in Delhi is bad - unless the meteorological conditions are favourable, as they usually are through some part of the summer and the monsoon (when Delhi's air is actually the cleanest). Chanakya is aware that some baseline studies on air quality have been done during the lockdown enforced to slow the coronavirus disease, but a real baseline would have to factor in activities and mobility, not assume that all vehicles and people will be off the streets. And at this time of the year, helped along by farm fires, mostly in Punjab, but also in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and the weather, the Capital and the NCR's bad air becomes worse. Which is when everyone starts to take note./Solutions to complex problems such as Delhi's bad air are always temporally-tiered. There are some that are short-term; others that are medium-term; and still others that are long-term. It's also possible to categorise them as scientific, economic, or behavioural. And clearly, since it isn't possible to change Delhi's location (or the Thar's), or influence the weather in any meaningful way, it's not very difficult to figure out what needs doing./The three easiest things to do, which will also have an immediate impact on air quality, are the following - stopping farm fires; preventing the burning of garbage; and prohibiting the use of diesel generators, not just in Delhi, but the entire NCR (an exception is made almost every year for Haryana, many of whose environmentally unfriendly glass-and-chrome condominiums survive on diesel generators). Doing this will ensure the region's air quality remains bad, and doesn't become worse. In the language everyone has come to understand now, addressing these three issues is akin to removing co-morbidities./The long-term cure to the original problem involves de-desertification, re-greening and re-wilding of the Aravallis; the move to greener fuel for vehicles; better garbage management; and moving polluting industries out./The reasons why a solution hasn't been found yet are purely political./The Centre and Haryana (and Uttar Pradesh) are governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party; Delhi by the Aam Aadmi Party; and Punjab by the Congress. And so, the Union environment ministry has shown itself to be far more interested in laying the blame at the Delhi government's door than finding a solution; Delhi blames Punjab, Haryana, and the Centre; and both Punjab and Haryana (more the former than the latter) have not managed to ensure their farmers do not burn the post-harvest stubble ahead of the next cropping season./As this paper reported on Saturday, Punjab has seen almost 4,000 stubble burning incidents this year (till October 15) as compared to 1,266 in the same period a year ago. For Haryana, the numbers are around 1,800 and 1,072. And only six farmers have been booked in Punjab this year, as compared to around 1700 last year - because officials usually involved in monitoring the fires were busy in crop procurement; and because the government didn't want to act against farmers already upset at the new farm laws passed by the Centre./The pattern is no different than it was in previous years. Local governments flout National Green Tribunal and Supreme Court (SC) orders with impunity, and Delhi and the NCR suffer./Chanakya is against judicial overreach into the domain of the executive, but because the latter has been found wanting in terms of willingness, ability, or both to address the air pollution issue, it is good that the SC has appointed former SC judge Madan Lokur in a role that makes him the NCR's unofficial Air Commissioner. The immediate task before him is to stop the farm fires, but there's a lot more he can do - from ensuring real-time monitoring of the contributors to Delhi's bad air to addressing the reason why Punjab's farmers are compelled to burn stubble. There are scientific, economic, behavioural and administrative solutions to the NCR's pollution problem and with politics out of the way, we may finally be able to breathe easy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi struggles to control garbage burning,"India, Oct. 18 -- Every winter, residents of Kirari in northwest Delhi wake up to a think blanket of smoke enveloping the entire area. It is mostly because of open burning of piles of waste every evening./This year too, complaints have already started pouring in and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has slapped the North Delhi Municipal Corporation with a fine of Rs 1 crore for its failure to control these fires, which are one of the major local contributors to air pollution in Delhi./""During a surprise inspection we found that the garbage was being burned beside the main road since morning and no official action was taken by the local municipality against the burning,"" said Gopal Rai, Delhi environment minister./Local residents said many open spaces along the main road have become a dumping site for local waste and every now and then someone lights these piles on fire, enveloping the entire area in a grey blanket./Rekha Rani, a resident of Kirari Harijan Colony, said that sometimes the fire rages so wild that the flames and the resultant smoke can be seen from several kilometres away./""You will see garbage dumped in any open space that is available here and every other day you find it lit up. During winters, eyes start burning and it becomes difficult to breathe,"" Rani said./Experts have also pointed out that as Delhi faces its annual winter air pollution emergency, curbing open waste burning could prove to be proverbial Achilles' heel./Data provided by Delhi Fire Services (DFS) control room shows that between September 15 and October 15, 127 complaints of open waste burning were received from across the city. Officials attending these calls said that some of these fires had turned unmanageable. In fact, over the last ten days five major garbage fires were put off by fire fighters./On Sunday, the DFS received calls about 28 such fires./On October 11, a vacant plot near the Ashram intersection saw a major fire, which took over two hours to control. Similarly, on October 15, a fire was also reported from northeast Delhi's Bhajanpura, DFS officials said./DFS chief, Atul Garg said, ""DFS teams have been actively contributing to pollution control measures in the city. Apart from controlling the frequent garbage fires, our teams have also been sprinkling water on the roadside and open spaces to control dust.""/Kripal Singh Ranawat, a shop owner near Bhajanpura police station, said waste collection and management is a major problem in these areas and some of the privately employed waste collectors often dump waste on road sides and on open plots and set it on fire./""Pillars of flyovers and boundary walls are coated with soot, so if the agencies do not believe us they can see this as proof of how frequently burning happens in these areas,"" Ranawat said./DPCC control room data also shows that over the last 10 days, teams had to intervened at 52 places where open garbage burning was spotted. Officials said that while monitoring teams are on-ground monitoring such burnings, they are also relying heavily on complaints being received from resident welfare associations (RWAs) and the general public./""Our teams are also patrolling areas in the night because waste is usually burnt at night,"" said a senior DPCC official./In Dwarka, residents complained that vacant plots have been turned into dumping grounds and despite repeated complaints to the pollution control agencies and the local municipalities, waste burning continues./""Garbage burning is common in Dwarka and in its surrounding areas. The (Winter) season has begun and the government must set up a 24x7 helpline for reporting garbage burning to control pollution. It normally happens in vacant DDA (Delhi Development Authority) plots,"" Karamvir Anil Parashar, activist and resident of Dwarka tweeted, along with pictures of smoke emanating from garbage fires./Experts agreed that waste management is an area where authorities need to work harder./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said waste management can be tackled with strict enforcement./""Waste burning is an offshoot of the larger problem of waste disposal and management. Agencies will need to step-up action not just during winters but all year long in order to control this,"" said Roychowdhury./A senior official of the north corporation said that the agency is doing its best to control cases of open burning in their areas./""While you can take prompt action against other polluting sources, preventing waste burning is difficult. The action in such a case is taken afterwards when the damage is done. What we can do is douse such fires immediately to prevent any further damage. Complete control can only come with awareness and cooperation from the public,"" the official said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Odd-even last weapon against pollution: Delhi's environment minister Gopal Rai,"India, Oct. 20 -- Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday said the government will implement the odd-even road rationing scheme to curb vehicular emissions as the ""last weapon"" in the fight against air pollution in the national Capital./""We have implemented the odd-even scheme several times in Delhi and it will be our last weapon. Odd-even is also a way to reduce vehicular pollution but right now we are completely focussing on this ('red light on, gaadi off') campaign. If all other programmes don't work, then the government will think about implementing the odd-even scheme,"" Rai said at an event to launch a campaign to urge motorists to turn off engines of their vehicles while waiting at traffic lights./Delhi's air quality has consistently remained in the 'poor' category since October 7, with the AQI remaining over 200. On Monday, Delhi's AQI was measured at 244./Experts also pointed out that since public transport is running with only limited capacity in view of restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the government should step up other measures to ensure that it doesn't have to resort to enforce odd-even./Also Read | 'Disagree with Javadekar': Kejriwal lists steps to tackle air pollution in short time/Bhure Lal, chairperson, Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) said that on-ground enforcement for controlling pollution sources will have to be augmented this time so that emergency measures such as bringing about the odd-even plan can be avoided./""This is surely a different kind of situation that we will be facing this time. The aim should be that the enforcement is so strict this year that the air quality does not slip into the emergency levels,"" Lal said./Delhi has so far implemented the odd-even scheme thrice in sweeping measures to reduce the city's record-high air pollution by limiting the number of cars on streets./After being implemented twice in 2016, the scheme was added to the Supreme Court approved Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) as a measure to be implemented when Delhi's air quality reached the 'emergency' category-PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) are above 300ug/m3 or PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) levels remain 500ug/m3 continuously for 48 hours./Last year, the scheme was enforced between November 4 and November 15./However, researchers and environment experts have been divided on the odd-even scheme's impact on the pollution levels in the national capital./When the policy was first implemented between January 1 and 15, 2016, a study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur, Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, The Energy Research Institute and National Physical Laboratory in Delhi, and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, found that the PM 2.5 levels fell by 4%-6%./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also carried out a study of the two phases in 2016 and concluded that a single factor could not result in substantial reductions in pollution and that an ""integrated approach"" was needed./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic the government will have to look at newer strategies to fight pollution. ""You cannot remove half of a city's vehicles without giving them an alternative public transport option. The Delhi government had plans for bringing in new buses, but a lot of things have been delayed because of the pandemic. The government will have to look for newer ways to keep the pollution levels down in these circumstances,"" she said./All private petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid cars, including those entering the city from other states, are required to be a part of the road rationing drive. Only CNG-fuelled commercial vehicles such as auto-rickshaws, taxis, trucks, buses, tempos and gramin sewas are allowed to ply during the arrangement./Two-wheelers, commercial vehicles, cars driven by women or carrying only women passengers, specially-abled people or school children are exempted from the drive./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Over 100,000 infants in India did not survive a month due to severe air pollution in 2019: Report","India, Oct. 21 -- Over 116,000 infants in India died within a month after their birth due to exposure to severe air pollution in 2019, according to the State of Global Air 2020 report. US-based Health Effects Institute and Global Burden of Disease released the first such report analysing the impact of high air pollution on infant health on Wednesday. The report said that India had the highest burden of infant deaths due to air pollution followed by Nigeria (67,900), Pakistan (56,500), Ethiopia (22,900), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (1,200)./Also Read: India recorded highest air pollution exposure globally in 2019: Report/It is based on a growing body of research and evidence that suggests mothers' exposure to polluted air during pregnancy is linked to increased risks to infants weighing under 2,500 grams at birth or those born before 37 weeks of gestation, as opposed to 38 to 40 weeks. Low weight and premature birth are linked to a higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea, other serious infections as well as brain damage and blood disorders, jaundice that can be potentially fatal./""Although the biological reasons for this linkage are not fully known, it is thought that air pollution may affect a pregnant woman, her developing foetus, or both through pathways similar to those of tobacco smoking, which is a well-known risk factor for low birth weight and preterm birth,"" the report said./Kalpana Balakrishnan, the director of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)'s Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health, said around 116,000 infant deaths can be prevented if air quality is as per the World Health Organisation's standards. ""That is how the attributable burden is identified. But the number seems large because population risks are often not perceivable because they have tiny risk on an individual level. For example, smoking, anaemia or maternal nutrition are all individual risks that can be dealt with on an individual level. But when it comes to air pollution, a very large population is at risk because of high overall exposure. India also has an underlying prevalence of low birth weight which also makes the risk pronounced.""/Balakrishnan said the evidence from over 70 studies, including that of ICMR in India, show that exposures to household and ambient air pollution are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. ""India has a long history of addressing multiple risk factors contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes including maternal nutrition, anaemia, access to antenatal care, to name a few.""/Balakrishnan said the recent evidence shows that air pollution must be included alongside these risk factors to address the burden of low birth weight and preterm births. Clean household energy initiatives offer some strategic near-term opportunities that can be directed at these vulnerable groups, Balakrishnan added. ""Results from on-going randomised control trials In India are expected to strengthen the case for such interventions.""/Balakrishnan said addressing the impacts of air pollution on adverse pregnancy outcomes and newborn health is important for low- and middle-income countries. ""...[it is] not only because of the high prevalence of low birth weight, preterm birth, and child growth deficits but because it allows the design of strategic interventions that can be directed at these vulnerable groups.""/Of all neonatal deaths attributable to air pollution globally, household air pollution accounted for about 64% of them. The rest were due to outdoor air pollution. The highest percentage of deaths attributable to household air pollution (80%) was estimated to be in the sub-Saharan region. The lowest was in high-income regions (less than 2%)./Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in India last year, making air pollution the largest risk factor for deaths among all health risks./Based on experience from the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak between 2002 and 2004, the report said air pollution could lead to both a higher number of Covid-19 infections and deaths./Pallavi Pant, a scientist at Health Effects Institute, said the evidence on the link between air pollution and Covid-19 is rapidly growing. ""It is clear that long-term exposure to air pollution can cause many of the health conditions associated with increased vulnerability to Covid-19 such as diabetes and chronic heart and lung diseases. Evidence increasingly suggests that people living in areas with high air pollution are likely to experience more severe outcomes from Covid 19,"" said Pant. ""Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, India carried a heavy burden of chronic respiratory and other diseases and India has also experienced high exposures for a long time. Exposures to air pollution have been shown to affect the human body's immune defence making an individual more susceptible to respiratory infections such as pneumonia.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India recorded highest air pollution exposure globally in 2019: Report,"India, Oct. 21 -- India recorded the highest annual average PM 2.5 concentration exposure in the world last year, according to the State of Global Air 2020 (SOGA 2020) report released on Wednesday./India was followed by Nepal, Niger, Qatar and Nigeria in high PM 2.5 exposures. This means people in India are exposed to the highest PM 2.5 concentrations globally./Also Read: India must wage an immediate, unified war against pollution/The report also said that India has been recording an increase in PM 2.5 pollution since 2010 contrary to Centre's claims that annual air pollution levels in the country are coming down. Out of the 20 most populous countries, 14 have recorded a gradual improvement in air quality but India, Bangladesh, Niger, Pakistan and Japan are among those that have recorded a modest increase in air pollution levels./SOGA, released by US-based Health Effects Institute and Global Burden of Disease (GBD), uses both data from ground monitors and satellite to make their assessments. To estimate the annual average PM2.5 exposure, or concentrations, GBD scientists link the concentrations in each block (they divide the globe in blocks or grids) with the number of people living within each block to produce a population weighted annual average concentration./Out of 87 health risk factors based on total number of deaths caused in 2019 assessed by the team, air pollution has the fourth highest risk globally preceded by high systolic blood pressure, tobacco and dietary risks. But in India, air pollution is the highest risk factor because of the huge burden of premature deaths it contributes to./India is also among the top ten countries with highest ozone (O3) exposure in 2019. Qatar recorded the highest O3 exposure followed by Nepal and India. Among the 20 most populous countries, India recorded the highest increase (17%) in O3 concentrations in the past ten years./On average, global exposure to ozone increased from about 47.3 parts per billion (ppb) in 2010 to 49.5 ppb in 2019. O3 is a major respiratory irritant which is not released directly into the air but is formed in a complex chemical interaction between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. NOx is emitted from the burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal) in motor vehicles, power plants, industrial boilers, and home heating systems. Volatile organic compounds are also emitted by motor vehicles, as well as by oil and gas extraction and processing and other industrial activities./The only silver lining for India though is that it has managed to reduce the number of people exposed to household air pollution. China reduced the percentage of its population exposed to household air pollution from 54% to 36%, while India reduced its percentage from 73% to 61% over the decade./Since 2010, over 50 million fewer people have been exposed to household air pollution. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG programme and other schemes have helped to dramatically expand access to clean energy, especially for rural households, Health Effects Institute said in a statement./""At this time, the data indicates that there was a modest increase in outdoor PM2.5 levels In India over the last decade. We know from experience elsewhere that the air pollution problem is unlikely to be solved in the short-term. With the National Clean Air Programme and introduction of BS-VI emission standards, India has begun to take steps towards improving air quality and it is critical that the efforts are continued and expanded over the next few years in order to see improvements in air quality. This will require concerted action at both at the national and state and local levels,"" said Pallavi Pant, scientist at Health Effects Institute./""Given the high exposure and staggering health burden of air pollution, India must show urgency and recognise air pollution as a regional-scale problem.

Pollution rising? Warrior moms are here to fight against bad air days,"New Delhi,, Oct. 21 -- ""Come July, and my kids would start wheezing, catch allergies if they are out for too long. Unlike bad water and polluted grounds, the effects of polluted air are not immediately visible. This pandemic has also proven that people who have respiratory issues find it hard to cope with the infection. It's high time we fight for better breathing rights for our future generations,"" says Bhavreen Kandhari, a Delhi-based environmentalist, and mother to twin daughters. She is also a member of Warrior Moms - a pan-India initiative of environmentally conscious mothers who are fighting against air pollution and other environmental issues./There are more than 1,000 women engaging with the team on a pan India scale, with numbers increasing every day. But, why the name Warrior Moms? Kandhari says it's because they are now operating on a war scale, and explains that ""Mothers will go to all ends of the world for the benefit of their children. The name is a reflection of that commitment. I shiver to think as a mother that I'm packing cigarettes instead of lunch boxes in the school bag; the air our child breathes could be equal to smoking up to 20 cigarettes a day! It is a national emergency.""/During the lockdown and even in phases of unlock, the pollution levels reduced drastically, thus allowing Delhi-NCR residents to breathe in peace. ""This is a chance for us to reflect upon the lifestyle choices we make, and also question the government's decisions that have made the air unbreathable prior to lockdown,"" says Anuja Bali Karthikeyan, a Warrior Mom from Pune./Sherebanu Frosh, a Gurugram-based Warrior Mom who is one of the 50 women at the core of this collective, says, ""Coming together and raising voices has always been the only way to make a difference. We felt that if mothers understood the implications of air pollution on their children, they would rise and fight for solutions.""/WHO has pointed out that children, especially below five years, are more vulnerable than ever to the harmful effects of air pollution. Gurugram-based Warrior Mom, Dr Sarika Verma, an ENT surgeon by profession, agrees to this, and says, ""We have taken up this cause because we feel authorities are not effectively dealing with this menace. The number of cases of children who now need nebulisers to breathe properly, has increased manifold in Delhi and nearby areas. But our fight isn't limited to air pollution. We will be championing the cause of waste management, oppose indiscriminate tree felling, and demand cleaner fuel for vehicles among other key issues.""/Talking about the need for appropriate policies to drive a sustained change, Frosh adds that the group is aiming for social media campaigns and conversations with a wider reach. She adds, ""Our mission is to push the change in technologies and policies, which are needed to get to a zero emission and AQI 60, for the sake of our children.""/Author tweets @bhagat_mallika/Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India's PM2.5 levels worst in world in 2019,"India, Oct. 22 -- India recorded the world's highest annual average concentration of PM 2.5 exposure in its air in 2019, according to the State of Global Air 2020 (Soga 2020) report released on Wednesday, extending to a decade the rising streak of the common air pollutant that has emerged as a respiratory health risk in the Capital and other cities./According to the report, India was followed by Nepal, Niger, Qatar and Nigeria in exposure to PM 2.5, which are fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters that are generally 2.5 microns, or about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair./India has been recording an increase in PM 2.5 pollution since 2010, said the report. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s 2019 report indicates that the national average PM 2.5 concentrations has recorded a rising trend in the past three years owing to an increasing number of vehicles on the roads and re-suspension of natural dust./Out of 20 most populous countries, 14 have recorded a gradual improvement in air quality but India, Bangladesh, Niger, Pakistan and Japan are among countries that have recorded at least a modest increase in air pollution levels measured by PM 2.5 content, said the report./The report comes on top of others showing India to be one of the countries with the world's worst air quality. Two-thirds of the most polluted cities, or 21 out of 30, are in India, and Delhi has the worst air among all national capitals, according to the 2019 World Air Quality Report by IQAir AirVisual./Also Read | Over 100,000 infants in India did not survive a month due to severe air pollution in 2019: Report/PM 2.5 pollutants, made up of hundreds of chemicals, are emitted into the air by construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, and smokestacks or fires, and by power plants, factories and automobiles. They can enter the blood stream via the respiratory system to travel throughout the body, causing health problems such as asthma, lung cancer and heart disease./""We need to read the complete report to be able to respond. But we can say that PM 2.5 standards were set only in 2009 following which monitoring began. So, we do not have trends for the entire decade as monitoring has gradually improved. Also, it's not possible to say that the country is seeing a decline or rise in pollution levels. Some cities are improving while some cities are also showing fluctuating trends,"" said a senior CPCB official./Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar has said at various forums that Delhi's air has improved significantly since 2016. He said in the Lok Sabha last year that the government would resolve the toxic air pollution problem in Delhi in less than 15 years - the time Beijing took to stanch a similar problem./""Satellite data of the past 10 to 15 years shows there is an overall increase in air pollution levels. But in the past two years we are seeing a marginal improvement based on satellite data. We are studying what could be the factors leading to this improvement. Is it meteorology or a reduction in emissions also? We may publish a paper on our findings soon,"" said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi./""In India, we do not have India-specific risk function which assesses how much of a risk, say air pollution, poses to developing various diseases. India should now do those long-term studies. The composition of particulate matter also has a huge impact on health... like is it dust or industrial emissions... so health impacts may vary by region. The bottom line is that exposure to PM 2.5 is very high in India."" he added./Dey said the National Clean Air Programme, which aims to reduce the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 (coarse pollution particles) in 102 so-called non-attainment cities by 20% to 30% by 2024 from the 2017 annual average levels, will be crucial./Soga, released by the US-based Health Effects Institute and Global Burden of Disease project, uses both data from ground monitors and satellite data to make its assessments. To estimate the annual average PM2.5 exposure, scientists at the latter link the concentrations in each block (they divide the globe into blocks or grids) with the number of people living within each block to produce a population-weighted annual average concentration./Out of 87 health risk factors assessed by the team based on the total number of deaths caused in 2019, air pollution emerged as the fourth highest risk globally, preceded by high systolic blood pressure, tobacco and dietary risks. But in India, air pollution is the highest risk factor because of the huge burden of premature deaths it contributes to./India is also among the top 10 countries with the highest ozone (O3) exposure in 2019. Qatar recorded the highest O3 exposure followed by Nepal and India. Among the 20 most populous countries, India recorded the highest increase (17%) in O3 concentrations in the past 10 years./On average, global exposure to ozone increased from about 47.3 ppb (parts per billion) in 2010 to 49.5 ppb in 2019. O3 is a major respiratory irritant that is not released directly into the air but is formed in a complex chemical interaction between nitrogen oxide (NOx) and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. NOx is emitted from the burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal) in motor vehicles, power plants, industrial boilers, and home heating systems./The one silver lining for India is that the country managed to reduce the number of people exposed to household air pollution. China reduced the percentage of its population exposed to household air pollution from 54% to 36%, while India reduced its percentage from 73% to 61% over the past decade./Since 2010, more than 50 million fewer people have been exposed to household air pollution. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, under which free cooking gas connections are provided to poor households, and other schemes have helped to dramatically expand access to clean energy, especially in rural areas, the Health Effects Institute said in a statement./""At this time, the data indicates that there was a modest increase in outdoor PM2.5 levels in India over the last decade. We know from experience elsewhere that the air pollution problem is unlikely to be solved in the short-term,"" said Pallavi Pant, a scientist at Health Effects Institute./""With the National Clean Air Programme and introduction of BS-VI (Bharat Stage-VI) emission standards, India has begun to take steps towards improving air quality, and it is critical that the efforts are continued and expanded over the next few years in order to see improvements in air quality,"" she said./TOP 5 countries with highest population weighted annual PM 2.5 exposure (in micrograms per cubic metres):/India 83.2/Nepal 83.1/Niger 80.1/Qatar 76/Nigeria 70.4/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Covid-19: As winter chill hints at a second wave, here's why young people are at more risk, how paracetamol helps and other precautions","India, Oct. 25 -- As per an analysis by the Union health ministry, nearly half the people who have died of Covid-19 are aged below 60 years. Dr Randeep Guleria, Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), recently raised concerns on how the rising air pollution combined with coronavirus infection and lung complications can possibly lead to serious consequences./With Russia and the United Kingdom already experiencing a second wave of Covid-19, aggravated by winter, there is no reason to dismiss the possibility of the same in India as the mercury dips. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned Delhi of witnessing around 15,000 Covid-19 cases daily in winter because of the prevalence of respiratory illnesses during this season that worsen symptoms of the disease./NCDC recommended that festivals like Durga Puja, Dussehra and Chhath be celebrated low key with little or no gathering. Since the vaccine for Covid-19 is likely to become widely available only by mid-2021, it is important to be educated about the correct dosage of medicines, especially paracetamol, for self-medication required to cure common symptoms of fever, cold and body pains in the winter flu season./In an interview with Hindustan Times, Dr Ramakanta Panda, leading cardiovascular thoracic surgeon and VC, Asian Heart Institute revealed, ""Young people more at Covid-19 risk than ever before."" The risk is increased by the fact that healthy, young adult population has started to travel and move about while ignoring basic precautions such as steam inhalation, social distancing, wearing masks and using a hand wash as they perceive that they are not in the Covid -19 risk group./""They may be a-symptomatic and unaware; transmitting the infection rapidly as they move about. They have undiagnosed diabetes and hypertension which is not being treated. Hence, they have a 'latent' risk that they're completely unaware of. This is worse than a 60+ person who is aware of and hence being treated for diabetes and hypertension,"" Dr Panda warned./He said that they are more likely to be ""asymptomatic and unaware; transmitting the infection rapidly as they move about, thus spreading Covid-19 to high risk groups within and outside the family."" Even as asymptomatic, there is a risk of damage to lungs, hearts and other organs and their long term implications are still not clear./""Since diabetes, hypertension and heart disease occur among Indians at a much younger age compared to western population, many young people are not diagnosed or treated. When they catch Covid-19, they will more likely have increased complications as well as difficulty to manage than an elderly person with the same disease but is already on treatment,"" Dr Panda highlighted./Though self-medication is not a recommended practice, when some people do, they do not realise the importance of right dosage and therefore tend to under-dose. In the encroaching winter flu season, dosing appropriately as recommended will help in better symptomatic control within the safety profile of the drug while under-dosing may result in concentrations too low to enable efficacy and show results./Paracetamol is one of the most popular and widely used medicines for the treatment of fever (antipyretic) and pain (analgesic). Dr. AK Gupta, Joint Secretary of Association for Prevention and Control of Rabies in India and Family Physician at New Delhi told HT, ""For an average Indian adult, Paracetamol 650mg is the optimal dose as compared to the 500 mg. It can be safely taken for faster and more effective relief from fever. Under-dosing with 500 mg may lead to delay in fever control and also may require frequent repetition of doses.""/Paracetamol can be taken every four to six hours as necessary, with a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg in any 24 hour period and with a minimum 4-hour dosing interval but taking more pills could lead to overdosing/serious side effects. Dr Gupta added, ""Treatment depends on the cause of your fever. It is therefore important to take the recommended dose for all medications, follow all instructions before taking them and take care of overall health by drinking enough liquids to prevent dehydration and get adequate rest. It is always advisable to consult your doctor to understand the underlying cause of your fever and the recommended treatment for the condition/disease.""/On the other hand, most of the expert studies say that having been cured of coronavirus does not mean that you are infective. Dr Panda shared, ""Most likely the first 2 weeks are infective. Before joining work, depending on the extent of Covid-19 affliction on various parts of body, tests like ESR , CRP, Interleukin, D-Dimer, Lung function test, HRCT lungs and Echocardiography of Heart can be taken. Not everyone needs to get all of them done because Covid-19 is a spectrum disease and the person-to-person outcomes of this disease are so maddeningly variable.""/The winter chill makes people lock the doors and windows of their houses to stay cosy inside which increases the levels of stagnant air. This causes silent injuries inside the body and studies have shown that the incidence of Covid-19 goes up due to stagnant air indoors. Hence, minimizing cross ventilation is not recommended this winter season./Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi marks a dull Dussehra,"India, Oct. 26 -- Dussehra in Delhi was a low-key affair this year, with restrictions in light of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic forcing several Ramlila programmes to shift online and only four organisers permitted to carry on with the effigy-burning ritual, as against 800 small and big ones last year./Senior officials in the Delhi revenue department said that last year, around 800 Ramlila organisers had got permission for the ritual, where effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnad are burnt at open spaces in public view. The height of the effigies can range from a few feet to over a hundred feet./Such events are often marked by gatherings, food courts, fairs and public celebrations across the city, most of which are restricted this year to prevent the further spread of Covid-19./""My greetings to everyone on this day which marks the victory of good over evil. Soon, humanity would stand victorious against the covid-19 demon,"" chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday./Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia thanked residents of the city for keeping celebrations low-key in the light of the pandemic and rising air pollution. He said, ""We must resolve to defeat today's evils - pollution and Covid-19.""/Delhi on Sunday recorded 4,136 new cases of Covid-19, taking the cumulative number of infections to 356,656 - even as 323,654 people have recovered and 6,258 have died of the disease./Some of the prominent Ramlila-Dussehra event committees in the city refrained from organising any programmes this year, so they did not seek any permission from the district administration and the police at any stage. The most prominent of these is the Luv-Kush Ramlila Committee, which organises the event every year in the Red Fort premises - an event attended by VIPs and senior political figures, cutting across party lines./""This is our contribution in ensuring a Covid-free and pollution-free Delhi. We have tried to set an example. Now we shall be campaigning for a firecracker-free Diwali too,"" said Arun Kumar, the committee's general secretary, who met Sisodia at his residence on Sunday, where the committee organised a symbolic celebration./Several other organisers in the city followed suit./""It is unsafe to organise anything that can lead to gatherings, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are performing the temple rituals, but there will be no Ramila and effigy burning,"" said Yogesh Pahuja, office bearer in the resident welfare association in Lajpat Nagar 2, which is one of the prominent Ramlila organisers in the city./Some of them went on to organise laser-light shows and cake-cutting ceremonies instead, with no gatherings./The four organisers who got permission are in Shastri Park, Vinod Nagar, GTB Enclave and Karkardooma, and the size of the permitted effigies in these areas range between 30 and 70 feet. However, the crowd size was limited to 200 in the venues. As a workaround, organisers said they would stream the event live on their Facebook pages./""We have installed sanitiser dispensers at the gates, and all visitors will be thermally scanned. This year, we will burn four effigies. The fourth one will represent the coronavirus,"" said Hareesh Chaudhary of Vishnu Avatar Ramlila in Shastri Park./Another revenue department official said that around 50 organisers in the city sought permission to burn effigies around a fortnight ago, but were not issued no-objection certificates (NOC) owing to safety reasons./In the last one month, a lot has gone into convincing these organisers for giving up on plans for the festivities this year, government officials said./""In one district alone, we have engaged with around 600 temple committees who participate in the Dussehra festivities. We communicated the problems that any potentially large gathering could entail. People have to be more cautious during the festive season"", said Neha Bansal, district magistrate (West Delhi)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mercury set to dip this week as winter sets in,"India, Oct. 27 -- Night and day temperatures are likely to fall over the next seven days in northwest India, including in the national capital, as winter conditions set in and due to a feeble western disturbance that led to snowfall in the upper reaches of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, from where colder winds are forecast to enter the northern plains, weather scientists said./According to the forecast by the India Meteorological Department's regional meteorological centre, Delhi, the weather will largely remain dry, and there will be a gradual decline in maximum and minimum temperatures by 2deg-3deg C in the next three to four days./Delhi has been recording below normal night time temperatures for at least a week now./The city recorded a minimum temperature of 15 degree Celsius, two degrees below normal on early Monday morning, and this is likely to dip as the month of November approaches./On Sunday, the minimum temperature in Delhi was only 13.8 degree C, three degrees below normal. It was also the lowest for the month of October since 2009, when 13.5 degree C was recorded./The lowest-ever temperature recorded in October was 9.4 degree C on October 31, 1937./""As we approach November, minimum temperature starts falling. The sky is clear now [less cloud cover] so the heat radiates back at night [leading to a cooling effect]. There was snowfall in the higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh on Sunday and Monday... northwesterly winds blowing from the direction of Himalayas bringing cold air but wind speed is low. We will see a fall in temperatures across northwest India,"" said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre./""For nearly a fortnight, Delhi has been recording minimum temperatures that are at least 1 to 2 degree C below normal. On October 26 and 27, the normal minimum temperature expected is 16.7 degree C and after than 15.9 degree C till November 1. But we expect minimum temperatures to be around 13 to 14 degree C,"" Shrivastava added./""There is smoke in the air which is why there are haze-like conditions during the day time.Wind direction will continue to remain northwesterly but there may be some improvement in wind speed Tuesday onwards,"" he said, referring to the air pollution levels in the capital city./Air quality in most parts of northwest India including Delhi, Faridabad, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Bhiwadi, Bulandshahr remained in the 'very poor' category air on Monday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Central law in works to curb air pollution,"India, Oct. 27 -- The Union government will bring in a new law for a permanent authority to oversee matters relating to air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday, prompting the judges to suspend an order that authorised former top court judge Madan Lokur to tackle the issue./Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the new authority will have a statutory role and have members from all states that contribute to the pollution problem in NCR, assuring the bench that a draft of the law will be shared in four days./""The Centre has taken a holistic view of the matter and found that several ad hoc measures taken in the past have not achieved any results. Now a comprehensive law is being planned with a permanent body having participation of neighbouring states,"" he said./The submission came on a day when farm fires in Punjab and Haryana hit a new peak and the Capital's air quality index (AQI) continued to linger in the ""very poor"" category for the fourth consecutive day, threatening to plunge into the ""severe"" zone as it has inevitably done at this time of the year for every year since 2016./Mehta indicated the new law is likely to be brought in as an ordinance and, while he did not give more details, a top environment ministry official told HT it will focus on the Delhi-NCR region./""I will not share any details of the law or what penalties are involved but this is a comprehensive law focused only on the Delhi-NCR region to curb the air pollution menace here from various sources. It is not an amendment of existing laws,"" said RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry./The solicitor general also repeated a request for the top court to suspend an October 16 order designating retired justice Lokur to oversee the farm fire problem, claiming there could be points of conflict between the new authority and the former judge's single-member panel./Farmland fires contribute heavily to the annual air pollution crisis. Smoke from smouldering paddy fields, which are set alight as a way to prepare for sowing the next crop, rises up and settles over much of north and northwest India. Coupled with local emissions and dust, it has in recent years turned cities into what the Supreme Court once described as gas chambers./The top court accepted the Centre's request till the next date of hearing. ""People are choking in this city. This is something that the government should have curbed and not a matter to be decided in a public interest litigation (PIL). We will welcome your decision if it is appropriate,"" said chief justice SA Bobde, who headed a bench that also comprised AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian./Senior advocate Harish Salve, who has been assisting the SC on environment-related issues, supported the Centre's stand. ""Attempts made by the Court in the past are not working out. Union government may require to write to states to take effective steps [to curb stubble burning],"" Salve said.The lawyer of the petitioner whose plea triggered the hearing had opposed the decision to put the October 16 order ""in abeyance"". ""For this year, justice Lokur Committee should continue. The law can be made operational from next year. On Thursday, the stubble burning cases in the MC Mehta case are listed. By then, justice Lokur's report will also be ready,"" said Vikas Singh. The October 16 order required the Lokur Committee to submit periodic reports. It was Singh who had suggested appointing an expert committee led by justice Lokur, who has past experience in hearing matters related to stubble burning and Delhi's pollution./Experts said that while the Union government has the constitutional right to bring in a law since environment is a central subject, its implementation will need focus. ""Though I have not seen the draft and heard only what solicitor general said in the Supreme Court, I believe such a law could be binding on state governments. But orders by the authority to be created under the law would have to be implemented by the state government. In the past, we have seen statutory orders under the Air Act by CPCB were also not implemented by state governments. So, the question would remain that what action Centre can take if the state fails to follow the directions,"" said Vijay Panjwani, former counsel for Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in the Supreme Court./Environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta too said the focus should be on enforcing existing mechanisms instead of creating new ones. ""Air pollution has been an issue for a fairly long time. Why do you need an ordinance now? The Centre has powers to issue directions under Section 5 of the environment protection act. Why is this coming in the pre-pollution season? It's a distraction as drafting a law will take time,"" he said. Dutta added that the new law will also create multiple authorities./A third expert said the new law and the mechanism will need to look beyond NCR. ""What we need is legal compliance and deterrence strategy for the entire country. The Graded Response Action Plan and the comprehensive action plan are both notified under the environment protection act. There is no dearth of power under the law. The question is of adherence,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'17% Covid deaths linked to pollution',"New Delhi,, Oct. 28 -- Around 17% of deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India could be linked to long-term exposure to air pollution, higher than the 15% seen on average across the world, according to a study published in the journal Cardiovascular Research on Tuesday./The analysis was based on study of air quality data and distribution of fatalities across the world till the third week of June, which the researchers used to calculate a Covid-19 mortality rate attributable to pollution. The highest proportion of these was in Czech Republic (29%), Poland (28%), and China (27%)./In terms of global regions, East Asia had the highest proportion of such deaths at 27%, followed by Central Europe and America where nearly 25% of the deaths in each of the regions were attributed to air pollution by the study./The authors say that these are proportion of deaths that could have been avoided if the populations had been exposed to lower levels of air pollution. ""...Attributable fraction does not imply a direct cause-effect relationship between air pollution and Covid-19 mortality (although it is possible). Instead it refers to relationships between two, direct and indirect, i.e. by aggravating co-morbidities [other health conditions] that could lead to fatal health outcomes of the virus infection.""/""When people inhale polluted air, the very small polluting particles, the PM2.5, migrate from the lungs to the blood and blood vessels, causing inflammation and severe oxidative stress... This causes damage to the inner lining of arteries, the endothelium, and leads to the narrowing and stiffening of the arteries. The Covid-19 virus also enters the body via the lungs, causing similar damage to blood vessels, and it is now considered to be an endothelial disease,"" said Professor Thomas Munzel one of the authors of the paper from the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany in a release./In India, experts have warned of air pollution leading to such outcomes, Covid-19 infections severe./""This will be the first winter we will see Covid-19 in India, we still do not know how it will play out. However, like every other year, we will see an aggravation of symptoms in people with existing respiratory or cardiovascular diseases with the dip in temperature and increase in pollution levels. And, a person with compromised lung function is much more likely to have a severe course of Covid-19 infection as compared to a healthy person,"" said Dr Anant Mohan, head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

UP's new ordinance to check air pollution covers state's most industrialised districts,"India, Oct. 30 -- Industrialists in Uttar Pradesh's six most industrialised and highest revenue-generating districts - that are part of the National Capital Region (NCR) - on Thursday said they wanted subsidised piped natural gas (PNG), instead of coal and wood, for their units to check air pollution./They said PNG was already being supplied to industrial units near Taj in Agra and Firozabad district. Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida), Bulandshahr, Hapur and Baghpat districts of UP are part of the NCR which now falls under the ambit of 'Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020'./After promulgation of the new ordinance by the Centre to check air pollution in NCR, industrialists of Uttar Pradesh's NCR want the state government to make sure there will be no harassment of industrialists./The ordinance stipulates a fine of up to Rs 1 crore with imprisonment of five years./""The state government must make available subsidised PNG to all industrial units in the state's NCR. The government is already doing this for industrial units in Agra and Firozabad districts,"" said Pankaj Kumar, national president of Indian Industries Association (IIA), a lobby group of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector./""We will soon hand over a memorandum to chief minister Yogi Adityanath with the list of suggestions for industrial units in the NCR,"" added Kumar./A majority of UP's industrial units are in Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), Ghaziabad and Meerut, which are considered maximum revenue and employment generators for the Uttar Pradesh government. Maximum investment in Uttar Pradesh is also in Noida and its adjoining regions./Smoke emanating from boilers of industrial units is considered among major air-polluting factors in the NCR along with burning of stubble.

Farm fires harming Punjab more than Delhi: PAU study,"India, Oct. 30 -- Stubble burning in Punjab is a localised problem and doesn't add to air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), rather farmers are choking their own children and brethren by setting the fields on fire, finds a study by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU)./The study says that the south-easterly direction of wind is highly unlikely to affect the air quality in the neighbouring states of Haryana and New Delhi./The study says that the detailed analysis of wind speed done over three years shows that fall in temperature in October and November reduce the formation of air currents./""So, a stable atmosphere is created in which only little vertical movement of air current occurs and horizontal transport of air is also reduced,"" says the head of the department of climate change and agriculture meteorology of PAU, Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, who has compiled the study./LOW WIND SPEED, DIP IN TEMPERATURE CREATES CLOSED-ROOM SITUATION/She, along with her team, has analysed the data of three years from 2017 to 2019 to conclude that the low wind speed and dip in temperature lead to a closed-room situation in which hardly anything enters or goes out./She observed that only once, the wind speed exceeded 5km per hour (6.11 per hour) and ""the wind direction was towards the south east (opposite Delhi)""./""Every paddy-growing state is suffering from factors adding to its air pollution. In simple terms, Punjab's smoke is not travelling 300-400 km to choke the lungs of Delhi, rather Punjab farmers are harming their own children and brethren by setting the fields on fire,"" said Sidhu./FIRECRACKERS AROUND DIWALI WORSEN THE PROBLEM/She said firecrackers around Diwali worsen the problem. While quoting the data of previous three years, she said smog was witnessed for 12 days till now this year, 10 days in 2019 and 11 days in 2018./She said the number of smog days may increase this year as the incidence of stubble burning was relatively high./The PAU finding is the second such study that claims Punjab farm fires are not contributing to Delhi's pollution. In 2018, a joint study by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, and Punjab Pollution Control Board had concluded that a significant contribution to Delhi's air pollution was from within the NCR or Uttar Pradesh./However, the PAU's study has been criticised by local environmentalists, who says such studies could encourage more fire fires./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

However, the middle and upper middle class people who weren't stepping out of their homes due to the lockdown remained safe. Now, with people joining back at offices and going out to restaurants and pubs has led to them getting infected,"" said Dr Mishra./Delhi health minister agreed, adding that this was one of the reasons private hospitals were running out of beds./""The issue is that many people want to go to private hospitals. People who come from outside Delhi already have a particular hospital in mind. The other reason is that the number of cases now being recorded are mainly in middle and upper middle class. Earlier when the cases came it was from the congested areas. These are people who go to the private hospitals, they can afford it, or many have insurance. However, we have the same facilities in government hospitals as well,"" said Jain./Currently, 44.7% of the total beds and 71.1% of the ICU beds are occupied./Private hospitals bear a higher burden of the disease, with 60.2% of the total beds and 79.8% of the ICU beds being occupied./Experts consider the spread of the infection to be in control when the positivity rate remains at 5% or less over two weeks/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Harvard study establishes bad air, Covid-19 mortality rate link","India, Nov. 6 -- An increase of 1ug/m3 in average PM2.5 exposure raised the mortality rate of Covid-19 by roughly 11%, a group of Harvard University researchers have found, the latest in a series of studies that underscore the double whammy faced by people in polluted parts of the world during the pandemic./The latest study is by a team of researchers in Harvard University who carried out a statistical analysis of coronavirus disease mortality rates across the 3,089 counties in United States and compared it with the long -term exposure people in these regions had of ultra-fine PM2.5 particles./""We found that an increase of 1 ug/m3 in the long-term average PM2.5 s is associated with a statistically significant 11% increase in the county's Covid-19 mortality rate,"" said the authors in their report, published in Science Advances on Wednesday./The analysis takes into account average PM2.5 exposure between 2000 and 2016 and Covid-19 mortality up till June 18. The findings are significant for a country like India where people are exposed to the highest annual average concentrations of PM2.5 in the world./According to the State of Global Air 2020 report published in October, the average Indian was exposed to 83.2ug/m3 of PM2.5 in 2019. For the average American, this number was less than a tenth at 7.66. At 11am on Thursday, the average hourly PM2.5 concentration across the 34 pollution monitors in Delhi stood at 360ug/m3. India's Capital is currently seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases./Air pollution causes a wide variety of health effects, some of the worst of which is due to the effects on an organ that Covid-19 too targets: the lungs. Some of these are shortened life expectancy, increased inflammation and tendency to develop clots, and greater susceptibility to breathing problems such as asthma, noted a separate research paper by researchers from University of Catania, Italy./The implication of increased air pollution on Covid-19 outcomes was first reported from Italy. ""Our data show a significant relationship between mean PM 2.5 concentration during February 2020, one month before the beginning of the outbreak, and the number of Covid-19 cases per region (updated to March 31st), confirming how more polluted areas are the ones where the contagion is more widespread,"" said the authors From the University of Catania in their August, 2020 update to their paper first published in April./""More significantly patients in polluted areas present with more severe forms of the disease requiring ICU. Mortality is two-fold higher than the other regions despite similar rates of ICU admission,"" they added./This is now backed by the statistical analysis of the American counties and their Covid-19 outbreaks. The Harvard University researchers used a method known as regression analysis to zero-in on possible factors that raised chances of Covid-19 mortality./Exposure to PM2.5 appeared to be the most prominent. ""We also found that population density, days since the first Covid-19 case was reported, median household income, percent of owner-occupied housing, percent of the adult population with less than high school education, age distribution, and percent of Black residents are important predictors of the Covid-19 mortality rate in the model,"" they added./The authors, however, add that their analysis is limited by lack of access to ""individual-level risk factors"" such as age, race, and smoking status, which can have an impact on the Covid-19 mortality rate./But, they add, an ecological regression analysis could help point research into the direction of different biological factors that can be at play. ""For example, it has been hypothesized that chronic exposure to PM2.5 causes alveolar angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor over expression and impairs host defenses. This could cause a more severe form of Covid-19 in ACE-2-depleted lungs, increasing the likelihood of poor outcomes, including death,"" they said./At the least, the authors add, such research could also provide a ""strong scientific argument"" for revision of ambient air quality standards and other environmental policies in the midst of a pandemic./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi vendors request govt to permit sale of green crackers till Diwali,"India, Nov. 6 -- The vendors in Delhi on Friday requested the government to permit the sale of green crackers till Diwali, after it banned the use of all firecrackers till November 30, as air pollution in the national capital soared to its worst level in a year./""Due to the sudden ban, we have to face losses of approximately Rs 15-20 lakhs. Earlier, the government said green cracker can be sold and gave us licence. We had already purchased the stock,"" said a vendor, according to news agency ANI./On Thursday, the average air quality index (AQI) was in the ""severe"" zone for the first time this season, just over a week before Diwali, a festival during which the use of illegal firecrackers in the past has led to the crisis spiralling out of control. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, the average AQI for the 24-hour period since Wednesday was 450. The day before, it was 343. Air quality is considered ""good"" when AQI is lower than 50./Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic was deteriorating in the Capital due to rising air pollution and appealed to people to avoid using them. ""If we burst firecrackers this Diwali, we are playing with the lives of our children and families..."" he added./""Reviewed corona situation in Del n preparedness wid Chief Secy, Health officials and all DMs. Corona cases hv increased due to festival season n pollution.

State's call for no-cracker Diwali a big blow for stall owners,"Pune,, Nov. 8 -- Those selling firecrackers, a business that thrives during the festival of lights, are prepared for tough times. Having set up shops across the city, they are looking at a dip in sale by 50 per cent./The statement by state health minister Rajesh Tope asking people to celebrate Diwali without firecrackers has left the cracker sellers in a fix as they have already being issued non-objection certificate (NOC) by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to put up stalls./""The Covid situation has already hit our business.

BJP leaders demand compensation for firecracker traders,"India, Nov. 9 -- The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) on Sunday demanded that the Delhi government should compensate firecracker traders for the loss incurred by them due to the ban imposed on the sale of all types crackers in view of the rising air pollution in the Capital./Former Union minister Vijay Goel along with BJP leaders and traders' associations held a protest on Sunday at Jama Masjid demanding compensation for the traders./While addressing firecracker traders, Goel said that the decision to ban firecrackers is an attempt by the Delhi government to show that it has been making efforts to curb pollution. ""These traders bought firecrackers stocks only after getting the licence. If the government had to impose the ban, then why did they issue the licence to traders to sell green firecrackers two months back.""/Goel said that they are not opposing the ban but the timing of it. ""Why the sale of firecrackers was not banned six months ago? The government has banned it now as it wants to show that it has taken some measures to curb pollution.""/The BJP said that the government's sudden decision to ban the sale of firecrackers has hit the traders really hard, as they have already been suffering losses due to the coronavirus disease pandemic./BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, said, ""The traders purchased huge amounts of the firecrackers by taking loans. Now, with the government's sudden ban on the sale of green firecrackers, these traders have obviously suffered huge losses.""/The BJP questioned the Delhi government about its promises it had made in the green budget. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, ""The people of Delhi would not have been facing the double whammy of pollution and Covid had the government taken timely action. The main reason for the pollution problem today is the failure of the government to implement the 26 promises it made in its green budget about installing smog towers, getting 1,000 electric buses, planting two crore trees, etc,"" Gupta said./The Aam Aadmi Party responded to BJP allegations, saying the saffron party has been playing politics over the crucial issue of air pollution. An AAP spokesperson said, ""Whereas Delhi government is concerned about the health of its citizens, BJP is playing dirty politics on this issue. Most of BJP states have banned firecrackers after first allowing it. What does BJP have to say about that? BJP should stop playing politics over the health of Delhiites.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi chokes on season's most polluted air,"India, Nov. 9 -- Delhi breathed season's worst polluted air on Monday with a heavy layer of pollutants blocking sunlight, causing a thick haze to envelop the city with experts sounding a health emergency for the vulnerable population including the elderly, children and those with comorbidities./The average air quality index in Delhi was recorded at 477 on a scale of 500, the highest since November 3 last year, in the severe zone. This was the fifth consecutive day when Delhi's air was in the severe category. The last time that Delhi had a such a long spell of polluted air in November was in 2016 and 2017, when the air remained in the severe category for six days./However, by late evening, the AQI deteriorated to 500 at five places -- Mundka, Najafgarh, Rohini, Drawrka Sec 8, Punjabi Bagh, according CPCB's Sameer app. The overall AQI in the evening stood at 491./Doctors warned that exposure to such high levels of air pollution continuously over days is linked to higher hospital admissions and people reporting with respiratory and cardiovascular complications./Weather scientists and pollution monitoring agencies have warned that an immediate relief was unlikely as meteorological conditions are not ideal for disperal of pollutants and farm fires are raging in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana./It is, however, unclear if strict measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) such as stopping all construction activities, introducing the odd-even road space rationing scheme, and stopping the entry of trucks into the city completely, will be implemented or not./At 416, the AQI was in the lower-end of the severe category on Sunday./Scientists on Monday said the farm fires from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana are choking the national capital because of calm winds. Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, said the wind speed in Delhi was less than 5 km per hour./""Due to the low wind speed, the smoke and pollutants cannot be dispersed which is why the condition is severe. Wind direction will switch to easterly direction and this will be a transitional phase when winds are usually calm. There may be marginal improvement in air quality on November 12 and 13, but if firecrackers are burst then condition will remain same or worsen,"" he said./Around 5,000 instances of farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana on Monday, contributing 38% of PM 2.5 load in Delhi, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology./Vijay Soni, scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD)'s air quality division, said, ""Around 5,000 instances of farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana contributing to the air quality being in the severe category on Monday. The air quality is likely to be in the severe category till Tuesday. If the winds become easterly tomorrow, then we can expect some improvement. As per our forecast, winds will start blowing from northwest on Tuesday,"" he said./""There is anti-cyclonic wind circulation in the lower levels and subsidence of air in large parts of northwest India presently. Both are linked to slow winds and accumulation of pollutants. We have been seeing a very large number of crop stubble fire points. The combination of these factors is leading to air quality index (AQI) hovering between very poor and severe categories for the past five days,"" explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre./The AQI is likely to be in the upper-end of very poor category on Friday and Saturday before turning severe around Diwali on November 15 and 16, according to ministry of earth sciences./Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Institute of Technology-Delhi, said the spell of polluted air will cause problems to those infected by Covid-19.""This time around, doctors have also pointed out that high pollution levels are bad for Covid-19 transmission as well. However, more than the acute exposure, the health burden is larger for chronic exposure - which refers to the pollution levels that people of Delhi are exposed to all year round. That needs immediate attention,"" he said./He explained that chronic exposure is linked to multiple health outcomes such as heart diseases, stroke, lung cancer, and also Type 2 diabetes, according to some studies./""All these eventually lead to mortality and different morbidities. One way to reduce the chronic burden is to control these pollution peaks. For instance, if we control the October-November pollution peak, we can reduce the annual PM 2.5 exposure by 15-20%,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Need to strictly enforce laws to minimise air pollution': Air quality management panel,"India, Nov. 9 -- As Delhi's air quality remained ""severe"" for the fifth consecutive day on Monday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said there was an immediate need to strictly enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) such as minimising the use of personal transport and restricting unnecessary travel to minimise pollution./""We need to strictly enforce existing laws, guidelines, SOPs to minimize air pollution on an emergency basis and minimise the use of personal transport and restrict travel unless absolutely necessary,"" the commission said, according to news agency PTI./Also Read: To draw a 'balance,' Haryana allows bursting of firecrackers for 2 hours on Diwali/There was also a need to encourage coal-using industries in the National Capital Region (NCR) to minimise the use of coal in the upcoming months, it added./The National Green Tribunal (NGT), in an attempt to stop the region's air quality from falling further, has imposed a total ban on the sale or use of firecrackers in the NCR from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight.

"Shrouded in haze, Delhi gasps for breath","India, Nov. 9 -- A veil of haze hanged over most parts of the city throughout Sunday as Delhi continued to receive a heavy load of pollutants from farm fires raging in the neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, turning the city's air into a toxic cocktail of ultrafine microscopic particles and gaseous emissions./For the fourth consecutive day on Sunday, Delhi's air quality index (AQI) was in the severe zone with a value of 416, indicating a health hazard to all those who were exposed to such poor air. Crop stubble fires in the northern states contributed to 29% of Delhi's PM 2.5 load according to estimates by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology./The PM 2.5 concentrations touched 250 micrograms per cubic metres on Sunday, over four times the national ambient air quality standards and 25 times the World Health Organisation prescribed limit of 10 micrograms per cubic metres./There were over 4,900 fire points in Punjab on Saturday and over 3,500 on Sunday, according to data with the ministry of earth sciences (MoES). The combination of smoke from crop fires and calm winds led to air quality deteriorating significantly. Farmer leaders said crop fires are likely to continue till November 15, by when harvesting will be completed. One of the reasons for the prolonged stubble fire period in Punjab is the shortage of farm labour who had moved back to their states during the national lockdown for Covid 19 pandemic./""Fires will continue for a week or so. All the late varieties of paddy are being harvested now. Many parts of the state faced labour shortage this year. Most of the farm labour comes from Bihar and UP. They travelled back home during lockdown. There was a labour shortage during the beginning of harvesting season,"" said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union. Agra, Bhiwadi, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and many other parts of northwest India also recorded ""severe"" air on Sunday./Scientists said air quality is unlikely to improve in the next two days. ""In the morning conditions were smoggy but, in the day, relative humidity is under 75% so what we are seeing is only smoke and pollution. Winds are calm so no dispersal of pollutants is possible. Visibility this afternoon is only 600 metres when normally during this season it should be at least 2,000 metres in the afternoon hours. There is no likelihood of improvement till Diwali. At the most, wind speed can increase up to 8 to 10 kmph,"" said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre./A western disturbance is likely to impact the north western region around Diwali day on November 14, but that may not do much for dispersal of pollutants. ""In fact, the wind direction will shift to easterly briefly on November 11 or 12 when wind speed will fall leading to accumulation of pollutants. The western disturbance is only likely to bring rain and snow to the upper reaches of hill states not to the north western plains,"" Shrivastava added./""There is anti-cyclonic wind circulation in the lower levels and subsidence (settling downwards) of air in large parts of northwest India presently. Both are linked to slow winds and accumulation of pollutants. We have been seeing a very large number of crop stubble fire points. The combination of these factors is leading to air quality index (AQI) hovering between very poor and severe categories for the past four days,"" explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre. ""The centre of the anticyclonic wind circulation is just south of Delhi today leading to most of the impact being felt here,"" he added./According to the Royal Meteorological Society, under an anticyclone air is descending forming an area of higher pressure at the surface. Because of these stable conditions, cloud formation is inhibited, so the weather is usually settled with only small amounts of cloud cover. This very stable atmosphere leads to accumulation of pollutants, experts said./""Winds are in a transitional phase. On Monday evening, they may shift to north-easterly direction but there is no likelihood of any improvement in air quality because wind speed is likely to be very low. Air quality may remain severe on Monday also and we also do not expect any significant improvement around Diwali. The fire counts are extremely high, adverse meteorology is leading to AQI spiking to severe category,"" said Vijay Soni, scientist, IMD, air quality division./Ventilation index was only approx. 6000 m2/s on Sunday. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air./Commission yet to meet/Though the six full-time members of the Commission for Air Quality Management for the National Capital Region (NCR) took charge on Friday, days after the Centre issued an ordinance on October 29 to set up the new centralised agency with sweeping powers to monitor and act against air pollution, the members haven't met yet. Rules for the functioning of the commission are also yet to be framed./""The meeting of the commission members is not dependent on framing of rules. The rules for the functioning of the commission will be framed in due course. The commission will meet next week and start its work,"" said Ravi Agrawal, special secretary, ministry of environment./MM Kutty, chairperson of the commission and former chief secretary of Delhi, did not answer calls on Sunday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Severe air quality in 9 Uttar Pradesh cities; Ghaziabad, Greater Noida worst in country","India, Nov. 10 -- Ghaziabad and Greater Noida recorded the worst air quality across the country. The air quality index (AQI) in Ghaziabad and Greater Noida was recorded at 482 each./At least nine towns and cities in Uttar Pradesh (UP) recorded ""severe"" air quality, according to data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday./Noida (479), Agra (475), Bulandshahr (450), Kanpur (404), Hapur (402) and Meerut (401) all recorded ""severe: AQI./An AQI between 401 and 500 is considered to be in the ""severe"" category, and is known to have an adverse impact on health conditions, according to experts./Also Read: Delhi air severely polluted for sixth consecutive day/Lucknow recorded an average AQI of 388, as the reading ranged from 335 to 449 at different parts of the state capital./An AQI between 301 and 400 is considered to be in the ""very poor"" category./As per the CPCB data, the major pollutants in the region were particulate matter (PM 10), PM 2.5 and vehicular emission./PM10 are particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers and they are also called fine particles. Environmental experts say PM10 is also known as respirable PM. PM is a complex mixture of soot, smoke, metals, nitrates, sulphates, dust water and rubber./PM 2. 5 refers to particles that have diameter less than 2.5 micrometres (more than 100 times thinner than a human hair) and remain suspended in the air far longer./These particles are formed because of burning fuel and chemical reactions that take place in the atmosphere./The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) authorities recently issued a fresh advisory to all the 75 district administrations to check the rise in air pollution./Efforts are also in progress to prevent stubble burning and illegal construction activities./""We are keeping a tab on air pollution and are taking measures to reduce it.

"Emergency in the air: NGT extends cracker ban, curbs","India, Nov. 10 -- Bursting or selling firecrackers in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) as well as much of north India will be prohibited till December 1, the National Green Tribunal said on Monday, announcing a near-sweeping ban that stems from concerns that already critical levels of air pollution will add to the growing toll of the Covid-19 pandemic./In a 58-page order, NGT said the ban will apply to all cities or towns where the average air quality during November (as per last year's data) was in ""poor"" category, or worse. The order refers to submissions by an amicus on the links between severe air pollution and Covid-19 infections as well as mortality./In Delhi, where the air quality index remained in the ""severe"" category for the fifth consecutive day, state environment minister Gopal Rai announced that people not complying with the ban on firecrackers will face action under the Air Act which means a jail term of up to six years and a fine of up to Rs.1 lakh./The announcement was made after a meeting between the state government, and district and police officials to discuss standard operating procedures to implement the ban./Firecrackers emit plumes of heavy metals into the air, which is already a toxic mix of ultra-fine PM2.5 and fine PM10 particles spewed by farm fires and local sources such as vehicles and construction dust./The air is already past the point of what is fit for breathing, experts said, welcoming Monday's ban./""Air pollution in Delhi is at hazardous levels. This time, the period of hazardous air seems to have arrived even before Diwali. The relationship of air pollution with severity of pneumonia is well established. Therefore, it is expected that there will be an increase in positivity and severity of Covid 19. All efforts should be made to curb pollution,"" said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care and former head of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./Across the country, in cities or towns where air quality is ""moderate"" , only green crackers can be sold - and burst for two hours during festivals. If nothing is specified by a state, the timing for firecrackers will be 8 to 10pm on Diwali and Gurupurab, and 6am to 8am on Chhath. On Christmas and New Year's Eve, this can be between 11.55pm and 12.30am. In other places, ban/restrictions are optional but if there are more stringent measures by the state authorities, they will prevail, NGT said./By HT's estimates, seven states and Union territories around the country have completely banned crackers./The NGT order directed chief secretaries and police chiefs of all states and Union territories to issue and circulate appropriate orders and enforcement guidelines. It added that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control boards are to regularly monitor the air quality during the ban and upload all data on their websites./An independent analysis by HT of CPCB's publicly released AQI data for November 2019 showed that of the 110 cities for which AQI was released that month (which will serve as the basis for the ban), 42 had an average AQI that was ""poor"" or worse through the month./CPCB collects AQI data from 387 cities across the country, of which only 110 were published in the agency's daily AQI bulletins in November 2019. CPCB officials said that data of remaining cities is collected manually, and thus not included in the daily bulletin. This will be included in the final list of cities, they added./""The assessment of where the ban on firecrackers will be imposed will have to be made by respective state pollution control boards based on NGT's order. But generally, we understand that ban may be imposed in all of north India while peninsular; parts of northeast India may not have to impose the ban,"" a senior CPCB official said, asking not to be named./To be sure, some states have already banned the use of firecrackers this year. These include Odisha, Rajasthan, Chandigarh, Sikkim, Delhi, Bengal and Tripura. Two key NCR states, Haryana and Punjab have a partial ban in place, but will now need to follow the NGT direction./The ban is not likely to be easy to enforce given religious sensitivities and economic compulsions. ""Diwali is a special challenge this year given the twin crisis of Covid pandemic and winter pollution. Past experience has shown that enforcement of ban and restrictions on crackers need strong public support and awareness. It is therefore important to make people aware that we cannot afford to increase disease burden from short term toxic exposure when winter smog is also worsening the health risk,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./Similar bans in the past, particularly the one enforced by the Supreme Court in 2018, were widely flouted./The Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturer's Association, Sivakasi (TNFAM) claimed during the NGT hearing that there is no correlation between use of firecrackers and increase in the number of Covid cases. They cited data from Ayodhya, where people celebrated the beginning of the Ram Temple construction with fireworks but there was no increase in Covid 19 cases./Santosh Harish, fellow at Centre for Policy Research, said, ""The NGT order is a welcome move... Also, this idea of laying out a broader principle restricting firecrackers across the country is useful. Now, the responsibility is with state governments. However, instead of a last minute order, if such directions had been provided a few months earlier, it would have improved the implementation and likely reduced economic hardship for those that depend on the fireworks industry.""/Firecracker traders said the timing of the ban would impact their earnings, especially since the lockdown earlier in the year had caused hardships. ""States like Maharashtra have announced that they won't ban firecracker despite having a high number of cases in the state. Though we are worried about the number of Covid-19 cases and the pandemic threat, what about the economic hardship faced by small-time traders? "" asked Subhash Chandra Jain, a firecracker trader in old Delhi who has been in the business for around four decades./Jain said that traders like him who deal in the business all year round will not face losses as huge as those who took loans to secure firecracker stocks and temporary licences. ""The Delhi government officials held meetings with the fireworks traders and gave us the thumbs-up for green crackers. Now, they have imposed a ban. The government should have done its homework.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

500: What a maxed out AQI means,"India, Nov. 10 -- On Tuesday morning, around 9.30 am, at least 18 stations in Delhi reported an air quality index (AQI) of 500, the highest value on the pollution measurement metric. A few private air quality monitoring platforms even reported an AQI of 999, indicating that the pollution measuring values had maxed out./What these numbers don't indicate is that concentrations of the ultra-fine and hazardous particulate matter (PM 2.5 or PM 10) in Delhi could be much higher than indicated by the maximum index value of 500./However, experts say the index is not underestimating the crisis by capping the value at 500./The PM concentrations may be far higher than the criteria for meeting an AQI of 500. But '500' indicates worst air quality with worst health impacts, the experts said./For example, an AQI of 401 to 500 represents PM 2.5 concentrations of over 250 micrograms per cubic metres and PM 10 concentration of over 430 micrograms per cubic metres on an average.. Since Monday, PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations in Delhi have been over 350 micrograms per cubic metres and 550 micrograms per cubic metres, respectively, but the AQI values have remained within or up to 500./The daily safe limit of PM 2.5 is 60ug/m3 while that of PM 10 is 100 ug/m3./A Central Pollution Control Board scientist explained, ""In our estimate, the AQI cannot deteriorate infinitely. Exceeding the 500 scale indicates the situation is terrible. At 500, maximum damage is done so there is no point going beyond that. It's a situation similar to the US Environment Protection Agency's (EPA) hazardous level. Its recommended that people remain indoors but indoor air quality is also impacted.""/""Not much has been studied as to what happens after we reach an AQI of 500. Health impacts plateau after a certain point. There is not much point in monitoring beyond that,"" the scientist added./""An AQI of 500 is exceptionally high. One can always conflate numbers. But it only means that air quality is in a very severe condition,"" said Mukesh Sharma, scientist, department of civil engineering, IIT Kanpur, who helped develop the AQI system for India./The United States EPA considers the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern./""The kind of air quality you are breathing depends on the concentrations of pollutants such as PM 2.5 or PM 10. The AQI is basically taking pollution levels from different pollutants and grading them in sub-indices and then calculating an index value based on the pollutant, which is of highest concentration at the time.,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./""The maximum AQI values have been calculated based on the kind of pollution experienced during the London smog of 1952. There is no logic in extending AQI values. We need systemic changes to control air pollution levels in the region,"" Roy Chowdhury said./Severe category air could have respiratory effects even on healthy people and serious health impacts on people with lung/heart diseases. The health impacts may be experienced even during light physical activity, according to Central Pollution Control Board's AQI report released in 2015./RoyChowdhury said all action to curb severe air quality should kick well in advance and not when AQI is 500./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Worst episode of smog negates all good air records in Delhi,"India, Nov. 10 -- More stubble fires than previous years and unsuitable weather conditions have negated the gains made in terms of more good and satisfactory air days as well as the annual average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations on account of a prolonged lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, experts said./They said consecutive days of severe air quality days or an air emergency episode like the present one wasn't recorded since 2016. The present smog episode will be the worst since AQI is being measured if severe air quality persists till Wednesday. Experts said the improvement in air quality over Delhi being recorded in the past two years will be negated because of severe air pollution this winter./In 2018 and 2019, 159 and 182 good to moderate air quality days were recorded compared to 108 and 152 in 2016 and 2017. In 2018 and 2019, 206 and 183 poor to severe air days were recorded compared to 246 and 213 in 2016 and 2017 according to CPCB./One of the signs of air quality improving is the absence of any severe air quality or smog episodes which are linked to higher hospital admissions and complications of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in the vulnerable population. ./Officials from anti-pollution agencies said one of the reasons Delhi couldn't sustain its improvements in curbing severe air episodes is an unusually high number of stubble fires flared this year and possibly because of the reopening of the economy after curbs imposed to control Covid-19 spread coinciding with adverse meteorological conditions like calm winds for the past one week./This time there have been at least 62,000 fire points compared to less than 60,000 in the past two years./""There is no doubt that 2020's annual average concentrations will be lower than last year. Even if you consider AQI, we have had a very high number of good, satisfactory and moderate days this year because of the national lockdown for Covid 19 pandemic. Severe days occur every year whether they were consecutive or not will not matter much,"" said a senior Central Pollution Control Board official on condition of anonymity./Scientists said the satellite data indicates a very high number of stubble fires this year. ""The satellite data we assessed indicates that crop stubble fires have been relatively higher than the average number of fires recorded in the past five years from 2015 to 2019. This has mixed with poor meteorological conditions. It is definitely true that number of severe air days had reduced in 2017, 2018 and 2019. There were a very high number of severe air days in 2016 and we experienced one of the worst smog episodes. This year again this has happened because of higher stubble fires, lack of surveillance because of Covid-19 related restrictions,"" explained Sagnik Dey, associate professor at IIT Delhi./He also flagged that Delhi needs to reduce its own emissions by at least 30% during the winter months beginning October to avoid such spikes./""Air pollution has doubled in October-November compared to say August-September even though local emissions have remained nearly the same. Stubble fires have only added to the emissions. If neighbouring states do not cooperate, Delhi will have to reduce its own emissions even further so that we don't see such hazardous air quality episodes. We also need to fine tune the graded response action plan so that strict control mechanisms kick in even before we have severe air continuously for six days,"" Dey said, referring to NASA satellite images which show a smoke plume has descended over Delhi and surrounding regions from the north./Trilochan Mohapatra, director of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and farmer leaders in Punjab have been saying more stubble fires are being reported in the state because of agitation and discontent over the three farm bills introduced by the Centre. Farmers are in no mood to comply with regulations and labour shortage due to the national lockdown has also made disposing stubble very difficult./""This year we have started recording several severe air quality days even before Diwali has arrived. The entire region is suffering severe air quality because pollutants get trapped here due to adverse meteorological conditions. We need significant curbs locally to reduce the intensity, duration and frequency of such episodes. Its important to monitor how fast such episodes clear up with emergency action. I am not aware of how effectively Grap is being implemented on a regional level right now,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air emergency in Delhi, no signs of Grap","India, Nov. 10 -- Delhi equalled its longest spell of severe air on Tuesday -- the sixth consecutive day of the city breathing in an air with most harmful levels of particulate and gaseous pollutants. Before this, the capital had breathed severe air for six consecutive days in 2016. However, there was no sign of emergency measures that used to kick in under the graded response action plan (Grap)./Even though India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said that Delhi might experience a slight respite on Wednesday, but it will be ""short-lived"", scientists said./CPCB data showed that the overall AQI of Delhi on Tuesday was 476, in the severe category. On Monday, the AQI of the city was 477./Tuesday began with pollution levels clocking an all time high of the season at 487. By 9am, at least 18 monitoring stations, such as Sirifort, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Bawana, Mundka, and Alipur recorded the maximum possible AQI recording of 500./According to Central Pollution Control Board's data, at 7pm on Tuesday, it was 48 hours since the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) had constantly remained above the 300ug/m3 and 51 hours since the PM10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) had been above the 500ug/m3 mark, pushing the city into the severe plus zone./The national ambient air standard for PM2.5 is 60ug/m3 and 100ug/m3 for PM10./Till 12 pm, the Dr Karni Sena Shooting Range station recorded a maximum PM2.5 level of 907ug/m3. In Mundka, these levels were as high as 1156ug/m3./Such long episode of bad air mandates emergency measures under Grap, including odd-even road space rationing scheme, ban on all construction activities, entry of trucks that are not destined for the city, except those carrying essential commodities, etc. However, till late Tuesday, no such steps had been initiated by the agencies./In a letter written to the CPCB late Thursday evening, the newly appointed Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) said ""till a mechanism is set up by the commission, as an interim measure, the CPCB is entrusted with the task of operationalising and monitoring the Grap measures""./The letter read, ""...(the commission) has decided that in view of the deteriorating air quality in NCR region, there is need to invoke the Grap already notified by the central government.""/Responding to this direction a CPCB spokesperson said that the monitoring body will issue the required directions on Wednesday looking at the AQI./Experts, however, said that the agencies should have been more proactive and this late direction by the commission was ""too little, too late""./""We have reached a point where the measures listed under Grap should automatically be implemented according to the AQI levels, without having to give any directions. I understand that the commission has just been formed and is taking some time to get used to this system, but we already have a mechanism in place, CPCB taskforce is supposed to monitor the air quality levels and recommend action. There is no excuse for not doing that,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment./She said that let alone bringing in additional measures, the authorities seem to be struggling with the enforcement of the basic measures listed under Grap, and Tuesday's situation was a classic example of that./""Delhi air pollution is in the severe category, the ministry of earth sciences' prediction suggests that the AQI will remain very high even tomorrow (Wednesday) and reduce marginally on November 12...A lot of challenges for the commission for air quality over NCR set up by the government of India,"" said Madhavan Rajeevan, secretary, union ministry of earth sciences./Rajeevan added, ""Let us not expect this pollution problem will be resolved quickly. Even China took 15 years to clean up their air. We need consistent and sincere efforts by all stakeholders without any blame game.""/Last year, the now dissolved Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had restricted construction activities and the operation of hot mix plants in the city from October 26, before calling for a complete ban on construction from November 5, as a preventive measure to control the rise of pollution levels. The ban was finally lifted by the Supreme Court in February this year./""We are implementing Grap and will continue to do so. Its implementation does not depend on Epca,"" said RP Gupta, secretary, union environment ministry./Scientists at the IMD said that a change in the wind direction and improved wind speed came to the rescue of the city, and after 2pm, the air quality started showing marginal improvement./VK Soni, head of IMD's environment monitoring research centre, said that the wind direction changed to easterly on Tuesday afternoon, which reduced the impact of the high instances of stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana on Delhi's air./""The wind picked up to reach around 8kmph during the day but there was so much pollution accumulation that its impact was not immediately seen in the air quality. We are hoping that we will be able to get out of the severe plus category through Tuesday night. Easterly winds will continue till Thursday,"" Soni said./Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre, said that this relief, however, will be short-lived./""From Thursday, the wind direction will change again to north-westerly, which will be conducive to bring the plumes of smoke from Punjab and Haryana. There is also a possibility that Delhi and NCR towns might get light rain around Friday and Saturday, which means that the moisture in the air lead to pollutants latching on closer to the surface, worsening the air quality further,"" Srivastava said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Why is Delhi is seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases? AIIMS director blames super-spreader events,"India, Nov. 11 -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi (AIIMS), director, Dr Randeep Guleria said on Wednesday that super-spreader events can be the reason behind the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi./""What happens is if in a crowd one does not wear a mask, a person who may be asymptomatic and is highly infectious he can spread the disease to a large number of people in the crowd. If they get the disease, they will take it to the area they go to, their own family members, their relatives and they will again spread the disease. So you can have super-spreading events, and it is likely that this has happened in Delhi. There were crowds, people did not take precautions and they were super spreading events and this led to an increase in the number of cases,"" Dr.Guleria told ANI/A super-spreader event is one where a single person with the virus can come into contact with multiple other people and spread the virus to them. They have been gaining widespread attention following reports that Donald Trump's pre-election fundraiser and his election night watch party might have been superspreader events, where members of his campaign were infected in significant numbers. In Kerala too, cases spiked after Onam celebrations./Agreeing that it is difficult to avoid crowds in the festive season, the AIIMS director warned that with the drop in temperature and rising air pollution levels there is a dire need to exercise caution. He also advised senior citizens and people with comorbidities to be extra vigilant during this phase and said there is an acute need for everyone to wear masks whenever they are in places with a considerable number of people./Talking about the sudden rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi, he said, ""We are seeing an increasing surge of cases in Delhi, and the numbers are increasing with time. The number of cases had come down to 2,000 from 4,000, and now they are going upwards of 7,000 and up to 8,000 in a day, this is also reflected in increased hospital admissions and to some extent in mortality.""/As per the Union health ministry's website on Wednesday, there are 41,385 active Covid-19 cases in the national capital, while 4,02,854 patients have been cured and discharged. Over 7,000 fatalities have been reported in the national capital so far./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"After 6 days, air improves to very poor","India, Nov. 11 -- On Wednesday, Delhi finally took a deep breath and not choke -- thanks to improved wind speeds and a change in the wind direction, carrying pollutants away from the national capital./The air quality index (AQI), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on Wednesday rose to the ""very poor"" category with a reading of 344, after a staying put in the ""severe"" zone for six days. On a scale of 0 to 500, any reading between 300 and 400 is deemed very poor, while those above 400 are considered severe./The AQI had touched 476 on Tuesday, in the upper reaches of severe zone./The CPCB, however, directed the stone crushers and hot mix plants to remain closed till November 17, to prevent any further deterioration in air quality./Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) credited the improvement in air quality to change in wind direction and improved speed./Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre, said from Tuesday afternoon, the wind direction over Delhi changed from north-westerly -- blows from the agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana bringing in smoke from farm fires -- to easterly./""Because of the wind direction change, we did not have stubble burning smoke adding to the local sources and deteriorating the air quality on Wednesday. The average wind speed was 12kmph, which was enough to disperse the accumulated pollutants,"" Srivastava said./He said on Thursday, too, the wind direction will remain easterly and there is a possibility of the AQI improving further into the better end of very poor zone. But this respite will be short-lived as on the Diwali weekend (November 14), wind will slow down and change direction back to north-westerly./As the city inched into the severe-plus zone on Tuesday evening, with no clarity on the enforcement of measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), the Commission on Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas decided the task of implementing Grap be temporarily given to CPCB until the newly constituted commission develops a mechanism for Grap implementation./There was confusion among agencies after Centre issued an ordinance on October 29 to set up the new centralised agency with sweeping powers to monitor and act against sources of air pollution across five north Indian states./""After the Commission was formed, we did not have the legal mandate to hold meetings or enforce Grap. The Commission gave us the responsibility only yesterday and so we couldn't take any measures on our own over the past few days,"" a senior CPCB official said./Experts also expressed concerns over this lack of coordination among agencies at such a crucial time./""Pollution control and abatement has for long been caught up in legal and institutional jugglery. The current air pollution crisis is an outcome of inaction and regulatory failure. The new Commission has not just inherited the legacy of the problem but also the regulatory framework, in the form of laws and action plans. What needs to be recognised is that even today, big economic decisions are at odds with environment measures. This includes pushing for large real estate projects, continued support for private transport or legal subsidies for coal power stations,"" said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

A slight breather for Delhi but Diwali may be 'severe',"India, Nov. 12 -- Experts on Thursday warned that violations of the ban on firecrackers on Diwali, coupled with slower, north-westerly winds carrying stubble burning smoke, will likely push Delhi's air pollution back into the 'severe' levels it witnessed earlier this week./Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that even though the city's air quality index (AQI) improved to the lower range of 'very poor' on Thursday, thanks to stronger winds, the situation will likely deteriorate from Friday./Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that on Thursday, Delhi's overall AQI was 314, in the 'very poor' category. On Wednesday, the AQI was 344, also very poor./Firecrackers could lead to Mumbai's worst air pollution post-Diwali in 6 years: SAFAR/Diwali will be celebrated on Saturday./VK Soni, head of IMD's environment monitoring research centre, said winds blowing over Delhi will start slowing down from Friday, and their direction will switch to north-westerly, which will increase the contribution of stubble-burning smoke from Punjab and Haryana./""Even though we have forecast that this Diwali is likely to be better compared to the last few years, the weather is expected to be unfavourable. If people in the city burst crackers, then the pollution level could slip to 'severe' on Diwali day and a day after,"" Soni said./The Capital's AQI was 'severe' for six days, starting November 6. The city got minor relief on Wednesday and Thursday, when the AQI was very poor category after winds shifted direction, blowing in from the east, and carrying minimal smoke from farm fires./Smoke from farm fires contributed to just 3% of Delhi's PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter) levels on Wednesday, the lowest since October 14./Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre, said that from Diwali afternoon the wind speed will dip to nearly 6kmph./""From Diwali evening the air quality is likely to start deteriorating.

Mumbai: BMC forms squads to monitor Covid-19 guidelines violations around Diwali,"India, Nov. 12 -- The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have formed squads in each of the civic body's wards to monitor violations related to the use of firecrackers and ensure that coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related protocols are not violated before and on the day of Diwali, which will be celebrated on Saturday (November 14)./The BMC has decided to monitor areas, where air pollution is on the rise during this period, and divert the squads to check the source of poor air quality index (AQI), officials said./Earlier this week, the Maharashtra government advised the public to celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali this year because of the dual impact of pollution woes and the Covid-19 outbreak./The BMC on Monday banned bursting of firecrackers in public and private places in Mumbai except on the day of Diwali./Also Read: Don't step out, celebrate Diwali from homes: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray/Firecrackers can be burst on the festive occasion in residential areas and housing complexes./Revellers are allowed to burst only two variants of firecrackers such as sparklers and flower pots./The BMC has taken the call on a ban on firecrackers following due deliberations./Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (AMC), BMC, said: ""We have analysed the crowding pattern of Mumbai, and classified areas with high population density around markets and public places, where there can be a possibility of a large gathering and the predicted timing of that congregation. For example, Dadar market is likely to have more people during early morning, while Marine Drive may have more public in the evening. This information was shared with Mumbai Police. We have formed various teams in a bid to mobilise them in a ward to educate and motivate the public about following three Covid-19-related precautionary measures such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and using hand sanitisers. Any violation will attract a fine of Rs 200.""/Kakani said that the civic body authorities had increased their workforce because of the festive season./""We have roped in officers and field staff from the licencing, insecticide and sanitation departments. We have deployed around 100 employees per ward, who are part of the newly formed squads. Besides, Mumbai Police personnel will also support us. In some of the wards, we have requested the police authorities to allow BMC employee to sit in their mobile police vans during patrolling,"" he said./BMC authorities have also requested the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), which comes under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), to share a daily air pollution report before and on the day of Diwali./""This will help us understand the air pollution spike in specific locations.

SC refuses to reverse ban on sale of firecrackers in Bengal,"India, Nov. 12 -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to reverse a ban on sale or use of firecrackers in West Bengal during the festive month of November, saying that preservation of life should be the top priority in a country faced with a pandemic./A West Bengal-based firecracker dealers' association filed an appeal before the top court challenging a Calcutta high court order of November 5 banning sale and use of firecrackers as a measure to curb the spread of Covid-19. The judgement likely means the end to potential legal challenges to cracker (sales and bursting) bans that the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and several states and Union territories have enforced. The main reason for the ban is to prevent an increase in Covid-19 cases, with research clearly linking fire crackers to air pollution (if only temporarily) and the latter to higher mortality from Covid-19./Delhi, for instance, has been choking on pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, and vehicular emissions, and was among the first states to ban fire crackers, which worsen air pollution significantly but temporarily. The ban in West Bengal will be effective till the end of this month and has affected the livelihoods of firecracker manufacturers as cracker sale hits peak in this month coinciding with festivals of Diwali, Kali Puja, Chhath Puja, and Jagaddhatri Puja. The high court order came on two public interest litigations (PIL)./Dealing with the appeal filed by Gautam Roy and Burrabazaar Fireworks Dealers Association, the apex court was of the view that the high court was right in its decision as it weighed the need of preserving life at a time of pandemic. ""We are in a situation where preservation of life is the only priority. We have a great deal of deference to what the high court does as the judges there are conscious of the situation on ground,"" said a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee./At least seven states and Union territories have banned crackers with another five allowing their bursting only for a limited time. On Monday, the NGT ruled that no crackers would be allowed to be burst in cities where the air quality in November (based on last year's average) was in ""poor"" category or worse. There are at least 42 cities that meet this criteria, according to HT's analysis of 110 cities that are featured in the Central Pollution Control Board daily pollution bulletin. Most bans have come into effect and last till the end of November./Senior advocate Siddharth Bhatnagar, appearing for the firework dealers informed the top court that the high court had no empirical data for denying permission for sale or use of crackers. He referred to a recent order passed by the NGT which allowed green crackers to be used for limited hours in places where air quality is moderate. He pointed out that last year the SC permitted crackers to be burst on festival days for two hours at designated places./Interestingly, according to the NGT criteria, Kolkata's air quality was in ""poor"" category last November, which means crackers are banned there this year./The bench was particularly concerned about the health of the elderly who were more vulnerable to breathing problems caused by smoke released from crackers that could be life-threatening during the pandemic./""We all have elderly people at our homes. If something contributes to preserving life of our elderly, let us join together in the interest of the community,"" the bench of justices Chandrachud and Banerjee said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"More steps coming, Delhi Covid situation should be under control in 7-10 days: Kejriwal","India, Nov. 13 -- Expressing concern over the spike in Covid-19 cases in the national capital, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that his government is planning to take steps in the coming week to address the issue. He also said the situation is expected to come under control in another seven to ten days./However, he did not elaborate on the options being considered by the government to control the ongoing spike in cases and recorded deaths. The CM also said that pollution is a contributing factor in the spike in the coronavirus disease cases./Senior government officials said the government has asked the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) - which is chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal - to convene a meeting by Tuesday to discuss the course of action./Also read | India records less than 50,000 daily Covid-19 cases for 6th day in a row/""The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is concerning. Next week, we will take some more steps to address it. The situation should come under control in 7-10 days,"" said Kejriwal in a video press briefing./On Thursday, Delhi recorded 7,053 new Covid-19 cases and 104 deaths in 24 hours - the highest fatalities for a single day yet. So far, 467,028 people in the capital have been diagnosed Covid-19 positive, of which 416,580 have recovered, and 7,332 have died./Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, ""By the current trends, it looks like cases can go up for at least another three weeks unless the government imposes restrictions on non-essential activities - that can concern market timings, size of gatherings, etc.""/In Friday's press briefing, Kejriwal shared results of an experiment with a bio decomposer - developed by the Pusa Institute - that can be used as an alternative for crop stubble burning.

'Bad air leading to Covid-19 spike; respite soon': Arvind Kejriwal,"India, Nov. 14 -- Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday identified high levels of air pollution as ""one of the biggest factors"" for the spike in Covid-19 infections, linking the two crises the Capital is currently reeling under, but said that the third wave of the coronavirus disease outbreak in the city was likely to come under control in another 7-10 days./Kejriwal's comments come at a time when the city has recorded persistently grim Covid numbers - it logged the most single-day fatalities on Thursday and, a day earlier, the most number of new cases. The city's hospitals have been swamped as active cases rose from 21,490 on October 13 to over 43,000 on November 13./At the same time, the air quality in the Capital has been several times over the safe limit for most of this month. For six days from November 6, it remained in the ""severe"" zone - above 401 - with the reading at some monitoring centres maxing out./Exposure to high levels of air pollution may exacerbate a Covid-19 infection, particularly since the virus as well as the particulate matter affect a person's ability to breathe once they enter deep into the lungs. For every 1ug/m3 increase in exposure to PM2.5, the increase in mortality risk due to Covid-19 rises by 11%, a group of researchers from Harvard University said in a recent study./""Whatever necessary steps are needed, we are taking them. There are steps we will take over the next few days, next week and we believe within the next 7-10 days, the outbreak will be brought under control,"" the CM said in a video press conference./Kejriwal did not elaborate on the options being considered by the government to control the outbreak, but according to senior government officials who asked not to be named, the administration has asked the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to convene a meeting by Tuesday./Experts said they feared it might take longer for the city to turn the corner from its current peak./""By the current trends, it looks like cases can go up for at least another three weeks unless the government imposes certain restrictions on non-essential activities - that can concern market timings, size of gatherings, etc,"" said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)./""We are seeing slightly more severe cases that are taking longer to recover. There are different theories but the most plausible seems to be rise in air pollution levels as this trend is largely seen in Delhi where pollution levels are the highest,"" said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital./""Both, severe pollution and festive season is contributing to the spread and severity of the disease, and how the outbreak pans out we will get to know exactly once the festive season gets over. The cases will eventually come down but I don't see it happening in days; it will probably take weeks,"" he added./The spike has been particularly pronounced due to the festive season. In the week ending October 25, when the city held muted Dussehra celebrations, there were an average of 3,663 cases every day. As on Thursday, this number rose to 7,196./In comparison, the number was 2,627 in the first week of October./In his address, the chief minister spoke at length about the air quality crisis, which he said has played a big role in driving the epidemic. ""One of the biggest reasons for Covid-19 spike in Delhi is rise in pollution,"" Kejriwal said./The 24-hour air quality index according to Friday's 4pm bulletin stood at 339, in the ""very poor"" category, worse than the 314 on Thursday, and weather experts expect the number to worsen over the weekend when at least some people are expected to defy bans to burst firecrackers./""Even though we have forecast that this Diwali is likely to be better compared to the last few years, the weather is expected to be unfavourable. If people in the city burst crackers, then the pollution level could slip to 'severe' on Diwali day and a day after,"" said VK Soni, head of IMD's environment monitoring research centre./The crisis prompted the National Green Tribunal to ban the use of firecrackers across the National Capital Region (NCR), a decision that was also based on research showing a strong link between Covid-19 severity and bad air quality./""This time, the period of hazardous air seems to have arrived even before Diwali. The relationship of air pollution with severity of pneumonia is well established. Therefore, it is expected that there will be an increase in positivity and severity of Covid 19. Instead, all efforts should be made to curb pollution,"" the tribunal said on November 9./The link between pollution and coronavirus disease was first made in Italy where officials discovered almost 40% of documented cases and a third of fatalities in the northern region of Lombardy./The epicentre of the outbreak also turned out to be a heavy industrialised and polluted region./The findings were backed by a statistical analysis of Covid-19 case and mortality spread across the 3,089 counties of United States. The team of researchers from Harvard University discovered that regions with worse air quality recorded more serious numbers./""We found that an increase of 1 ug/m3 in the long-term average PM2.5 is associated with a statistically significant 11% increase in the county's Covid-19 mortality rate,"" said the authors in their report, published in Science Advances on November 4./The air quality crisis has been an annual event for the last decade, Kejriwal said in his briefing on Friday as he devoted a sizeable chunk to one of the major causes of air pollution: farm fires in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh./Kejriwal shared results of an experiment with a bio decomposer - developed by the Pusa Institute - that can be used to dissolve crop stubble that farmers usually burn./Last month, he said, the bio decomposer was spread over 2,000 acres of farm lands in Delhi and results of the experiment - based on samples collected from 24 villages -- showed that 70%-95% of total crop stubble have been decomposed./""Now we have a solution. I urge other states, the central government and the Supreme Court to take note of it. The Delhi government will file a petition along with this report to the central government's air safety commission urging them to issue directions to states to use the bio decomposer,"" said Kejriwal./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Residents claim ban enforcement weak, calls to cops went unheeded","India, Nov. 15 -- Despite a blanket ban on firecrackers across the city both by the Delhi government and the National Green Tribunal, loud bangs of fireworks reverberated across neighbourhoods filling them with smoke on Saturday./While residents claimed that the police were lax in enforcing the ban, the cops alleged that the locals did not cooperate especially in cases where people bursted crackers from their terrace and balconies./Many resident groups complained that complaints made to the helpline reporting cracker bursting were ignored./Sujatha Nair, a resident of south Delhi's Vasant Kunj, who is also the founder member of a citizens' group, 'War against Pollution', said she had called police control room number reporting cracker bursting instances around Kishangarh area at least thrice but no action was taken./""The police vans were nowhere to be seen. How were they imposing the ban? Apart from my own complaint we had many members who have also tried to reach the police numbers to report cracker burning in their respective neighbourhoods, but no action was initiated,"" Nair said./However, a senior police officer, who didn't want to be named, said whenever they received specific inputs about firecrackers, they responded and registered cases./""But we cannot act when we aren't informed where exactly crackers were being burst. For example, if someone was doing it from their apartment balcony and the caller didn't point out the exact flat number to us, it was difficult for us to identify and act against such miscreants,"" said the police officer./Bhavreen Kandhari, environmentalist and member of Warrior Moms, a pan-India initiative of environmentally conscious mothers fighting against air pollution, said officials on helpline numbers were asking complainants to locate exact addresses./""There was non-stop crackers all around and when I called 112 (Delhi's single emergency helpline number) they insisted that I should be out at 11.50pm, searching for the exact address. When I told the official on the line that the sound of crackers was coming from Kotla and Lodi Colony and their teams should do a vigil there, he slammed the phone,"" Kandhari said./The police officer, however, said their efforts were hampered in many instances when callers complained about crackers, but didn't want to follow it up or be identified to assist the police in pointing out the miscreants./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Rain, strong winds help Delhi get cleaner air day after Diwali","India, Nov. 16 -- The weather gods came to Delhi's rescue a day after Diwali, helping the city get a breather from the incessant cracker bursting on Saturday. While Delhi's air quality index remained in the 'severe' zone on Sunday, high wind speed and rain in various parts of the city helped improve the air. This improvement is expected to continue till Monday when the AQI levels are likely to come back to the 'very poor' zone, the weather forecast said./Senior scientists at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that a western disturbance, which started impacting the Western Himalayas on Saturday, brought widespread and moderate rains to Delhi NCR. Delhi recorded 0.4mm rainfall till 5.30 pm (at Safdarjung observatory) on Sunday and average wind speed over the city touched 40kmph by evening./Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre, said that the wind direction blowing over Delhi changed from north-westerly to easterly, which also reduced the transport of stubble smoke from Punjab and Haryana./""At the Safdarjung observatory, the maximum temperature was recorded 29.1 degree Celsius, while the minimum temperature was 11.4 degree Celsius, which is two degrees below the season's normal. Wind speed will remain high in Delhi and NCR throughout Sunday night, which will help in the dispersion of pollutants,"" Srivastava said./IMD recordings show that the Palam observatory recorded 1.8mm rainfall, Ridge recorded 1.2mm rainfall and at Jafarpur and Najafgarh, 1mm rainfall was recorded till 6.30pm on Sunday./Unlike previous years when air pollution levels remain very high turning to ""severe"" category the day after Diwali, this time air pollution levels gradually reduced on the day after Diwali due to favourable meteorological conditions./For instance, in 2019, Diwali was on October 27. The air quality index (AQI) on October 27 and 28 were 337 and 368 respectively both in ""very poor"" category. But on October 29 and 30 air quality had deteriorated to ""severe"" category with AQI of 400 and 419./""Delhi escaped prolonged exposure to severe air pollution this time because of the western disturbance. It has brought rain and thundershowers to many parts of northwest India. The wind speed started picking up since Sunday morning recording over 10 kmph which led to gradual dispersal. Winds were stronger in the evening when it started raining. We expect that air pollution levels will reduce significantly tonight,"" said Vijay Soni, scientist at IMD's air quality division./The ventilation index on Sunday was approx. 10000 m2/s. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor./Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air./Winter chill is likely to set in over northwest India in a couple of days due to the impact of the WD. ""The minimum temperature is likely to fall in the next couple of days by about 2 to 4 degree C due to cold winds from the Himalayan region,"" said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD./The western disturbance was lying over Afghanistan and neighbourhood on Sunday. Under the influence of the Western Disturbance, an induced cyclonic circulation and its interaction with lower level easterlies, widespread rainfall accompanied with thunderstorm, hailstorm and lightning was recorded over the Western Himalayan region./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi: Air quality improves marginally after Sunday's rain,"India, Nov. 16 -- Delhi's air quality index (AQI) improved from ""severe"" on Sunday afternoon to ""very poor"" category by late evening. The AQI further improved on Monday morning, but still remained in the ""very poor category./The national capital's AQI improved to 325 on Monday morning from 395 on Sunday evening. An AQI between 401 and 500 and 301 and 400 is considered in the ""very poor"" and ""severe"" category, respectively./Severe air quality was recorded on the Diwali day, which was celebrated on Saturday (November 14), but dispersed quickly by the evening because of rainfall and thunderstorms triggered by a Western disturbance in the western Himalayan region./Also read | Diwali pollution: Delhi-NCR exhibits irresponsibility, again/Some parts of Delhi had received rainfall, measuring up to 2 millimetres (mm), till at around 6.30pm on Sunday accompanied by winds blowing up to 30 kilometres per hour (kmph)./The wind speed helped disperse Diwali-induced air pollution accumulated over the past two days./Favourable meteorological conditions helped improve the national capital's AQI this year after Diwali, which was far worse during the corresponding period last year./In 2019, Diwali was celebrated on October 27. The AQI on October 27 and 28 was 337 and 368, respectively, and was in the ""very poor"" category. On October 29 and 30, the AQI further worsened to the ""severe"" category and showed 401 and 419, respectively./The Union Ministry of Earth Sciences' (MoES) air quality early warning system has forecast that wind direction would likely to be easterly or north-easterly on Monday and wind would blow up to six kmph./""The AQI is likely to remain in the 'very poor' category on Monday. Wind speed is unlikely to pick up significantly. As a result, no major improvement in the AQI is expected,"" said Vijay Soni, a scientist at India Meteorological Department's (IMD) air quality division./Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) evaluation report on air and noise pollution levels was released on Sunday. CPCB data showed that the AQI was far higher than last year, despite a blanket ban on sale and use of firecrackers because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and pollution woes./Besides, there was no significant dip in noise pollution levels./Delhi's average particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations on Diwali day was 645 micrograms (mg) per cubic metres (m), 6.45 times of the national standard and 483 mg per cubic m, eight times of the national safe standard./CPCB attributed the AQI to unfavourable meteorological conditions along with an impact of raging stubble fires in neighbouring Haryana, Punjab and parts of western Uttar Pradesh./This year the surface temperature and average mixing height were recorded to be the lowest in the last five years. A lower mixing height limits vertical dispersion./The hourly average concentration of PM2.5 started increasing since 11pm on Saturday (November 14) and reached its peak in most of the weather stations at around 1am, the report added./""This year air pollution levels both during pre-Diwali and the Diwali day have been higher than last year. One of main reasons for this is the contribution of stubble fires to Delhi's PM 2.5 concentrations on both the days. On the Diwali day, stubble fires contributed to 32% of Delhi's PM 2.5 load and on the pre-Diwali day it was 38%. Meteorological conditions are also adverse because Diwali was in mid-November this year, when mixing height is low (mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air). The contribution of firecrackers or festivities is lower this year, as compared to 2019.

Pollution levels soar on Diwali as cracker ban falls flat in Delhi,"India, Nov. 16 -- Pollution levels soared in the national Capital on Saturday night and early Sunday morning as tens of thousands of people defied the ban on firecrackers, before providential winds blowing in the right direction flushed the pollutants out on Sunday, with a smattering of rain in the late afternoon and evening washing everything down./On Saturday and early Sunday, though readings from air quality sensors across the city showed a rapid rise in concentration of harmful emissions, before going on to surpass levels seen during last year's Diwali./The average air quality index rose from 414 at 4pm on Saturday to reach 435 on Sunday, with PM2.5 and PM10 emission concentration recording a sharp spike that began at 6pm. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's emergency dashboard, concentration of PM2.5 - ultra-fine particles that can stick deep into a person's lungs - went from 306ug/m3 at 5pm to a peak of 672 ug/m3 at 2am./The crackers just made already bad air worse./""This year air pollution levels both during pre-Diwali and Diwali day has been higher than last year. One of main reasons for this is the contribution of stubble fires to Delhi's PM 2.5 concentrations on both days. On Diwali day, stubble fires contributed to 32% of Delhi's PM 2.5 load and on pre-Diwali day it was 38%,"" said a senior CPCB scientist on condition of anonymity./But then, the region had an unexpected stroke of luck this year, one absent during last year's Diwali, when pollutants from the farm fires and from firecrackers enveloped the city in a noxious shroud./A senior official from SAFAR, Union ministry of earth sciences's air quality monitoring centre, said that even though the spike in pollution levels witnessed on Saturday was highest compared to the Diwali days, the dispersion post-Diwali was also the fastest because of high wind speed./""Looking at the dispersion of pollutants, this was the best Diwali compared to the last four years. The winds were strong and the rain also helped wash off pollutants,"" said the Safar official. By late Sunday evening, the AQI was at 395, in the 'very poor' category./On Diwali day, the emissions trajectory was in near tandem with what was seen last year, when it began climbing around 5-6pm before peaking around 1-2am. In 2019, baseline pollution levels were lower than what they were this year, which meant the peak pollution was nine times more than before Diwali celebrations began - compared to twice as more this year. In absolute terms, however, the concentration of the ultra-fine particles was more this year than it was last year./It was around 6pm on Saturday that PM2.5 levels crossed the emergency threshold - 300ug/m3, a level where it would stay at least for the next 24 hours despite an increase in wind speeds and some rain the following day./This post-Diwali spike in pollution has been a consistent trend for the last five years and it comes at a time of the year when the air is already a mix of smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states and dust from an increasingly drying, post-monsoon ground./""Meteorological conditions are also adverse because Diwali was in mid-November this year when mixing height is low (mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air). But our understanding is that the contribution of firecrackers or festivities is lower this year compared to 2019. This is evident from the fact that pollution levels spiked substantially last year on Diwali in comparison to pre-Diwali day,"" the CPCB scientist added./According to CPCB's analysis of its three manually operated stations at ITO, Pitampura and Janakpuri, and three real time stations at Dilshad Garden, Shadipur and Dwarka, most pollution parameters were found to be higher than last year in a majority of the stations monitored both on Diwali day between 6am on Saturday to 6am on Sunday and on a pre-Diwali day on November 9 during the same period./""On Diwali day (this year), almost all the pollutants reported higher values as compared to 2019 Diwali day. Pitampura recorded increase in PM and SO2 indicating impact of firecracker bursting on Diwali day,"" said the CPCB report referring to data from three manual monitoring stations. Similar trends were seen in data from automatic stations also./Noise data from six stations reveal that at three locations (Lajpat Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase-II, Janakpuri) it increased on Diwali night this year compared to 2019, while it remained same at one (Kamla Nagar) and decreased at two (Pitampura and Okhla). Highest noise levels were recorded at Mayur Vihar Phase II and Janakpuri at 72 Leq dB(A) between 6pm and midnight./According to CPCB data, the air quality index (AQI) at 10am on Saturday was 369, but the value reached 378 at 12pm, 385 at 1pm, 396 at 2pm. By 3pm, the AQI recording had slipped into the ""severe"" zone, at 405./As firecracker bursting continued unabated across the national Capital, by Saturday midnight the AQI had spiked to touch 460, with air quality monitoring stations such as Jahagirpuri maxing out at 500, which is the highest possible recording on the AQI scale. Stations including Narela, Bawana, Vivek Vihar and Alipur also clocked AQI levels above 485, by 12am./With a ban ordered by the National Green Tribunal on November 9, the Delhi Police said it registered 1,206 cases on Saturday for selling and bursting firecrackers, and held 850 people for such offences./In all, the number of people booked and held for selling and bursting firecrackers on Diwali night and in the days preceding it far outnumbered similar action last year when there was a ban only on non-green firecrackers./The police said that people were also able to burst firecrackers because it was difficult for the police to act against those who were bursting them from their homes or from multi-storey buildings. ""We had an active presence in the streets, but there is only so much you can do about such activities in buildings,"" said another police officer./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that the firecracker bursting on Saturday showed that no ban can be implemented without the participation of public and therefore the stress should be on creating awareness among people./""Collective and cohesive framing of problems and solutions at the community level is still a work in progress.This argument by no means is pushing the onus and burden of action to individual decisions and choices and detracting attention from stronger governmental action for good governance. Governments will have to act. But this is about strengthening societal acceptance of difficult action that otherwise get slow because of lack of public support,"" she said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air quality improves in 4 out of 5 Uttarakhand cities this Diwali compared to last year,"India, Nov. 17 -- After monitoring the air quality index of major cities in the state, the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board's data shows that air quality improved in four out of five cities in the state on Diwali this year compared to last year./Only the capital city of Dehradun reported a dip of 14.2% in air quality index this year./The pollution control board monitored air quality during Diwali in five major cities of Dehradun, Rishikesh, Kashipur, Haridwar and Haldwani./The board monitored indices like PM 2.5, PM 10, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide./SP Subudhi, member secretary of the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board said, ""Except Dehradun, all other cities have shown improvement in air quality this year on Diwali when compared to last year, even if it was marginal. In Dehradun, the air quality dipped by 14.2% with an increase in PM 2.5 and PM 10. From our analysis, we understand that the increase in the level of air pollution in Dehradun is due to the bursting of crackers.""/The data released by the pollution control board states that this year the air quality improved by 39% in Rishikesh, 15.4% in Kashipur and around 2% in Haldwani and Haridwar compared to last year on Diwali day./""The improvement of air quality in other cities shows the seriousness of citizens towards an important issue like air pollution. In Haridwar, levels of only PM 10 had increased this year, which can be traced to dust from road construction and development activities underway in the area,"" added Subudhi./According to records, the cumulative air quality index of all five cities this year was registered to be 296 (poor category) compared to 326 last year, with an improvement of around 9.5%./In Dehradun, the two-hour limit fixed by the Uttarakhand government for the bursting of firecrackers on Diwali went up in smoke, with people bursting crackers from evening till the wee hours of Sunday./In an order issued on November 11, the state government had allowed sale and bursting of only green crackers from 8 pm to 10 pm in six cities -- Dehradun, Haridwar, Kashipur, Rudrapur, Rishikesh and Haldwani.

Biomedical waste incineration plant to shift out of Mumbai by Feb 2022,"India, Nov. 20 -- The Maharashtra environment department has directed the city's only biomedical waste treatment facility to commence the shifting process out of Mumbai by December 2021 and complete it by February 2022 to improve air quality in the eastern suburbs./Residents from Govandi, Mankhurd, Deonar and surrounding areas have filed repeated complaints against SMS Envoclean Pvt Ltd, appointed by the civic body to deal with Mumbai's Covid-19 and associated biomedical waste from June onwards, about toxic air and black smoke emitted after incinerating personal protective equipment (PEE) kits, from the treatment facility, allegedly leading to health ailments in the area./State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had directed the treatment facility to be shifted out within a year, and asked the facility to expedite the process of identifying an alternate site for their operations within a month./On Wednesday, Thackeray held a meeting with the facility operators, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and various local leaders./""It was finalised that there would be no incineration or associated emission within Mumbai anymore and for this, a timeline has been charted out, that by December 2021, the plant will be moved out of the city,"" said Thackeray./The plant operators had identified a 3-acre plot at an uninhabited location around 70 km from Mumbai at Khalapur in Raigad district./""The state issued consent to establish the new plant on Wednesday while a no-objection certificate was issued by BMC to move the plant out of Mumbai,"" said Thackeray, adding, ""The current space at Govandi, however, would continue to be used for only holding the city's waste before being transported to the new site. However, incineration followed by emission and other waste treatment procedures will be carried out away from the city.""/SMS plant operators said they were devastated by the decision. ""We do not have any other option. We now have to bear a cost of Rs 50 crore for setting up the entire facility at Khalapur and all efforts made in Mumbai will be wasted,"" said Amit Nilawar, director, SMS Envoclean./Nilawar added that with a drop in Covid-19 cases, the quantity of Covid-19 and other biomedical waste had reduced by 47% since September-October./""We are now receiving 17 to 18 tons per day against 32 tons till October first week. However, we are sending 6-7 tons to another unit in Taloja - Mumbai Waste Management Ltd for treatment,"" he said./A local resident from Govandi, requesting anonymity, said citizens welcomed the decision but hoped that the shifting out process could be expedited.

HTLS 2020: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal hopes 3rd wave may recede if trend holds,"India, Nov. 21 -- Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday expressed hope that, based on positive signs over the last four-five days, the national Capital was crossing the third peak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with the positivity rate of tests and the number of infections consistently declining during this period./The cases in Delhi have surged in their third and the deadliest wave so far, with the positivity rate (the number of those infected as a percentage of those tested) spiking to 15%. The Delhi government recently sought tighter curbs on weddings in city and asked the Union government for approval to lock down market places if they were turning into hot spots./""It appears that there are some good signs in the last 4-5 days. On November 15, the positivity rate was 15%. On November 17, this reduced to 13%. Today, it is 10.5%. In the last five days, the positivity rate reduced by 5 percentage points. It appears that the cases are reducing. We are keeping our fingers crossed. I hope that if this trend continues, then maybe we - the people of Delhi and those from the central government and all organisations - I think we are crossing the third peak,"" Kejriwal said at the 18th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit./Also Read: HTLS 2020: No VIP category should be created for Covid-19 vaccine, says Kejriwal/The Delhi chief minister said that even after 8,593 daily cases recently, the Capital's health care infrastructure did not collapse under the surge of infections, something that was noticed in several metropolises across the world, including New York City. ""A total of 7,500 beds are vacant, and 450 ICU beds are vacant right now,"" he said, praising the efforts of health care workers. ""We will add 1,000-1,500 ICU beds in the next 1-2 days,"" he added./Referring to the intensity of the third wave, the Delhi CM said that experts indicated the disease pattern was aggravated because of increased air pollution. He said the fundamentals of the ""Delhi model"" that his government devised to fight the pandemic a while back - testing, home isolation, public data, hospital beds, and plasma therapy - remained strong even today, and the current situation did not go out of control because of the robustness of this strategy./On Friday, the national capital recorded 6,608 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the infection tally to 517,238 , while 118 deaths in a day pushed the death toll to 8,159./Kejriwal also said that his government was in the process of creating a health information management system that will integrate and track hospitals and other such facilities across the Capital. ""All Delhi government hospitals, mohalla clinics, poly clinics... all will be connected with each other. At the click of a button, you will know on the cloud. what all is available at which hospital. All citizens will be given e-cards and their medical history will be available on the cloud... I hope we will be able to implement it in a year.""/The CM added that the system will begin only with Delhi government hospitals but the plan is to expand it. ""It is a modular structure in which extra things can be plugged in subsequently. In one year, we will try to bring Delhi government hospitals on this. I would like private and central government hospitals to come on board subsequently. The entire health infrastructure of Delhi should be on this platform finally, but in Phase 1, it is going to be only Delhi government infrastructure.""/He said that under the system, when a patient visits a health facility for the first time, their history will be fed in. The details will then keep getting updated with each visit. The CM added that the system, planned for two years, was brought into urgent focus because of the pandemic and the tendering process for it had been completed./Also Read| HTLS 2020: 'Congress has collapsed as a national party': Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal/The Delhi CM said that when the pandemic began early this year, several factors were beyond Delhi's control, leading to the ballooning of Covid-19 cases. ""We found out about the coronavirus in February and March... Indians wanted to return from countries ravaged by the disease at that point. By March 22, about 32,000 people returned and spread across Delhi. We asked DCs to identify them and isolate them but it wasn't practically possible. Delhi didn't start from zero, we started with several thousands.""/When asked which aspect of the disease was the most challenging to tackle, he said the ""rate of the spread of the infection"". ""It spreads so fast. If you are not on your toes 24 hours a day, then your structure collapses.""/He said the Delhi government's decision to begin home isolation for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic cases was a game-changer. ""If all patients come to the hospitals, then we can't manage. Without home isolation, there would have been no beds for serious patients,"" he said./Kejriwal also said that the decision to implement a nationwide lockdown in March was a good move as it gave governments time to build infrastructure and acquire equipment. On the question of whether a lockdown could return in the Capital, he said: ""A lockdown doesn't end corona; it delays the infections. The day the lockdown ends, cases will rise."" He added that governments should clamp lockdowns only when facilities are overrun with infections, emphasising that it was essential to keep up economic activity even while fighting the pandemic./Also Covid: Delhi vs New York comparison by CM Kejriwal amid 3rd wave #HTLS2020/He defended the Covid-19 testing record of Delhi, saying that the government responded to the worsening situation swiftly. ""August 16, when cases started rising [in the second wave], within a week we increased the number of tests. Even now, as the cases started growing, we started testing more.""/Kejriwal said that the accuracy of rapid antigen tests was doubtful, but RT-PCR tests took much longer to return results. ""Ideally, all tests should be RT-PCR,"" he said. But the CM said the turnaround time in these tests was two days on average./The Centre recently announced that it will double the testing capacity in Delhi to 100,000-120,000 with a focus on increasing RT-PCR tests, deploy mobile testing labs and ramp up ICU beds./Kejriwal also said that the entire world was desperately waiting for a vaccine.

Why a new decomposer may hold hope of dousing farm stubble fires,"India, Dec. 5 -- Desperate to control air pollution in the national capital, the Union government in October proposed heavy fines and even jail for polluters, including farmers who were burning paddy stubble, leading to the city's deadly winter smog. Along with three new farm laws, thousands of farmers are also protesting these harsh measures, saying they cannot afford costly alternatives. But trials this harvest season indicate that crop-residue burning could be stopped, or at least effectively controlled, by a new technology that is showing encouraging results./A proprietary microbial solution developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) - usually referred to as the Pusa institute -- that turns biomass, such as rice stubble, into natural manure, has proved to be successful in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, according to scientists behind the project. The Delhi government, which utilised the technology and is strongly promoting it, has also found the experiments to be a success./""ICAR's invention, named Pusa, decomposes crop residue, including paddy straw, and turns it into manure in about 25 days, thus eliminating the need to burn paddy stubble,"" YV Singh, principal scientist of microbiology at the institute, a top state-run facility, told HT./Singh said the technology showed an efficacy range of 70%-80% during in-house open trials. This paved the way for the Delhi government to adopt the technology, drenching over 800 hectares of non-basmati rice fields with the bio-decomposer in the Capital's rural belts for free. The operation, undertaken between October 11 and November 20, cost approximately Rs 20 lakh./A Delhi government panel studied the outcomes of the trials, termed it a success, and recommended expanding its use nationally as its appraisal found that the decomposer turned ""90%-95% crop residue into manure in 15-20 days""./""Delhi has found a solution to the problem of crop residue burning and now no state can now make any excuse,"" Delhi's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters on November 5 after touring rice farms under the project./Assuming farmers in Punjab burn paddy straw in at least two million hectares of rice, it will cost the state Rs 571 crore to fund the use of Pusa decomposer, HT's calculation based on the Delhi government's costs show. This could be effectively path-breaking because the cost is just a fraction of the Rs 6,000 crore the state spends annually on subsiding various farm inputs, from cheap fertilisers to power./Farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop./Since the straw from premium basmati rice, which is mostly exported, is soft enough to be used as fodder, it does not require burning, and has little role in air pollution. The share of basmati in overall paddy output is just 2.1%, official data shows. The residue of non-basmati rice varieties, which account for the largest paddy area, is too hard to be of any economic use, and farmers have long maintained that there is no viable or cost-effective alternative to burning the unwanted stalks./Though Punjab's farmers have increasingly switched to modern machines to efficiently harvest rice, such machines also leave paddy stalks in their wake, leading to stubble-burning, said Manpreet Singh, a farm engineering specialist at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. Automated harvesters are designed to shave off the grainy part of paddy, leaving loose straw behind. Farmers find it cheaper to burn the remnants./Unlike the decreasing landholding size at an all-India level, the operational landholding size in Punjab has increased over the years, making use of larger machines viable, analysts say./Data from the national agricultural census 2011 show that average land-holding size in Punjab has gone up from 2.89 hectares (7.1 acres) in 1970-71 to 3.77 ha (9.3 acres) in 2010-11, much higher than the national average of 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres)./As the westerly winds carry the smoke from the burning stubble towards the national capital, air pollution in Delhi spikes to alarming levels - the air quality index often breaches the ""severe"" level (400-plus) that is hazardous even for healthy individuals. Though local emissions and weather also lead to pollution spikes through the winter, the first wave exacerbated by stubble fires is the deadliest and most intense./Air pollution kills up to an estimated 30,000 people in Delhi annually, according to a 2015 report of New Delhi's Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./Scientists at IARI started on a research project two years ago for a solution to burning of non-basmati straw, a programme involving some of its top scientists and droves of PhD scholars, Singh said./The Pusa decomposer comes in the form of capsules that contain an activated package of eight strains of fungi. ""I can't make the strains public because it is a proprietary formulation and we are in talks with private firms to market it in exchange of royalty,"" the principal scientist added./To prepare a solution of 25 litres, enough to cover one hectare of paddy, farmers need to add five capsules of the propreitory decomposer, along with jaggery and checkpea flour, to water. Within a week, a good layer of fungi admixture is formed./According to A. Amarender Reddy, the principal scientist at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (Crida), microbial agents in the solution act on the straw to make it soft, break down its components and release nutrients into the soil./Singh said scientists were gleaning lessons from actual trials in Delhi. ""Field results are promising, but we are analysing the results to see if we can customise the product further to adapt to different soil environments,"" Singh said./According to Reddy, the findings of trial results - like the one by the Delhi government panel -- are always represented in average terms. Any average doesn't account for variations in individual farms, so it is possible that not every farm has uniform results, he added./The scientist said that use of the solution across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - two other states that add to the Capital's pollution woes - could help control the problem, but added that the solution wasn't a silver bullet./""It is not a magic solution which you spray and stubble vanishes. It works best as part of integrated stubble-management approach,"" Singh said./For instance, scientists pointed out that farmers should carry out laid-down drills, leaven the stubble with additional equipment, and adhere to prescribed temperatures while storing and spraying./In Punjab, which reports far more fire incidents than Haryana (cumulatively between October 1 and November 3, Punjab saw 79093 fire incidents this year compared to 50738 in the corresponding period last year, according to Indian Agriculture Research Institute's satellite surveillance), the government has authorised the use of eight farm equipment, including the so-called ""happy seeder"". Individual farmers can avail 50% subsidy to buy these machines, while farmer groups are eligible for up to 80% subsidy. These machines cost between Rs1.40 lakh to Rs.1.60 lakh. The tractor-mounted ""happy seeder"" can be used to sow wheat without the need to clear the straw./""But the problem is farmers still prefer burning because of lack of awareness and cost issues,"" said HS Sidhu of the Borlaug Institute for South Asia, who was one of the developers of the ""happy seeder""./Analysts say more studies of the Pusa decomposer should be conducted urgently across various farm zones. If the results are encouraging, the decomposer should be included among farm technologies that are eligible for subsidy, they add./""Any technology, to be successful, needs scalability. Therefore, the government should invest in any solution that is promising. Testing across agroclimatic zones should be the way forward. Look at Covid-19. Afterall, humankind was successful in developing a vaccine in such a short time,"" said Rohini Mali, an independent consultant, who was formerly advisor of food systems, FAO in Rome/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Bad-air law drafted, cleared in less than a week","India, Dec. 9 -- It took less than a week in October for the environment ministry to draft and promulgate an ordinance mandating a commission to monitor air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR), a Right to Information (RTI) reply has revealed, showing that the process of framing the law started only after the top court ordered the formation of a committee (a different one) to track pollution./On October 16, the Supreme Court said it was setting up a committee headed by former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur for monitoring stubble burning and air pollution in the NCR and nearby areas, considered to be some of the most polluted in India, particularly in the winter months when post-harvest crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana causes the capital to be shrouded by smoky haze./Five days after the SC order, the ministry started the process of setting up CAQM (Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas) with statutory backing and on October 24, it requested the court not to constitute the panel./The SC agreed to the request./""The first draft of the Ordinance was created on October 23, 2020,"" the reply to an RTI application filed by this correspondent said. And the Ordinance was promulgated on October 28, it added./The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020 mandated the statutory body to adopt a consolidated approach towards monitoring, tackling and eliminating causes of air pollution in Delhi-NCR by coordinating with state governments which, however, were not consulted on the law./The ordinance replaced the 22-year-old Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) which introduced several important interventions to control pollution. According to the Ordinance, based on court orders, various ad hoc committees like the EPCA had been formed to assist in the implementation of court directives, but the new commission would subsume them./The commission works under the supervision of the central government and comprises members from all NCR states and the Central Pollution Control Board, apart from ministries such as petroleum and natural gas, agriculture and commerce. The commission is empowered to take decisions and act against sources of pollution under various laws like the Environment Protection Act and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act./Former petroleum secretary MM Kutty was appointed as the first chairperson of the commission on November 7./Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Prasoon Tripathi, in the RTI reply on December 2, admitted that there had been no consultations with the states or public on the draft. This was in reply to a question whether the state governments and public had been consulted on the important air pollution mitigation legislation./""The ministry of law and justice was consulted. The ministry of law and justice promulgated the draft for its promulgation,"" the reply said./He did not provide the file notings and different versions of the draft law before the ordinance was promulgated, saying the file was not with him. ""As and when the file is received to the undersigned, the relevant information will be provided.""/An environment ministry functionary familiar with the development said the commission was set up in a short time to initiate a coordinated effort to control air pollution in NCR./""The government was swift to act and provided a platform of all stakeholders including the civil society to become part of the government's effort to control air pollution,"" he said, requesting anonymity./Legal experts said the new commission had become a hub of civil servants./""It is obvious that the environment ministry was not keen on another SC appointed committee to monitor air pollution. So, it promulgated the Ordinance, (creating the commission) which is dominated by bureaucrats. Of the 15 members, only three members represent NGOs. The majority of ministries engaged in actions that contribute to the pollution such as that of power, housing and road transport are there but crucial ones such as rural development and health are missing. No farmer body has been included even though stubble burning is said to be main cause of air pollution in northern India,"" said Ritwick Dutta, an environment lawyer./The central government has effectively taken control of anti-pollution measures in the Delhi-NCR, as is evident from the fact that the chairperson of this commission is a central government appointee, said Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research think tank./""The enforcement mechanism is clearly top down and so far there is no indication that it will include third-party monitoring and citizen-driven enforcement,"" she said./On Tuesday, the air pollution levels in Delhi and National Capital Region was between very poor to severe with Ghaziabad being the most polluted city with Air Quality Index (AQI) of 415. Many towns in Uttar Pradesh such as Bulandshahr and Kanpur reported AQI of more than 400. Delhi had AQI of 386, which meant that the capital's air quality was poor despite lesser number of vehicles on road because of Bharat Bandh called by farmer bodies demanding repealing of three farm laws./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

900 Bihar farmers to miss out on govt subsidy for stubble burning,"India, Dec. 11 -- In a bid to discourage stubble burning, the Bihar government has initiated strict action against 900 farmers in the last three months post paddy harvesting season by blocking government incentives and subsidies paid through direct benefit transfer( DBT) for three years in 11 districts./Bihar is the only state in India where such a system has been put in place since last year, linking government incentives for farmers with compliance to the ban on stubble burning- a major factor for air pollution. Total 1.64 crore farmers are registered with the State agriculture department for DBT transfers./With 462 penalised farmers, Rohtas district tops the list of offenders who have been denied the DBT assistance, followed by 133 in Kaimur and 100 in Nalanda, shows data assessed from the agriculture department. Rohtas and Kaimur are the major paddy growing districts in Shahabad region./Other districts where farmers have faced action include Buxar (93), Bhojpur (21), Patna (33), Gaya (40) and Jamui (7). The blocking of subsidy transfers by the government means the farmers will not get aid for procuring farm equipment, input subsidy etc, which are directly transferred to the accounts of farmers registered with the state agriculture department./""The aim of blocking the DBT to farmers is to disincentivise the practice of stubble burning. The exercise has been undertaken by strict monitoring of the farm lands by our agriculture coordinators and kisan mitras, who report about erring farmers from remote areas,"" said, secretary, agriculture, N Saravana Kumar./Kumar said the government was not in the favour of filing FIRs against erring farmers but the blocking of DBT could turn out to be an effective method./""We are doing awareness programmes in the districts to tell the farmers how burning of crop-residue not only causes air pollution but is also bad for the soil as it damages the micro nutrients in the soil,"" Saravana said./Last year, DBT to 376 farmers were blocked after the post-Kharif season and this year, post Rabi season in February- March, 625 farmers were blocked./""This system of blocking DBT to farmers is only in practice in Bihar. It is proving effective as farmers cannot get benefits for three years, which is a long time,"" said a senior agricultural officer./Stubble burning is rampant during the post Kharief and Rabi crop season harvesting, when farmers burn the waste to dispose of the crop residue, causing air pollution. Delhi and other cities, especially in north India, have been grappling with extreme air pollution caused by stubble burning./Also Read: Bad-air law drafted, cleared in less than a week/In Bihar, the problem of stubble burning may not have reached alarming levels like in Haryana and Punjab but farmers have been using the practice more in the last few years due to huge residue left in the farms after the harvest due to wider use of combine harvesters./""In Bihar and other states, the growing mechanisation of farming has led to heavy stubble burning in the last few years as the waste generated is huge post harvest by equipments, Besides, farmers are not much interested in keeping husk for sale as there is less demand for it in rural areas these days due to less focus on animal rearing,"" said Dr Bihari Singh, environmentalist and co-ordinator, environmental sciences, Nalanda Open University./Also Read: Confronting everyday sources of pollution across the country/He listed the ill-effects of stubble burning. ""Smoke from the crop residue emits heavy quantities of carbon dioxide, suspended particulate matter and other harmful particles that affect the air quality index (AQI). It is one major reason for air pollution in cities and towns in the state,"" Singh added./Singh said the practice of burning of crop residue could be checked if the government encourages farmers to make compost through short-term methods after harvesting as it would enrich the soil and cause less air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

National Clean Air Programme: Ludhiana MC to restart mechanical sweeping,"Ludhiana,, Dec. 17 -- (Hindustan Times) -- With the deteriorating air quality in the industrial hub becoming a cause for concern for authorities and residents alike, a slew of government departments have joined hands with the civic body under the National Clean Air Programme./Under the programme, the municipal corporation (MC), Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), forest department and industries department have been brought under one roof./Since the Union government has sanctioned Rs 26 crore for the city under the national clean air programme (NCAP), cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu conducted a meeting with officials of different departments at the MC's Zone D office on Wednesday and directed them to collectively prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) regarding measures taken to reduce pollution. Mayor Balkar Singh Sidhu, MC commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal and senior officials from other departments were in attendance. The officials said that with Ludhiana, being an industrial hub with over 90,000 industrial units and thousands of vehicles plying on city roads, is one of the nine non-attainment cities (areas with air quality worse than national ambient air quality standards) in Punjab./The city's air quality index has surpassed 300 and ventured into the 'very poor category' on numerous occasions, particularly, when stubble burning was at an all-time high or during Diwali. Doctors say the poor air quality has led to breathing discomfort among people with asthma, heart and lung diseases. It has been decided that the MC will restart mechanical sweeping of roads to reduce the quantity of particulate matter and dust in the air./Officials said the civic body will commence trials of mechanical sweeping this week. Funds allocated under the NCAP will be used to purchase the machine./The project was put on hold in 2018 after objections were raised on the working of the company and payment of bills. Similarly, many other points were discussed, including installation of intelligent traffic lights, timely repair of potholes and stubble burning./Apart from the four monitoring stations being installed by PPCB, the MC has also proposed to install 15 more environmental monitoring stations in the city. Currently, only one monitoring station is operational in Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). Eight screens will also be installed by PPCB at different points to display the pollution levels in the city./PPCB superintending engineer Sandeep Bahl said a source apportionment and emission inventory study was done in the past and as per the study, road dust contributes to 28% of the air pollution, bio-mass burning 18%, vehicular pollution 16% and industrial pollution 35% to the total air pollution./As per the 15th finance commission, funds have been allocated to urban local bodies for improvement of air quality and under this programme, Rs 52 crore has been allocated to Ludhiana city, of which Rs 26 crore will be sanctioned and released to the MC, said Bahl./Ashu said all the departments have been directed to work on this project collectively and residents have been urged to support the administration./""We aim to reduce the air pollution in the city and a road map is being made for the same. All the departments will submit their reports in a week or two, following which we will start working on ground level and regular review meetings will be held to increase efficiency,"" said Ashu./With the civic body working to establish micro forests alongside Buddha Nullah to increase green cover in the city, the forest department officials have also been directed to establish micro forests within the city. Ashu said that till now the focus of the forest department was on areas outside the MC limits but now authorities have been directed to chalk out a plan to increase green cover in the city./With thousands of diesel auto rickshaws plying on city roads causing air pollution, it has been decided to prepare a new report to phase out the diesel auto rickshaws and introduce e-rickshaws in the city./Ashu said different departments including the Regional Transport Authority and traffic police have been directed to prepare the report in two weeks./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi suffered most loss due to air pollution: Study,"India, Dec. 23 -- Among Indian states, Delhi suffered the highest per-capita economic loss because of premature deaths and illnesses caused by air pollution last year, followed by Haryana, according to a study published on Tuesday by the science journal The Lancet, which highlighted the price being extracted from the nation by bad air./The study said India was bearing massive losses to its economy and productivity because of the health impact of air pollution. National GDP suffered a loss of 1.36% because of air pollution last year, it said. In comparison, the total health expenditure in India is only 3.8% of GDP. In 2019, 1.67 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution, accounting for 17.8% of the total deaths./Delhi's per-capita state gross domestic product (GDP) loss in 2019 was to the tune of $62 and neighbouring Haryana suffered a per capita GDP loss of $53.8, said the report titled ""Health and economic impact of air pollution in the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study, 2019""./The highest loss to overall state GDP was recorded by Uttar Pradesh, India's most populated state, at 2.15% followed by Bihar at 1.95% and Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan at 1.7% each. These are states with a relatively low per-capita state GDP./GDP per capita measures the sum of marketed goods and services produced within a territory, averaged across everyone who lives within it./Delhi has ranked consistently among the world's most populated cities in global surveys in recent years because of emissions from automobiles and power plants, as well as construction dust and cooking with solid fuels. The problem worsens during the winter months, when the capital gets shrouded by thick, smoky haze because of post-harvest farm fires lit by cultivators in states such as Punjab and Haryana to clear their fields of stubble./The Capital suffered an overall economic loss to the tune of 1.08% of state GDP last year because of both outdoor and indoor pollution, according to the Lancet report. The comparative figures for UP and Punjab were 1.34% and 1.22%, respectively./Between 1990 and 2019, the death rate per 100,000 population has increased by 115.3% in India because of exposure to high outdoor air pollution. The death rate because of exposure to household air pollution has decreased by 64.2%because of a decline in the use of solid fuels. The death rate due to exposure to ground level ozone increased by 115% during the 29-year period./It estimated that economic loss caused by premature deaths due to air pollution in India last year was $28.8 billion and from morbidity due to air pollution was $8 billion. Of the total economic loss of $36.8 billion, 36.6% was from lung diseases, which included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (21.1%), lower respiratory infections (14.2%), and lung cancer (1.2%), The rest was from ischaemic heart disease (24.9%), stroke (14.1%), diabetes (8.4%), neonatal disorders (13.3%), and cataract (2.7%)./""The most common cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) globally is tobacco smoking; more than 90% of COPD cases are liked to smoking. But in India one of the main causes of COPD is air pollution, particularly indoor air pollution,"" said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. ""PM 2.5 emissions can go up to 30,000 micrograms per cubic metres when food is being cooked with solid fuels in a closed kitchen.""/""When it comes to the health impacts of outdoor pollution, it is important to understand what are the pollution particles made of - it being emitted from burning of rubber, kerosene or diesel etc. For example, diesel emissions are carcinogenic because they consist of polyaromatic hydrocarbons which have a role in development of lung cancer. A majority of deaths caused by air pollution is due to COPD,"" he added./The economic impact of air pollution was estimated by the authors based on output per worker. The output per worker in each state in 2019 was calculated as the labour share of GDP multiplied by GDP in 2018-19, divided by the number of people who were employed./""Air pollution has the potential to impede accumulation of future human capital by reducing children's survival, undermining their health, and reducing their ability to benefit from education. The cost savings resulting from the prevention of productivity losses attributable to air pollution would contribute to the formation of new human capital,"" the study said./It cited the example of the US where every dollar invested in the control of air pollution since 1970 is estimated to have yielded an economic benefit of $30./""The economic impact of this health loss due to lost productivity is huge at 1.4% of the country's GDP in 2019, besides a roughly estimated expenditure of 0.4% of GDP on treatment of air pollution related diseases. The health and economic impact of air pollution is highest in the less developed states of India, an inequity that should be addressed,"" said Prof Lalit Dandona, director of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, national chair of population health at the Indian Council of Medical Research and senior author of the study./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

61% of active Covid-19 cases in Delhi's 5.5k hot spots: Delhi govt data,"New Delhi,, Dec. 25 -- Around 61% of active Covid-19 cases in Delhi as on December 22 were in areas demarcated as containment zones, up significantly from 35% in mid-November, when the national capital was at the peak of its third wave of coronavirus disease cases, according to Delhi government data./Additionally, the Capital had a far greater number of containment zones on December 22, as against mid-November, even though the city has seemingly passed the third wave of infections, and daily new infections are lower now than during than the former period./As on December 22, Delhi recorded 12,189 total active cases, of which 7,438 (61%) were in the city's 5,501 containment zones. In comparison, on November 15, the Capital had 43,774 active cases, of which 15,242 (35%) were inside the 4,430 containment zones demarcated at the time./The government attributed the sharp increase in the share of active Covid-19 cases in red zones to its micro-containment policy, which was intensified in November./In fact, till early-December, they also allowed containment zones to be notified with less than three cases identified in close proximity, based on a risk assessment by district surveillance officials. The Capital had 6,501 containment zones on December 11 - the highest count so far, government data showed. It further showed that even though the next 11 days saw a drop in the number of active containment zones (from 6,501 to 5,501), it still remains higher than the number on November 15 (4,430)./As new Covid-19 cases in the national capital have continued to decline for around three weeks now, seven out of 11 districts recorded less than 1,000 active cases as on December 22 - compared to only one such district on November 15./Delhi added a daily average of 1,186 new cases in the seven days ending December 22, down significantly from the 6,697 daily average infections it added in the seven-day period ending November 15 - a period that coincided with increased crowds owing to festivities, and hazardous levels of air pollution./State revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, ""Delhi witnessed the third wave of Covid-19 in November, which was the worst so far. During that phase, the government decided to go for an aggressive strategy of creating micro containment zones. The idea was to arrest the spread of the disease at the earliest by bringing in a higher proportion of cases under scaled-up surveillance. Micro containment zones were created wherever district officials assessed transmission risk. The efforts have shown good results and Delhi is in much better shape now.""/Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, ""Containment zones witness scaled up surveillance and concentrated efforts on the fronts of testing, tracing, health checks, etc. So, a higher proportion of active cases in containment zones is a good sign. It shows that the government has done better in identification and demarcation of such red zoned. It also shows that scaled-up efforts have succeeded in reducing Covid-19 cases in Delhi.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Amplifying reach, fake science biggest challenges to vaccination","India, Jan. 2 -- The Oxford-AstraZeneca and Bharat biotech vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are all set to get the Drug Controller General of India nod for restricted emergency use, with the priority vaccination of health workers, frontline workers and older populations scheduled to begin in January. India aims to vaccinate around 300 million people over the next six months./The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine costs US$5-6 per dose, but it will be given free to those who need it under the Central government's vaccination drive. Bharat Biotech has not disclosed the price of its Covid-19 vaccine. ""The vaccines are free not just in Delhi but the entire country,"" said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday./The UK became the first country to approve the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on December 30 and will begin vaccination before India on January 4. Only India has cleared the Bharat Biotech vaccine for approval./Vaccines work. Mass vaccination led to the global eradication of smallpox in 1979, with the last case reported in Somalia in 1977. Before its eradication, variola virus that causes smallpox infected at least 50 million people annually in the 1950s and killed around 300 million in 20th century, compared to the 100 million people who died in wars and armed conflict in the same period./Not getting vaccinated not just leaves people unprotected but fuels the unfettered spread of disease. Politics and fake science are fuelling safety concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine on social media even before it's approved for use in India. Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said, ""I am not going to get vaccinated for now. How can I trust BJP's vaccine.?"", while former Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy tweeted if Indians were going to be guinea pigs./Politically-motivated leaders, discredited researchers, and uninformed influencers can mislead people with little or no understanding of science, which has led World Health Organisation (WHO) to list ""vaccine hesitancy"" as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019, along with air pollution and climate change. Vaccine hesitancy is a reluctance or refusal to get vaccinated despite availability and affordability of a vaccine./With fake science spreading within minutes on social media, the Central and state governments and public health professionals have the additional task of debunking emotionally-charged rumours./Dr Harsh Vardhan, a trained clinician who led India's polio eradication efforts both in Delhi and the country as the state and then the national health minister, fired an opening salvo on Saturday and said people should reject misinformation rumours against the new Covid-19 vaccines. ""I appeal to people to not believe in any rumours. Different kinds of rumours were spread during polio immunisation, but people got their children vaccinated, which led to India being declared polio free. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine is the government's priority, and these will not be compromised,"" said Dr Harsh Vardhan./Conducting nationwide innoculation campaigns is not new to India. Mass vaccination ended smallpox in the country within a year of the disease devastating Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal in 1974, when India recorded at least 61,000 cases and 15,000 deaths. The last indigenous case was reported in the Katihar district of Bihar on July 5, 1975, following which India was declared small-pox free in 1977./Following extensive nationwide vaccination drives, India was officially declared polio-free in 2014, three years after the last case was reported in West Bengal on January 13. Massive outreach programmes to dispel conspiracy theories about the polio vaccine being a birth-control tool targeting Muslims in parts of western Uttar Pradesh and Bihar finally led to reduction in cases. Polio cases declined from a global high of 741 in 2009 to one in 2011. Interrupted vaccination coverage has led to polio persisting in Pakistan and Afghanistan, which together reported 451 cases in 2020, according to data reported to WHO till Dec 30./Even before the Covid-19 pandemic interrupted vaccination services, unfounded rumours about the safety of measles-rubella vaccine had slowed coverage in some states despite the vaccine saving at least 21 million lives globally since 2000./The biggest challenge is ensuring vaccines reach those who need it as soon as possible. ""Priority populations will not account for more than 10% hence need a plan for general population or else we too will encounter suboptimal vaccination rollout like US. Government should consider 50:50 deployment for three months and then lift restrictions to augment access. Why not have 50:50 split in vaccine deployment between priority and general population?"" tweeted Kiran Majumdar Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon Limited./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Lockdown may have pushed communities back to traditional cooking fuels: Study,"Chandigarh,, Jan. 7 -- A study has raised concerns that the Covid-19 lockdown may have impacted the transition towards clean cooking fuels in the country, suggesting that there was an immediate need to frame policies to address long-term changes, such as switching back to traditional cooking fuels in the current era of fuel transition./The study that appeared in the Environment International journal, published by Elsevier on December 28, last year, was conducted jointly by scientists from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Panjab University, Indian Council of Medical Research and Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Emory University, Atlanta./Policy actions for clean fuel transition/""Focus and target policies to the poor and other marginalised populations to ensure sustained uptake and transition to clean fuels and intensified efforts to involve direct engagement of private entrepreneurship for continued clean cooking fuel provision is required,"" the study recommended./The researchers have also recommended for Covid-specific packages to be introduced for the severely affected communities to deal with the economic impact of the lockdown, beyond what has already been implemented./The researchers have also stressed on development of reward mechanisms to ensure sustained use of LPG. For example, if the household commits to using only LPG, the cost of the second cylinder of fuel could be waived./""The nationwide lockdown is likely to affect key factors such as energy access, income, transportation, that play a key role in decisions influencing household fuel use. The rural population already bears the burden of poverty and may not be able to afford and access clean cooking fuels during the lockdown. They are, thus, vulnerable to reversion to their traditional cooking methods using solid biomass fuels,"" said Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, one of the authors from the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER./The household air pollution caused due to the use of polluting fuels increases their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases, and thus may intensify the risk and severity of Covid-19 infection. Hence, there was an urgent need to expand sustainable energy solutions worldwide, the study said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution raises childhood anaemia risk: Research,"India, Jan. 11 -- Meeting air pollution control goals under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) could go a long way in improving child health in India, a new research paper has concluded, finding a strong correlation between high outdoor pollution and prevalence of anaemia among children under the age of five years./A research led by the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi and Harvard University's TH Chan School of Public Health found that on a district level, for every 10 micrograms per cubic metres increase in outdoor PM2.5 exposure, average anaemia prevalence increased by 1.9% and average haemoglobin level decreased by 0.07 g/dL (grams per decilitre)./At an individual level, for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre increase in ambient PM2.5 exposure, average haemoglobin decreased by 0.14 g/dL among children under the age of five. PM 2.5 are fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters that are generally 2.5 microns, or about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair./Also read | Air pollution raises risk of pregnancy loss in India, south Asia: Lancet study/The researchers used data from the national family and health survey 2015-16 to examine the association of anaemia with high PM 2.5 levels. ""We collected the geo-location of the children covered in the National Family Health Survey data. We derived their exposure to PM 2.5 concentrations based on the year of their birth to the time of the survey. The data was adjusted for diet, maternal anaemia prevalence and body mass index all of which has a bearing on anaemia prevalence,"" said Sagnik Dey, coordinator of the Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA) and associate faculty at the School of Public Policy, IIT Delhi. The team used satellite data for calculating air pollution concentrations./For the district-level analysis, exposure was derived based on the five-year average ambient PM2.5 exposure per district while individual level analysis was based on the year of birth./""Our analysis reveals that apart from diet and other known causes of anaemia like maternal anaemia, air pollution also plays a significant role in anaemia development and prevalence. We have also discussed the biological mechanism through which air pollution could be a risk factor for anaemia. But that can be only confirmed through a cohort study (studies on groups of people to investigate the causes of a disease),"" added Dey./High air pollution levels have been associated with adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, and mortality outcomes. For children, it has been associated with low birth weight and stunted growth in past research./As of 2016, nearly 60% of children in India were anaemic. The introduction of the National Iron Plus Initiative in 2011 sought to expand the beneficiaries of the National Nutritional Anaemia Prophylaxis Programme to children aged 6-59 months. ""Although anaemia decreased by about 11% between 2006 and 2016, it remains a major issue despite an increase in available food fortified with iron. It is clear that other potential risk factors for childhood anaemia must be identified and understood,"" the study observes./The NCAP doesn't have a legal mandate but aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 concentrations from the 2017 levels in over 100 cities by 2024./""Chronic inflammation can affect the production of red blood cells. It can also affect the way iron moves inside the body or iron trafficking which is mediated by cytokines. We believe that it is the same mechanism by which air pollution raises the risk of low birthweight and preterm births. Inflammation is the biggest link between air pollution and anaemia. But definitely cohort studies would make this linkage clear,"" said Kalpana Balakrishnan, the director of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)'s Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution shot up in some northern towns last year despite lockdown,"India, Jan. 14 -- A new analysis has found that air pollution increased in small towns and cities outside Delhi and NCR in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region last year./Even though the average PM 2.5 levels for summer and monsoon months last year is considerably lower than in 2019, winter pollution levels increased in Punjab and Haryana (north of NCR) leading to an increase in their annual average PM 2.5 levels./Bigger cities and towns including Delhi recorded a significant reduction in annual PM 2.5 concentrations during the pandemic year. Delhi for example recorded an almost 13% improvement in 2020 compared to 2019./The analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment suggests air pollution levels spiked in certain parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains mainly because of a combination of reopening of the economy after the national lockdown (March 25 to May 31 and phased reopening till December) and adverse meteorology in winter./Several bigger cities have witnessed a reduction in annual PM 2.5 levels, smaller towns and cities have recorded an increase: Fatehabad in northern Haryana is the worst performer with 35% increase from 2019 level. It is followed by Bhatinda at 14%; Agra 9%; Khanna 7%; Mandi Gobindgarh 6%; Moradabad 5.5% and Kurukshetra recorded a 1% increase./Sirsa recorded a 44% decrease in PM 2.5 levels; Varanasi 31%; Gaya 27%; Muzaffarpur 13%; Delhi 13% and Hisar recorded a 12% reduction among others./CSE used real-time data (15-minute averages) for 26 cities in the IGP region from the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) Central Control Room for Air Quality Management for the analysis. The analysis highlights that Fatehabad which recorded the highest increase in PM 2.5 concentrations last year and Sirsa which recorded the highest improvement are only 40 km apart./""Therefore, this massive variation cannot be attributed to meteorology and has to do with local factors. The annual average of these towns along with other smaller towns like Hisar and Jind in the north-west is heavily influenced by episodic pollution caused by burning of crop stubbles. The influence is so strong that it can elevate their monthly PM2.5 levels for November to that of Delhi's, but unlike Delhi, these towns are directly exposed to the smoke. The elevated November levels do not linger on for the rest of the winter in these towns (as is the case in Delhi),"" said Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager in CSE's Urban Lab team of the Sustainable Cities programme./""This brings out the impact of the extraordinary disruption that 2020 has caused. Despite the dramatic reduction in air pollution during the lockdown, pollution has bounced back across the region post-lockdown unmasking the high impacts of local and regional pollution. This demands quicker regional reforms and action to curb pollution from vehicles, industry, power plants and waste burning to further bend the air pollution curve on a regional scale,"" explained Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Early lockdown in Delhi had less impact on air quality: Report,"India, Jan. 14 -- The first Covid-19 lockdowns led to significant changes in urban air pollution levels in Delhi and other major cities around the world, but the changes were smaller than expected, a new study by an international team of experts led by the University of Birmingham has concluded./Published in 'Science Advances' on Thursday, the researchers evaluated changes in ambient NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), O3 (ozone) and fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations arising from lockdown emission changes in 11 global cities: Beijing, Wuhan, Milan, Rome, Madrid, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Los Angeles and Delhi after developing new corrections for the impact of weather and seasonal trends./The experts discovered that the beneficial reductions in NO2 due to the lockdowns were smaller than expected, after removing the effects of weather. They also found in parallel that the lockdowns caused (weather-corrected) concentrations of ozone in cities to increase./Scientists at Birmingham used machine learning to strip out weather impacts and seasonal trends before analysing the data: site-specific hourly concentrations of key pollutants from December 2015 to May 2020./The study also revealed that concentrations of PM2.5, which can worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease, decreased in all cities studied except London and Paris./Lead-author Zongbo Shi of the University of Birmingham said: ""Rapid, unprecedented reduction in economic activity provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of interventions on air quality. Emission changes associated with the early lockdown restrictions led to abrupt changes in air pollutant levels but their impacts on air quality were more complex than we thought, and smaller than we expected./""Weather changes can mask changes in emissions on air quality. Importantly, our study has provided a new framework for assessing air pollution interventions, by separating the effects of weather and season from the effects of emission changes,"" the expert added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Action on old vehicles, traffic congestion in Delhi's plan against air pollution","New Delhi, Feb. 2 -- The task of curbing air pollution in Delhi will now require even state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana to report action taken against polluting diesel and petrol vehicles that are over 10/15 years old once in every two months to the Commission on Air Quality Management, the body set up by the Central government to curb pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas./This was stated by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in an affidavit submitted before the top court during the hearing of a set of petitions dealing with air pollution in Delhi./The affidavit highlighted the steps taken by the broad-based Commission having representatives from states adjoining Delhi along with representatives from Central ministries and representatives of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control authorities./The Commission, appointed in November 2020, identified five focus areas while tackling the issue of pollution in Delhi-NCR. These included industrial pollution, agricultural stubble burning, municipal solid waste management and biomass burning, construction and demolition activities and vehicular pollution./During the interactions with representatives from Delhi and neighbouring states, the Commission noticed lack of enforcement against polluting, over-aged vehicles not just in Delhi but in neighbouring districts of the national capital. The neighbouring states also did not have a traffic management plan in place to tackle vehicular pollution./Also read: CAA rules are under preparation - Govt tells Lok Sabha/The affidavit said, ""It was strongly reiterated that such overaged petrol/diesel vehicles more than 15/10 years of age, must not be allowed to ply in NCR at any cost and if found doing so, shall be taken off the roads immediately.""/Accordingly, the Sub-Committee on ""Safeguarding and Enforcement"" working under the Commission on January 8 this year, prepared a reporting format to be submitted by Delhi and adjoining states every two months. This format has details about over-aged vehicles impounded, traffic congestion spots identified and resolved, new pollution under control (PUC) centres added, existing and proposed car parking facilities, and additional CNG fuelling stations./On industrial polluting units, the Commission examined nearly 6,642 units operating in Delhi-NCR, of which 3,138 were found to be using clean fuel (CNG/PNG). The Commission set a deadline of January 31 for remaining 2,904 units (Haryana -2220, UP- 420, Rajasthan-151) to convert to clean fuel./On stubble burning, the affidavit said that the Commission's focus was on crop residue management by which the paddy straw, that is usually burnt, could be cut using farm machinery and used by other industries as the source of fuel. The affidavit said, ""Stubble burning and pollution arising therefrom is a major area of concern, particularly during the months of October-November. The Commission identified Crop Residue Management as one of the priority areas.""/To facilitate this, the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmer Welfare, under the Central government, has developed an app-based aggregator platform for hiring and renting of farm machinery required for stubble cutting. The app called FARMS (Farm Machinery Solutions) has nearly 1.47 lakh individual farmers and over 22,000 custom hiring centres (CHC) across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh. Nearly 1.58 lakh machines have been supplied to individual farmers and CHCs through the app and other financial incentive schemes, the affidavit stated./Though the issue of stubble burning affects the quality of air in Delhi during the winter months, the Commission is focusing on crop residue management as a technique to curb stubble burning incidents. The top court has expressed concerns over stubble burning after a public interest litigation (PIL) filed before the Court pointed out that pollution caused by stubble burning can impact mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease./In 2020, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh reported a decline in stubble burning incidents but Punjab reported a 15 per cent increase. In Haryana last year, 5,000 farm fires were reported as compared to 6,652 in 2019. Punjab reported 76,590 farm fires as against 52,991 in 2019./On Tuesday, the apex court took up the PILs on stubble burning and air pollution in Delhi but adjourned the matter after two weeks. The Centre's affidavit will be examined by the Court on the next date of hearing./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Kejriwal meets with experts, says will launch project to identify real-time pollution sources","New Delhi, Feb. 9 -- To study and control real-time pollution sources in the national capital, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday held a meeting with researchers from IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi and The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), before announcing that the Delhi government will work with the researcher teams to launch a ""real-time source apportionment"" project in Delhi.The government will also set up an advanced monitoring system of real-time pollution sources, the chief minister said./Kejriwal on Tuesday tweeted, ""IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur and Teri have developed technology for real-time source apportionment of pollution. Had a meeting with their experts. We will work with them to implement it in Delhi. If we know source of pollution on real-time basis, it will help us take immediate action (sic).""/While the technology to carry out real-time source apportionment of pollution already exists in the country, the team of scientists headed by IIT-Kanpur will be effectively implementing this project in the national capital./Mukesh Sharma from IIT-Kanpur, who is heading the project, confirmed that the team made a presentation before the chief minister on Tuesday and the complete implementation of the project might take around five to six months./""The real-time monitoring of pollution sources will help the Delhi government to take immediate action against these sources. The chief minister has directed senior officials to work on the matter and also to submit a proposal before the cabinet. After the cabinet clears it, work will start in full swing,"" the Delhi government said in a statement./The statement added, ""This technology will also clarify the factors responsible for the spike in air pollution at a particular spot. It will also help to study the real-time effect of vehicles, dust, and smoke from factories. Based on the results obtained, the Delhi government will be able to take the necessary action to curb sources of pollution.""/A senior official of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said the team of scientists, headed by professor Mukesh Sharma, civil engineering department, IIT-Kanpur, has given a presentation on the technology./""The project is still in its initial stage. We have suggested a few recommendations to the team and we are hoping that in a few months, we will be able to implement the project in Delhi,"" the official said, wishing not to be named./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pune to get six more air quality monitoring systems,"India, Feb. 10 -- PUNE The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) will be setting up six more air quality monitoring systems in the city./The city will receive Rs.50 crore funds from the Union budget to set up the continuous ambient air quality monitoring system (CAAQMS) and undertake other works. The funding will be done in a phase-wise manner, said officials./Other cities which will be receiving funds from the state are Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Nashik and Nagpur./Mumbai has been allocated with a budget of Rs.232 crore while other cities will get Rs.50 crore each./""Till now there was only one system in Pune city. Now that the area has widened in past few years, installation of six new systems will help to monitor air quality in a better way,"" said an official from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Pune, on condition of anonymity./Along with Pune, MPCB has also decided to add 41 new stations across the state. Currently, there are 101 air inspection quality centres in the state out of which 78 centres are manual and 23 are monitored via continuous ambient air quality monitoring system./According to officials, there are also other criteria like controlling industrial smoke, vehicular emission, biomass burning which should be checked to improve air quality./The urbanisation and increase of vehicular movement have deteriorated the air quality of the city. ""MPCB undertakes preventive measures to control air pollution, but lack of public support has made things harder for us. In the coming days, we will also launch a few more programmes in the city to raise awareness about air pollution,"" said the official quoted above./Last year, in the same initiative, Pune city had received funds of Rs.62 crore./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Over 30% deaths in '18 caused by fossil fuels: Study,"New Delhi, Feb. 10 -- Over 30% of deaths in India in 2018 were caused by air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, a new study conducted by scientists from Harvard University, University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London have found. Researchers estimated that exposure to particulate matter from fossil fuel emissions accounted for 18% of total global deaths in 2018, which was around one out of five./The study, which has been published in Environmental Research, a peer-reviewed journal, states that more than 8 million people are killed each year by air pollution from burning fossil fuels like coal and diesel. However, topping the global charts in the most number of such deaths was India and China./China had the highest premature mortality with 3.91 million deaths and India accounted for 2.46 million deaths./Data collected by the researchers showed that in India, Uttar Pradesh, where 471,456 additional deaths were reported because of fossil fuels, reported the maximum deaths caused by exposure to fossil fuel fumes. This was followed by Bihar with 288,821 deaths caused by fossil fuel burning and West Bengal, where 276, 312 such deaths took place./The study also stated that Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu also reported over 1 lakh (each) such deaths./Scientists said that while previous researches on similar areas relied on satellite and surface observations to estimate the average global annual concentrations of airborne particulate matter, known as PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), the satellite and surface observations were unable to tell the difference between particles from fossil fuel emissions and those from dust, wildfire smoke or other sources./In this study, however, the scientists have used a more advanced technology of GEOS-Chem, a global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry, which has a high spatial resolution./This means that the researchers could divide the globe into a grid with boxes as small as 50 km x 60 km and look at pollution levels in each box individually./""Rather than rely on averages spread across large regions, we wanted to map where the pollution is and where people live, so we could know more (about) exactly what people are breathing,"" said Karn Vohra, a graduate student at the University of Birmingham and first author of the study./Environment and health experts stressed on the need for governments to control the use of fossil fuels and check on the emissions caused by it, to prevent such premature deaths./""When we see that deaths from fossil fuel combustion exceed deaths from malaria by a factor of 20, we must recognise that this is a major global health crisis,"" said Sarah Hsu, executive vice chair, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University./""...As healthcare workers, we have the obligation and opportunity to save millions of lives by advocating for clean energy, divesting from fossil fuels, and de-carbonizing our healthcare facilities,"" Hsu said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi's fight against pollution set to get smarter,"India, Feb. 10 -- The Delhi government will start in six-seven months its first source apportionment project and real-time monitoring of pollution, tools which will be employed to make better strategies to curb air pollution in Delhi./Source apportionment is the practice of deriving information about pollution sources and the amount they contribute to ambient air pollution levels./The new model was finalised after a meeting on Tuesday between Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and a team of scientists from IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi and The Energy Resources Institute (TERI). The scientists made a presentation before the chief minister and said that the new system will not just provide data on the concentration of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) in the air, but will also give information on the constituents of these fine particles, a first for the national capital./In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Delhi government said, ""Source apportionment project in Delhi, along with setting up of an advanced monitoring system of real-time pollution sources will help in monitoring sources and allow Delhi government to take immediate action against these sources.""/According to a Swiss based group, IQ AirVisual, Delhi was listed as the world's most polluted capital city for the second straight year in 2019. The study measured the concentration of hazardous PM2.5, particles that are less than 2.5 microns in diameter and can be carried deep into the lungs, as higher PM2.5 levels could cause deadly diseases, including cancer and cardiac problems. Every winter, the city's air turns toxic with the air quality mark reaching emergency levels on several days./Explaining the new model, scientists involved with the project said the collection and assessment of data will be done at two levels -- through a 'super site' and through 'mobile air labs'./Advanced air quality monitoring equipment will be set up at the 'super site' in different locations where hourly data for pollutants will be recorded. Scientists said these sites will not only provide data on levels of PM 2.5 in that location at any given point of time but will also give details of the composition of ultrafine particles, using which the exact source of pollution can be traced./""These 'super sites' will help authorities act immediately against the sources. Apart from short-term action, the recordings will facilitate long-term analysis, helping agencies draw up policies. For instance, the agencies will know which pollution sources are consistently contributing to the pollution levels in an area and action can be taken to tackle it permanently,"" said Mukesh Sharma, professor (department of civil engineering), IIT-Kanpur, who led the team of scientists during the meeting with Kejriwal./""Daily variations can depend on temporary things like construction activities or high traffic movement but if it is persistently contributing to the poor air quality in an area then solutions need to be drawn,"" Sharma added./Currently, Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) air quality monitoring stations provide hourly average data on PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last year started real-time monitoring at 13 pollution hot spots./At a more micro level, the scientists are also developing 'mobile air labs', which will move around the city and record pollution levels and specific sources at a particular period of time./Sumit Sharma, director, earth science and climate change division, TERI, who is also involved with the project, said air quality models will also be used to record details such as from where the pollution is coming and what could be the strategies to control it./""The Delhi government told us very clearly that they have source apportionment studies available with them, but those studies are static studies giving details for a particular period of time. They (government) wanted daily and hourly data of emissions and which sources are contributing to these levels, using which effective strategies can be made to control it,"" Sharma said./A senior DPCC official said they have enlisted some recommendations before the team of scientists to tailor-make the technology for Delhi. ""We will further improve the system but we can say for sure that this technology will help us monitor pollution sources more effectively,"" the official said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Dense fog likely, air quality gets worse","India, Feb. 12 -- The city and its adjoining areas are likely to witness dense fog and haze for the next two days due to low wind speed, leading to rise in the air pollution levels, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday./On Friday, Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida were the top three polluted cities of country -- a second in the past four days -- with the pollution monitoring agencies seeing no respite for the next three days./According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Ghaziabad on Friday was 375 ('very poor') -- worst in the country just like on February 9 and 10 -- against 356 on Thursday. Similarly, Noida's AQI was 363 -- second most polluted city in country -- against 311 a day earlier, followed by Greater Noida with an AQI value of 352 against 344 a day earlier./An AQI between 101 to 200 is considered 'moderate', between 201 and 300 is 'poor', between 301 and 400 is 'very poor' and above 400 is considered 'severe'./According to weather analysts, the wind speed on Friday dropped as the region fell into a low pressure area and is likely to continue to be so till Sunday./""The region will see dense fog on Saturday, bringing down the visibility to around 100 metres,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD./The experts said that temperatures are around season's average only but the wind speed are very low. ""Due to low wind speed during the morning hours, the condensation of moisture would continue. Also, since the low speed of winds leads to accumulation of particles, the haze formatting will be there. This could bring the visibility down to less than 100 metres from early morning hours to about 9am,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency./Meanwhile, the minimum and maximum temperatures for Noida were recorded at 12.6 degrees and 26 degrees Celsius, respectively./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), not much change in the pollution situation is expected over the next few days. ""Surface winds are low and wind speed is likely to marginally improve during day time. The ventilation is likely to stay in the same range and no significant change in AQI is expecting for the next couple of days. AQI is likely to stay in the very poor category for the next two days. AQI likely to marginally improve to lower end of very poor to poor category is forecasted for February 15,"" said a SAFAR statement on Friday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
