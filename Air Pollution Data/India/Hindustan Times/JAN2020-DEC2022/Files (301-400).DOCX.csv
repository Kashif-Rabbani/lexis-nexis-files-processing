Prayagraj: Poor air quality in Sangam city poses health threat to residents,"India, Nov. 13 -- With the onset of winter, the side effects of air pollution have increased in Sangam city. Air pollution can cause various ailments including breathing related problems, and can even harm vital organs like heart, lungs, eyes, skin and cause acute respiratory infections./To check air quality, UP Pollution Control Board has installed automated electronic devices at three places which include Jhunsi, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) and Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC). The air quality index (AQI) at Jhunsi on Friday was at 324g/m3, at MNNIT 279g/m3 and at PMC 111g/m3, which were above the prescribed AQI standard of 50-100g/m3./As the air quality in the city is deteriorating, a number of medicos, officials of transport department and weather experts have recommended caution to the people./Former president of Allahabad Medical Association (AMA), Dr MK Madnani says, ""Asthma is a respiratory disease caused by environmental pollution wherein the person feels difficulty in breathing, a feeling of pressure in the chest and cough, causing phlegm. These are caused from allergies.""/Air pollution could also be dangerous for the eyes. Ophthalmologist Dr Kamaljeet Singh says, ""Pollution affects the cells of the eyes, due to which the problem of dryness, redness and pain increases in the eyes. Due to the presence of elements like nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and Sulphur dioxide in the polluted air, there is more damage to the eyes.""/According to kidney specialist Dr Anurag Singh, Environmental pollution is extremely dangerous for the kidney. Heavy metals floating in the air and reaching the body through food get trapped in the kidneys. In recent times, the prevalence of kidney diseases has increased due to pollution./""If we start getting clean air and water, then not only the kidney gets benefitted but also the spread of diseases will get reduced,"" he adds./Senior dermatologist of the city, Dr KG Singh says, ""Pollution in the air is dangerous for the skin as this makes it lose its moisture and leads to various problems, including redness, rosacea and eczema. Due to this, fine lines, wrinkles and spots start appearing before time.""/To cut air pollution from vehicles, transport office has also taken several initiatives. ""Vehicles are being checked regularly but still lot of awareness has to be spread. People should participate in the workshops conducted by us and understand how they can save the environment. The department is continuously taking action in collaboration with the Pollution Control Board,"" says regional transport officer (RTO), Prayagraj, RK Maurya./Regional environment officer RK Singh says, ""Weather is also deteriorating air quality index in the city as lack of a bit strong winds (blowing at a speed of 10 to 15 kmph) has affected the AQI.""/""However, the situation is now improving gradually as the incidents of stubble burning have come down in the district. We are also monitoring the constructions sites to check air pollution,"" he says./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Among world's 10 most polluted cities, 3 are from India. Check full list here","India, Nov. 13 -- Mounting levels of air pollution in Delhi, exacerbated by a hazardous amalgamation of smoke from farm fires in the nearby states and the city's local pollution sources such as vehicle emissions, have triggered concerns of a health emergency. Meanwhile, the air quality and pollution city tracking service from IQAir, a Switzerland-based climate group that is also a technology partner of the United Nations Environmental Program, has shown that there are as many as three cities from India on the list of ten cities with the worst air quality indices./While Delhi tops the list with an average AQI of 556 as listed by the IQAir service, Kolkata ranks fourth and Mumbai sixth in the entire list. The cities with the worst AQI indices also include Lahore, in Pakistan, and Chengdu, in China./Here are the ten cities with the worst air quality indicators and pollution rankings, according to IQAir:/-/1.

Farm fire smog: Bathinda sees six days with half of normal bright sunshine hours in November,"BATHINDA, Nov. 13 -- Punjab's Bathinda district in November so far has witnessed six days with no more than half of normal bright sunshine hours amid a blanket of haze as the burning of paddy stubble continues unabated in the state./Moreover, the district saw zero bright sunshine hours on Thursday, according to the observatory of Punjab Agricultural University's regional research centre./On Friday too, hazy conditions prevailed in the morning and there was no sunshine in the afternoon. The exact details of bright hours for the day will be released on Saturday./Senior agrometeorology scientist at PAU Raj Kumar said the drastically reduced sunshine time was due to heavy smog in air. ""Weather conditions are dry for over two weeks and there should have been complete bright sunshine time for average 8-10 hours per day. But as the burning of crop residue in the fields is being reported across the state, bright sunshine hours are adversely impacted,"" he said./On three days of November, bright sunshine was seen for six hours, and one day, full sunlight was recorded for seven hours. November 1 was the only day when the sunshine hour was recorded for full 8 hours./Paddy harvesting in southern Punjab gained momentum from November 1 and there has been a spike in the number of farm fires in the region since./Seven districts of the south Malwa belt have reported a daily average of 1,672 farm fire cases since November 1, adding up to the air pollution./Sunil Mittal, dean of school of environment and earth sciences at Bathinda-based Central University of Punjab, said reduced bright hours are also likely in the adjoining districts of Malwa as smog conditions are similar. A blanket of pollutant particulate matter created in the atmosphere has lowered the surface temperature by 3 degrees Celsius than the normal temperature./""Such conditions during the winter are conducive for various viral infections. Reduced sunshine hours are expected to stay for another 10 days and smog might cause serious discomfort to vulnerable sections,"" said Mittal./On Friday, 3,403 farm fires were reported in Punjab and 1,421 incidents were recorded from seven districts of south Malwa./Maximum 619 fire incidents were reported from Sangrur. Moga, Ludhiana, Patiala, Bathinda and Barnala districts reported more than 200 fire cases./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi schools shut but CBSE board exams as per schedule,"India, Nov. 13 -- The Central Board of Secondary Education on Saturday said that the Term 1 board exams for Classes 10 and 12, slated to begin from Tuesday, will be held according to the schedule even as the Delhi government announced suspension of in-person classes for a week from Monday in view of the hazardous levels of air pollution in the national capital./The first of a two-part system of board examinations this year will be held in-person, starting Tuesday. There are over 2,100 CBSE-affiliated schools in Delhi. Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examinations of CBSE, said, ""The closure directive is for other classes and not board exams. Board exams for classes 10 and 12 will take place as scheduled. There is no change.""/Schools were shut in March last year when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). While in-person classes for students in grades 9-12 restarted in September, schools reopened for physical classes for students in all grades on November 1./School administrators said they will comply with the government's order but raised concerns about the adverse impact on the learning gap that school closure might cause. ""If the government has directed schools to suspend physical classes, we will have to comply with the orders. We are yet to receive the written order but have informed parents. Switching back to online classes will not be very difficult since online classes are already taking place in a hybrid manner,"" said Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools' Conference which has over 120 top Delhi schools as its members./She said that the need of the hour was to find sustainable solutions since the closure of schools were not conducive. ""Closure of schools over pollution is now becoming an annual affair. This is not sustainable. One cannot keep schools closed for three months starting from November. The impact of the learning gap created through school closures will heavily impact children in the long run. We must take steps to counter pollution,"" she said./Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said the school informed the parents, but was waiting for a written directive and clarity on board exams scheduled for next week. ""We have a board exam on November 19. Now, we are waiting for instructions and clarity on how the exam will be conducted. Teachers will have to be in school for the mock exam as well. We will have to work out the logistics based on what the board tells us,"" said Joshi./She said the school will have to rework its schedule in view of the closure of in-person classes. The school had planned children's day celebrations on Monday which will now take place online. ""There is a little disappointment among students now. There is uncertainty over the board practical exams as well that we had planned for next week. The only silver lining is that teaching will not be affected since we are used to online classes due to covid,"" said Joshi./Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said that the school will revert to its old timeline based on online classes once written orders from the department of education are issued. Arora said that most schools were in the process of conducting board practicals and will need to tweak the exam schedule once written orders are issued./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Winds help improve air quality but Delhi's air stays very polluted,"India, Nov. 14 -- The smoke grey skies over Delhi opened up a little on Sunday with long-range transport level winds that bring stubble emissions slowing down, pushing the air quality back into very poor zone from the severe recorded on Saturday, even as the city registered the season's coldest morning at 10.1 degrees Celsius./The national capital is in the grip of a severe pollution episode prompting the Supreme Court on Saturday to order the central and Delhi governments to take emergent steps, including a two-day lockdown.Hours later, the Delhi government announced shutting of schools for in-person classes, a four-day ban on construction and ordered its staff to work from home for a week./Delhi recorded an average air quality index (AQI) of 330 in the very poor category, down from 437 (severe) recorded on Saturday. According to the Centra Pollution Control Board data, the air quality on seven of the first 14 days in November was in the severe zone; it was very poor on six days and remained poor for one day./Doctors have warned that even short-term exposure to such polluted air may cause irreversible damage to critical organs of even healthy individuals./Forecasting agencies said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's overall air pollution mix fell to 12% on Sunday from 31% on Saturday./Even at 'very poor', CPCB's health advisory states the air quality can cause respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure, indicating the improvement in the air quality index was only a temporary respite. Forecasts show the AQI is expected to stay in the 'very poor' category over the next two days, despite a slight deterioration./""The air quality over Delhi improved to 'very poor' from the 'severe' category and is likely to remain in the 'very poor' category for the rest of Sunday. It will deteriorate slightly, but will remain in the 'very poor' category on Monday and Tuesday,"" the daily bulletin issued by the Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi said. The EWS is a part of the ministry of earth sciences' forecasting model./According to the EWS, wind speeds from northwest of Delhi have slowed down and were blowing at 4 km/hr on Sunday. The wind speed expected to be remain similar on Monday as well. On Tuesday, the wind speed could reach up to 8 km/hr./The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), another government forecasting body says while the number of farm fires have increased in the last 24 hours, touching 3,445 fires as compared to 3,157 on Saturday, the stubble share has reduced, owing to a reduction in transport-level winds./It stated restrictive measures will help the air quality positively, however, the AQI could start deteriorating from Tuesday night as wind conditions once again become calm./While activities to prevent pollution from spiking further, such as the ban on construction activities in Delhi till November 17, kicked into action from Sunday onwards, other restrictive measures such as the ban on physical classes at schools and making government offices work from home will kick into place from Monday onwards./Karthik Ganesan, Fellow and Director - Research Coordination at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) says while the new measures are welcome, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) needs to be rethought./""It must be implemented as an ex-ante emergency measure, by considering air quality forecasts and not waiting for the situation to worsen for 48 hours or longer. We have the science that gives us an indication of things to come, given how meteorology plays a significant role in the deterioration this time of year. Delayed implementation, when pollution breaches the severe level, risks the possibility of seeing little to no impact, thereby further reducing the confidence of the public in the impact of restraining economic activity,"" he said./Dr Col Vijay Dutta, Internal Medicine & Respiratory Medicine at the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre says 'very poor' may be a category slightly better than 'severe', but its impact remains quite similar. ""Pollution levels are still very high and anyone going out needs to use masks to minimize inhalation of toxic air. Any form of physical activity also needs to be avoided. Even healthy people can develop breathing, lung problems and even cancer in the long run, if there is exposure to such air,"" he said./At 10.1 degrees, Delhi's minimum temperature was three degrees below normal and the lowest so far this winter. Before this, the lowest was 11.1 degrees Celsius on Saturday.

Delhi govt to submit proposal on lockdown to SC today to tackle air pollution,"India, Nov. 15 -- The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi will submit a proposal on imposing a lockdown and its modalities to the Supreme Court on Monday in view of the rising air pollution in the Capital./It comes days after the top court asked the central and city governments to take immediate steps to improve the air quality in Delhi and suggested measures such as stopping vehicles and clamping a lockdown in the national capital./With the onset of winters, Delhi's air quality plunges to hazardous levels every year due to stubble burnings, emissions from transport, coal-fired plants outside the city and other industries, as well as open garbage burning and dust./This year, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in and around the city has worsened to 470-499 on a scale of 500, according to federal pollution control board data. That level of pollution means the air will seriously impact people with existing diseases and even those who have healthier lungs./With the situation continuing to remain grim, the AAP government ordered the closure of schools till November 20 and asked all government offices in Delhi to work from home, starting from Monday.

Explained: Delhi's air pollution spikes year-round,"India, Nov. 15 -- Factors in play (to be plotted in a graphic)/January and February: Extremely low temperatures and low mixing height, with moderate to dense fog in the morning. Low temperature and moisture in the air traps pollutants close to the surface. Both months witness 'severe' air days./March and April: Wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly, and temperature begins to rise. The mixing height increases, allowing pollutants to disperse freely./May and June: Temperatures peak during this period, which is good for dispersal of pollutants. But, a combination of local winds and south-westerly transport-level winds bring large quantities of dust from Rajasthan./July, August and September: South-easterly and easterly winds start blowing from the Bay of Bengal as precursor to monsoon winds, and bring moisture and rain to Delhi. Rain settles pollutants, as pollution levels stay at their lowest./October, November and December: Monsoon withdraws, and wind direction changes to north-westerly that bring emissions from stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana. This coincides with a drop in temperature. December generally sees the first 'very dense' fog spell of the year, with temperatures dipping below 5 degrees Celsius. This makes it difficult for pollutants to disperse./What conditions generally lead to smog in late October and early November?/The south-west monsoon withdraws by the first week of October. This triggers a change in wind direction and north-westerly winds start blowing from Punjab and Haryana through the Indo-Gangetic Plains, all the way up to West Bengal. These winds are colder and dryer as compared to the south-easterly winds blowing earlier, leading to a drop in temperature by the end of October. The winds also bring pollutants from stubble burning towards Delhi. Farm fires start to pick up pace October 15 onwards. Firecracker burning on Diwali, celebrated during late October or early November, combined with stubble emissions lead to a smog./Why it spikes in the end of December?/Stubble burning has completely stopped by this time of the year. Pollution spikes largely becauses temperatures dip to 1-3 degrees Celsius. Colder air slows down dispersal of pollutants and brings down the mixing height, trapping pollutants close to the ground. Delhi also sees fog spells at this time, as the moisture also traps pollutants in the air./What is behind the third pollution spike?/In summers, dust is the most prominent pollutant, characterised by high PM 10 concentration in the air. A third spike is generally observed towards the end of May and early June, when south-westerly winds from Rajasthan bring coarser particles towards Delhi, while farm fires in the neighbouring Haryana and Punjab during the Rabi harvest season, towards the end of May also brings a stubble emissions. Finer pollutants disperse easily due to high temperatures but dust can still stay in the air. Instances of trans-boundary dust pollution, coming all the way from the West Asia have also been reported across NCR in the past, leading to 'very poor' to 'severe' air in the summer./What is the role of temperature?/Low temperatures not only make the air heavier and slows down pollutants, but it also brings down the mixing height -- an invisible layer of the atmosphere within which pollutants mix. The closer this layer drops to the surface, the lesser the space for pollutants to mix freely./How does fog causes spike in pollution?/Moisture in the air traps pollutants and makes them heavier, not allowing them to disperse easily. This can lead to a constant haze in the air that dissipates only when there is adequate sunlight leading to warmer air./How far can stubble emissions travel?/Satellite data shows stubble emissions can travel all the way across the Indo-Gangetic plains. However, they start dispersing after a few hundred kilometres, and generally lose their potency after crossing Delhi-NCR. The longer the distance they travel, the lesser their impact./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"SC slams Centre, Delhi govt on Capital's unending air crisis","New Delhi, Nov. 15 -- The Supreme Court on Monday lamented that it was being ""forced to set the agenda"" on the pollution crisis in the National Capital Region (NCR) as it pulled up the Delhi government for ""passing the buck"", the Centre for not proposing ""drastic measures"", and NCR states for doing little to control what has become an annual public health crisis./In a hearing on Monday, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, gave the Centre and state governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh 24 hours to hold an emergency meeting and prepare a list of urgent steps that can be put in place immediately to bring down the levels of pollution in the ""forseeable future""./""We want you to come out with concrete action plan by tomorrow. All the three governments and the Centre (must) come out with concrete steps. Otherwise, don't blame us for passing any direction we deem appropriate,"" said the bench, fixing Wednesday as the next day of hearing./The bench, which also included justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, listed out the areas of concern, including work for home for all offices in Delhi, and dissuading farmers from burning stubble for two weeks in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh./The focus of the court, however, was clearly on emergency mitigation to control local sources of pollution, asking for the Centre and states to focus on curtailing activities such as construction, traffic and road transport, industries, and power plants./""It is very unfortunate we have to set an agenda for the governments. When we heard this matter on Friday, we thought you will conduct a meeting and come up with something concrete. But nothing is there... tell us about the drastic steps that you must take to bring down the levels of pollution in the next two-three days,"" the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre./It reiterated that the Centre and Delhi government should consider a lockdown of a few days in the national capital to control the road traffic and vehicular pollution, besides curtailing road dust which, according to the governments, has been a prime cause of pollution./The court's directions come at the time when pollution in the region has oscillated between ""severe"" (400-plus) and ""very poor"" (300-400) - hazardous levels on the air quality index (AQI) scale - as they do every year in the first few weeks of November, and none of the measures put in place by administrations at various levels seem to have worked. Except for Sunday, when it was 330, the AQI has been at the upper end of very poor or well into severe category since Diwali on November 4./Farm fires/When the hearing commenced on Monday, senior counsel Vikas Singh, appearing for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey, blamed politics for not taking action against farmers even though stubble burning has been a major contributor to air pollution in the pre-winter weeks. He said that because Punjab and Uttar Pradesh go for the assembly polls next year, no steps are being taken./""We don't want any politics. We only want pollution to come down. We are not concerned with election or politics. Let us see how pollution can be brought down,"" retorted the bench./On his part, the S-G read out from the affidavits filed by the Union government regarding the steps taken by various authorities, and conceded that stubble burning is not a chief contributor to the worsening air quality. He said that farm fires contributed a meagre 10% to the bad air a day ago and they are problematic only during the two months in the pre-winter and winter weeks./""Are you agreeing in principle that farm fires is not a chief reason for rise in pollution? So, all the hue and cry over farm fires actually had no legal, scientific or rational basis... your own affidavit shows that stubble burning contributes only 4% annually. So, we are trying to target something which is an insignificant source of pollution,"" said the bench./It pointed out that the Centre's own submissions showed that 75% of the pollution is due to three factors -- industries, road dust, and vehicles. ""If we have to reduce the pollution drastically, you will have to focus on these three factors to see the effect in the next few days. So, you have to tell us what are the steps that you plan to take immediately. Why don't you stop plying of vehicles in Delhi for two days? This is a decision you have to take,"" said the bench./It noted that although some decisions were taken by the authorities over the last two days, they ""have not yet indicated the broader steps that they are going to take to control the factors which are responsible for poor air quality.""/""The moment we say something, you start saying we are overreaching, etc. But what to do when we need to even fix the agenda of your meetings,"" it remarked./The court also pulled up the counsel for the Punjab government for not taking effective steps to mitigate the issue. ""In your affidavit, you are very loudly saying that you have imposed fines on farmers for stubble burning in terms of the order of the National Green Tribunal. But why are you completely silent on what incentives are providing to these farmers? You don't disclose anything in your affidavit about incentivising them and what you propose is just a paper exercise,"" it commented./Lockdown in Delhi?/Mehta responded that certain drastic measures in contemplation included imposing a lockdown in the Capital, besides completely stopping entry of trucks in Delhi. However, the S-G added, experts have advised that these steps could wait./Senior counsel Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said that the city government was willing to impose a lockdown but this will have to be implemented through the NCR, including the cities in Delhi's adjoining states of UP and Haryana./""We are only concerned about bringing down the pollution levels. You need to decide what steps are to be taken,"" replied the court./The Delhi government was also reproached by the bench when it could not give out details of the road cleaning machines that were deployed in the national capital. Instead, Mehra submitted that BJP-headed municipal corporations should apprise the court of these details./""You are only passing the buck. Your lame excuses will force us to hold an audit of revenue you are earning and spending on popularity slogans. People are suffering and you are not bothered,"" the bench told Mehra./Mehra said that the city government is willing to take all possible steps and would also release more funds for the machines immediately./The court then adjourned the hearing to Wednesday, asking the Centre and states to enumerate the steps to be taken immediately./The air quality crisis in the Delhi has been an annual affair with recordings illustrating the problem only 2015 onwards. A significant change of meteorological parameters and the combination of two man-made factors - farm fires and Diwali celebrations - invariably combine to push the quality of air into zones unfit for breathing./Beginning mid-October, winter conditions begin to develop, marked by a drop-off in winds. These winds come in from the northwest, as opposed to the southeast during monsoon, and carry ultrafine PM2.5 particles that originated as smoke from farm fires./This period is also the peak for farm fires as farmers clear paddy stubble left behind after harvest - this year, 77,997 fires were spotted between October 1 and November 14, according to the Suomi-NPP satellite's VIIRS algorithm. This is the second highest number of fires for this interval seen since 2012 -- the earliest year for which this satellite has data -- after 2016, when 94,803 fires were observed by the satellite./Diwali celebrations, which too fall in October-November period, further add to the air pollution temporarily as people burst firecrackers despite a long-standing ban./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World COPD Day: Tips to manage a lung attack,"India, Nov. 16 -- Lung attacks or lung exacerbations are experienced by about a third of those suffering from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People diagnosed with this chronic disease often find themselves having a tough time to breath./COPD is a disease that obstructs air flows from the lungs, hampering one's ability to carry out daily chores with ease. A number of processes cause the airways to become narrow. There may be destruction of parts of the lung, mucus blocking the airways, and inflammation and swelling of the airway lining, as per WHO (World Health Organization)/Dr S K Jindal, Director, Jindal Clinics and former Professor & Head, Pulmonary Medicine, at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research tells us more about the disease, symptoms of a lung attack and stages of COPD on the occasion of World COPD Day (November 17)./How to diagnose a lung attack or a COPD episode/A person suffering from COPD may experience severe breathlessness, increased coughing, chest congestion, sudden heart palpitations, wheezing and a feeling of desaturation in the body. ""Many a times doctors may also diagnose the attack by looking for symptoms like cardiac arrhythmia, pneumonia and viral infection in the upper respiratory tract that may also be prevalent in COPD patients and can be life threatening in nature,"" says Dr Jindal./Stages of COPD/People diagnosed with mild and moderate COPD can often carry out daily activities with difficulties like breathlessness and cough. While those suffering from severe and very severe stages of the same often are bed ridden due to increased breathlessness. It affects their quality of life and restricts their movement. People with severe stages of COPD have difficulty in having food, going to the restroom and carrying out other daily tasks. Severe COPD patients can experience total respiratory failure or loss of breath./COPD is usually classified into four main stages namely: mild, moderate, severe and very severe./""A special exercise to strengthen the muscles used for breathing can help in dealing with the disease. However, in severe cases, a lung transplant or surgery may be recommended to help improve lung function. Most important, avoid self-medication and only take medicines prescribed by the doctor. Also, take inhalers regularly as prescribed by the doctor,"" says Dr Jindal./Treatment/Treatments are generally carried out based on the severity of the diseases and the number of excavations that have occurred due to various complications, says Dr Jindal./The treatments primarily consist of inhalation using proper dilators; drugs such as Albuterol and Ipratropium are also used. Severe cases may require nebulisation drugs with oral bronchodilators and other antibiotics./""Oral steroids are also given if the patient has more excavations and is suffering from C or D type of COPD. These are mainly given to clear acute flare ups in the airway after which basic treatments like respiratory rehabilitation, different respiratory exercises and nutrition intake are followed by,"" says the doctor./Management of lung attack/COPD is not a reversible disease and is a chronic disease that deteriorates lung function progressively over time. Though it can easily be treated in the early stages through inhalation therapy and respiratory rehabilitation methods that can improve the overall condition of your health and thus reduce the severity of symptoms./Lifestyle changes/""The best way to prevent COPD is to never start smoking, and if you smoke, quit. Also, stay away from second-hand smoke, which is smoke from burning tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, or pipes as smoking and air pollution are the biggest contributors to COPD,"" says Dr Jindal./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air quality dips again, deteriorates to very poor zone in Gurugram","India, Nov. 16 -- After improving for a day, Gurugram's air quality again dipped to the ""very poor"" zone, according to Central Pollution Control Board's classification on Monday. The city reported an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 332 with Particulate Matter (PM)2.5 as the prominent pollutant./On Sunday, Gurugram had reported an AQI reading of 287./An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe""./According to the weather bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR on Monday evening, the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally but remain in the ""very poor"" category on Tuesday and Wednesday. Over the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of ""very poor"" category in this region with PM2.5 as the predominant pollutant. PM 2.5 is fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters of 2.5 microns. PM 2.5 pollutants are made up of hundreds of chemicals that can enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system and cause asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease./Over the next two days, the ventilation index - a measure of air pollution based on the speed of the wind and the height of the column of air in which smoke or other pollutants mix - in Delhi-NCR will be 3,000 m2/s on Tuesday and 1,500 m2/s on Wednesday. Experts say a ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s, along with an average wind speed less than 10kmph, is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants./The weather bulletin also mentioned that on Sunday, Haryana reported 195 farm fires./In the past few days, Delhi-NCR witnessed ""severe"" air quality due to which on Sunday, the Haryana government ordered that all schools will be shut in four districts - Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar -till November 17. The Delhi government too, on Saturday, announced the closure of all educational institutions for a week, and imposed a four-day ban on construction activities./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution levels shoot up further in Mumbai, AQI at 269","Mumbai, Nov. 16 -- A day after air pollution levels touched a season high of 245 on the air quality index (AQI), pollution levels shot up further on Tuesday, peaking at 280 in the morning, and then dropping slightly to settle at an index value of 269 by evening. An AQI of 269 falls in the ""poor"" category, which, as per the Central Pollution Control Board, can cause ""breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.""/This is as per data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) network of 10 monitoring locations across the city./Gufran Beig, meteorologist and project director, SAFAR, explained that a buildup of moisture in the city has allowed the air to retain a larger quantum of particulate matter pollutants, like PM2.5 and PM10, pushing up the AQI in almost all monitoring locations./According to IQ Air, a Swiss air quality technology and monitoring company, Mumbai's air quality on Tuesday evening made it the seventh most polluted city across major cities globally. Delhi was the second worst, while Kolkata came in at number 10. IQ Air follows more stringent air quality guidelines laid down by the United States of America's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as per which the AQI of all three Indian cities fell in the ""unhealthy"" category./Experts attributed the spike in pollution - particularly particulate matter (PM) - over the past two days to an incursion of moisture after the formation of a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea off Maharashtra's coast. Air quality had also dipped to the ""poor"" category this month on November 5, a day after Diwali, when the AQI touched 215. However, the overall AQI as presented by SAFAR is an average of its city-wide network, which shows significant geographic variation./Colaba continued to register the city's most polluted air with an AQI of 370 on Tuesday evening (up from 345 on Monday). This was in the ""very poor"" category, which, as per the CPCB can cause ""respiratory illness on prolonged exposure."" Other locations with ""very poor"" air on Tuesday included Mazagaon at 331 (up from 325 on Monday) and Malad with an index value of 327 (up from 306 on Monday). ""Very poor"" air persisted in Bandra-Kurla Complex which recorded an AQI of 311 (314 on Monday)./Only Andheri registered a significant improvement in air quality, with a ""moderate"" AQI of 183 (down from a ""poor"" reading of 259 on Monday). Meanwhile Chembur (183), Borivli (159), Worli (142), Bhandup (125) and Navi Mumbai (183) all recorded ""moderate"" air on Tuesday, with slight deteriorations from Monday. ""Moderate"" air quality can cause ""breathing discomfort to people with lung disease such as asthma, and discomfort to people with heart disease, children and older adults,"" as per the CPCB's health advisory./""Because of the low-pressure area, moisture laden winds have started blowing over the city, pushing up the humidity levels. When this happens, the air becomes heavier and is able to hold pollutants, especially PM2.5 and PM10, to a greater capacity. This is why haze has accumulated over some parts of the city. Locations with higher AQI are very likely also more humid, such as in south Mumbai. At the moment, winds are not strong enough to disperse this haze but there may be some relief tomorrow due to rains,"" Beig said, pointing out that parts of the South Konkan and adjacent area, including Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri coast have already begun receiving thunderstorms as of Tuesday evening./Rising humidity levels have also coincided with an uptick in temperature over the past week, with Tuesday's daytime maximum settling at 35.7 degrees Celsius (two degrees above normal), up from 35.2 degrees Celsius a day prior. This was after maximum daytime temperature dropped to a monthly low of 32.8 degrees Celsius on November 7./Mornings in the city have also been getting warmer, with Tuesday's minimum nighttime temperature settling at 25.4 degrees Celsius - four degrees more than normal - up from 24.4 degrees Celsius a day prior. On November 11, the minimum temperature was 19.8 degrees Celsius. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to remain above normal till Friday, as per IMD's seven-day forecast for Mumbai./""We were expecting it to rain in Mumbai on Tuesday, but the influence of the low-pressure area is being felt more in south Maharashtra. Northern Raigad, Mumbai and parts of interior Thane will get rains either Tuesday night or Wednesday. There is a likelihood of thunderstorms continuing till early Friday,"" said a meteorologist with the IMD's regional forecasting centre in Mumbai./The highest daytime maximum temperature recorded this month in Mumbai was on November 14, when the mercury touched 36.6 degrees Celsius. Last year, the highest temperature recorded in November was 36 degrees Celsius (on November 15 and 18)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Winter can increase risk of heart attack. Tips by cardiologists to take care of your heart,"India, Nov. 16 -- Winter season in India is awaited by many as the chilly weather lets us indulge in good food and endless cups of tea and coffee. The season however may spell trouble for people with heart disease as several studies suggest increase in cardiovascular events like heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmia during winter./As the temperature drops, our body and heart have to work extra hard to maintain a healthy body temperature. This may strain our heart and increase risk of heart failure in people whose heart function is not up to the mark./Why winter is problematic for heart patients/""With fall in temperature, an alteration occurs in the physiology of the body to keep it warm. Low temperature tends to activate sympathetic nervous system and along with that it increases secretion of catecholamines. This in turn leads to constriction of blood vessel which thereby results in increase in heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and aggravates the blood clotting process. All these detrimental effects eventually increase the risk of heart attack,"" says Dr. Atul Mathur, Executive Director, Interventional Cardiology and Chief of Cath Lab - Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, Okhla, New Delhi./""Additionally, your heart has to work harder during winter to maintain a healthy body temperature. People who are already having heart problems, those who are having high blood pressures and heavy drinkers and smokers are at increased risk during cold weather,"" says Dr Charan Lanjewar, Interventional Cardiologist and Honorary Consultant at Global Hospital, Parel, Mumbai./Other factors/Dr Mathur says there are other factors like air pollution, decrease in physical activities, emotional stress, poor dietary habits and increase incidence of viral infection during winter also that increases the risk of heart attacks and failure./""Those patients who suffer with poor heart function known as severe LV dysfunction are at much more higher risk in this season, because they have a tendency of fluid accumulation within the body that leads to difficulty in breathing,"" says Dr Mathur./The season of respiratory illnesses/Winter months are also the time when various illnesses, such as the flu and pneumonia, strike. Respiratory illnesses in particular are a real stress on the heart, especially for older people. If you have pneumonia, your oxygen is low and you have to work harder to breathe, which increases heart rate. When you're sick like that, there's a lot of physiological stress, says Dr Lanjewar./""Various scientific studies done all over the world have shown an increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the winter season. This may be due to seasonal variations in the levels of vaso active peptides and well as physiological changes like increased cutaneous vasoconstriction. Hence patients with heart disease need to be extra careful during winter seasons,"" says Dr Naeem Hassanfatta, Consultant Cardiologist, Wockhradt Hospital./How to keep your heart safe during winter/* Dr Mathur advises to wear warm woolen clothes, gloves, hat to keep body warm./* Avoid excess alcohol consumption and smoking./* Manage your stress: Engage in hobbies and physical activities like gardening or painting. Try yoga and meditation at home. Take proper sleep in night and regular breaks from work/* Regular exercise: Daily exercise for at least 30 minutes per day is important. Avoid exercising outside early in the morning in cold temperature. Opt for indoor exercises like static cycling, treadmill, yoga etc./* Improve diet: Avoid excessive salt and sweets in your diet. Use polyunsaturated cooking oil like safflower oil, mustard oil. Increase salad and fruits in diet./* Regular health checkup: Go for routine visit with your cardiologist and follow the advice./* Last but not least, keep yourself positive and immediately visit to hospital in case of any emergency./""Patients need to make sure that they need to stick to their medication and exercise schedule. Also avoid the increased levels of pollution during winters. Heart failure patients need to be evaluated by their doctors before onset of winter to assess their fluid status,"" says Dr Hassanfatta./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mansukh Mandaviya pedals to unveil health pavilion at India International Trade Fair in Delhi,"India, Nov. 16 -- Amid the ongoing discussion around the worsening air quality in the national capital, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya for his part, on Tuesday, rode a bicycle to Pragati Maidan in Delhi, emphasising on the need to reduce pollution. The minister was at Pragati Maidan to inaugurate the health pavilion at the India International Trade Fair (IITF) that is taking place at the venue./The Union ministry of health and family welfare said, ""In the first ever cycle rally organised at the India International Trade Fair, Mansukh Mandaviya cycled to inaugurate the Health Pavilion to generate awareness and promote a healthy active lifestyle in view of the rising burden of NCDs in the country.""/""Today I am here to inaugurate the health pavilion. Pedalling cycle reduces air pollution, it keeps one fit and healthy and saves non-renewable energy,"" news agency ANI quoted Mandaviya as saying. ""To promote cycling, I will be launching awareness with the help of cycling clubs across India,"" he added./The theme of the health pavilion at the IITF is creating awareness about Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), also called lifestyle diseases, and to project the importance of total health, the ministry said./However, this is not the first time the minister has advocated the use of bicycles. Earlier in 2019, he said, ""I regularly ride my bicycle to be fit and healthy. I personally ride my bicycle to Parliament. This not only makes me fit, but sets an example for others to ride bicycles, save fuel (no pollution) and be fit. Let us all pledge to ride bicycles daily and use it to commute to nearby places,"" during a seminar at Surat, Gujarat. He has also notably pedalled to the Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2019 to take oath as a minister./The cycle rally has been organised in the city a couple of days after deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday (November 14) urged the Delhi public to use cycles or buses at least one day every month in view of the worsening air pollution./""People can ride a cycle at least once a month to prevent pollution and save the environment for future generations,"" he said during a cycle rally as part of the Raahgiri programme./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Debate over share of farm fires in toxic air,"India, Nov. 16 -- Like a thick haze of smog that blots out visibility, mystery shrouds the exact contribution of stubble burning in worsening the air quality of Delhi-NCR./The Union government on Monday submitted before the Supreme Court that stubble burning is not a prime cause of pollution, adding that it contributes just around 10% to the total pollution. But the affidavit, placed by the Centre before the court in the same matter, also contains a finding that the stubble burning has been contributing about 35% to 40% of the total pollution load in Delhi-NCR./Interestingly the same affidavit, at another point, refers to a scientific study to maintain that stubble burning contributes a meagre 4% to PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants during the pre-winter and winter weeks. The source of this scientific study has not been named in the affidavit./Delhi-NCR has been in a grip of severe-plus air pollution as a toxic smog lingers over the Capital and its adjoining cities, leading to a public health emergency. This November has also seen the number of farm fires reaching a new high with the enforcement of a ban on the practice collapsing./On Saturday, the Supreme Court stepped in, imploring the Centre and the Delhi government to take ""emergent measures"", including imposition of a lockdown in the national capital, to ""immediately"" control rising levels of air pollution./At the same time, the bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, lamented that ""bashing farmers"" over stubble burning has become a fashion even though there are several other major contributors to the hazardous air quality./When Delhi government's counsel Rahul Mehra submitted that it is ""probably"" the stubble burning that has made the air quality index and PM 10 and PM 2.5 pollutants shoot up by several hundred points, the bench, which also comprised justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, retorted: ""What is this? Now, it has become a fashion to bash farmers, whether its Delhi government or someone else. You had imposed a ban on firecrackers in Delhi. But see what has been happening in the last 7-8 days. What are you doing? What are Delhi Police doing?""/When the proceedings resumed on Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, conceded that the court was right when it said that stubble burning is not a major contributor of air pollution. ""I must admit stubble burning is not a major contributor. It contributes only 10%,"" he said./This prompted the bench to observe that the ""hue and cry"" over farm fires apparently had no legal, scientific or rational basis. The bench also noted that the Centre's own affidavit refers to a study to say that stubble burning contributes only 4% to increase in PM 2.5 and PM 10, and therefore, ""an insignificant source of pollution"" was being targeted by everyone./But the anomaly in the Union government's response was sought to be highlighted by senior advocate Vikas Singh, who was appearing for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey. He contended that the Centre is trying to mislead the court by claiming stubble burning is causing less than 10% pollution. He said that the high-powered committee, comprising senior officials of the Centre and governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and UP have recorded in the meeting on November 14 that stubble burning is responsible for 35%-40% of air pollution./HT has reviewed the Centre's affidavit cited by Singh. The minutes of the meeting of the commission for air quality management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas, held on Sunday, records it categorically that farm fires and stubble burning partakes a major share in rising levels of pollution./""Post Diwali, there has been a spurt in the number of fire incidences owing to paddy stubble burning, particularly in Punjab where about 42,285 incidences have been reported in the last 10 days alone, out of the cumulative fire count of 62,863 till November 13 during this season. Likewise, the instances of paddy stubble burning in Haryana have also witnessed an increase compared to last year with 5,400 incidents being reported so far in 2021 against a cumulative figure of 3,635 in the corresponding period in 2020,"" recorded the commission./It also made a recommendation in this regard to the state governments concerned.

Sea-salt may be responsible for high AQI in south Mumbai: Experts,"Mumbai, Nov. 16 -- In the past two days, Colaba and Mazagaon in South Mumbai have emerged as the most polluted localities, with the air quality index (AQI) exceeding 330, indicating ""very poor"" air as per data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) network of 10 monitoring locations across the city./Colaba's AQI on Tuesday evening stood at 370 while Mazagaon's stood at 331. On the other hand, places in interior Mumbai recorded ""moderate"" air, for example Chembur (183), Borivli (159) and Bhandup (125)./This discrepancy between interior and coastal locations, according to experts, could be explained by higher concentrations of sea salt (or sodium chloride) that not only acts as a primary pollutant, consisting of particles that meet the criteria for PM2.5 and PM10 (small, respirable airborne particles less than 2.5 and 10 micrometers in diametre) but also reacts with other pollutants to create secondary compounds./""It's generally true that coastal towns are less polluted than landlocked ones. Strong winds from the sea sweep through the city and clean up the air. But there are certain conditions in the proximity to the sea can be a disadvantage,"" said Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality expert certified by the Quality Council of India under the Union environment ministry./""With Mumbai experiencing high humidity and slow, landward winds from the sea, the conditions are perfect for sea salt to become aerosolised, or airborne. Since the particles are very tiny, air quality monitors will detect them and reflect a higher AQI,"" Panwar explained. Moreover, in areas like Colaba and Mazagaon, which also see a high amount of on-road and maritime traffic in ports, the presence of vehicular emissions can also amplify the role of sea salt as a pollutant./""Sea salt is a chemical compound. In areas where there is a lot of traffic we usually see presence of other compounds like sulphur oxides and benzene, which is present in vehicular exhaust. In the presence of humidity and heat, salt will react with these other pollutants to form secondary compounds in the air. If wind speeds are slow, these secondary pollutants will accumulate and add to the pollution load,"" Panwar added. He clarified, however, that this phenomenon is yet to be demonstrated in Mumbai through an empirical, scientific study./Increasing heat and humidity have been the key drivers behind the Mumbai's ongoing pollution spike. While an increase in air pollution typically coincides with a drop in temperature, the haze shrouding Mumbai has been accompanied by warmer conditions. Experts explained that when temperatures drop, the mixing height of airborne pollutants reduces and they settle closer to the ground. When temperatures increase on the other hand, hot air rises and carries pollutants higher up into the atmosphere./""However, Mumbai at the moment is experiencing an unusual effect from a weak low-pressure system in the Arabian Sea, which is atypical for this time of the year. This is causing the temperature to increase only slightly, to the point where the air is becoming just humid enough to hold more particulate matter in place. And the wind speed is too slow, so there is a lot of localised accumulation of pollutants,"" said Gufran Beig, project director at SAFAR./Others experts agreed. Ronak Sutaria, founder of Respirer Living Sciences, said, ""MET department data shows that wind conditions all day on Tuesday were very stagnant - which results in more localisation of pollution. This indicates that locations such as Colaba and Mazagaon are reporting more localised pollution levels, and not as much of the regional levels, in which pollutants are translocated from other areas by wind.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Experts say lockdown will do little to clear Delhi's air,"New Delhi, Nov. 16 -- The Delhi government on Monday told the Supreme Court in an affidavit that it was willing to consider a lockdown in the national capital to bring down pollution levels if other NCR states agreed to do the same, but multiple experts believe such a step will achieve little in terms of controlling the bad air, cause major economic disruption, and trigger an emissions rebound once it is rolled back./The lockdown suggestion was first made on Saturday by the top court while taking stock of the Capital's annual air emergency that has once again led to a toxic haze engulfing the city as measures by the Delhi and Union governments have once again failed to control the spike. The suggestion of locking down was in the context of Delhi alone, and the rationale behind it was that it will curb emissions from vehicles and industries, and road dust./But experts said this would only be a reactive measure that is unlikely to lead to any improvement now that the situation has turned serious. Mukesh Khare from IIT Delhi, who is also a former expert member of the now-dissolved Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control Authority), said that measures such as lockdowns, if at all, can be taken pre-emptively when there is a prediction of a drop in air quality./""We have forecasting systems which can tell when air quality will deteriorate and the concentration levels expected. Measures under Grap (Graded Response Action Plan) and a lockdown should be possibly based on that if required. It is even possible to feed data from the Covid-19 lockdown period and assess the possible reduction that could occur if a decision support system is used,"" he said./Senior counsel Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, told the court on Monday that a lockdown will be of little use unless it is implemented across adjoining NCR regions in UP and Haryana./Another expert called the lockdown suggestion a ""knee-jerk idea"" that takes away from what is needed: focussed year-long measures. ""It is a knee-jerk reaction, if it occurs. Once the lockdown is lifted, those sources of pollution will return once again and you are only looking at an extreme and temporary solution. What we need is action throughout the year,"" he said, asking not to be named./A third expert said warned of the costs of such measures, especially when there is little scientific evidence it will lead to any significant gains. ""It will set a terrible precedent, and show that we are not able to handle the spikes in pollution at this time of the year. We also cannot judge the meteorological factors that will be at play, even if a lockdown is imposed,"" said Santosh Harish, fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR)./Thaneshwar Adigaur, secretary of the Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union said that the ban on construction activity in the Capital has already led to uncertainty in the sector, and feared workers might migrate back to their villages as they had when the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed last year./Inamul Haq, a private labour contractor in Delhi, said: ""Workers are worried that the ban on construction activity will be extended as the air pollution situation is unlikely to improve. In the past too, the ban has been extended. It was after great difficulty I managed to get workers back from Bihar, West Bengal etc. Now, I don't know how long this will continue.""/Haq said that if the ban is extended then he might think of sending the labourers to other cities./Traders opposed the idea of a lockdown, too, ""We hope there is no lockdown now, as it will hugely impact businesses. It is only recently that the rush is back in the markets and sales have picked up. A lockdown now will break the continuity.

"Haryana takes a leaf from Delhi's book, starts odd-even rule to tackle pollution","India, Nov. 17 -- In view of mounting levels of air pollution in Delhi and the adjoining national capital region (NCR), the Haryana government has now decided to impose from next week an odd-even rule in four districts - Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, and Jhajjar. In addition to this, the state government has also decided to extend the work-from-home option till November 22 for employees in 14 districts, including Bhiwani, Charkhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Nuh, Mehendragarh, Sonipat, Rohtak, Rewari, and Palwal./The odd-even traffic rule, first instituted in India by the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi, is a modified version of the odd-even rationing system popularised in the US as part of a response to the second gasoline crisis in 1979. Under the odd-even scheme in India, alternate days are marked for vehicles with their number plates ending in odd and even numbers, respectively. Vehicles with registration numbers ending in odd numbers are allowed on the roads on odd days and even-numbered vehicles are allowed on even days./By implementing the scheme, the Haryana government hopes to see a drop in pollution levels and a reduction in road congestion. Moreover, keeping in view the toxic haze in the NCR air, an extension of the work-from-home option has also been deemed suitable./The worsening air quality in the national capital, Delhi, has, in the meanwhile, continued to rise to alarming levels. According to doctors, there has been a spike in chronic respiratory conditions - such as asthma among children. Moreover, prolonged exposure to deadly pollutants could seriously impair the cognitive development of children, health professionals added./Pollution has been hitting dangerous levels across New Delhi and other parts of northern India this month. On most days, the Air Quality Index (AQI) has stayed above 451 on a scale of 500, indicating ""very poor"" and ""severe"" conditions that affect even healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases, according to the federal pollution control board's guidance./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Curbs widen across NCR in scramble to fix bad air,"New Delhi:, Nov. 17 -- The ban on construction work and offline classes in Delhi was extended to all cities falling in the National Capital Region (NCR) and trucks carrying non-essential supplies will not be allowed to enter the national capital, the Commission on Air Quality Management announced late on Tuesday, after officials scrambled for ways to battle the air pollution crisis nearly two weeks after hazardous conditions first set in over the region./The CAQM, states government officials and agencies held a meeting earlier in response to a 24-hour deadline set by the Supreme Court on Monday to meet and prepare a list of urgent action that can be taken, and came as weather forecasters predicted meteorological parameters to remain such that pollution may not naturally be blown away for at least 10 more days./In an order issued late in the night, CAQM cited predictions by the India Meteorological Department that show the air quality was likely to remain in very poor category till at least November 21 to issue a slew of new directions./The orders, in addition to the ones above, mention a strict enforcement of the ban on diesel-generator sets and the closing of schools and colleges for in-person classes indefinitely. Industries using fuel are only allowed to run if they use gas, or will need to close, and six of 11 thermal plants in 300km of radius of Delhi will have to stop functioning till November 30./Authorities in NCR ""shall ensure that no vehicle of more than 10 years (diesel) and 15 years (petrol) are found plying on the road"", it added./Chief secretaries of each NCR state have been asked to submit a compliance report of all these activities on November 22, the order reads./Air pollution in Delhi, meanwhile, rose back into the severe category with the AQI reaching 403 at 4pm on Tuesday. Since November 5, the day after Diwali, the air quality in the capital has been in the severe category for seven days, and very poor for the remaining four. This period has seen hospitals record a spurt in people coming in with respiratory diseases, with some now officially diagnosing it as pollution-related ailments in order to draw attention./The central ministry and the states of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as well as their pollution control boards, attended the meeting./Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai later said that the state government suggested the curbs implemented in Delhi be extended to other NCR states./""In the meeting, on behalf of the people of Delhi, we proposed that work-from-home be implemented, all construction work and industries in the Delhi-NCR region be shut for the meantime. The other states presented their proposals too and the final decision and minutes of the meeting are still awaited,"" said Rai./According to a person who asked not be named, the Delhi government also suggested a temporary ban on heavy vehicles not carrying essential supplies./A senior Haryana Pollution Control Board official that they have volunteered to temporarily shut down all industries that are not operating on Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and also suggested that in order to bring down pollution levels, two of the biggest thermal power plants of the state, located in Panipat, can also be temporarily shut down./""In the coming days we will also start a major crackdown against all aged diesel (over 10 years) and petrol (over 15 years) vehicles. We are also requesting corporate houses to encourage work from home, so that vehicular emissions can be controlled,"" the Haryana official said, asking not to be named./According to the first official, the CAQM was also briefed by the India Meteorological Department, which said weather conditions are likely to remain unfavourable at least for the next 10 days, which meant stringent pollution control measures will have to be taken by all NCR states./The Supreme Court on Monday pulled up the Union and several state governments - Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh included - for the continuing crisis in NCR. The judges gave 24 hours for them to hold an emergency meeting and prepare a list of urgent steps that can be put in place immediately to bring down the levels of pollution in the ""forseeable future""./But multiple experts believe steps such as lockdowns and post-facto measures in response to the crisis, will achieve little, causing major economic disruption, and triggering an emissions rebound once they are rolled back./""First and foremost there is no difference in air pollution levels even after the air quality commission is established. With so much fanfare, the Centre established an air quality commission (CAQM) but we don't know what directions they have issued. They are not under the air or water act but the Commission is a law passed by parliament which has independent power to issue directions and take action against air pollution,"" said Ritwick Dutta, environmental lawyer./""The commission has said no construction but we don't know if even a single action has been taken. There is no will to police. They are not like the Pay Commission. They are a statutory body with power to police. The Grap (graded response action plan) is very clear on what interventions should be made when air pollution has crossed a particular threshold but now they are not even debating the odd-even scheme. Same drama continues every year,"" Dutta added./On Monday, experts warned against steps like lockdowns, one of the steps suggested by the court. ""It will set a terrible precedent, and show that we are not able to handle the spikes in pollution at this time of the year. We also cannot judge the meteorological factors that will be at play, even if a lockdown is imposed,"" said Santosh Harish, fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), told HT on Monday./The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the matter on Wednesday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"26 times this November, Punjab's AQI slipped into 'severe' category","India, Nov. 17 -- Bathinda The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Punjab has been of severe quality (401 upwards on the measuring scale) on 26 different occasions across eight air pollution audit spots over November to date. AQI above 401 means it was five times worse than the 'satisfactory' AQI value of 51-100. A severe AQI rating means the air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases./An analysis of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data says the average daily AQI was rated 'poor' (201-300) on up to 14 days in the state, since November 1. The daily AQI average did not touch the 'severe' level this month, but the daily average of 'very poor' scale of 301-400 was recorded on up to four days at four AQI assessment spots./The debate over air standards in Punjab, however, has failed to get due attention with the pollution levels in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) grabbing headlines.The CPCB audits air quality at eight places in six districts - three in Ludhiana (Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh and Ludhiana City) and one each in Bathinda, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Patiala and Rupnagar./Data says, the maximum overall high-pollution days this month in Punjab was at Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) in Ludhiana. On 14 days, AQI was rated 'poor' in the city, and one day it was 'very poor'. Jalandhar, the air quality indicator of Doaba region, faced average 'poor' air on 12 days this month and it was reported 'very poor' on one day./The daily average assessment in Amritsar, the sole pollution indicator of Majha, was 'poor' air on 11 days whereas it was moderate (101- 200) on four days. In Bathinda, average daily 'poor' air was recorded on eight days and 'moderate' for seven days this month./In the state, AQI on most days this month reached a much higher level than the average readings./'No data on which activity/adds how much to pollution'/Vinod Kumar Garg, professor, School of Environmental Science and Technology at the Bathinda-based Central University of Punjab, ""Burning of organic waste, vehicular emission, power generation plants, dust etc cause smog and the problem turns worse in winters due to climatic conditions. There is no scientific mechanism to confirm how much use of various resources contribute to pollution,"" he said./CPCB data says on 78 occasions, air quality deteriorated and fell in 'very poor' category./Bathinda, the only centre of south Malwa to audit air quality, saw eight days in November where AQI scaled beyond 401. Of these, the AQI was at the highest scale of 500 on four occasions since November 11. Patiala and Rupnagar recorded a maximum scale of 'severe' levels on three days. Ludhiana recorded very poor air on 15 occasions in November when AQI was very poor./The only exception was the Shivalik foothill region near the Rupnagar sample collection site, where daily AQI was 'poor' only twice; but severe air pollution was recorded thrice over the past 16 days./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"World COPD Day: Important to focus on lung health, says Padma Shri Dr Digambar Behera","CHANDIGARH, Nov. 18 -- If a patient suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) gets infected with Covid-19, the chance of mortality increases. Even in light of Covid, COPD remains a leading cause of death and now it is more important to focus on lung health./This was stated by Padma Shri recipient Dr Digambar Behera during a panel discussion on Wednesday. The discussion was organised by Zorgers Healthcare to raise awareness on World COPD Day./Dr Behera said people should keep their lungs healthy by avoiding cigarettes, air pollution or occupational exposures and by staying active either through regular physical activity or pulmonary rehabilitation./While speaking on the occasion, Dr Vishal Sharma and Dr Sunny Virdi, pulmonologists, said, ""The main risk factors for COPD are tobacco smoking, atmospheric air pollution as well as indoor pollution due to smoke from biomass used for cooking. However, lifestyle changes like eating healthy, exercise and vaccination help cope with limitations created by the disease.""/""Smoking is suicide by instalments. There is a huge risk among COPD patients to get severe Covid infections as smoking leads to weakened immunity,"" said another pulmonologist, Dr Suresh K Goyal./Varun Gupta, founder, Zorgers, said, ""Around 10-15% of our patients are COPD and these patients are in a high degree of need for non-invasive ventilation equipment likes Bipap, CPAP or Portable ventilators and many of them do require oxygenation as well where oxygen cylinder or concentrator is also required to keep them comfortable at home under the supervision of a nurse and a treating pulmonologist.""/Pulmonologists Dr Zafar Ahmed Iqbal and Dr Rahul Katyal were also present during the panel discussion./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"For clean air, get citizens involved","India, Nov. 18 -- With the onset of winter, the Indo-Gangetic plain is, once again, enveloped in thick smoke. While Delhi is at the centre of the discourse on air pollution, the clamour for clean air is gaining traction across the country./In the last two weeks, I have travelled across three states - Uttar Pradesh (UP), Punjab, and West Bengal - and noticed a rising demand for clean air. From addressing pollution from sugar and paper mills in UP's Muzaffarnagar district to managing fumes from the landfill site on Ludhiana's Tajpur road to increasing focus on non-motorised transport in Kolkata, citizen collectives have identified issues that need attention from policymakers./Even India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) identifies public awareness for participation in air pollution management as one of its key objectives. In fact, the pollution control boards and municipal corporations could benefit from engaging citizens by using a three-pronged approach: Empanelling monitoring groups; encouraging citizen science; and amplifying the use of complaint redressal portals./First, local governments should work with citizen groups to identify and prioritise areas for intervention. While city action plans made under the NCAP were created with the intention of identifying these priorities, a 2020 study finds that less than 25% of these plans contain relevant information on sources - needed for prioritising activities. Local governments should leverage collective knowledge of communities to identify their implementation priorities./For instance, efforts to highlight industrial air pollution by residents of Maharshtra's Kharghar-Taloja-Panvel region were noticed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. It then committed to deploying two air quality monitors to ensure round-the-clock air quality monitoring. While this alone may not be the solution, it is an acknowledgement of their efforts./Second, local agencies should support citizen science projects aimed at improving local air quality monitoring. This is in line with the NCAP's recommendation to empower communities ""with tools and information to take action and improve local air quality""./Currently, most citizen science experiments in India are led by academic institutions and civil society organisations. Government agencies looking to launch similar projects can take inspiration from Belgium's CurieuzeNeuzen (Curious Noses), the world's largest citizen science project on air quality. Supported by a local environmental agency, the initiative used a newspaper listing to recruit over 20,000 citizen scientists to measure nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the Flanders region. It demonstrates how institutional support for citizen science can help generate community-level insights on air quality./Third, policymakers should promote the use of pollution complaint portals beyond Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). The NCAP requires all states to set up such facilities. Examples include the Central Pollution Control Board's SAMEER app, the Delhi government's Green Delhi app and the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board's Swachh Vayu app. Further, such portals should be subject to regular reviews to ensure they are not being underutilised. For example, Swachh Vayu received just 30 complaints from Kanpur and Lucknow in the first half of 2021. In contrast, Green Delhi received over 7,000 complaints within a month of its launch. The reality in Lucknow became clear when the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)'s researchers detected more than 400 dispersed sources of pollution in the city in a six-week period preceding the second Covid-19 wave. Scientific estimates suggest that dispersed sources of pollution could contribute as much as 25% of the pollution burden in cities like Lucknow and Kanpur. Grievance redressal portals can turn citizens into air quality sentinels and generate information on pollution sources for further investigation./Active public participation is largely responsible for the success of government programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission. Local authorities should engage communities in managing air pollution as well./Tanushree Ganguly is a programme lead, CEEW/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi air may improve as wind speed picks up: IMD,"India, Nov. 20 -- After nearly 20 days of breathing hazardous air this month, Delhi's air quality is set to improve marginally from November 21, India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said Friday./Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that Delhi's overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading on Friday was 380, categorised as ""very poor"". While this was a few points higher than Thursday's 347, also considered ""very poor"" on CPCB's AQI scale, forecasters said they expect wind speed to improve from Sunday, facilitating the dispersion of pollutants./An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is considered ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe""./""While the winds will continue to blow from the northwest, the speed will pick up and this will help disperse the accumulated pollutants. We are hoping that after November 21, the AQI will come down to the 'poor' range,"" said VK Soni, head of IMD's environment and research centre./Soni explained that another factor for the improvement of air quality during the weekend is the reduction in the stubble fire count in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana./Union ministry of earth science' air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said that on Friday, 1,077 fires were recorded in both the states, which contributed to 3% of the Capital's PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels. According to experts, PM2.5 is the dominant pollutant in the region./Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi remained in the normal range. Forecasters said that while the city usually sees at least three or four western disturbances in the month of November, this year it has not experienced an active western disturbance since October 24./A western disturbance refers to an area of ""disturbed"" or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying with it moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall and fog in northern India./On Friday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is the official marker for the city, was 25.9 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 10.9 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal./""If we experience a western disturbance, the temperature will see a drastic drop,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services./River of smoke/On Friday, American space agency Nasa on Friday shared several satellite images (that were taken on November 11) of farm fires-- which have led to a spike in the levels of air pollution in Delhi -- spreading all the way across the Indo-Gangetic plains as a thick plume of smoke. In the images, the Capital is almost completely shrouded by the smoke, which continues well beyond Agra, with Nasa indicating this is likely to have affected over 22 million people in a single day./The images were taken by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite on November 11, Nasa informed on its blog./""Looking at the size of the plume on November 11 and the population density in this area, I would say that a conservative estimate is that at least 22 million people were affected by smoke on this one day,"" said Pawan Gupta, a Universities Space Research Association (USRA) scientist at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center./Delhi's air quality was in the ""severe"" category on November 11, with AQI of 411, with the government forecasting body Safar pegging the share of farm fire contribution to Delhi's PM 2.5 to be 26% that day./According to Safar, while the contribution from farm fires has reduced, the local wind speed is calm, thereby trapping pollutants. ""Local surface winds are low at the moment with moderate ventilation of near surface pollutants. From Sunday onwards, surface winds are likely to be strong resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality,"" it said./In the blog, Nasa scientists said while lingering monsoon rain kept fire activity low for a few weeks longer than usual, elevated fire activity was observed in November. They added that fires in northern Pakistan also likely contributed to some of the smoke on November 11./According to experts, meteorological conditions and other factors can also contribute to hazy skies, with dust from the Thar desert contributing to the haze on November 12, 2021, a separate image shared by the space agency showed./Hiren Jethva, an USRA scientist based at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, who uses measures of ""greenness,"" or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to anticipate fire activity each year, said this summer has seen one of the largest NDVI values in the last 20 years, based on which he had predicted this season to record a fairly high fire count. The data he uses comes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Nasa's Aqua satellite./""I had predicted this would be one of the most active fire seasons on record, and that is exactly what we have seen,"" said Jethva. ""We still have a few weeks of burning to go, but already Aqua MODIS has detected more than 17,000 hotspots in Punjab and Haryana-making this the most active fire season on record.""/Data from the last decade shows stubble burning is generally at its most active between October 15 and November 15, with a drop in activity seen from the third week of November onwards. LS Kurinji, Programme Associate at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), says after a late spike in the number of farm fires this year, numbers have started dropping again with less than 1,000 fire counts recorded in the last two days./""Previously, scientific reports indicated that it takes 14-22 hours for smoke from Punjab and Haryana to reach Delhi under favourable meteorological conditions. Data from Safar indicates that on days when winds blew from the northwest, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 level was in the range of 20-50% this year,"" she explained./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Ideally shampoo your hair every day, just before bedtime so your hair and scalp can breathe and stays clean while you sleep./Use a conditioner: Toxic and cold air can result in unwanted hair fall. It is therefore important to indulge in some deep conditioning treatments that add moisture to the hair, especially if you have hair with a very rough or dry texture. Use an effective conditioner after your shampoo. Remember, both the shampoo and conditioner must always be of the same brand./Prevention is better than cure:/1.Applying a light hair oil daily, especially if you are stepping out will coat your hair and scalp and can be washed off at when you are back indoors./2.Wearing a cap or bandana outdoor will protect your hair. Ensure this covers your hair and head all around. For the sake of good hygiene, change your headgear daily./Skin/Surface cleaning: Us a natural face wash twice or thrice daily. Apply an alcohol-free toner or pure rose water to clean the build-up of toxins, pollution, and excessive oil on the skin. Use a minimum of thrice a week, if not daily. Scrub once weekly to exfoliate and remove dead, dry and flaky skin. All three regimes need to be done and one does not substitute the need for doing the other./Deep pore cleaning: Apply a mud or clay-based face masque twice a week. Make a smooth paste, using water and spread out evenly on the face and neck. Allow the mask to dry and work into the skin for about fifteen minutes, then rinse well. Masks have the inherent quality to go into the pores of the skin and perform an effective deep cleaning action, which not only prevents the accumulation of pollutants but also makes you look fresher./Make your lips more kissable: Chap stick and lip balm are essential for men, both for protecting your lips from harsh winter winds and the effects of smoking and toxic air. Biting and licking your lips only makes them worse. Use only at night and never during the day./Body: Don't expose the skin to very hot water, as this will further deplete the skin of its natural oil and moisture. A warm shower should suffice. Ensure to use an effective and heavy-duty body lotion or moisturiser generously all over the body. This will leave your skin feeling smooth to touch. It will also coat your skin and prevent pollution and toxins in the air from getting absorbed into it./Hydrate: To prevent dry or flaky skin, you need to moisturise and nourish your skin. As they can attract dust, dirt particles and soak up the sun, moisturisers should as a rule, always be used on a clean face at night. As cold winds can make the skin look weather beaten, ensure to keep your skin well hydrated./Quick fixes:/1.Keep Washing: Make sure to wash the surface dirt from your face as often in a day as possible./2.Cover up: Try and limit your skins exposure to the environment. Embrace long sleeve tops, turtlenecks, full length lowers and a wide face mask to cover as much of your face as possible./Ten Products to Use/1.The hot + cool air purifier by Dyson/This is by far the most powerful and stylish air purifier available.

Winter woes: Keep seasonal allergies at bay,"India, Nov. 21 -- Sneezing, congestion and a runny nose - Onset of winters is not a breath of fresh air for many. With a slight nip in the air, one would feel that it's time to enjoy a much-needed break from seasonal allergy symptoms, but as the weather gets colder, winter allergies rear their ugly head./""Unlike autumn or spring allergies, which are often responses to outdoor allergens like pollen, winter allergies are triggered by substances inside our home. While these indoor allergens are present year-round, allergies can flare up in the winter because you're cooped up in the house with the windows closed,"" says Dr Trupti Gilada, Infectious Disease Specialist, Masina Hospital, Mumbai./Triggers/Winter usually means staying indoors resulting in overexposure to indoor allergens. ""During winters staying indoors leads to higher exposure to dust on carpets, furniture,toys etc, plant pollen, insects like mites and cockroaches,pets could be carrying dust and pollen on their furs. People susceptible to allergies could be worst hit and conditions like asthma,seasonal rhinitis,urticaria etc may worsen,"" Dr Charu Goel Sachdeva, HOD And Consultant- Internal Medicine HCMCT Manipal Hospitals Dwarka New Delhi/Pollen from plants and air pollution do lend to the problem too.

Protect your eyes from pollution,"India, Nov. 24 -- Pollution levels in Delhi-NCR have been alarming since the onset of the festive period, owing to a combination of factors such as vehicular pollution, burning of firecrackers and stubble burning in neighbouring states, etc. According to a recent study, the air quality in NCR is as bad as smoking 40 cigarettes a day. And, prolonged exposure to this polluted air has a catastrophic impact on all organs of our body, including the eyes. Cases of dry eye, watering, burning sensation, blurred vision and even glaucoma are being reported on a regular basis./""The eye, being one of the most sensitive organs, is continually exposed to the toxic environment, posing a significant risk to eye health and eyesight in general,"" says Dr Saumya Sharma, senior consultant at Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals./Factors affecting eye health/The severity of discomfort produced by air pollution is determined by the levels of hydrocarbons and nitric oxide in ambient air. Hydrocarbon chemicals that cause such irritation in the eyes are C4 and C5 olefins, produced by automobiles. ""According to IQair.com, air pollution in most of India's major cities ranges from bad to severe, with air quality index (AQI) readings above 400. Aside from the traditional culprits such as automobile exhaust and industrial trash, open burning of agricultural waste exacerbates the problem,"" adds Dr Sharma./Effects of pollution on eyes/With regular exposure, air pollution can cause tearing, burning, blurred vision, glaucoma and dry eye syndrome, which is irreversible./""Dry eye syndrome is a condition where the eye does not produce enough tears to moisturise the eye, causing it to remain dry all the time, leading to irritation. If this persists for a prolonged period, it can even lead to vision loss,"" shares Dr Mahipal Sachdev, medical director and chairman, Centre for Sight Group of Eye Hospitals./Air pollutants can also cause chemical conjunctivitis. Typically recognised as 'pink eye', conjunctivitis refers to contamination or swelling within the outer membrane of our eyeball. ""Treatment includes rinsing the eye thoroughly with saline and may require the use of typical steroids,"" adds Dr Sachdev./Many individuals are also experiencing burning sensation in the eyes, as a result of air pollutants such as nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide in the air./""A 2015 study by AIIMS, New Delhi, shows that 10-15% of people in Delhi suffer from chronic irritation and dry eye syndrome due to constant exposure to a high level of pollutants in the air. Redness, sensitivity to light, soreness, sensitivity to wind and smoke and mucus forming around the eyeballs are some of the common symptoms of dry eye syndrome,"" adds Dr Rishi Raj Borah, Country Director, Orbis India./How to protect your eyes/Avoiding exposure to harmful pollutants is the golden rule. However, eye symptoms can be minimised in a polluted environment by following these tips./Avoid rubbing your eyes, even if particulates enter them, as this may cause abrasion on the cornea./Wash your eyes thoroughly with water. If foreign body sensation persists, visit an ophthalmologist./Lubricating eye drops prescribed by eye specialists can also offer comfort./Wear sunglasses when outdoors, which protects the eyes against UV rays that can cause long-term problems./Don't wear contact lenses when outside.

Can air pollution affect your pregnancy? Here's how to reduce the risks,"India, Dec. 2 -- Due to the extreme rise in pollution levels, the air we breathe in can trouble us majorly and can put our chances of expanding our family at great risk. Many studies have found that air pollution can be one of the contributors of lower fertility rates in women and men. Some other researches also ascertain that air pollution may also be one of the primary reasons for miscarriages. This is because inhaling polluted air is known to be as dangerous as smoking during pregnancy./Here are some ways in which it can affect your pregnancy:/Sudden infant death syndrome/Air pollution creates great risk for infants. At times, you and your baby's life can be put in immense danger if you are regularly exposed to passive smoke. Bad air quality also contributes to sudden infant death syndrome in babies./Also, read: World Prematurity Day: What is the ideal nutrition for a very low birth weight baby?/Underweight delivery/During normal pregnancies, delivery takes place in 38 to 40 weeks with the baby's weight being about six to nine-pounds. If in a pregnancy, the baby's weight is less than five pounds and eight ounces, the baby is considered to be weak and underweight. An underweight delivery can take place due to a number of reasons. However, exposure to poor air quality while being pregnant is considered to be a major reason./Development of autism/Pregnant women, when exposed to excessive air pollution during their pregnancy period, have a greater risk of developing autism in their babies, as compared to women who breathe cleaner air. Some researchers say that air pollution contains a huge number of contaminants, which can interrupt the baby's brain development./Premature delivery/Air pollution is a big reason behind premature deliveries. Babies born before time often have a risk of developing permanent physical disabilities and neurological disorders. Though preterm birth can happen to any woman due to many reasons, we should try avoiding air pollution./Also,'s why buying an air purifier is a must for these 7 types of people/Everything that an expecting mother consumes, drinks and inhales goes directly to her foetus. It is very important to keep a check on the air quality before heading out of the house. It may help to limit or avoid the time when the pollution is at its peak. Usually in the morning, ozone levels tend to be lower. If air pollution is terrible, it is always safe to be indoors./Here are some tips to reduce the risks of air pollution:/Indoor plants/Many indoor plants provide oxygen and have the ability to filter the indoor air. They help you and your baby in inhaling fresh air by removing hazardous compounds from the atmosphere and substituting carbon dioxide with oxygen./Using an air purifier/Air purifiers work as a one-stop solution to prevent indoor air pollution. These purifiers remove every dirty thing, from smoke to dust and germs from the indoor air. This helps you and your baby grow in a healthy environment. Being indoors and inhaling better air quality from the very beginning can provide long-lasting benefits to you and your baby./Use of natural products/There are many household cleaning products that contain harmful chemicals. Hence, in order to create a healthy environment, you can use natural household cleaners like vinegar to clean surfaces, an electric chimney while cooking, and a carbon monoxide detector. You can also avoid being in or going into a freshly painted room or a room that has people who are smoking. This is because passive smoking is equally dangerous./(This story is written by Dr Aruna Kalra. Dr Kalra is a famous Gynaecologist and Obstetrics Surgeon.

Needed: Affirmative action on pollution,"India, Dec. 2 -- The Supreme Court (SC), on Thursday, rapped the Delhi government and the Centre, giving them 24 hours to propose concrete measures to control industrial and vehicular pollution. This comes after the SC's November 15 order directing the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas to take steps to control pollution. The Commission, on November 16, announced some emergency measures including a ban on construction work, but many say this was too late./It risks repetition to state that Delhi's pollution story is a terrifying - but foreseeable - one. In November, air quality was the worst since the Central Pollution Control Board started maintaining records in 2015, with the average Air Quality Index at 376, and Delhi suffering 11 ""severe"" air quality days. Severe air corresponds to average PM 2.5 concentrations of over 250 micrograms per cubic metre. To put this in context, according to the World Health Organization, the safe range is 15 micrograms per cubic metre./Year on year, Delhi's residents are exposed to dangerous air pollution levels in the winter, but the State has not risen to this public health crisis in time. Its failure to implement pre-emptive measures will mean more such spikes in air pollution, and with it, several illnesses. In children, this includes reduced lung growth and asthma. In adults, ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the most common causes of premature death due to air pollution. The Capital needs proactive action from the Delhi government and the Centre based on air quality forecasts by the ministry of earth sciences. The residents of Delhi deserve affirmative and proactive action./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Act on bad air in 24 hrs: SC to Centre,"India, Dec. 3 -- The Supreme Court on Thursday put the Centre on a 24-hour deadline to come out with a ""creative"" and ""urgent"" mechanism to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR, failing which, the court said, it may set up a task force itself since ""nothing is really happening to control pollution"" and ""all authorities have failed""./The top court also pulled up the Delhi government for reopening schools on November 29, directing it to reconsider the decision in the wake of exposing young children to bad air and toxic smog. Hours later, the Delhi government announced the closure of schools until further orders./Fixing the next hearing at 10am on Friday, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, said that the Centre and the Commission for the Air Quality Management (CAQM) for Delhi-NCR and Adjoining Areas must apprise the court if they could come up with a more effective mechanism for implementing the pollution control measures./""We expect a serious, serious action or we will pass orders. We give you 24 hours to come out with a plan of action. You take a hard look at the issue and come up with a solution with seriousness. If you cannot, we will have to pass some directions tomorrow,"" the bench, which also comprised justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, told solicitor general Tushar Mehta./While Mehta, representing the Centre and CAQM, sought to highlight the steps taken by the Commission against violators, the court remained unimpressed and remarked that all authorities have been unable to contribute anything on controlling pollution./""If there is an emergency situation, you have to act urgently and with some creativity and innovation. But we cannot induce creativity in the bureaucracy. We cannot help you if you don't want to do something... We will have to do something extraordinary or the situation cannot be helped,"" observed the bench./It also questioned the efficacy of CAQM, asking whether the Commission has any power to enforce its directives or if its remit is confined to only issuing directions. ""Also, look at the composition of your Commission. It has members from all states, all departments in the country. Then, you have so many subcommittees under the Commission. It is more like all departments of the government of India together...What is the purpose of having 20-30 members except creating an additional burden on the state exchequer,"" the bench said, pointing at the composition of the 28-member CAQM./Delhi has been in the grip of hazardous pollution for over a month now. This was the worst November for Delhi in terms of the average air quality index (AQI)./December too has started with alarming pollution levels, with the AQI hitting 429 on Thursday, up from 370 a day earlier. While pollution in November was driven significantly by smoke from farm fires in upwind states, the air quality so far this December has been fuelled largely by local emissions./Mehta, on his part, tried to convince the bench that there are flying squads which have been monitoring the directions given by CAQM, and read out details of monetary penalties imposed for industrial and vehicular pollution./""Fines are not the solution to this problem...We feel nothing is happening even as pollution levels are rising. All this is just wasting our time...We will take up tomorrow morning... We will come at 10am and will give you 15 minutes to tell us what you can do now. We will only say don't compel us to do what you should do,"" retorted the bench./The CJI further told Mehta: ""As a layman, I am asking this question. The question is the day when this matter started, there was a particular level of pollution. Then we heard the matter, there were reports in the newspapers and media; there was wide publicity; directions were given too. The question that we ask is why the pollution levels are still going up? That's the question every citizen will ask... Delhi government and others said stubble burning is a main cause but that's over now.""/Mehta said that CAQM has identified industrial and vehicular pollution as chief contributors but the bench yet again noticed that there was no implementation mechanism in place to check vehicles coming from Uttar Pradesh to the national capital. ""This is just an instance of non-implementation,"" added the bench./To this, Mehta said he would consult the Union environment minister and other authorities on certain points that he has for a better structuring of the Commission and a more effective implementation mechanism./The court also slammed the Delhi government for reopening schools in the city./""Small children have to go in morning in fog. Children have to go to schools at 6-7 in the morning in this bad weather,"" the bench told senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the Delhi government./Singhvi maintained that the Delhi government has taken strongest possible measures to control pollution and that there is no dilution of the court order, and pointed to studies and reports on learning loss due to school closure during the pandemic. ""But if this court wants us to reconsider, we will do it,"" he added./""Don't use our shoulders to fire shots. You are the government. You do your work. Who will sit at home when you open schools?,"" the bench told Singhvi./Meanwhile, senior counsel Vikas Singh, who appeared for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey, pressed for a ban on construction in the Central Vista, citing huge amount of dust. ""Even for Central Vista, the same standard has to follow. No project can be more important than lives of people. Why allow Vista only? Other builders could also say that we will also comply with pollution norms and therefore, they should also be allowed,"" argued the lawyer./Singh urged the bench to set up a task force under the chairmanship of a former Supreme Court judge and suggested justice Rohinton F Nariman's name. ""Norms are there, but no implementation. Please constitute an empowered task force and flying squads to ensure compliance,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Ghaziabad recorded 'good' air on just 10 days this year, AQI still 'very poor'","India, Dec. 4 -- Residents of Ghaziabad breathed in ""good"" quality of air -- with an air quality index (AQI) between zero and 50 -- only 10 days this year, said weather experts on Saturday./Figures released by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) indicate that the city recorded 20 days with an AQI in the 'severe' category and 75 days with an AQI in the 'very poor' category./According to the official government data, Ghaziabad is listed among the 16 ""non-attainment cities"" in Uttar Pradesh, with high levels of air pollution. Cities are declared 'non-attainment' if they do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter (PM10) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over a period of five years./""The fewer number of 'good' air days this year is due to the fact that the city is situated in the Indo-Gangetic plain, where the dust content is naturally high. Even during the coronavirus-imposed lockdown, the pollution levels reduced a bit, but the AQI was not in the 'good' category... The impact of vehicular emission and adverse meteorological conditions also impact the city's AQI on a regular basis,"" said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB./An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'./Between January and November this year, days with a 'very poor' quality of air increased to 75, against 67 and 62 days during 2019 and 2020, respectively./The figures, however, also indicated that the condition has improved a little as in 2020 and 2019, which saw only 13 and three days with an AQI in the 'good' category, but none in the months of April, May and June when the lockdown restrictions were first imposed after the Covid-19 outbreak across the country. 2021 saw 100 'moderate' days, against 122 in 2020 and 93 in 2019, according to the figures./Pollution levels under the 'moderate' category causes ""breathing discomfort to the people along with lungs, asthma and heart diseases""./""We have about 15-20 patients daily, and they have symptoms related to bronchial asthma, infection in the respiratory tract, among others. These also get aggravated due to higher pollution levels, and some patients also suffer from skin infection, heart issues, and irritation to eyes. The frequency of such patients increases to nearly 100-150 per day during winters. Pollution is one of the major factors affecting such patients,"" said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital./Environmentalists, meanwhile, said that all the pollution abatement measures should continue round the year, instead of agencies concerned taking such steps only during the winter season, and that is ""the need of the hour""./""If agencies concerned are sincere enough, they must take up pollution abatement measures round the year. However, there is a lack of enforcement on the ground level, and it is only during the monsoon or rainfall that the pollution levels decline. Local factors like garbage burning, road dust, and vehicular emission continue to add to the high pollution levels every day. The administration must have a local policy to combat pollution round the year,"" said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist./This year, since Diwali on November 4, the city has been recording the AQI levels only in the 'severe', 'very poor' or 'poor' category./According to figures released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Saturday, the three cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, and Noida recorded the AQI at 327, 335, and 355, respectively -- all in the 'very poor' category./According to a System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) forecast on Saturday, wind speeds are likely to be low in the next two days (December 5 and 6), and reducing ventilation will lead to a degradation in the air quality, but within the 'very poor' category only./""From December 7, winds are likely to increase dispersing pollutants, but the AQI is likely to remain in the 'very poor' category. Partly cloudy sky and low mixing layer height are preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,"" said the Safar forecast./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

17 flying squads will monitor pollution curbs: Centre in SC,"New Delhi, Dec. 4 -- The Union government on Friday responded to the 24-hour deadline set by the Supreme Court on Thursday for creating an ""urgent"" mechanism to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR, and constituted an enforcement task force and 17 flying squads to implement pollution control measures through surprise checks, inspection and closure of polluting units, besides announcing criminal prosecution and imposition of fines on violators./On Thursday, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, observed that the top court could set up a task force itself since ""nothing is really happening to control pollution"" and ""all authorities have failed""./""We expect a serious, serious action or we will pass orders. We give you 24 hours to come out with a plan of action,"" the bench, which also comprised justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, told solicitor general Tushar Mehta./Hours later, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas, held an emergency meeting in the wake of the Supreme Court's deadline. The decisions taken in the meeting were presented before the bench on Friday in the form of an affidavit./Mehta added that 17 flying squads have been constituted so far to make surprise visits, periodical incognito checking and inspections. ""The number of flying squads will be increased to 40 within 24 hours. These squads will report to the enforcement task force everyday at 6pm in daily meetings. Based on their reports, the task force shall pass orders of preventive, corrective and punitive actions such as financial penalty and criminal prosecution as prescribed by the law.""/He further said that any dereliction in duty by any of the members of the flying squad or the implementing agency will also attract disciplinary proceedings./Another important decision, Mehta said, pertained to cutting down industrial pollution by restricting the operation of all units not running on PNG or other cleaner fuels up to eight hours a day during the week and closure on weekends./""Operation of thermal power plants within 300 kilometres radius of Delhi shall continue to be regulated in terms of Commission's order on November 30 whereby, only 5 out of 11 thermal power plants, have been permitted to schedule their operations and rest have been directed to remain inoperative till at least December 15.""/At this point, the bench asked the S-G to consider moving to alternate power sources once thermal power plants are switched off./""We are not issuing any direction or anything today. You give it a thought....In the long term, you have to think of phasing them (thermal power plants) out completely,"" the bench told Mehta./The national capital has been in the grip of hazardous pollution for over a month now, compelling the Supreme Court to regularly monitor the issue. This was the worst November for Delhi in terms of the average air quality index (AQI). While pollution till mid-November was driven significantly by smoke from farm fires in upwind states, the poor air quality since, and especially in the past week has been caused by local emissions and meteorological factors./Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey, complained that the latest affidavit is just ""eyewash"" and the authorities should be questioned why the solar power plants have not come up in the national capital if they were really serious about the issue./""We mentioned that to the S-G just now... This is not an adversarial litigation. Something has been done. Whatever you asked for yesterday, they have started that too. Mr Singh, we are not closing the proceedings. We are going to monitor it...we are nudging the government,"" responded the bench./Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, expressed his concerns about the directive issued by CAQM to restrict the number of hours an industrial unit could work if it is not running on PNG or other clean fuels. He said that the condition is too stringent for the sugarcane industry and would create huge losses to them since this is the sugarcane crushing season. Kumar requested the bench to suspend the operation of this order for at least two weeks to enable him come back with specific details on location and number of the industrial units coming under the ambit of CAQM order./The bench, however, asked Kumar to approach the Commission with his grievances. ""All NCR states are members of the Commission. You go to them with your grievances if you want an exemption or suspension of this order.""./As Kumar said that UP is a downwind state and the air quality is affected due to wind from Pakistan, the bench replied in a lighter vein: ""Do you want us to ban industries in Pakistan?""/The court then passed a brief order, recording its satisfaction over the steps taken by the Centre and CAQM. ""For the time being, in view of the measures taken by the government of India and the notification issued by CAQM dated December 2, we direct the governments of India and Delhi to implement the measures therein,"" stated the court order, fixing the next hearing on December 10./The affidavit submitted in the court further said that CAQM has ordered that all schools and colleges in NCR shall remain closed till further orders, allowing only on-line mode of education except for the purpose of conducting examinations and laboratory practicals./""Entry of trucks in Delhi shall not permitted, except for CNG and electric trucks and trucks carrying essential commodities,"" it added./Entry of vehicles from other states to the national capital will also be regulated more strictly now. At 124 entry points to Delhi, the concerned state government will ensure deployment of teams from the road transport department along with police personnel at every border entry point for 24 hours, in rotation, directed the commission. These teams shall be responsible to stop entry of trucks as well as check other vehicles./On Thursday, the apex court rued lack of effective mechanism for implementing the pollution control measures. It also questioned the efficacy of CAQM, asking whether the Commission has any power to enforce its directives or if its remit is confined to only issuing directions./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Light rain, thundershowers likely in Delhi today, AQI to remain 'very poor': IMD","New Delhi, Dec. 5 -- A blanket of cloud and haze enveloped Delhi as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted light rain and thundershower in the national capital on Sunday evening or night. The air quality index in Delhi will, however, remain in the very poor category, according to the real-time data of the Central Pollution Control Board./The Air Quality Early Warning System's forecast for this evening said that the AQI in the national capital region is likely to be on the lower end of 'very poor' category./As of this morning, Delhi recorded an AQI of 305 (very poor), Faridabad 296 (poor), Ghaziabad 288 (poor), Gurgaon 174 (moderate) and Noida 273 (poor)./The mercury dropped to 11.4 degrees Celsius in Delhi, two notches above the season's normal on Sunday, according to the weather department, while the maximum temperature is likely to be around 25 degrees Celsius, they said.

"Lockdown not on cards after Omicron case, says Delhi health minister Jain","India, Dec. 7 -- A day after the first case of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was detected in the national capital, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said a lockdown was not on the cards at the moment, and that the graded response action plan to combat Covid-19 will come into action if the number of cases starts increasing, as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged residents of the city not to panic./""There is no possibility of a lockdown at the moment. The graded response action plan will be implemented if Covid-19 cases start increasing,"" said Jain. The plan has levels of restrictions such as closure of restaurants, malls, offices, and educational institutes as the positivity rate - proportion of samples that return positive - increases. Hospitals have also been asked to scale up their Covid-19 infrastructure accordingly. The graded response action plan is a mechanism similar to one used to fight air pollution./It classifies outbreak severity into four bands - yellow, amber, orange and red - with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it./Private offices, malls, weekly markets and the Metro will be shut down if the test positivity rate (TPR) rises above 2%, and the city will be put under a curfew if the number breaches 5%, according to the action plan, which was approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)./Jain added that 27 people who are suspected to have been infected with the Omicron variant have been admitted to Lok Nayak hospital. Of them, 17 have been confirmed to have Covid-19 either through RT-PCR or Rapid Antigen Test. The results of genomic sequencing for the rest are awaited./The first Omicron case was detected in Delhi on Sunday, and so far 23 cases have been genotyped across the country./The variant was first detected in South Africa towards the end of November and has since been detected in several countries./Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged people not to panic because of the variant./""The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has now entered India. We are constantly receiving news regarding patients being found in this region, that region, and even in Delhi. However, I would like to tell everyone that there is no need to panic or lose sleep over it. I am constantly monitoring the situation and progress being made to deal with the possible threat of the spread of Omicron,"" he said in a digital press briefing on Monday./""I held a review meeting last week as well in relation to this, where we took account of all the necessary health facilities and their status, from beds to oxygen to medicines and all other necessary equipment. We are prepared to provide all this and other required material in sufficient quantity and on time. So there's no need to get stressed or panic. But keep doing your part - continue social distancing and never step out without wearing a mask,"" Kejriwal added./On November 30, Kejriwal held a meeting to review the state's preparedness against Covid in case a third wave emerges in the country. Kejriwal had then announced that 30,000 Covid-19 beds are ready in Delhi, with 100 beds per ward to be arranged as and when required on a two-week notice taking the total bed capacity of Delhi to over 64,000 beds. Additionally, 6,800 ICUs will also be ready very soon. Medicine stocks are currently being added, and home isolation arrangements are being strengthened. Oxygen supply and storage is being bolstered, with extra storage facilities of 442 MT, and production of 121 MT oxygen within Delhi. Additionally, telemetry devices to provide real time oxygen tracking are being installed in all oxygen facilities. Around 6,000 oxygen cylinders have been imported and 15 oxygen tankers bought to prevent oxygen shortage, the CM then said./The Delhi government has issued a Covid helpline number - 1031, to help Covid patients during any problem. This helpline number works 24x7. It employs employees in three shifts, who can attend 600 to 700 calls./Jain added that more than 93.9% of people have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and more than 61.3% both doses. He also added that the chief minister had written to the Centre urging them to ban flights from affected countries for some time to prevent the disease from spreading./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

A healthy lifestyle is the 'secret' to manage diabetes effectively,"India, Dec. 14 -- Lifestyle diseases like diabetes have become rather common today, and are affecting people of all ages. Blame it on our lifestyles or the increasing air pollution, but the statistics are alarming to say the least. As per statistics revealed by International Diabetes Federation's IDF Atlas in 2019, about 77 million people in India are living with diabetes. And these are in the public domain, but what about cases that are undiagnosed? It is said that every 1 in every 2 adults living with diabetes do not even know that they suffer from the disease./That's not all - with diabetes, there is a higher risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases, stroke, heart failure and nerve damage. But the good news is that this lifestyle disease can be effectively managed with the help of diet, exercise and medication, as well as supplementation with vitamins and minerals./The moderator, Sakshi Mandwal, as part of P&G Health's initiative 'Ask your doctor', had a chat with Dr Sanjay Kalra, Current President-Elect of South Asian Federation of Endocrine Society (SAFES) and Consultant, Bharti Hospital, Karnal, and Mr. Milind Thatte, MD, P&G Health India, to discuss the various causes and early symptoms of diabetes. They also spoke about some simple ways to manage diabetes effectively./Early symptoms of diabetes/Dr Kalra termed diabetes as 'an emergency in slow motion', which is the reason most people do not pay much attention. Although most symptoms do not present themselves before it's too late, there are certain warning signs./These include:/- Excessive thirst/- Increased hunger/- Weight loss/- Weakness/- Blurring of vision/- Frequent infections/The most common causes/Dr Kalra highlights that there can be various kinds of diabetes, most common being type-2 diabetes. ""Of course, there is a genetic component, so even if one parent has diabetes, your chances of getting it are more. There is also something called type 1 diabetes, which is more common in children. But they can also develop type 2 diabetes,"" he added./Diabetes and associated complications/Dr Kalra emphasised on the need to manage diabetes effectively, because it doesn't just affect the pancreas, but the entire body. ""When you have glucose circulating in the blood in high concentrations, that blood will bathe the body from head to toe. So, any organ can get impacted,"" he explained./Earlier this year, P&G Health undertook India's first Nerve Health Awareness Survey that revealed that diabetic complications like peripheral neuropathy impact up to 50% of the diabetic patients./Explaining this initiative in detail, Mr Thatte shared, ""It was an effort to create awareness about nerve health, and empower people to recognise early symptoms of B vitamin deficiency and how this can be overcome through a balanced diet as well as additional supplementation. While diabetes is known to have an impact on nerve health, only 13% of the respondents associated diabetes with nerve damage.""/Vitamin and mineral supplementation to combat diabetes/""When it comes to our company's objective, we are India's leading vitamin and mineral supplement manufacturing company. We manufacture and market prescription and non-prescription supplements that improve the lifestyle and quality of life,"" shared Mr Thatte./Dr Kalra added that although vitamins are an integral part of our diet, the upper socio-economic strata are deficient in vitamins B12 and D. ""We need to optimise our nutrient status, so this is a wake up call for all of us,"" he said./P&G Health has a dedicated portfolio which includes supplements for Vitamin B and Vitamin E. As a leader in Nerve Care with its flagship brand Neurobion, P&G Health has been working to raise awareness on the symptoms of Nerve Health as well as effective management of the same. Vitamin E is another nutrient that's equally important, although it is largely associated with skin nourishment. P&G's Evion has been around for decades now, and is one of the most preferred by consumers today. ""When it comes to the role of antioxidants, it helps in the neutralisation of free radicals, and reduces the associated tissue damage. A company like ours emphasises on quality checks, so Evion before it reaches the market has passed 50 quality checks,"" explains Mr Thatte./The last word/A healthy lifestyle is imperative to manage diabetes, so Dr Kalra says one MUST NOT compromise when it comes to their eating habits, sleep cycle, exercise routine as well as supplements. It is also essential to keep stress at bay, and abstain from substance abuse./Concluding the conversation, Mr Thatte says that P &G Health's endeavor is towards raising patient and consumer awareness to help them recognize early symptoms and seek timely treatment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi govt appointed 3-member panel to look into Bhalswa landfill fire,"India, Dec. 15 -- Three days after a fire broke out at the Bhalswa landfill, the Delhi government on Tuesday constituted a three-member committee to investigate the blaze and submit its report within two days./Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the committee -- headed by senior environmental engineer DK Singh and comprising senior scientific officer Dr Chetna and environmental engineer Rajiv Sharma -- has been asked to look into the reasons behind the fire and submit a detailed report within two days, based on which the environment department will take action to ensure there is no repeat of such an incident./""The environment department has formed a three-member committee to investigate the fire which broke out at the Bhalswa landfill. The committee has been directed to look into every aspect and possible reasons behind the fire. The members have also been instructed to submit a report to the environment department within two days, after which appropriate action would be taken to ensure such instances do not occur in future,"" said Rai./The Bhalswa landfill comes under the jurisdiction of the BJP-ruled North MCD. Elections to the three municipal corporations are scheduled for early next year./""It was discovered that due to the fire at the Bhalswa landfill site, piles of garbage were spilled everywhere around the site and the smoke made the air barely breathable for the people around. Reportedly, many such unfortunate instances of fires have taken place in the past, but the North MCD has not taken any action to prevent them,"" said Rai, adding that landfill fires are a major contributor to Delhi's air pollution./North MCD spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking a comment./On Monday, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that small fires in landfills are common across the world, and attributed it to gas build up.

A similar complaint has also been forwarded against Verka Milk plant officials for burning the organic waste in the premises on Thursday morning./President, Council of Engineers Kapil Arora said, ""Burning of waste adds to pollution and causes respiratory and skin diseases. It is the duty of MC to stop others from indulging in the illegal activity, but its own staff is acting against restriction orders issued by National Green Tribunal (NGT) and Supreme Court in the past. The employees also misbehave with the public when they oppose the burning of waste.""/""Earlier too, complaints have been submitted with the senior officials, but to no avail. If MC and senior officials in the local bodies department failed to take action then we will be forced to move NGT,"" said Arora./MC health officer Vipal Malhotra said that the department has not received any complaint against MC staffers indulging in illegal activity of burning waste in parks recently. The public should submit a complaint along with the proof and required action will be taken against the employees too. A minimum fine of Rs.5000 is imposed on the violators who are caught burning the waste in open./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi air pollution: Restrictions on construction activities likely to be eased,"India, Dec. 20 -- Restrictions on construction activities are likely to be eased in Delhi after imporvement in the air quality. According to reports, the Commission for Air Quality (CAQM) may announce the decision regarding the same on Monday./""In view of the significant improvement in the air quality in NCR over the last three days, the CAQM is likely to further liberalise restrictions in the construction sector,"" news agency PTI reported quoting an official./The commission had on Friday said the restrictions on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-NCR will continue till further orders./However, projects related to public utilities, railways, metro, airports and ISBTs, national security, defence, healthcare, highways, roads, flyovers, power transmission, and pipelines among others had been exempted./The central air quality panel had also allowed authorities in Delhi-NCR to resume physical classes for students in classes 6 and above, colleges and other educational institutions with immediate effect. The commission had also said that physical classes for students up to class 5 can begin from December 27./Every year in Delhi, air quality plummets to hazardous levels with the onset of winters due to stubble burnings, emissions from transport, coal-fired plants outside the city and other industries, as well as open garbage burning and dust./This year, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in and around the city has worsened to 470-499 on a scale of 500, according to federal pollution control board data. That level of pollution means the air will seriously impact people with existing diseases and even those who have healthier lungs./A study conducted by the Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago, over a period of two years has revealed that Delhi's indoor pollution levels are also worryingly high and way above WHO limits./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Bad air: Ad hocism won't work anymore,"India, Dec. 23 -- It's December in Delhi, and as the city is blanketed by a brown soup of air pollution again, a familiar storyline is playing out. This year, too, focus on the issue picked up just in time for Diwali, reaching a crescendo during the stubble-burning season. Arguments rage on which source contributes how much to the ever-worsening air quality. Questions are raised about whether air pollution could be harmful, even cause death, with the Union government responding that there is too little evidence on the health impacts of air pollution./Persuaded by the visibly deteriorating air quality, the Supreme Court holds frequent hearings on pending cases on air pollution and directs immediate action by state governments of the region. Unfortunately, state governments, apart from engaging in the predictable blame game, introduce emergency measures a few weeks too late and launch a range of ad hoc, untested, and predominantly technical fixes. All this while Delhi residents, and much of the Indo-Gangetic plain, continue to breathe air orders of magnitude worse than what is acceptable./This story plays out year after year because our attention is focussed on this environmental and health emergency for far too short a period, and when it is, we miss the wood for the trees. A significant amount of time is wasted trying to answer questions that nobody asked, or science has already resolved for us. This was evident in Parliament on November 29, where in response to a parliamentarian's question, the environment ministry stated in the Lok Sabha that ""there is no conclusive data available to establish a direct correlation of death/disease exclusively due to air pollution""./Leaving aside the fact that such stringent conditions of causality would exclude smoking or HIV/AIDS as potential causes of death, no epidemiologist would argue that air pollution is an ""exclusive"" cause of death or disease. But decades of research in India and globally have shown conclusively that air pollution creates new vulnerabilities and exacerbates existing ones, leading to illness and premature death (over a million each year in India)./There is, of course, no more significant symbol of ineffective ad hoc pollution control measures than the smog towers erected in Delhi. There is no scientific evidence that proves such towers to be effective anywhere, let alone in one of the most polluted cities in the world. The Delhi government's analysis has shown that the crores spent on the smog tower at Connaught Place have yielded little in the way of improvements in air quality. Yet, more will be erected in other cities./Similarly, the Union and state governments have invested thousands of crores over the last few years in purchasing and distributing happy seeders, developing bio-decomposers, and converting stubble to ethanol among a raft of other technical solutions to stubble-burning. And yet, burning stubble remains the most economically viable option for farmers to clear their fields between the growing seasons. Unfortunately, myopic policymaking has meant we continue to procrastinate on difficult policy decisions, most critical among them being moves towards crop diversification and extending the coverage of minimum support prices./Air pollution is a complex societal problem caused by aspects of policy related to India's energy mix, poverty-reduction goals, agricultural productivity, transportation choices, urban planning, and many others. We must recognise this and focus on long-term policy pathways with clear goals and time lines. Regrettably, our approach is centred in the ""here and now"", where instead of decisively moving towards emissions reductions at source from the big four (industry; transport; biomass and waste burning; and dust), we focus much of our energy on implementing emergency action plans once the air quality has already reached severe levels./While the National Clean Air Programme and the 15th Finance Commission grants to urban local bodies are a modest start, the lack of technical capacity within the implementing agencies and the time needed to ramp up action mean we are unlikely to see progress in the short term. More importantly, focusing on urban centres ignores the vast swathe of rural India that experiences air quality as bad if not worse as pollution sources exist both within and outside the household./This is a nationwide, all-year-round problem. So the government needs to plan strategically for the long term, with clearly defined metrics for success, including interim and final targets. This process needs to be guided by a multi-disciplinary team of experts and be responsive to calls for public consultation and accountability. We can no longer afford to spend inordinate amounts of time engaging with ineffective and ill-planned techno-fixes, responding to red herrings, and focusing on Delhi to the detriment of the rest of the country./Bhargav Krishna is fellow, Centre for Policy Research, and co-founder, Care for Air.

Rise in air pollution increases COPD cases in Pune,"India, Dec. 24 -- As cooler winds continue in the city, many areas report poor air quality during the day. As a result, there is a rise in asthmatic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complaints. Shivajinagar, Bhosari, Alandi and other parts of Pune city reported poor air quality during morning hours. The air quality index (AQI) worsens by evening with more road traffic./As per data furnished by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality for Pune city on Friday evening was moderate./However, Shivajinagar reported poor air quality with PM2.5 particles at 201 and the air quality for December 25 is likely to remain poor as forecasted by Safar./Along with Shivajinagar, Nigdi and Bhosari also reported poor air quality on Friday. Lohegaon, Alandi, Kothrud, Katraj, Hadapsar and Bhumkar chowk in Wakad reported moderate air quality. Pashan reported satisfactory air quality on Friday./Speaking about the rise in cases of asthma and COPD, Dr Sushrut Ganpule, consultant pulmonologist with Jupiter Hospital in Pune, said there are about 20 per cent more cases of asthma and bronchospasm./""During winter there is an increase in cases of asthma and COPD due to reduction in day and night temperatures and other reasons and conditions lead to enhanced symptoms of asthma and COPD. Winter is also the flowering season because of which it is more likely to affect asthma patients. Temperature and other factors can act as triggers for patients and lead some of them to have induced attacks,"" said Dr Ganpule./He said that because of low day and night temperatures, the air quality is also poor which may affect patients./""The air has more PM 2.5 particles and they affect patients as air quality deteriorates. Smog can also affect asthma and COPD patients a lot,"" said Dr Ganpule./Speaking about the relation between cold and poor air quality, scientist from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said that as night temperature drops the pollution particles start settling down./""As they settle at lower levels of the atmosphere along with the pollution generated by vehicles, it overall affects the air quality further. This is a normal phenomenon during winter,"" said officials from IITM./As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the day and night temperature are likely to see a rise in the next few days./Lung installation to check pollution/To spread awareness about air pollution and its impact on health, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in collaboration with NGO Parisar will install a replica of lungs at Sambhaji Garden on December 27. The replica will be installed with sensors to measure the pollution and its impact. Depending on air quality and pollution, the lungs will turn black with passage of time./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi Covid-19 curbs: New Metro guidelines commuters must know,"India, Dec. 28 -- The Delhi government on Tuesday announced a series of curbs in the national capital in the wake of rising coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The caseload has risen due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2 virus./The restrictions announced by the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government includes closure of gym, yoga studios, spa and other places where gatherings can take place and reducing the number of employees going to the office./The restrictions will also impact those who use Delhi Metro to travel to their offices or other places. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has also been asked to reduce the number of passengers in a coach./According to the new guidelines that have been issued by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), Metro trains have to run at 50 per cent seating capacity. No standing passengers will be allowed in the trains, the order further said./""At the same time, buses going from one state to another will run with 50 per cent seating capacity, while only two passengers will be allowed to travel in auto, e-rickshaw, taxi and cycle rickshaws,"" the order further said./The restrictions that have been put in place by the Delhi government from today are under the first level of the graded response force (GRAP) - yellow alert. If the Covid-19 situation deteriorates further, the second level (amber alert) will come into effect, which will reduce the seating capacity further to 33 per cent, as per GRAP framework decided in July./The DDMA had in November allowed standing passengers in each Metro coach, along with 100 per cent seating capacity, as a measure to boost the use of public transport in light of the hazardous air pollution levels in the national capital./The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic had majorly affected operations of the Delhi Metro./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Can heart attack be triggered by air pollution? Know from a health expert,"Delhi, Dec. 31 -- A heart attack occurs when the blood flow, which brings oxygen to the heart muscle, is reduced or obstructed due to the blocking or severely narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart. The signs of it may include chest pain, breathlessness, breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, upper body pain or dizziness./According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 17.9 million people died from Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. We often picture a heart attack as grimacing from the extreme chest pain and clutching our chest but few know that heart attacks are silent too and symptoms in women may sometimes be different from men./As per the British Heart Foundation, ""Air pollution can affect your heart and circulation by damaging the inside walls of your blood vessels, causing them to become narrower and harder, restricting the movement of your blood vessels, which can increase your blood pressure and add to the strain on your heart, making your blood more likely to clot, affecting the normal electrical functioning of your heart which could cause abnormal heart rhythms and causing small changes to the structure of the heart like those that are seen in the early stages of heart failure.""/In a report by Physicians For Social Responsibility, it was revealed that, ""air pollutants contribute to serious, even fatal damage to the cardiovascular system and air pollution is a factor that you can't control just through healthy lifestyle."" It added, ""Harmful air pollutants lead to cardiovascular diseases such as artery blockages leading to heart attacks (arterial occlusion) and death of heart tissue due to oxygen deprivation, leading to permanent heart damage (infarct formation).""/Asserting the same, Dr Santosh Kumar Dora, Senior Cardiologist, Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai shared, ""Worldwide, exposure to air pollution has been estimated to account for 16% of deaths from ischemic heart disease and 11% of deaths from stroke. There is also evidence on air pollution leading to increased incidence of diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. In a large-scale prospective study in women, living within 50 m of a major roadway increased the risk of sudden cardiac death by 38% compared with living >= 500 m away. These studies show the impact of rising air pollution and cardiovascular disease burden and death.""/Solution:/Cautioning that exposure to air pollution can rapidly deteriorate the health in some heart patients, where the lungs are also congested, Dr Santosh spilled the beans on a few measures. He stated, ""Residence should be located far from factories, major roadways. Wearing face masks and installing air purifiers at homes. Avoid commutes during rush hour. Use indoor air purifiers and closing windows, air conditioners.""/Though the government has currently made it mandatory to wear a face mask while going out of home amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Santosh suggested that he safest mask to filter out coronavirus is the N-95 mask. He claimed, ""Coronavirus measures approximately 0.125 micron. So the N-95 mask will be very useful to filter out the PM2.5 and PM 10 particles very effectively.""/Studies have shown triple layer surgical masks and multi-layered cotton masks also are effective to prevent coronavirus spread. As N-95 masks are costly, these masks are cheaper options. All these masks which protect us from Covid-19, also will be useful to protect us from PM 2.5 and PM 10 air pollutant particles and prevent heart health from deteriorating./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Involvement of people living with non-communicable diseases,"India, Dec. 31 -- justify;"" >The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Day 2021 theme of ""leaving no one behind"" is approprate, given the gaps in equitable access to health care during the Covid-19 pandemic. While the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana is meant to enhance equitable access to health care, in India, inequity is related to socioeconomic and political status, caste, class, geography and gender differences, among others, resulting in inequitable health outcomes and health service utilisation. These dimensions also converge and intersect, wherein schemes meant for the most vulnerable members of the community are often left behind due to lack of awareness. While accelerating progress towards UHC is essential to ensuring the health and wellbeing of all people, the brunt of inequitable access to health care is borne by those living with chronic illnesses. Every year,approximately 100 million people are pushed into poverty as a result of out-of-pocket expenditure for health care, a large proportion due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs)./NCDs, including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and mental health conditions, tend to be of long duration and are the most common causes of death and disability worldwide and in India (71 % and 63% of all deaths, respectively). Many NCDs are preventable, driven by modifiable risk factors including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol use and air pollution.Besides causing financial distress, these diseases also afflict physical and mental stress, not just on those bearing the condition but, also their caregivers. These People Living with NCDs (PLWNCDs--those with the condition/s and their care givers) bear the brunt of the disease, coupled with the mental trauma of navigating a complicated health system. Pandemics only worsens the challenges faced by PLWNCDs, both in terms of derailing regular care, and also increasing risk of severe morbidity or mortality./To sensitise the public, set up infrastructure, and carry out NCD screenings at the primary health care level, the ministry of health and family welfare, Government of India, has implemented aNational Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke (NPCDCS) since 2010. India also adopted ten national NCD targets in 2013 and, thereafter, released the National Multi-Sectoral Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Common NCDs - 2017-22 (NMAP). The NMAP supports a whole-of-government (all ministries/departments of central and state governments) and whole-of-society(community, civil society organisations (CSOs), private sector) approach to NCD prevention and control. However, any reference to PLWNCDs is starkly missing in these initiatives./Community participation and empowerment is an important best buy for achieving equitable, people-led health care and palliative care.The Alma-Ata Declaration on primary care emphasised that communities have a right and responsibility to be involved in their health. Even with years of evidence, reiterating the need of communities to be at the centre of efforts to prevent and treat NCDs, their meaningful involvement remains tokenistic. There is a gap in leveraging how PLWNCDs can be partners to health care providers, grassroots health workers and CSOs. They have unique, first hand insights and expertise of the contextual challenges to NCD prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care, and palliation and, on ensuring overall quality of life. This varied group represent a range of demographic backgrounds which can not only augment the efficiency of the health system but also, be a strong voice for NCD prevention./In India, there are a handful of groups making efforts towards meaningful involvement of PLWNCDs as pivotal stakeholders. The Healthy India Alliance (HIA), also known as the India NCD Alliance (/<a href=""http://www.healthyindiaalliance.org"">www.healthyindiaalliance.org</a>/), is one such coalition focusing on concerted PLWNCD-led action. HIA has been closely involved with the Our Views, Our Voices initiative, of the global NCD Alliance (/<a href=""http://www.ncdalliance.org"">www.ncdalliance.org</a>/), wherein the perspectives of PLWNCDs are embedded into the core of civil society action planning. Through several pan-India community conversations, HIA has absorbed the expertise of the Peoples' Collective, calling for people-centeredness in policy formulation, programme implementation and health system strengthening. HIA developed theIndia Advocacy Agenda for People Living With NCDs, highlighting the needs, priorities and challenges of People Living with NCDs. HIA also undertook a situational analysisto map the UHC landscape in India, the health systems' capacity to prioritise NCDs within the ambit of UHC and, call for a people-centred response. PLWNCDs in India, have also provided key inputs for the development of the Global Charter on Meaningful Involvement of People Living with NCD, which is now open for endorsements by stakeholders (/<a href=""https://www.ourviewsourvoices.org/global-charter/endorse"">https://www.ourviewsourvoices.org/global-charter/endorse</a>/)./The pandemic while highlighting inequities, has also shone light on the power of a united peoples' movement in dealing with unprecedented impediments, when Covid mitigation disrupted routine services, including NCD care. Health care is no longer restricted to medical facilities, having diffused to homes and the communities. PLWNCDs and citizens have taken on the onus of care and management. This reiterates their critical role as key players in the effectiveness of a hybrid, in-person and virtual health care system. Meaningful involvement of PLWNCDs warrants leadership and active involvement in all aspects of the NCD response including - governance, policy formulation and enforcement, design and delivery of programmes and services, community mobilisation, evidence generation and impact evaluation./The way forward:/PLWNCDs represent a diverse and dynamic section of society, with valuable social, economic, cultural and professional skills. They are a rich human resource that embodies the humane facet to the statistics that NCDs and UHC are often restricted to. They must thrive and lead the way so that no one is left behind, in letter and spirit./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Childhood pneumonia: India's silent epidemic,"India, Jan. 8 -- With the Covid-19 pandemic raging on for two years, the world has recognised the challenges around inequitable access to resilient health systems, especially access to oxygen. This remains a prime barrier in other major respiratory illness which plague India - especially India's young. Childhood pneumonia, which causes the death of a child every 39 seconds in the country, was the cause for nearly 127,000 deaths in 2018 (UNICEF)./The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2019-21, reveals that the number of parents seeking medical care for childhood pneumonia dropped marginally from 73% to 69%. This, even as the cases among Indian households stood at 2.8%./While the pandemic played a part in this disregard of the killer disease, it also points to lack of awareness about the disease. A better understanding and prioritisation of childhood pneumonia in the community are required. As with Covid-19, it is important to watch out for distinguishing symptoms of pneumonia - to differentiate it from a simple nose block or breathing problems due to upper chest congestion./Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, and causes acute respiratory infection. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When someone has pneumonia, the alveoli fill up with pus and fluid, limiting oxygen intake. Incorrect or delay in treatment can cause respiratory failure./Children who live in overcrowded conditions and are exposed to environmental contaminants such as indoor and outdoor air pollution are at an elevated risk of contracting pneumonia./As we are seeing with the Covid-19 pandemic, any change in the course a widespread disease takes can only be done if everyone, including the public, acts in unison. We need a campaign that resonates across the length and breadth of the country - something similar to the ""Do Boond Zindagi Ki"" campaign for polio eradication. The government's recently launched SAANS (Social Awareness and Action Plan to Neutralise Pneumonia Successfully) campaign is expected to bring a positive change in the way the country perceives childhood pneumonia. Besides, the inclusion of the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) in the universal immunisation programme will go a long way in disease prevention./But several challenges remain, mainly because identification of pneumonia symptoms requires a high level of diagnostic skills. It is unfair to expect such skills among the frontline health workers such as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) who are not well equipped, but are still given the responsibility of identifying signs of pneumonia in the early stages. In rural areas, a majority of the care-seeking happens through informal private providers without a formal medical background, and hence they lack the skills to make an informed diagnosis./Diagnosing pneumonia by getting X-rays and blood samples takes time and is available at health care facilities that are not always accessible. The lack of availability of rapid testing kits that can quickly diagnose pneumonia is another challenge./The need of the moment is an extensive network of health care providers who are equipped to traverse every nook and corner of the country, diagnosing, treating, and referring patients to the nearest health care facility. The cadre of community health workers, present in every village of India, is equipped and authorised to do so. This is the time to strengthen their capacities to improve their performance./Private providers should also be roped in to reach the remotest corners of the country. This has to be supported by an intelligent digital backbone that studies the incidence of cases, monitors spikes, and triggers concerted action. Efforts are also needed to shift the organisational culture of accountability to ensure quality./While we, as a country, suffered terribly from the pandemic, the hard-earned learnings can be used to manage other critical health emergencies, such as pneumonia, as well. Let's breathe life back into our struggling children./Rajiv Tandon is director - Health, and Lopamudra Ray Saraswati is manager - Health, Research Triangle Institute International, India/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi's first CNG-based pet crematorium to be operational by April,"India, Jan. 11 -- The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has initiated the construction work on the first municipal pet crematorium of the city in Dwarka and the work on the project is likely to be completed in the next four months by April 2022, leader of the House Inderjeet Sehrawat said on Monday./Sehrawat said that the veterinary department is setting up the city's first CNG-based cremation centre for small animals in Dwarka Sector 29, where provisions will be made to store their ashes for 15 days after being cremated with proper rituals. ""The project is being executed in public-private partnership mode (for 10 years) and the entire cost of construction, upkeep, and maintenance of this crematorium will be taken up by the NGO Green Revolution Foundation. The arrangement with the agency allows it to operate the facility for 10 years and the agency has been selected through an open tender process,"" Sehrawat said./As part of the agreement, the corporation has allotted land for the cremation centre; the SDMC will retain ownership of the crematorium./A senior veterinary department official said that the facility will come up on a 700 square metre site inside the 4-acre dog centre complex in Dwarka where the sterilisation centre is already operational./""Pet owners will be able to get back the ashes. There will be other facilities such as prayer rooms available. We are also making provisions for a locker room. The facility will have two furnaces with a capacity of 200kg biomass capacity and a 150kg biomass capacity per cycle each. Each cremation cycle will take 30 minutes to 1 hour,"" the official said, adding that the facility will be smokeless./""As part of the contract, the developer will have to install an air pollution control system. The CNG eco-friendly crematorium will be constructed with advanced air purification technology to make it 98% smokeless and pollution-free. The smoke will also pass through a wet scrubber. While initially we planned to set up a dog-only crematorium, the project has been expanded to include other small animals such as cats, goat, sheep and monkeys,"" the official explained./Sehrawat said that the corporation has fixed a fee of Rs.2,000 for cremating animals that weigh less than 30 kilograms and Rs.3,000 for cremating dogs and other animals that weigh more. ""Cremation of stray dogs from areas under the jurisdiction of the SDMC will be done free of cost while a rate of Rs.500 has been fixed for the cremation of stray dogs from areas under the jurisdiction of other civic agencies,"" Sehrawat added./The other four agencies-- north MCD, east MCD, New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board- will be expected to transport the dead animals to the centre while the NGO has been tasked to ensure transportation of dead animals in SDMC areas to the Dwarka centre, Sehrawat added./The much-delayed project was first announced in 2018. Recently, the north MCD also expressed interest in setting up a similar facility. The Dwarka dog crematorium site had become a point of controversy in April-May, when the city was facing its worst mortality rates due to the second wave of Covid pandemic, and the civic body had decided to create temporary pyre platforms with the goal of expanding the daily Covid cremation capacity. Ultimately, the site was never used for human cremations./Dr Ravindra Sharma, director (veterinary department) SDMC, said since many pet lovers wanted dignified last rites for their pets, the crematorium will also arrange for priests and urns. ""There will be a priest at the crematorium, to perform traditional rituals. At the new crematorium, there will be a facility to store ashes for 15 days from the date of cremation, so that people can collect them later,"" he said./Pet-owners in the city have lauded the idea. Upendra Kumar of Greater Kailash-1, who owns an Alsatian, said that since south Delhi is home to a large number of pet-owners, the crematorium will really be beneficial. ""Many of us had run from pillar to post to get our pets cremated, as south Delhi presently has only a small private crematorium for pets. This new crematorium will certainly give solace to us and peace to the souls of our pets,"" he said./With inputs from Sanjeev Jha/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Dementia: A sharp rise in cases expected - how to avoid being one of them,"India, Jan. 14 -- As scientists predict dementia cases will triple over the next three decades, we asked an expert how to identify the early symptoms and what we can do to avoid it./A diagnosis of dementia is a frightening prospect./Sufferers lose the ability to think, remember and reason so severely that it's difficult to go about daily life. They struggle to control their emotions, to communicate and perform daily tasks. It's debilitating and poorly understood./In the next three decades, the number of people suffering from dementia is set to triple - climbing from about 57 million today to more than 152 million people by 2050, according to results from a new study published in The Lancet./Although it's a grim prediction, many of the risk factors for dementia are what scientists describe as ""modifiable"" - meaning, changes in behavior can affect your chances of developing dementia./So, what can we do to stave off this crippling condition?/Before it's too late, consider these risk factors/Dementia is not a specific disease. It's a general term used to describe the latest stage of a neurodegenerative disease - when it is too late to reverse the changes./Not all of the cognitive impairments that can lead to dementia will, however. Some can be reversed and, crucially, many can be prevented through changes in the way we lead our lives, says Marina Boccardi, dementia expert at the German Research Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)./""If we miss the chance to cure reversable conditions, that's when they could become dementia,"" she told DW./It's difficult to pin down exactly what causes the neurological damages that can be precursors to dementia. But scientists have identified several factors that make your chances much more likely. The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention lists 12 main risks: Lower levels of education, hypertension, impaired hearing, smoking, obesity, depression, a lack of physical activity, diabetes and low social contact, as well as excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injuries and air pollution. Recent research has also highlighted a link between sexual assault and dementia./The good news is a majority of these risks can be lowered through changes in behavior, Boccardi points out. ""If we as individuals or our governments do something concrete to reduce these risk factors, we may avoid as many as 40% of dementia cases,"" she told DW./So, how can we prevent dementia?/Many of the risks stem from a lack of stimulation - physical, social and mental./Regular exercise and a healthy diet - low in sugar and saturated fats, devoid of smoking and high alcohol consumption - can reduce the risks associated with diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure and depression. As can healthy sleeping patterns - not too little or too much. A large study published in 2021 found people in their 50s and 60s who don't get enough sleep are more likely to get dementia later in life./Some research also suggests dancing could be a powerful antidote to loss of brain function./A study in the New England Journal of Medicine involving 469 people over 75 found ""dancing was the only physical activity associated with a lower risk of dementia."" By stimulating both the mind and the body, dancing offers a two-pronged benefit: Along with engaging the brain, requiring memory, coordination and cognition, the physical activity of dancing can also lower the risk of cardiovascular disease./Some factors, however, have more to do with privilege and chance - such as low education levels, brain injuries, assault, air pollution and, in many cases, obesity. These risks are not so easily modified./Why detection of early symptoms and treatment are so important/Often, by the time patients begin to notice the impact of a neurodegenerative disease on their daily lives - memory loss and tremors, for example - the disease has been at work for many years and it's too late to reverse the damage. Brain changes such as the build up of proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease, for example, are known to start about 15 to 20 years before patients show cognitive impairments./That's why early detection is so important, Boccardi says, because this allows for treatment./The early stages of dementia tend to start with forgetfulness, losing track of time and getting lost in familiar places. Anxiety and depression can also serve as early indicators that something is not right, especially for younger patients./And although many people can experience these things without suffering from a serious illness, Boccardi advises to pay attention if you find yourself thinking ""oh, this is really not me"" and find it worrisome. The same goes for family members. ""If you notice relevant changes in behavior in family members that they might not notice themselves or might be hiding, that's a good time to get a medical check,"" she said./Whatever you do, don't ignore it, says Boccardi - including when someone has received a neurodegenerative diagnosis, as isolation and lack of treatment will only worsen the condition./""Fear and stigma around dementia keeps people from doing what you should actually do - keep up social interaction, keep doing things and being active, doing what you can do, which is often quite a lot.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Indonesia replaces sinking Jakarta with new capital city Nusantara: Details here,"India, Jan. 20 -- The Indonesian Parliament has passed a law to relocate the country's capital from Jakarta to Nusantara. This is the most significant advancement of an idea the country's leaders have been toying with for years./The new state capital law, which provides a legal framework for President Joko Widodo's ambitious $32 billion mega project, also stipulates how development of the capital will be funded and governed./""The new capital has a central function and is a symbol of the identity of the nation, as well as a new centre of economic gravity,"" Planning Minister Suharso Monoarfa told parliament after the bill was passed into law./Why is Indonesia moving the capital from Jakarta?/The plan was formulated as Jakarta is prone to flooding amid climate change. The sinking megacity also suffers from chronic congestion and air pollution./Monoarfa said that the relocation of the capital city to Nusantara is based on several considerations, regional advantages, and welfare and with a vision of the birth of a new economic centre of gravity in the middle of the archipelago./President Joko Widodo first announced the capital would be relocated in 2019, but the move was delayed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic./How fast is Jakarta sinking?/Jakarta sits on the swampy ground near the sea - making it especially prone to flooding - and is one of the fastest-sinking cities on Earth, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). It has been dropping into the Java Sea at an alarming rate due to the over-extraction of groundwater./Jakarta is also one of the world's most overpopulated urban regions. It is home to more than 10 million people, with an estimated 30 million in the greater metropolitan area, according to the United Nations./About Nusantara/The name of the new city has been chosen by Widodo. It is a Javanese term which translates to ""archipelago"" in the Indonesian language. It is located within the jungle of Kalimantan on Borneo island./According to data from the National Planning and Development Agency, the total land area for the new capital city will be around 256,143 hectares (around 2,561 square kilometres) - almost all of it converted from the forest area./Indonesia owns the majority of Borneo, the world's third-largest island, with Malaysia and Brunei each holding parts of its northern region./The initial relocation will start from between 2022 and 2024./Nusantara would follow in the footsteps of new capitals in other countries, notably Brazil and Myanmar./It will strengthen supply chains and place Indonesia ""in a more strategic position in world trade routes, investment flows, and technological innovation,"" the government said in a statement./The new capital has been dubbed by the government as a low-carbon ""super hub"" that will support pharmaceutical, health and technology sectors and promote sustainable growth beyond Java Island./Nusantara will be led by a chief authority whose position is equivalent to a minister./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Garbage burning chokes Pune residents,"India, Feb. 3 -- PUNE Residents are once again troubled by the incessant problem of garbage burning which is affecting their health. and are knocking on the doors of the authorities to check the menace./In every part of the city, garbage is being dumped on the road and blatantly burned daily in the morning, leading to heavy smog and think smoke laying a blanket across the area, thus leading morning walkers to inhale the smoke./""Garbage burning has become an eyesore. We have been complaining continuously, but the local authorities have turned a blind eye,"" said Vaishali Patkar who sees massive black smoke every time she commutes via the service road from Veer Bhadra Nagar in Baner./Judith Menezes, a NIBM resident said, ""This is a weekly occurrence. Garbage is dumped on vacant plots, and uis burned by unknown people.Nobody is able to find neither the dumpers nor the miscreants. The smoke bellows into our society and often causes irritation cough and also constant watering of the eyes.""/Local corporator Nanda Lonkar from NIBM, said, ""We make sure that there are daily rounds from the sanitation department and we try to clean up at the earliest.

Centre nudges states to reopen schools as Covid-19 cases dip,"India, Feb. 4 -- Schools should reopen at the earliest possible and appropriate guidelines have been issued to states, a top Union government official said on Thursday, citing the protection from vaccines to make a strong case for in-person classes to be resumed./The stand, taken by Niti Aayog member VK Paul, comes at a time when several states have dithered on letting children back into classrooms despite a sustained drop in new cases nationwide./""Physical learning is possible; school activities which lead to interaction, development is possible; and teachers can feel safe because now in any case we are vaccine protected,"" said Paul during the government's briefing on Covid-19 on Thursday./Agreeing with concerns that closing schools had led to significant learning losses, Paul said: ""Therefore at the earliest, appropriate, opportune time, the schools should be opened. It had other imperatives in the absence of vaccines-teachers were not protected, for instance. [But] we have come a long way now; and we have more confidence to go in the direction of running schools""./The Union government in December issued new guidelines to states, which it made public this week as the debate over reopening schools grew. Among the changes in these rules are dropping a mandatory parental consent for children to be asked to return to classes. ""The decision for opening of schools rests with the state governments; and further down by the district administrations. The broad issue is that we would still like to ensure that schools are opened; and that schools are run according to protocol. We are still in the midst of a pandemic but by implementing SOPs, we can ensure safe conduct of schools,"" he said. At present, eight states have opened schools fully. The number of states that have opened for higher classes is 16, while nine others - including Delhi and Uttar Pradesh - are yet to do so./Schools were closed across the country in March 2020 when the Sars-CoV-2 first began taking hold across the world. They were reopened as part of a phased ""unlock"" process on October 15, 2020 but had to be shut during the Delta variant outbreak in the spring of 2021. In Delhi, additional closures last year were triggered by the air pollution crisis./The Union government has now issued new guidelines and a separate advisory detailing how to improve learning levels and bring back a large number of students who have dropped out after learning moved online - a mode that not many can afford./""The guidelines are advisory in nature, which were shared with all states, UTs, and stakeholders asking to adapt these as per the needs of the states as deemed fit. And they are to prepare their own guidelines and SOPs,"" said Sweety Changsan, joint secretary (department of school education & literacy), ministry of education./The latest updated guidelines take into account vaccination coverage in the country, especially of teaching and non-teaching staff in our schools and educational institutions. ""In all the states, the vaccination coverage for both teaching and non-teaching staff has been around 95%, on an average. Some states have even completed 100% vaccination of their teaching and non-teaching staff. Information regarding the eligible student level is still being collected. Also, for various central institutions like Kendiyra Vidayalaya, Navodaya Vidyalaya etc. it's about 98- 100%,"" said Changsan./Gatherings and congregations, and group activities should be allowed in accordance with the SOPs; and necessary precautions are advised for children with co-morbidities as they pose higher risk of developing serious disease./""The ministry has been encouraging states to follow the SOPs; and take forward the issue of vaccination, and alternative measures so that continued learning is carried on,"" she added./Experts have said that schools should be the last to close and first to reopen, particularly since children themselves are at significantly lower risk from disease. The risk largely pertains to them potentially passing on Covid-19 to teachers and relatives, a danger that has been significantly mitigated now with high vaccination uptake rates./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World Cancer Day observed in government health institutions in Mohali,"Mohali, Feb. 5 -- World Cancer Day was observed in various government health institutions across the district on Friday. Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said World Cancer Day is observed every year across the globe on February 4 to raise awareness about the disease and its symptoms. The day also tries to inspire prompt action and life-saving treatment and care for all individuals suffering from the disease./She said that this year's World Cancer Day theme is ""close the care gap"". The theme aims to raise awareness about the vast difference in cancer care and prevention that people from different sections of society can avail themselves. People with low income, lack of educational qualifications, and disabilities face considerable barriers in availing care for cancer. The transgender population and refugees are some groups that are often unable to get proper treatment until their cancer has progressed to an advanced stage./The civil surgeon added that the use of tobacco, cigarettes and betel leaf is a major cause of cancer in India. It is possible to cure a deadly disease like cancer but it should be detected in time and, therefore, timely diagnosis is very important. Talking about the causes of cancer, the civil surgeon said tobacco use is the cause of cancer in 40 out of 100 cancer patients in India. Tobacco is the leading cause of six major cancers. ""Cancer can affect people of all ages,"" she said. Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution are risk factors for cancer and other non-communicable diseases. The most common cancers are breast, lung, colon and rectum and prostate cancers. She said many cancers can be cured if detected early and treated effectively./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Can Ayurveda shrink tumours? Check out these 32 herbs with anti-cancer potential,"Delhi, Feb. 5 -- February is Cancer Prevention Awareness Month and since today, we know more about cancer than ever before, it is no secret that early detection and treatment is the key to prevention that can save millions of lives every year - a thought backed by the World Health Organization and even Ayurveda experts. The WHO lists tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution as risk factors for cancer and other noncommunicable diseases./Can Ayurveda really shrink tumours?/While scientists are making their best efforts to fight this disease, Ayurveda experts assert that the ancient Ayurvedic classics are aware of the clinical features resembling cancer with the names such as Apachi, Gulma, Granthi and Arbuda. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Vasudev Vaidya (PhD) Deputy Medical Superintendent at Sushrutha Ayurvedic Medical College and Hospital and Dr Sunitha MP (MD Ayurveda) Department of Dravyaguna Vijnana shared, ""Ayurveda, the oldest Indian medicine system which is still at practice is known from very early times for preventing or suppressing various tumours using these natural drugs and nowadays the scientific community has shifted the focus of research on complementary and alternative medicine for the management of cancer.""/They explained that in Ayurvedic concept, according to 'Charaka' and 'Sushruta Samhitas', cancer is described as inflammatory or non-inflammatory swelling and mentioned either as 'Granthi' (minor neoplasm) or 'Arbuda' (major neoplasm). The nervous system (Vata or air), the venous system (Pitta or fire) and the arterial system (Kapha or water) are three basics of Ayurveda and very important for normal body function and in malignant tumours, all three systems get out of control (Tridoshas) and lose mutual coordination that causes tissue damage, resulting in critical condition./""Tridoshas cause excessive metabolic crisis resulting in proliferation,"" they said. The doctors added, ""The modern cancer therapy which is known to be burdened by drug-induced toxic side effects, hoping perfect cure of disease, form the complementary and alternative medicine system. The main objective of Ayurvedic therapy is to find the ultimate cause of an illness while the therapeutic approach of Ayurveda is divided into four categories as Prakritisthapani chikitsa (health maintenance), Rasayana chikitsa, (restoration of normal function), Roganashani chikitsa (disease cure) and Naishthiki chikitsa (spiritual approach).""/Potential herbs for Cancer:/Dr Vasudev Vaidya and Dr Sunitha stressed that herbs help in total healing, reduce the side effects along with reduction in cancer-associated complications. They revealed that though many herbs are under clinical studies and being investigated phytochemically to understand their anti-cancer potential nowadays, some plants have scientific evidence of anti-cancer property./These include:/1.

MPCB tells Khaparkheda power plant to stop dumping of toxic fly ash in Nandgaon village,"India, Feb. 5 -- The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on Thursday issued a notice to the Khaperkheda Thermal Power Station (KTPS) in Nagpur district to immediately stop dumping fly ash slurry into the Nandgaon ash pond, some 40kms away. The move comes nearly a month after state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray met with researchers tracking the impact of fly ash (a toxic by-product of coal combustion) pollution in the region, and ordered action to control pollution around the Koradi and Khaparkheda power plants./For several months, locals from Nandgaon have been protesting against the unauthorised dumping of fly ash in their village, to the detriment of the groundwater and their farmlands. This was highlighted in a November 2021 report -- Polluted Power: How Koradi and Khaperkheda Thermal Power Stations are Impacting the Environment -- by researchers at the Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) in Nagpur, Manthan Adhyayan Kendra in Pune and advocacy group Asar. Its findings were presented to Thackeray on January 6. Keeping in mind the significant impact of coal-pollution on the lives and health of communities, the research groups requested the state government to hold off on installing the proposed new thermal power units at Koradi, and the operation of a new ash pond at Nandgaon./Aaditya Thackeray, cabinet minister for environment, highlighted that he has personally been receiving several complaints from this region. ""The safety and security of citizens of Maharashtra is our primary concern and if any amount of pollution is impacting them, we will ensure abatement at the earliest,"" he said. Representatives of the minister also added that Thackeray is slated to make a visit to the area soon to see first-hand the impacts of fly ash pollution on local communities./As per the 'Direction Notice' issued Thursday by the MPCB's regional officer (Nagpur) to the chief engineer, KTPS, the MPCB office had received various complaints regarding disposal of ash slurry into Nandgaon ash pond without permission or without providing any precautionary measures resulting in water and air pollution in the vicinity, which amounts to a violation of various environment norms../""Accordingly, Boards official had inspected the Nandgaon ash pond and verified the disposal of ash slurry in the Nandgaon ash pond without providing any pollution control arrangements.Now, therefore, in view of the above, you (KTPS) are hereby directed to comply with the following directions: You shall stop disposal/dumping of ash slurry into the Nandgaon ash pond, immediately,"" the notice reads./The MPCB has also cautioned KTPS that in case there is a failure to comply with these directions, the Board would have no option left but to issue appropriate legal action against the power station. Affected villagers had requested the MPCB, Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (MAHAGENCO) as well as Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray to curb the disposal of harmful pollutants keeping in mind the deteriorating health of local residents affected by pollution./Out of 21 surveyed villages in the area surrounding the two power plants, ""A total of four villages reported health problems due to water being contaminated, either due to fly ash settling in water or due to other contamination of drinking water. At the same time, 9 out 21 villages reported health problems that they attributed to air pollution due to fly ash including difficulty in breathing (9 villages) respiratory diseases like bronchitis and asthma (5 villages) frequent cough and cold, throat infection (4 villages) and irritation in the eyes and eye infections (7 villages),"" researchers had noted in November last year./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Aaditya Thackeray to visit areas impacted by fly ash pollution,"India, Feb. 6 -- Cabinet minister for environment and climate change, Aaditya Thackeray, will on Tuesday visit villages around the Kaparkheda Thermal Power Station (KTPS) in Nagpur district, where people complained of pollution from fly ash -- a toxic byproduct of coal combustion. The development comes three days after the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) directed KTPS to halt the unauthorised dumping of fly ash in Nandgaon village./Thackeray said that he has received several complaints from this region. ""The safety and security of citizens of Maharashtra is our primary concern and if any amount of pollution is impacting them, we will ensure abatement at the earliest,"" he said, adding that he held successive review meetings with the MPCB, MAHAGENCO, representatives of the state power ministry, and researchers who are working to document the impact of fly ash on local communities./He further said that the state environment and energy departments will come up with a detailed mitigation plan. ""The idea is to ensure proper control of both air and water pollution around coal-fired power stations in Koradi and Khapedkheda in Nagpur district. The mitigation plan will be implemented around other thermal power stations in Maharashtra,"" said Thackeray./Meanwhile, officials from the union environment ministry on February 4 visited the affected areas with representatives from the MPCB, MAHAGENCO and an independent researcher from the Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD). They found evidence of fly ash pollution in nearby fields and water bodies./Notably, CFSD, along with Pune-based Manthan Adhyayan Kendra and advocacy group Asar, had published a report in November 2021, titled ""Polluted Power: How Koradi And Khaperkheda Thermal Power Stations Are Impacting The Environment""./The report said that of 21 villages surveyed around the two power plants, four reported health problems due to water contamination, either due to fly ash settling in water or other reasons. ""At the same time, 9 villages reported health problems that they attributed to air pollution due to fly ash, including difficulty in breathing (9 villages) respiratory diseases like bronchitis and asthma (5 villages) frequent cough and cold, throat infection (4 villages) and irritation in the eyes and eye infections (7 villages),"" the report had noted.

Gurugram: Initiative to track diseases caused by air pollution hits a roadblock,"India, Feb. 9 -- The district health department's latest initiative to track diseases being reported across health institutions in the district due to the impact of air pollution has hit a roadblock. With hospitals not sharing data, the department is not being able to maintain proper records,said officials on Wednesday./The department started the initiative around two years ago under the National Program on Climate Change and Human Health. The focus on this initiative has increased in the past six months with regular training and meetings with medical staff. Two sessions of training have been conducted in the district since January this year./""The initiative was initially started around two years ago... there was not much focus as all resources were being used to manage the Covid-19 pandemic. In the past six months, under the chief medical officer's guidance, at least 150 health staff have been trained on how to identify and report cases where they suspect that a respiratory disease could be due to exposure to air pollution,"" said Dr Isha Narang, deputy civil surgeon who is the nodal officer for the initiative./""However, despite regular intimation to both private and government hospitals, they are not sharing data with us. It is a known fact that air pollution impacts our respiratory system. With this initiative, we are trying both to track cases and generate awareness so that people personally check their actions and reduce contribution to air pollution,"" added the deputy civil surgeon./Officials said during training, the health staff are asked to check for acute respiratory diseases. First, the staff have been asked to rule out possibilities like common cold due to weather change, Covid-19, and then check the exposure of such patients to air pollution and location of stay (rural or urban) if close to any pollution hotspot. A format has been set up for the health staff to report such cases so that a database can be made./Officials from the health department said that they are planning to conduct more training sessions, along with discussions with private hospitals, over the next few weeks to spread awareness about the initiative and encourage hospitals to share relevant data pertaining to diseases caused by air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mumbai environmentalist seeks public health advisories on poor air days,"India, Feb. 14 -- In a letter to officials on Sunday, city-based environmentalist and founder of the Awaaz Foundation, Sumaira Abdulali, demanded that a public health advisory be issued on days when Mumbai experiences days with hazardous air quality, much like what is done in Delhi and the surrounding national capital region when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds./Abdulali pointed out that over the last couple of weeks, Mumbai witnessed its highest ever air pollution levels since city-wide intensive air monitoring was initiated in 2015. Mumbai's AQI breached the 500 mark on January 24-25 and again witnessed very high AQI (over 300) during the first week of February. This was attributed to two dust storms that originated in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and surrounding regions that brought dust and haze to northwestern Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan./""These incidences, however, cannot be dismissed as one-off events affecting the city's air pollution, since poor air quality and its impact on health has become a significant concern for Mumbai not just during the winter months, but throughout the year,"" Abdulali wrote on Sunday to the chief minister, environment minister and commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). She added that BMC has in its latest budget announced the installation of 128 sensor-based systems to monitor air quality and provide real-time data within 4 sq km each, making Mumbai's air quality network the largest in India. ""This will make forecasting and also issuing health warnings on poor air quality days a lot easier now,"" Abdulali said./Public Health Warnings are mandated by the National Clean Air Action Plan (NCAP). They are to be implemented by every urban local bodies (ULB) of the 132 non-attainment cities in India on days when air quality severely deteriorates and is unhealthy for citizens. The design for forecasting AQI and issuing health warnings will lead to increased public awareness and ultimately, a decrease in health risk, she explained./""I request Public Health Warnings should be urgently issued in Mumbai and Maharashtra when the Air Quality Index (AQI) rises beyond safe health limits and reaches Poor, Very Poor or Hazardous levels. Such health advisories in advance would ensure people and vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, children, pregnant women among others can effectively protect themselves from deteriorating air quality,"" Awaaz Foundation's letter says./Health advisories for poor air pollution is an established global practice, and demonstrably more effective when they are hyper-local in nature.

""After receiving multiple complaints especially from women of Nandgaon and taking action, I decided to take stock of the ground situation. I have directed Nandgaon ash pond to be restored to its original state within the next 15 days. Nandgaon and even the Waregaon ash bunds will be permanently shut,"" said Thackeray./The announcement comes as a major relief for locals, whose health and livelihoods have been impacted by huge amounts of fly-ash (a toxic byproduct of coal combustion) being dumped in open spaces by the Koradi and Khaparkheda power plants, eventually entering their fields and water bodies./Maharashtra will also be conducting a comprehensive study to determine how ageing and polluting coal-fired power plants can be phased down in a systematic manner./""An audit of all power plants in Maharashtra for pollution control measures will be done. The power plants that are not meeting prescribed standards will face decisive action. A mitigation plan will be developed for this,"" said Thackeray./The state currently has an installed capacity of 13,602 MW of which coal-fired thermal power accounts for nearly 75% or 10,170 MW. State-owned thermal power stations include: Chandrapur, Koradi, Khaperkheda, Nashik, Parli, Bhusawal and Paras./A thermal power station generates electricity by converting it from heat, which is used by households and industries. A fuel (primarily coal) is used to boil water in a pressurised vessel to produce steam, which is then used to drive a turbine that is connected to an alternator, a device which converts mechanical energy to electricity in the form of an alternating current. Thermal power can also be generated from other fuels, including natural gas, heating oil or biomass./""I applaud the minister's decision. But the Nandgaon ash bund often floods into our fields and community spaces. There is a lot of unemployment in the village because people whose farms are just outside the ash bund have been impacted,"" said Sonali Manoj Varkhade, sarpanch, Nandgaon./Thackeray also added that pollution control measures including installation of flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) for air pollution will be set up at all power plants across the state, starting with Koradi-Khaperkheda. ""We will ensure 100% fly ash utilisation as per the centre's norms. The fly ash will be used for infrastructure projects,"" he said./Leena Buddhe, founder of Centre for Sustainable Development, also supported the state government's decision. CSD in November 2021 (along with environment groups Manthan Adhyayan Kendra and Asar) had published a report -- ""Polluted power - How Koradi & Khaparkheda Thermal Power Stations are impacting the Environment"" -- suggesting that all prior pollution-related harm be cleaned up under the supervision of a commission comprising local community and civil society members as well as independent experts./The findings were presented to Thackeray last month. Out of the 21 villages surveyed in the area surrounding the two power plants, ""a total of four villages reported health problems due to water being contaminated, either due to fly ash settling in water or due to other contamination of drinking water. At the same time, nine out of the 21 villages reported health problems that they attributed to air pollution due to fly ash, including difficulty in breathing (nine villages), respiratory diseases like bronchitis and asthma (five villages), frequent cough and cold and throat infection (four villages), and irritation in the eyes and eye infections (seven villages),"" the report said./Buddhe described the development as an ""historic"" example of environmental justice, seeing as no other minister has yet taken a strong stand against power plants. ""The minister patiently heard the issues of the community. The land should now be restored and a detailed plan on the restoration should be chalked out by involving the villagers. We feel that the work has just begun and it's a long way to go,"" she said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Doctors share health tips to keep colorectal cancer (CRC) risks at bay,"Delhi, Feb. 17 -- Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer and the one that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer which that which affects either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, colorectal cancer often begins as a growth called a polyp, inside the colon or rectum which is part of the body's digestive system./While causes of this cancer are still being debated in the healthcare industry, it is one of the leading cause of cancer deaths in the western world and India is catching up to the high numbers as well. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Niti Raizada, Director of Medical Oncology and Hemato-Oncology at Fortis Group of Hospitals in Bangalore, explained, ""Colorectal cancer develops when healthy cells in the colon or rectum lining alter and grow out of control, causing a tumour. Various circumstances cause different types of tumours. However, researchers are still trying to figure out the cause of colorectal cancer and how to prevent it. While there is no way to totally avoid colorectal cancer, there are ways to reduce one's risks.""/Tips to keep colorectal cancer (CRC) risks at bay:/Dr Narasimhaiah Srinivasaiah, Head of colorectal services in Karnataka region and Senior Consultant Colorectal surgeon (Colorectal, Peritoneal & Pelvic Oncology) at Apollo Institute of Colorectal Surgery (AICRS), shared, ""Risk reduction with right awareness, a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise and balanced diet with fruit, vegetables, whole grains and foods containing fibre are some ways of reducing the chances of contracting this type of cancer. Screening, in case of doubt, is the best route to take.""/He highlighted that while environmental factors such as food, water and air pollution play a role and contribute to 95% of all the colorectal cancers, the risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle, stress, obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, alcohol, consumption of junk food, excess red meat and lack of fibrous diet seem to influence the situation and makes an individual more prone to it. He revealed, ""The genetic cancers account to 5%. Being aware and understanding of colorectal cancer is paramount. One should stick to the traditional home-cooked food rich in balanced nutrients and greens. Fresh, lean meat which is cooked slowly at moderate temperature is preferable when opting for a non-vegetarian meal.""/Furthermore, he advised that a diet rich in fibre, fruit, vegetables, folate, calcium and vitamin D can help reduce your risk of colorectal cancer. He asserted, ""Accept healthy lifestyle changes. Get a daily dose of exercise and keep your weight in check. One point that is never spoken about is 'toileting'. As important as eating healthy is evacuation of the waste. An unhealthy toilet habit and toileting positions can lead to stools rich in toxic metabolites such as ammonia. This causes damage to the lining of the colon and rectum. The damage triggers a change in the cells which are precursors for cancers. This is very true of the Western system of toilets where the evacuation can be incomplete. Indian toilets or Squatty potties are recommended.""/Echoing the same, Dr Niti Raizada said, ""Colorectal cancer risk may be reduced by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and less amount of red meat. People who take calcium and vitamin D supplements had a lower risk of colorectal cancer, according to several research. Polyp removal via a colonoscopy can help prevent colorectal cancer and helps inspects the big intestine for cancerous polyps.""/Adding to the list of preventive measures, she revealed, ""Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), according to some research, may help persons with a history of colorectal cancer or polyps grow fewer polyps. Taking low-dose aspirin can help prevent cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer in some persons, depending on age and risk factors. Regular use of NSAIDs, on the other hand, can result in serious adverse effects such as stomach lining haemorrhage and blood clots leading to stroke or heart attack.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Emissions from Chandrapur power station impacts Mumbai, Goa and 7 other states: Study","India, Feb. 28 -- A new research report published on Monday has found that pollution from Chandrapur's Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) is impacting public health not just in nearby areas of Chandrapur and Nagpur, but also in cities such as Mumbai which are located a considerable distance away from the power plant. In 2020 alone, operations at CSTPS, which is Maharashtra's largest in terms of installed capacity, resulted in emissions of 4,724 tonnes of particulate matter, 1,03,010 tons of sulphur dioxide (SO2), 28,417 tons of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 1,322 kgs of mercury, the report finds./The report titled 'Health impacts of Chandrapur coal-based power plant, Maharashtra' was published by researchers at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Areas affected by these pollutants include Mumbai, Palghar and Goa in addition to several districts in Gujarat, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Chattisgarh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh./Using dispersion modelling methods to simulate the movement of emission plumes away from the site, which was analysed along with data on meteorology, population exposure, and baseline mortality data from the Global Burden of Disease project, researchers were able to attribute 62 premature deaths (for the calendar year 2020) in Chandrapur district alone to pollutants which have travelled from the CSTPS site./Similarly, 45 premature deaths in 2020 were attributed to CSTPS pollutants in Yavatmal, 30 in Mumbai, 29 in Pune and Nanded, making these the worst affected cities in terms of attributable deaths./""Air pollution impact from the CSTPS were observed over hundreds of kilometres impacting cities like Nanded, Pune and Mumbai among other cities. The operation of the CSTPS in 2020 alone contributed to more than eight lakh sick leave days, approximately 1,900 asthma emergency room visits of which over 800 were children, deaths of at least 1,300 people, and 1,800 preterm births across central India,"" CREA said in a statement Monday./""The plant also caused more than 34,000 absence days from work in Chandrapur and > 30,000 in Nagpur in the same year. The analysis also indicates that the plant's operation caused 69 preterm births in Nagpur and 79 in Chandrapur,"" CREA's report notes./CREA's analysis comes on the back of a January 2022 order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), passed in response to a petition addressing pollution concerns arising from CSTPS operations. In its order, the NGT ruled that there have been clear violations by CSTPS in adhering to air pollution norms, and directed authorities to conduct a health impact assessment study to gauge CSTP's public health footprint./Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at CREA and the report's lead author, said, ""Air pollution from coal-fired power plants does not only impact people in its immediate vicinity but travels long distances, and the concentration levels put everyone at risk, especially vulnerable citizens such as children, the elderly, and pregnant women. The health of such a vast section of a population is being compromised due to the apathy from the Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (MAHAGENCO).""/More worryingly, Dahiya also said that CSTPS is just one of several operational coal-based power plants in the country that do not comply with pollution control norms and that the cumulative health impact of coal power is certainly much higher across India./""Only about 2 percent of all India's coal-fired TPPs are actually following the union environment ministry's 2015 rules to mitigate pollution from power generation. MAHAGENCO especially has a history of non-compliance, which needs to change,"" he added./A viable solution, CREA's report suggests, would be to retire the two oldest units out of the seven which are currently operational at CSTPS (which are the most polluting), along with the installation of flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) technology to reduce the emissions at the source itself./""Installing FGD systems will reduce SO2 emissions by 92% at units numbered five to nine, and will also mitigate economic losses due to welfare loss and health burden. In 2020, more than Rs.1,650 crores could have been saved if the norms were being adhered to,"" said Dahiya./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Have entered phase that may end in 6th mass extinction, says IPCC co-chair","India, Feb. 28 -- The world has entered a phase that could end in the sixth mass extinction event, according to the latest climate evidence presented on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. Two species are illustrative of this - the white subspecies of the lemuroid ringtail possum disappeared after the 2005 heatwaves in Australia, and the Bramble Cay Melomys (Melomys rubicola) was not seen after 2009 with sea-level rise and storm surge leading to the first climate driven extinctions. Endemic species are at greatest risk of extinctions according to IPCC./The increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events such as heatwaves and droughts have driven mass mortalities in trees and corals, and in hundreds of local extinctions, IPCC said. Hans-Otto Portner, co-chair, IPCC, Working Group II, told HTthat he hopes the world hears the message from scientists that any further delay in concerted global action will mean missing a rapidly closing window to securing a liveable future./Edited excerpts:/How has the 1.1 degrees Celsius (degC) warming impacted biodiversity so far?Global warming of 1.1degC has already caused dangerous and widespread disruption in nature. About half of plants, animals and marine species studied globally are moving poleward or, on land, to higher altitudes to find conditions they can survive in. The increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events, such as heatwaves and droughts, have driven mass mortalities in trees and corals, and hundreds of local extinctions. Some losses attributed to climate change are already irreversible - we have documented two species that have become extinct because of climate change. Perhaps as worrying is the fact that climate change interacts with other pressures such as deforestation, habitat destruction, pollution and overfishing to increase the overall threats to nature./Are we seeing the start of the sixth mass extinction? How are such localised loss of species and extinctions expected to impact humans?There is no doubt that we face many unavoidable climate hazards over the next two decades with warming of 1.5degC. The risk of biodiversity loss in forests, kelp and seagrass, Arctic sea-ice and warm-water corals is expected to increase. The number of people at risk from climate change and associated loss of biodiversity will progressively increase. However, the risks to nature and people depend more on their vulnerability and exposure to climate hazards than to the level of warming so the message here is that there are things we can do to minimise the impacts to biodiversity and people's lives by acting now to adapt to climate change. Altogether we have entered a phase that may end in the sixth mass extinction, but ambitious action now can stop this development./(According to American Museum of Natural History, there have been 5 mass extinctions in the past: About 445 Million Years Ago: Ordovician Extinction; about 370 Million Years Ago: Late Devonian Extinction; 252 Million Years Ago: Permian-Triassic Extinction; 201 Million Years Ago: Triassic-Jurassic Extinction; 66 Million Years Ago: Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction)/What does approaching tipping point mean? Which ecosystems are approaching tipping points?More frequent and intense extreme events, superimposed on longer-term climate trends, have pushed sensitive species and ecosystems towards tipping points which would take them beyond their capacity to adapt, causing abrupt changes -- some of which would be irreversible over decades to millennia. One of the most obvious irreversible tipping points is the species being driven to extinction by climate change. I'm a marine biologist and so let's look to the ocean for examples of tipping points. Here I see tipping points being approached because of marine heatwaves which have driven repeated mass coral-bleaching events in many parts of the world. Although corals can survive bleaching and recover, this takes time; so when bleaching recurs frequently, corals are more likely to die. The progressive disappearance of the warm water coral reefs indicates that they are beyond their tipping point in several regions. As ocean warming and acidification accelerate, corals will increasingly lose their ability to keep pace with sea-level rise. Rising sea levels will cause more erosion along our coasts and beaches will be lost - some of these are turtle nesting sites./How are these widespread impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems likely to impact human health?We rely on nature for so much. It's a food source, it pollinates our crops, it gives us clean air, it can protect our coastlines, and of course it absorbs and stores carbon as well which helps us regulate the climate. It does an amazing job. But it's under pressure, and loss of ecosystems and their services have cascading and long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Focusing on health specifically, climate change is increasing vector-borne diseases - for example malaria and dengue - and water-borne diseases. It is contributing to undernutrition, mental health disorders and allergies in Asia by increasing the hazards such as heatwaves, flooding and drought, and air pollution, in combination with more exposure and vulnerability. Increases in heavy rainfall and higher temperatures will further increase the risk of diarrhoea, dengue fever and malaria in tropical and subtropical Asia. More hot days and intense heatwaves will increase heat-related deaths in Asia./How is the Indian monsoon impacted by climate crisis? Is it also approaching a tipping point?In the second half of the 20th century, the South and South-east Asian monsoon has weakened, primarily due to air pollution. In the long term, South and South-east Asian summer monsoon precipitation will increase./Personally, how did you deal with the stress and anxiety of documenting impacts on ecosystems?As a marine biologist, I'm very aware of the devastating impacts of climate change on the ocean, and what I know is that these are going to get worse because the ocean reacts slowly to the changing climate. My research gives me the evidence; I read evidence from other scientists, but I never get used to it. What has also struck me in the five years that I have been co-chairing this working group which focuses on the impacts of climate change is the overwhelming evidence now of the threat it poses to our own well-being. That is difficult to deal with sometimes. By bringing together 270 authors and sharing our growing scientific knowledge with policymakers and society more widely, I would like to think I am playing a part in highlighting the impacts but, perhaps most importantly, explaining what we can do about them. I hope that the world hears our message that any further delay in concerted global action will miss the rapidly closing window that we have to secure a liveable future./What can governments do to reverse these impacts?As we explain in this report, some of these impacts of irreversible, but if we want to avoid mounting losses, we have to act now. The key to success is having a healthy planet - conserving between 30% and 50% of our land, freshwater systems and oceans. But conservation has to be effective and equitable so that we safeguard nature and, at the same time, make sure that people can still make a living from the land. And of course this has to go hand in hand with reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the changing climate. However, our message to governments in this report is very clear - if we limit warming and adapt to climate change it can help deal with poverty, end hunger, ensure that more people have clean water. This will be challenging, but we know what to do./What do we expect in a 1.5degC warming scenario?I don't always like to focus on 1.5degC because it makes it seem like a cliff edge. In fact, every small increase in warming - every fraction of a degree - makes a difference. However, what the evidence shows is that, on land, 9% of the thousands of species assessed are likely to face a high risk of extinction at 1.5degC, and given that the risk of extinction in biodiversity hotspots increases by about 10-fold as warming risks from 1.5degC to 3degC./Are we at the point of no return?There is no doubt that climate change is a threat to our well-being and the health of the planet and we are not on track to secure a liveable world. However, we can turn this around - I describe this as the decade for action. If we make rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming and if we take action to adapt to the risks we face from the changing climate, we can also tackle some of the other threats we face, for example we can reduce poverty and hunger, improve people's health and provide more people with clean energy and water.

"India stares at water scarcity, extreme heat stress: Report","New Delhi, March 1 -- The Ganga, Indus, Amu Darya and other river basins in Asia could face severe water scarcity by 2050 due to climate crisis and related impacts that act as stress multipliers, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned on Monday./Among Asian cities, Ahmedabad faces a high risk from the so-called urban heat island effect (urban centres seeing higher temperatures compared to surrounding areas) and Mumbai is at high risk from floods and sea level rise, the IPCC has said. It adds that while Ahmedabad has adopted some institutional policies to adapt to these risks, Mumbai hasn't./Overall, South Asia is among the most vulnerable regions in the world when it comes to severe climate impacts due to extreme poverty and inequity, IPCC underlined. The climate crisis is already increasing vector- and water-borne diseases, undernutrition, mental disorders and allergic diseases in Asia by increasing hazards such as heatwaves, flooding and drought, air pollution, in combination with higher exposure and vulnerability, IPCC's report titled ""Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"" flagged./In addition to all-cause mortality, deaths related to circulatory, respiratory, diabetic and infectious disease, as well as infant mortality are on the rise in Asia with high temperatures. A spike in heavy rain events and temperature will increase the risk of diarrheal diseases, dengue fever and malaria. More frequent hot days and intense heat-waves will also increase heat-related deaths, the Asia factsheet of the report said./""Extreme heat puts additional load on the circulatory system, which has to do additional work to cool the body via perspiration. This may lead to dehydration and increased metabolism. Excess heat may be linked to increase or exacerbation of complications of diabetes due to dehydration and increased metabolism. Infant mortality will rise because children are not able to control their body temperature well,"" said Dilip Malvankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gujarat./There has also been biodiversity or habitat loss of animals and plants due to the climate crisis in some parts of Asia. Future climate change would cause greater biodiversity and habitat loss, modelling studies indicate. The risk of irreversible loss of coral reefs, tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, plankton communities and other marine and coastal ecosystems will increase./Glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) -- sudden release of water from a lake fed by glacier melt -- will threaten local and downstream communities in High Mountain Asia./Climate change caused loss to infrastructure, disruption in services and affected supply chains in Asia and will increase risk to infrastructure further -- even as it creates opportunities to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and green jobs, the report said. ""Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods (eg: smallholder farmers, pastoralists, fishing communities),"" the summary for policy makers of the report said./At 2 degree C or higher global warming, food security risks due to climate change will be more severe, leading to malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Central and South America and Small Islands./""This report rightly puts a spotlight on how vulnerability is exacerbated by existing inequities and factors like colonialism. Rich countries must now do their fair share and meet the long-standing demands from developing countries to pay up for loss and damage,"" said Harjeet Singh, Senior Adviser, Climate Action Network International./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Climate and Us | The domino effect that the climate crisis unleashes on health,"India, March 2 -- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s working group II report, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, released on Monday should be a wake-up call for the Centre and state governments in India./Apart from the devastating and irreversible consequences of the climate crisis being recorded on several ecosystems globally including the Himalayas, the health and wellbeing chapter of the report is a worrying account of how several climate-driven mental health conditions, diseases and other related deaths are shooting up./Without a strong public health system and strategies to cope with extreme heat in every state, several parts of India are now staring at catastrophe./Climate variability including temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and population mobility has led to increases in dengue globally and the chikungunya virus in Asia, Latin America, North America, and Europe. Higher temperatures, heavy rainfall events, and flooding are associated with an increase in diarrheal diseases in several regions. These diarrheal diseases include cholera, other gastro-intestinal infections, and food-borne diseases due to Salmonella and Campylobacter./Floods have led to increases in vector-borne and water-borne diseases and have caused disturbances of public health services. Climate extremes increase the risks of several types of respiratory tract infections that the IPCC has flagged, while wildfires, storms, and floods are followed by a spike in the rates of mental illness in exposed populations./Spring pollen season in northern mid-latitudes is occurring earlier due to the climate crisis, increasing the risks of allergic respiratory diseases; potential hours of work lost due to heat has also increased significantly over the past two decades. Some regions are already experiencing heat stress conditions and approaching the upper limits of labour productivity./Extreme heat has negative impacts on mental health, wellbeing, life satisfaction, happiness, cognitive performance, and aggression, IPCC has said./The climate crisis contributes to food insecurity, which can lead to malnutrition, undernutrition, obesity; and disease susceptibility in low- and middle-income countries, IPCC has said with ""high confidence"". Populations exposed to extreme weather and climate events may consume inadequate or insufficient food, leading to malnutrition and increasing the risk of disease. Children and pregnant women experience disproportionately higher nutrition and health impacts./For the first time, IPCC has explained the link between the climate crisis and mental health conditions and conflict. ""Children and adolescents, particularly girls, as well as people with existing mental, physical, and medical challenges and elderly people, are particularly at risk. Mental health impacts are expected to arise from exposure to high temperatures, extreme weather events, displacement, malnutrition, conflict, climate-related economic and social losses, and anxiety and distress associated with worry about climate change,"" the report states./The climate crisis also impacts the risk for conflict by undermining food and water security, income and livelihoods. An excess of 250,000 deaths per year by 2050 attributable to the climate crisis is projected just due to heat, undernutrition, malaria, and diarrheal disease, with more than half of this excess mortality projected for Africa (compared to a 1961-1991 baseline)./Unlike a pandemic like Covid-19 when there is a sudden spike in deaths and infections, the massive health impact of the climate crisis is unfolding gradually. But there is hardly any documentation of these impacts in the health sector. Experts in India, for example, have been asking for daily all-cause mortality numbers to be released so that spikes in deaths during extremely high-temperature days can be tracked./There is also little to no discussion on how can poor and marginalised communities can be protected from extreme heat and water scarcity in cities and villages. The response time to the crisis is closing very soon./IPCC has also flagged that the adaptation capacities of humans are not equitable./Global hotspots of high human vulnerability are found particularly in West, Central and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, Small Island Developing States and the Arctic, IPCC has underlined again with ""high confidence""./""Vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and within regions, driven by patterns of intersecting socio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, marginalization, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance. Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change,"" the report has said./The IPCC is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations responsible for advancing knowledge on the human-induced climate crisis. The report in question has been drafted by 270 scientists from 67 countries./According to the Stockholm Environment Institute, the IPCC report preparation starts with governments formally approving the outline and ends with the approval of the Summary for Policy Makers and the acceptance of the rest of the report. Governments own the reports. That intergovernmental ownership is crucial within the context of the global climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The IPCC reports provide a collective foundation for these negotiations, which cannot then be undermined by negotiators challenging the scientific basis on which all countries have agreed./From the climate crisis to air pollution, from questions of the development-environment tradeoffs to India's voice in international negotiations on the environment, HT's Jayashree Nandi brings her deep domain knowledge in a weekly column/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Bihar starts survey to prepare exclusive environment plans for all districts,"India, March 13 -- The Bihar government is in the process of preparing exclusive environment plan for all 38 districts of the state to address the local environmental issues, said Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) member secretary S Chandrashekhar./Aiming to create a National Environment Plan, the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which was formed under the National Green Tribunal Act in 2010 as a specialised judicial body to handle environmental issues in the country, directed all the states and Union Territories in 2020 to create state environment plan based on the district environment plans. These district environment plans have to be submitted to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) which will forward it to NGT and once approved by NGT, the department of forests, environment and climate will form a state environment plan on this basis and make the district plan effective in different areas./Chandrashekhar said BSPCB has engaged an agency to conduct survey in all the districts to prepare the district environment plan and the agency has started the work./""District plan is intended to address the local needs and requirements. Every area has different kind of problem. The plan has to be prepared according to the local needs. This is why we first need to have the facts and figures regarding pollution in different areas of the state and then the strategies for improvement will be prepared. For this work we have engaged an agency,"" Chandrashekhar said./The deadline to submit district environment plan was October 2021, but considering the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, things got delayed,"" he said. As the district plan is to be submitted within 3 months, the agency has started working over it, he said, adding, ""Survey of pollution level in the districts has been started.""/The fact findings and the strategies for improvement will be sent to the CPCB which will forward it to NGT, he said, adding, ""Once approved by NGT, the district environment plan will be made effective.""/The agency, which the State Pollution Control Board has engaged for district plan, has started conducting survey of the kind of pollution in the area, the level of pollution, the sources of pollution and its impacts over life and environment in the area. Besides, the environment plan will also have strategies to stop pollution and to curb and bring down the pollution graph. The plan will also mention the team of officials for monitoring the implementation of district environment plan and their work, responsibilities and accountability will also be clearly mentioned./The district environment plan needs to address issues related to waste management, solid waste management, biomedical waste, construction and demolition waste, hazardous wastes, electronic wastes, plastic waste, water quality management, ambient air quality management, domestic sewage, mining and noise pollution./Rakesh Kumar, a Patna-based environmentalist, said air pollution level has been high in the state. ""Patna and Muzaffarpur were listed in the 20 most polluted cities of the country, reported by the Smart Air Analysis, 2021 which was based on the PM (particulate matter) 2.5 AQI (Air Quality Index) 2021 India Pollution Data./Patna recorded PM2.5 levels 16 times higher than the World Health Organisation (WHO)-recommended limit of 5 microns, he said. Muzaffarpur too had high PM 2.5 pollution level, he added. The environmentalist said air pollution is the leading cause of diseases and deaths in our country and one among the most commonly tracked pollutant is very small fine particles known as PM 2.5 which often enters the lungs and bloodstream and badly affect them, he added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

In works: Sustainable solutions to address Delhi's crucial challenges,"India, March 14 -- A low-cost sensor to monitor air pollution, an advance warning system to predict new infections for better pandemic preparedness, improving the efficiency of mass transport systems and a dashboard for pedestrian safety - these are some of the technology-driven solutions being developed under a central government initiative for the sustainable development of Delhi and the National Capital Region./The projects are being carried out by the science and technology cluster, City Knowledge Innovation Cluster-Delhi Research Implementation and Innovation (CKIC-DRIIV), set up by the office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the central government last July. DRIIV is one of the six science and technology clusters in the country./The initiative is led by experts from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT Delhi)./""The idea is to address key issues faced in the region related to environment, mobility, health, education, and others by providing innovative solutions and bringing them from the laboratory to the market,"" said Shipra Misra, chief executive officer and managing director of CKIC-DRIIV./The science and technology cluster brings together industry-academia-government bodies on a single platform for collaboration. It's modelled on similar clusters in the western countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, and others. In western countries, these clusters have brought about a change within the country and contributed to the development of the regions where they are located, said Misra./""The main task is to develop an ecosystem around science and technology where various players can come together and contribute in bringing innovation from the laboratory to the market. A lot of research work is being carried out by various organisations. We don't want to leave research on paper, directionless, but actually drive it along what is needed as per the national mission requirements and attract private funding for its implementation,"" said Misra./To this end, IIT Delhi has collaborated with a large number of organisations and academic institutions that are working on six key areas: air pollution, solid waste management, water security, use of artificial Intelligence or machine Learning in healthcare, sustainable mobility, and effective education./Amrita Dawn, technology liaison head of CKIC-DRIIV, said, ""Over 40 academic institutions, government organisations, PSUs, private sector firms, and others from across north India have collaborated to address the challenges related to environment, socio-economic issues and sustainable development. Different organisations are developing solutions which will be implemented in Delhi-NCR and later scaled to the national level.""/Though the cluster started work in July 2021, it already has a few projects in the implementation stages./Finding solution to city's air pollution crisis/One of the key areas of work is to find solutions to the air pollution problem in the Delhi-NCR region and meet the target of the National Clean Area Programme (NCAP) of a 20-30% reduction in particulate matter (PM) levels in five years./Regularly monitoring air pollution levels is essential for this, said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at IIT Delhi's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences. He leads DRIIV's air pollution./Some of the key projects include hotspot management, developing low-cost sensors to monitor air pollution on a hyper-local level, as well as identifying villages and districts where controlling stubble burning will have the maximum impact on Delhi's air quality, among others./For pollution hotspot management, the team has collected pollution data at the neighbourhood or municipal levels./""We have data for a 100mx100m area. This gives us a better understanding of the pollution problem. For instance, as per our data, Shahdara, Connaught Place areas, among others have high pollution levels. We are now working on a strategy to manage hotspots,"" said Dey./IIT Delhi is working with a start-up to develop low-cost sensors./Delhi has 40 ground-based monitoring systems. But setting up a station and its maintenance is capital intensive, since each unit costs around Rs.1-3 crore./""Monitoring pollution levels is essential to find solutions to the problem. Despite having 40 monitoring stations, there is gap in pollution data collected from north, northwest, southwest areas of Delhi. The city's satellite towns - that are equally or more polluted - have just one monitoring station each. We are now developing low-cost sensors so that it can be deployed at a hyper local level,"" said Dey./The team has started a project to study the impact of use of mechanical sweeping machines in controlling dust pollution, as there are no studies available to show this. This study is important as a lot of civic agencies are hiring or buying mechanical sweeping machines for cleaning arterial roads./The cluster's long-term goal is to develop sustainable emission scenarios for the future to address air pollution and climate change simultaneously./Other important projects/Another major focus areas where work has started are solid waste management and use of artificial intelligence or machine learning in healthcare./To address the issue of stubble burning, Misra said, a team of experts is working on converting biomass to fuel, particularly hydrogen. The aim is to produce commercially viable hydrogen fuel cells in line with the national mission on building a 'hydrogen economy'./On the healthcare front, work is on to develop a system that can provide information about new bacterial or viral strains in advance to policymakers to control and manage the spread of infectious diseases. ""It started with Covid-19, which is not going to be the last of the pandemics. The next threat is already looming -antimicrobial resistance to bacteria. So, we have developed a system that can give us advance warning and allow enough time for policymakers to take measures. The team has already built the platform for strainflow database which provides two months advance notice to policy makers,""/In water security, the team is working on using low-cost technology to clean natural water bodies. Misra said, ""We are also studying the overall water security of Delhi NCR region for next 20-25 years to assess what is the surface water and ground water availability. It will also suggest how we can recharge those systems and deploy efficient tech to manage the use of water, particularly irrigation that's where 80% water consumption is, to mitigate this problem.""/In sustainable mobility, work is going to use technology to improve the bus transportation system, developing Electric vehicle charging infrastructure, batteries for EV etc. In education, work is going on in collaboration with school and college teachers to connect classroom teaching with real life problems and incorporate the use of the latest technological tools./Misra said most of the projects are long-term and require industry support to have visible impact within a period of three to five years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi world's most polluted capital for fourth year in row,"India, March 22 -- Delhi has been ranked as the most polluted capital city in the world for the fourth consecutive year in an annual air quality report by a Swiss group released on Tuesday./Annual average PM2.5 levels in Delhi increased by almost 15% in 2021 compared to the previous year - from 84.1 micrograms per cubic metre (mcm) to 96.4 mcm, the report said/The IQAir World Air Quality Report 2021 analysed data on PM2.5 levels from 6,475 cities in 117 countries and regions across the world. The level of PM2.5, or particulate matter less than 2.5 microns thick, is a key measure of air pollution because these particles enter the bloodstream and cause lasting health damage./The prescribed annual average limit for PM2.5 in India is 40 mcm, according to ambient air quality standards of the Central Pollution Control Board. The World Health Organization standard for the pollutant is 5 mcm./Dhaka in Bangladesh, N'Djamena in Chad, Dushanbe in Tajikistan and Muscat in Oman followed New Delhi on the list of most polluted national capitals. No country met the WHO standard and of the 6,475 cities, only 3.4% met the WHO limit./Among the most polluted cities, Rajasthan's Bhiwadi fared the worst followed by Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of Delhi./As many as 35 of the 50 topmost polluted cities in the world are in India, the report said. It also showed India's annual average PM 2.5 levels rose to 58.1 mcm in 2021 - ending a three-year trend of declining concentration of the ultra-fine matter in the country's air. In 2020, India's average annual PM2.5 level was 51.9./""India's annual PM2.5 averages have now returned to pre-quarantine concentrations measured in 2019. India is also home to 11 of the 15 most polluted cities in Central and South Asia in 2021, with 48% of India's cities exceeding the 50 micrograms per cubic metre mark, which is over 10 times the WHO guidelines,"" said the report released by IQAir, a Switzerland -based air quality technology company./Delhi also ranked third in the 15 most polluted regional cities in central and southeast Asia -- overall, it was fourth, with Chinese city Hotan recording worse figures. Rajasthan's Bhiwadi topped this list with 106.2 average annual PM 2.5 levels. Besides Delhi, five more cities in the national capital region (NCR) made it to this list./Ghaziabad was ranked two with average annual PM2.5 levels of 102 mcm; Noida ranked sixth with PM2.5 levels of 91.4; Baghpat ranked nine, Greater Noida 12, and Rohtak was number 13./The average annual figures mask what has been an acute air quality crisis that hits much of north India, including Delhi and the National Capital Region cities entirely, during winter. Beginning somewhere around late October, a spell of bad air pushes the PM2.5 concentration to over 300mcm as smoke from farm fires in upwind states descend, choking millions of people in toxic smog.Pre-winter weather conditions of low wind speeds exacerbates the problem by trapping local pollutions along with the farm fire smoke./The report is a wake-up call to governments and corporations because it once again highlights dangerously high levels of polluted air people are breathing across the country, said Avinash Chanchal, campaign manager at Greenpeace India, an advocacy group./""We don't need to invest in science to find the solutions to the air pollution crisis. We already know the solution, which includes promoting renewable energy for transportation and building infrastructure that encourages cycling, public transport usage and walking,"" said Chanchal./The increase in PM2.5 levels in 2021 over 2020 was inevitable since the country was in a lockdown during 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, an advocacy group./""We have seen that both in 2020 and 2021 that the problem has mostly been the winter months, which tips the average several times over the safe limit,"" Roy Chowdhury said. ""Looking at the data, three out of top four most polluted cities are in NCR, which once again highlights the need to have a regional action plan to curb pollution.""/Globally, only 3% of the cities and no country met the latest WHO standard for PM2.5./""It is a shocking fact that no major city or country is providing safe and healthy air to their citizens according to the latest World Health Organization air quality guidelines,"" said Frank Hammes, chief executive of IQAir. The report showed how much more work is required to provide clean air around the world, Hammes said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

What's in store for India's coastal cities?,"India, April 1 -- Indonesia is shifting its capital, partly in an attempt to get away from the sea. Jakarta, its current capital city, sits on the island of Java, a narrow strip in an increasingly stormy sea. The island is home to rivers that are flooding more frequently, as monsoon patterns change. Parts of the island are sinking as groundwater reserves are over-used. And Java is ceding land to a rising sea./While it is alarming to see a country make such a move partly as a result of the climate crisis, it is even more concerning to note that many of the issues plaguing Jakarta are those that affect India's coastal cities too./India's 7,500 km of coastline is home to some of the country's largest cities by population and economy. Mumbai, the commercial capital, is an island city built largely on reclaimed land. Surat, a hub of the lucrative diamond and textile trades, is built along a river and is flood-prone. Kochi is being lashed by storms from both coasts. Chennai's water reserves are being depleted even as its population booms. Kolkata, already disaster-prone, is seeing land subside, seas rise, and the buffer offered by the Sunderbans weaken./These five are among the coastal Indian cities at risk of being submerged by 2100, according to the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); two of the report's four parts have been released so far, in August 2021 and February 2022./Other major at-risk cities in India include Ahmedabad, Kandla, Okha and Bhavnagar in Gujarat; Bhubaneswar and Paradip in Odisha; Patna, Lucknow, Khidirpur; Mormugao in Goa, Mangaluru, Visakhapatnam and Tuticorin./In terms of potential economic impact from floods, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata also featured, alongside Guangzhou and Bangkok, on the IPCC's list of 20 coastal cities around the world that stand to lose the most./***/Rising sea levels are part of the reason these cities are at risk. Other key factors are already visible./Warming seas are causing storms to intensify and super-storms to become more frequent. Cyclone Amphan, which hit West Bengal in May 2020, was one of the fiercest to hit the state in 100 years. On the cooler, calmer western coast, Cyclones Ockhi in 2017 and Tauktae in 2021 would once have been considered rare. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology have observed a 52% increase in the number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea over four decades, along with an increase in intensity and duration./Altered monsoon patterns are causing flooding in cities that didn't flood and worsening flooding in cities that did. The same is true of water scarcities. As the rains become more erratic and less predictable, they are dumping more of their volumes in single large events that cannot be absorbed effectively. This depletes groundwater levels, already low on account of human use. Depleting groundwater levels cause land to subside. Meanwhile, as more land is covered with concrete in prime cities, more rainwater runs off into the sea./""As cities grow taller and more concretised, turning into urban heat islands, the climatic behaviour within the city itself becomes erratic, with pockets of intense heat that cannot escape and rainfall that does not move,"" says climate scientist Submal Ghosh, convener of the interdisciplinary programme in climate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay, and one of the lead authors of the IPCC report./For the purposes of this report, the focus is the coastlines. But it must still be said that much of India stands smack in the fallout zone of another major eco-sensitive and vulnerable land mass: the Himalayas. As flash floods strike and glaciers recede, the impact of the climate crisis on the Himalayas is so significant, for India and globally, that the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan mountain system is being referred to as the third pole./Back to the coasts, what does the action plan look like? See what's unfolding on the ground in five key cities././MUMBAI: A coast-benefit analysis/Old maps of Mumbai are collectors' items because of how the shape of the city has changed, as it was claimed, colonised, reclaimed and built up over about 250 years. A clump of seven marshy islands has turned into one of the world's most densely populated megalopolises, the city and suburbs alone home to an estimated 12.4 million people./Today's maps could soon be collectors' items too. The sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that large parts of the city could vanish under the sea by 2100, as sea levels rise. In 30 years, about 70% of south Mumbai could be underwater, the city's municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said last August, while announcing that the city was beginning work on a Mumbai Climate Action Plan./This is a megalopolis that juts into the sea, is built in large parts on reclaimed land, and has a coastline under constant attack from construction (it has some of the world's most highly priced real-estate), and from infrastructure projects such as the coastal road, which the IPCC report terms ""maladaptive""./Now, as storms intensify on the western coast and cyclones begin to form in the Arabian Sea, this will have a cascading effect. In June 2020, Mumbai was hit by Nisarga, its first cyclone in over 70 years. In May 2021, Cyclone Tauktae became the first extremely severe cyclonic storm to affect Mumbai in 130 years./""Mumbai is in a unique location, where huge moisture surges generated from the very warm western Indian Ocean enter the landmass, and move towards central India, causing extreme rainfall along the way,"" says climate scientist Subimal Ghosh, convener of the interdisciplinary programme in climate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay, and one of the lead authors of the IPCC report. ""It acts as sort of a gateway for these events.""/In terms of mitigation efforts, the municipal corporation last month launched the Mumbai Climate Action Plan, a 30-year strategy aimed at readying the city for the coming crises./It identifies priority areas such as air pollution, urban greening, water resource management and sustainable mobility, with the aim of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The plan includes building flood resistant infrastructure, increasing solar power capacity, and improving the century-old stormwater drains that flood even in a normal monsoon./""The plan ticks all the boxes, but it's not clear how it is all going to be carried out on the ground,"" says Anjal Prakash, research director at the Bharti Institute of Public Policy of the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, and one of the lead authors of the recent IPCC report. ""Coordination, implementation and accountability are where the major issues are. I would say there has to be a special purpose vehicle that reports directly to the chief minister's office, with the power to implement even at the ward level, with transparency. The role of civil society in monitoring and evaluating the programmes must also be accommodated.""/Without such a special vehicle or some extraordinarily new approach, the Mumbai Climate Action Plan risks ending up like the ambitious Brimstowad (Brihanmumbai Stormwater Disposal System), a project that dates back to 1985, got a boost after the deluge of 2005, but remains mired in litigation and delays nearly 40 years on./- Natasha Rego/./KOLKATA: Heat, drought, storms, cyclones. Could a bio-shield be the answer?/Cyclone Amphan, which hit West Bengal in May 2020, was the first super-cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, and one of the fiercest to hit the state in 100 years. Exactly a year on, Cyclone Yaas hit./West Bengal has always had more than its share of hydro-meteorological disasters - floods and cyclones, downpours and lightning strikes. It has the highest death toll from such events of any state in India, according to 2021 data from the Union ministry of earth sciences, with an estimated 964 deaths between April 2018 and March 2021./Kolkata, the state's capital, sits at sea level, along the Hooghly river, 125 km from the coast. It has been listed as one of the seven megacities in Asia most vulnerable to disaster-related mortality. It is now at risk from fiercer storms , more intense heat waves, flooding, drought, outbreaks of vector-borne diseases, distress migrations into the city, and a further dipping of land levels as groundwater levels plummet./For centuries, the city and the state were protected by the Sunderbans, the world's largest mangrove delta. But the Sunderbans has been losing its very dense mangrove cover, as a result of intensifying storms and rising salinity./In one sweep, 1,600 sq km of mangrove forest were damaged by Cyclone Amphan. ""Amphan has definitely taken a toll on the Sunderbans,"" says Debal Roy, chief wildlife warden for West Bengal./While an IPCC report from 2019 states that sea level is rising by 3.6 mm every year, the Sunderbans delta is subsiding by 2.9 mm every year. ""These two figures put together show that water is gobbling up land at the rate of 6.5 mm per year,"" says Kalyan Rudra, river expert and chairperson of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board./Intensifying heat waves are set to raise the risk of drought. ""With rising temperatures, cases of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are also expected to rise,"" says Tuhin Ghosh, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University. Storms, drought and land loss will force climate migrants to move to cities such as Kolkata, which will further stretch their resources./Is Kolkata prepared to handle the crises? Human activity continues to eat away at carbon sinks and natural aquifers. ""Unbridled development has obstructed the natural drainage system into the East Kolkata Wetlands, which act like the kidneys of the city. As groundwater levels across the city plunge, this may result in gradual subsidence of land,"" Ghosh says. Even the city's drainage systems haven't been updated; its stormwater drains, like Mumbai's, date back a century, to colonial times./The state's forest department is now working to create a ""bio-shield"", a sort of sea wall made up of various plant species that can absorb the impact of storms and protect coastal areas, including the Sunderbans./""There has to be a combination of strengthening green and blue infrastructure. While green infrastructure includes more focus on urban greening and biodiversity protection for different climate anomalies, blue infrastructure refers to protecting and enriching waterbodies, cascading lake systems, streams and rivers across the city,"" says Anjal Prakash, a climate scientist and co-author of the recent IPCC report. ""It is important going forward for Kolkata and other cities in West Bengal to focus on resilience plans.""/- Joydeep Thakur/./SURAT: Booming population, record floods/Surat sits a mere 13 m above sea level, with the Tapi river, and a network of creeks flowing through it. This makes it vulnerable to flooding. Now, the effects of the climate crisis are being felt too./In 2006, a deluge combined with high tides to inundate 80% of Surat for four days. It was the third major flood in 12 years, in a city that saw 20 notable floods in the century preceding. ""With every 1 degree rise in temperature, we should expect a 7% intensification of extremes,"" says Udit Bhatia, a climate scientist working on critical infrastructure resilience at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar./As the city works to build a resilience plan, it doesn't help that Surat's population is booming. The city, a hub of the lucrative diamond and textile trades, has one of the fastest-growing populations of any city in India. It jumped from 2.4 million to 4.4 million between 2001 and 2011, according to census figures - a rise of over 50% at a time when the national average was 17%. The population is currently 6.9 million and is expected to grow at a rate of 9% until 2035, according to a 2018 report by Oxford Economics, making it the fastest growing city in the world./What does the resilience plan look like? In 2008, Surat was one of 10 Asian cities (two others from India were Gorakhpur and Indore) selected to join the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, a joint effort to develop resilience strategies for the years ahead. Under it, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) set up the Surat Climate Change Trust, with climate experts and researchers on board to help analyse patterns and predictions, strategise and help formulate mitigation plans, especially for flooding./""One of the finest projects that we worked on was establishing an early flood warning system, with the help of IIT-Delhi, in 2013,"" says Kamlesh Yagnik, a founder trustee of the Surat Climate Change Trust and chief resilience officer with the SMC. ""The integrated system gives us forecasting results from the IMD, lets us know how much rain is going to fall where, and how much is essentially going to have to be released from the dam. It lets us know which areas of the city will be inundated. Of course, it requires continuous fine-tuning, because every year newer real estate developments take place.""/The city has other projects in the works too. One is a proposed 68-hectare biodiversity park, an urban forest that would act as a lung of the city. The other is a proposed water plaza, an idea borrowed from the Netherlands. ""It is essentially a multipurpose, transit storage space within the city, with provisions to store water when there is heavy inflow, until it can be pumped out later,"" says Yagnik. ""At other times, the same space can be used for community engagement, sports, and it can act as a park also.""/If maintained and sustained right, these initiatives could certainly add to the local mitigation efforts, especially in reducing urban heat island effect, says Bhatia./Meanwhile, construction continues along the banks of the Tapi. A report filed by retired justice BC Patel, former chief justice of the Delhi high court, before the National Green Tribunal, reads: ""The law pertaining to Land Acquisition has not been followed, the land was not acquired and the land appears to have been allowed to develop.""/- Natasha Rego/./KOCHI: In the path of more storms/Cyclone Ockhi hit Kochi, with devastating effect, in 2017. At least 300 people were killed; hundreds are still missing. In 2021, Cyclone Tauktae travelled parallel to the western coast of India, before making landfall in Gujarat. It caused heavy rainfall in Kerala in May, and delayed the onset of the monsoon. That same year, Cyclone Yaas, which originated in the Bay of Bengal, added to the havoc, and the impact on the monsoon./Cyclones used to be an unusual phenomenon on the west coast, because of the historically cool waters of the Arabian Sea. In recent decades, that's changed. ""Temperatures in the Arabian Sea have been rising gradually since the early 1900s, with an accelerated increase since the 1980s,"" says Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Centre for Climate Change Research at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune./Researchers at IITM have observed a 52% increase in the number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea over the past four decades, along with an increase in intensity and duration. ""As we saw with Tauktae, cyclones now spend a long time in the sea, building up a lot of moisture, increasing the chances of destruction along the coast,"" Koll says./Kochi's position between the Lakshadweep archipelago and Sri Lanka, in the tapering southern end of peninsular India, makes it susceptible to cyclones formed in the Bay of Bengal too./Kochi's vulnerabilities are compounded by its location between a sea whose levels are rising and the ravaged hills of the Western Ghats, which send monsoon runoff rushing into the city. ""We are seeing that total rainfall during the monsoon period is actually decreasing,"" says Koll, who contributed to the recent IPCC report. ""We're having long dry periods, with intermittent heavy-rain events. When the rain does come, it can bring a month's worth of rainfall in a few days.""/What is the mitigation plan? The short answer is that there isn't one. At a virtual conference organised last year by the World Resources Institute - the non-profit global research institute that also helped formulate the Mumbai Climate Action Plan - experts and stakeholders from the state discussed the need for a robust action plan to integrate disaster management, nature-based solutions and the involvement of local communities./The most noteworthy project currently on the table is a two-year-old one that seeks to upgrade some of the city's 18 canals, to prevent flooding and promote water transportation./""Restoring these canals is also an important step in tackling water logging, as the drainage system is not capable of accommodating such huge quantities of precipitation appearing these days,"" says Sunny George, director of the SCMS Water Institute, an educational institute that provided technical support to the Kochi Municipal Corporation in formulating the city's 2015 water policy./- Natasha Rego/./CHENNAI: Nascent struggle to stem the flow/As sea levels rise, climatologists watching Chennai are expecting to see flooding, drought and water shortages./This is a city whose population is growing so fast that estimates have shot up from 4.6 million in the 2011 census to 10.7 million according to Statista, as of 2019. Meanwhile, rampant urbanisation and poor urban planning have seen the total area occupied by water bodies shrink from nearly 12.6 sq km in 1893 to about 3.2 sq km in 2017, according to a 2019 study by the department of geology at Chennai's Anna University./In June 2019, after three consecutive deficient monsoons, the city's four main reservoirs ran dry. Amid uneven rainfall and the shrinking and pollution of water bodies and aquifers, Chennai now leans heavily on desalination plants and groundwater./Meanwhile, flooding is intensifying. In December 2015, a downpour of 494 mm - the heaviest one-day rainfall in Chennai since 1901 - wreaked havoc in the city. November 2021 went down as the third-wettest November in the city's recorded history./""Population growth, drastic changes in land-use patterns, loss of green cover, and inundation due to sea-level rise all make the city exceedingly vulnerable to climate change,"" says Palanivelu Kandasamy, professor of environmental sciences at the Centre for Environmental Studies at Anna University. ""Climate change action must shift from mitigation to adaptive strategies, and the state must accelerate the pace of the efforts."" Coastal embankments must be constructed where necessary, Kandasamy adds. Instead, marshlands and wetlands are being filled in for construction./The Pallikaranai marshland, the only urban wetland in Chennai city and one that acted as a sponge in times of flooding, has shrunk by about 90% over less than half a century. A dumping ground as well as developments on and around the wetland have reduced its area from about 5,500 hectares in 1965 to about 600 hectares in 2013, according to a 2019 report by an amicus curiae, senior counsel P S Raman, appointed by the Madras High Court./Last year, the court directed the state government to declare Pallikaranai a protected Ramsar wetland; the proposal is awaiting a nod from the centre./For now, the biggest immediate concerns are the increasingly intense storm surges on the cyclone-prone eastern coast, says SA Sannasiraj, professor of ocean engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras. ""The frequency of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal is growing. In 2020, there were four major cyclones affecting India - Amphan, Nisarga, Nivar and Burevi,"" Sannasiraj says./In terms of adaptation and mitigation strategies, last August the Tamil Nadu government began formulating a Climate Change Mission aimed at focusing on sustainable agriculture, water resources, forest and biodiversity, strategic knowledge, enhanced energy efficiency and solar power. The plan is to ""carry out 199 projects in these sectors"" by 2030./- Vanessa Viegas/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"To develop equitably, address five priorities","India, April 6 -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the inequitable and unsustainable systems in which people in the South-East Asia Region and across the world live and work, consume and exist. Globally, over 90% of people breathe unhealthy air, resulting in around seven million deaths every year, including 2.4 million in the region. Food systems that are unsafe, unhealthy and unsustainable cause millions of premature deaths annually, primarily from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and are a leading contributor to climate change and antimicrobial resistance - two of the greatest health risks facing humanity./In 2020, around one in four people globally lacked safely managed drinking water in their homes, and just 50% of health care facilities in least-developed countries provided basic water services. Poor quality drinking water can lead to acute waterborne disease and risks exposure to toxic chemicals such as arsenic. Inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in health care facilities makes health care less effective and has a disproportionate impact on women and girls. In total, World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 13 million deaths each year are due to avoidable environmental causes - a figure that we cannot and must not accept./We have before us a once-in-a-century opportunity to drive transformative, lasting change. While the Covid-19 crisis has highlighted the inequitable and unsustainable nature of existing political, social and commercial decisions, it has shown that if decision-making is transparent, evidence-based and inclusive, people will support bold and far-reaching policies that protect their health, families and livelihoods. It has shown that by prioritising equitable health now and for future generations - including through long-term investments, well-being budgets, social protection, legal and fiscal strategies - we can build ""well-being societies"" that facilitate human flourishing, and fulfil every person's right to health and development, without breaching ecological limits./To achieve a region and world in which clean air, water and food are available to all, where economies promote physical and mental health and well-being, where cities are liveable, and where people have control over their own health and that of the planet, we must address five priorities./First, protect and preserve the source of human health: Nature. Policies that reduce deforestation, promote afforestation, and end intensive and polluting agricultural practices can improve air quality, strengthen food systems, and promote sustainable farming and forest management. They reduce the risk of emerging infectious diseases, over 60% of which originate from animals./Second, invest in essential services, from water and sanitation to clean energy in health care facilities. Countries must continue to protect drinking water supplies by implementing multi-sectoral water safety plans and including WASH in relevant health policies, strategies and programmes, with a focus on increasing access at the primary health care level. In line with the region's 2017 Male Declaration, countries must continue to build climate-resilient health facilities that not only respond to and withstand environmental health threats, but also promote environmentally sustainable practices./Third, ensure a quick and healthy energy transition. Globally, two-thirds of exposure to outdoor air pollution results from the burning of the same fossil fuels that are driving climate change, which between 2030 and 2050 is expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths annually. While countries in the region have made commendable efforts to expand renewable energy sources, increased action is needed, and must be accompanied by rigorous enforcement of air quality standards, as well as increased investments in public transportation infrastructure./Fourth, promote healthy and sustainable food systems. Diseases caused by a lack of access to food, or consumption of unhealthy, high calorie diets, are a major contributor to NCDs, which in our region kill around 9.2 million people annually. In all countries of the region, WHO will continue to support countries to identify and implement high-impact and cost-effective ""best buys"" that transform the food environment, from food reformulation and labelling, to increased taxation of unhealthy foods and beverages, and strengthened restrictions on marketing, especially to children./Fifth, build healthy, liveable cities. In 2021, five cities in the region were selected to participate in the WHO Urban Governance for Health and Well-Being initiative, which aims to strengthen country capacities to promote health and address health inequities. To take just two examples, policymakers can expand cycleways and increase the provision of green and healthy spaces to reduce greenhouse emissions and road traffic injuries, increase physical activity, and promote mental health./We are at a pivotal moment. The decisions we make now can either ""lock in"" development patterns that do permanent and escalating damage to the ecological systems, or they can promote a healthier, fairer, and greener world. Together, we must raise our voice and act now to protect our planet, health, and future./Poonam Khetrapal Singh is regional director, WHO Southeast Asia/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The site sees daily dumping of garbage from the civic body. Most of this garbage is mixed waste./A waste-to-energy facility is supposed to come up at the site./Fire brigade officials said that given the inflammable nature of the dumped garbage, it is common for such huge conflagrations to take place during summer season./Numerous plumes of smoke billowed into the sky as the fire took on an intense form. The area residents have been complaining about an increase in air pollution and claimed that the waste depot is constantly on fire due to the indifferent role of the municipal administration./The locals further doubted the reason behind the fire and said did the fire was it ignited deliberately. Akhil Maratha Mahasangh president Uday Patil said, ""The frequency of such incidents at the garbage depot has increased. Instead of using the scientific method for disposing of the accumulated garbage in the city, the garbage is being set on fire so that it automatically destroys the garbage.""/""PCMC is playing with the health of citizens and should take strict action against those responsible behind the incident otherwise a mass agitation will be started against this, "" Patil warned./PCMC fire chief Kiran Gawade said, ""The fire took place due to extreme heat weather conditions and has been brought under control.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Over 60% of Delhi's 5.5k traffic cops suffer from hypertension',"India, April 7 -- Nearly 60% of the 5,500 traffic police personnel in Delhi suffer from hypertension, 20% have diabetes and 10% have hearing problems, according to their medical check-up reports conducted by the Delhi Police in February this year./Senior officers privy to the details of the check up said direct exposure to air and noise pollution, job stress and irregular sleep were some of the reasons cited for these medical conditions./""Even if you fix the normal blood pressure levels to 140/90 (a normal healthy adult person has a blood pressure of 120/80), nearly 2,000 of them would be hypertensive,"" a senior officer privy to the check up details said./He added that in a separate in January this year, it was revealed that over 30% of the traffic police officers in Delhi have signs of asthma, lung congestion, throat irritation, while low bone density and joint aches were also found common among them./A former officer who held a top post in Delhi Traffic Police concurred with the findings of the check up, and said that by the time they are about to retire most traffic police officials fall prey to hypertension, diabetes and other lifestyle diseases. ""Earlier, there was no proper roster for them, due to which they had to work 12-15 hours at a go. The demanding schedule and the high air pollution levels in Delhi also play a major role in aggravating the situation. However, in the last eight months, things have improved very much as the present commissioner of police has introduced the e-Chittha portal, to ensure optimal use of manpower resources. It has not only increased the efficiency and transparency in working among all in traffic police, but has ensured that the staff has sufficient time to spend with their family and take care of their health and well being,"" she said asking not to be named./Many traffic personnel whom HT spoke said fear for their safety while being deployed on road intersections was one of the major causes of stress./Rajesh Kumar, a traffic constable posted in Najafgarh area, said on the highways, the trucks are a menace. ""We have to be careful specially during the night. Flagging down a truck, which move at high speed during the night, is always a tough proposition,"" he said./According to police data, of the nearly 1500 people who have died in hit-and-run accident on city roads since January 2020, 53 were traffic police personnel./Dinesh Kumar, a head constable from Outer Delhi, said, ""Even asking a commuter to slow down or produce vehicle documents often lead to an argument. Sometimes the passengers even threaten or hit us.""/Virender Singh Chahal, special commissioner of police (traffic), agreed that hypertension and other lifestyle diseases are common among the police personnel. ""Working with noisy traffic and high levels of pollution around them, the traffic police personnel have a higher chance of developing hypertension, breathing problems and lifestyle diseases such as diabetes. To reduce the risk, we regular conduct their health check-ups and their deployment is done on the basis of their health reports. People get irritated when a traffic personnel asks them to produce their documents or flags them for a violation. We will soon launch a 'patience enhancement' programme for the commuters, so that they should feel relaxed at the traffic signals and co-operate with the police,"" he said./Asked if those with acute health problems would be considered to be posted out of traffic unit, Chahal said he would not rule out such a possibility ""in exceptional cases"". ""If someone's health is such that he or she is physically unable to continue, we will certainly consider a transfer,"" he said./Dr AK Gadpayle, medical superintendent of Sharda Medical College in Greater Noida, said traffic cops face severe mental stress due to the nature of their jobs. ""Their jobs are always on the stick. Hypertension is most common among them due to irregular working hours, interaction with all sorts of people who often argue with them, and then the fear of accidents while being deployed in heavy traffic. All of this affects their mental well being, and causes hypertension and lifestyle diseases such as diabetes,"" said Gadpayle who has also served as the director general of health services, government of India./SPK Jena, professor of applied psychology in University of Delhi, said apart from job stress and pollution, the personnel deployed in traffic police develop an inferiority complex by comparing themselves with the regular police officers, thinking they represent the 'less competent lot' of police force. ""Lot of studies have indicated that the traffic policemen, who are forced to stay out throughout the day, fall prey to several diseases, at least twice at the rate of others in professional jobs. It is a common belief that officials deployed in traffic police have lower competence levels than their counterparts in law and order and supervision duties in the police station.

MahaGenco serves defamation notice to researchers of Chandrapur pollution study,"India, April 12 -- The Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (MahaGenco) has served a defamation notice to the Delhi-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) over a research report published by the latter in February. The report stated that pollution from Chandrapur's Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) impacted public health, including causing premature deaths not just in Chandrapur and Nagpur, but also in cities such as Mumbai and Pune, which are at a considerable distance./Dubbing the study ""mischievous"", ""baseless"", ""false"", ""misleading"" and ""unscientific"", MahaGenco through its advocate imposed damages to the tune of Rs.10 crore on CREA, with added liabilities of Rs.1 crore per day after March 20, in case the report is not withdrawn. A copy of the notice, dated March 12, has been reviewed by Hindustan Times./Nandikesh Sivalingam, director, CREA, confirmed the development but refused to comment. ""We would not like to say anything beyond what is contained in our response to MAHAGENCO,"" he said./Sanjay Khandare, chairman and managing director of MahaGenco, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday./""The complete data mentioned in your report regarding premature deaths right from Chandrapur to Pune and Mumbai is not only incorrect, false but the same is mischievous and baseless. You are also called upon to give the details regarding the research made by CREA regarding the overall issues about the air pollution in Chandrapur city,"" MahaGenco said./Responding to the notice on April 4, CREA said, ""The report is primarily based on the data of emissions and plant parameters obtained by my client from government, public sources, Court/ National Green Tribunal's Orders and Committees appointed by it.""/Highlighting that the study relies on a ""globally used scientific methodology to estimate the long-range transport of pollutants emitted from tall stacks"", CREA also said that MahaGenco's contention shows a ""lack of understanding of the basic science of air pollution emissions, dispersion and chemical transformation.""/CREA's report titled 'Health impacts of Chandrapur coal-based power plant, Maharashtra' - had found that areas impacted due to pollutants from CSTPS include Mumbai, Palghar and Goa in addition to several districts in Gujarat, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Chattisgarh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh./Using dispersion modelling methods to simulate the movement of emission plumes away from the site, which was analysed along with data on meteorology, population exposure, and baseline mortality data from the Global Burden of Disease project, researchers were able to attribute 62 premature deaths (for the calendar year 2020) in Chandrapur district alone to pollutants which have travelled from the CSTPS site. Similarly, 45 premature deaths in 2020 were attributed to CSTPS pollutants in Yavatmal, 30 in Mumbai, and 29 in Pune and Nanded, making these the worst affected cities in terms of attributable deaths./""Air pollution impact from the CSTPS were observed over hundreds of kilometres impacting cities like Nanded, Pune and Mumbai among other cities.

The high cost of Himalayan ruin,"India, April 14 -- The Union environment ministry plans to exempt highway projects critical to the country's defence or that are of strategic importance near the nation's borders, from the requirement of prior environment clearance, this newspaper reported on Thursday. Instead, the draft notification, on April 11, prescribed environmental safeguards for self-compliance by developers. This pro-infrastructure stand is not unanticipated: In 2021, the Centre used the same defence-strategic requirement argument in the Supreme Court (SC) in the Char Dham Pariyojana (CDP) case. This argument was accepted by the SC. Environmentalists and geologists opposed the government's stand because India's northern borders fall in the highly eco-sensitive Himalayan region./The Himalayan landscape is not just strategically crucial to India, but also has a huge role to play in ecological, economic, and cultural development. Its role has become even more critical in the era of the climate crisis. The region has faced challenges due to excessive focus on commercial forestry, cascading hydropower projects, mining, and unbridled tourism. These have led to deforestation, biodiversity loss, toxic waste accumulation, air pollution, and degradation of water sources. The impacts are evident: The once-pristine hills stations of the Himalayan region - Shimla, Darjeeling, and Shillong - now look like unplanned metropolises; every monsoon leads to floods and landslides; and getting a clear view of the Himalayan range is often a challenge because of the haze. The Himalayas also play a role in regulating the monsoons, and is home to some of the major rivers - essential for water security. The region is also a seismic zone./The massive road-building projects in the pipeline will only devastate an already ravaged landscape. It is futile to hope that developers will follow the self-compliance guidelines in the absence of strong governance and oversight mechanisms. While the nation's security is paramount, it also critical to keep in mind what the SC-mandated panel on CDP said in its report: ""Today, worldwide, it is becoming clearer by the minute that any development devoid of honest and uncompromising ecological concerns will prove short-sighted; and inevitably in the long run bring devastation and disaster on our heads."" The government should remember that the costs of the large-scale and long-term devastation, which extensive road-building will unleash, may be too high to bear./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Chandigarh: Health problems common in every house in vicinity of Dadumajra landfill,"CHANDIGARH, April 15 -- For the past 12 years, 42-year-old Vinod Kumar, a resident of Dadumajra Colony (DMC), has been suffering from skin allergy and fungal infection. With even medical treatment not helping his condition, medical experts have recommended that he shifts his residence from the most polluted area of City Beautiful/""The infection is so severe that doctors have asked me to leave this area. Flies and mosquitoes are rampant here and that is a major cause of my skin problem. Due to allergy, I am unable to wear warm clothes even in winters. What's worse is that even my teenage sons are facing this same problem,"" said Kumar, a government employee./However, this is not the only such incident in the area. In almost every house located in the vicinity of the Dadumajra landfill, people are suffering from health hazards including allergies, asthma, skin ailments, tuberculosis (TB), cancer, paralysis and other chronic diseases. Five cancer patients have died in DMC in just two years./Spread across 45.11 acres, the landfill is located right in the middle of the residential area, with people of Dadumajra, Sector 38 (West), Sector 25 and Dhanas Colony, being most exposed. Last week, it took more than two days to put out a fire at the dumping ground and many people in these areas complained of breathing problems. The dumping ground witnessed, on an average, 30 fires per year between 2005 and 2021.

Startup mantra: Retrofit solutions to beat vehicle emissions,"India, April 16 -- Amidst all the hype around electric vehicles (EV) and hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles, three entrepreneurs - Irfan Pathan, Rizwan Shaikh and Shantanu Sonaikar - through their clean-tech startup Pi Green Innovations have developed a retrofit solution for existing conventionally-fuelled heavy vehicles, diesel fuelled generator sets and industrial boilers in order to reduce and capture hazardous particulate matter (PM) emissions and pollution caused every day. The founders claim that their retrofit device can capture 90 per cent of the particulate matter emitted from the genset in real-time ranging from PM2.5 to PM10./In the beginning./The inventor or brain behind the CarbonCutter Rizwan Shaikh hails from Bhusawal, a small town located 400 kilometre from Pune city, in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra. Irfan is from Kolhapur who did his MBA from MIT, Pune and Shantanu is a chartered accountant and investment banker turned entrepreneur./Irfan was running his ready-to-drink cold coffee business when he met Rizwan at a forum. Rizwan showed a video of a wooden TV box sized box attached to his scooter and how it captured pollution. Realising the business potential in this idea, Irfan asked Rizwan to commercialise it./Irfan said, ""Rizwan is very passionate about his tech-work. When I asked him about the funding needed to make a prototype and commercialise the invention, he had no idea of the money we would require. So, we chalked out a business plan and decided that I would invest Rs.17 lakh initially. We started our journey with a retrofit device for heavy vehicles and in the first three years my investment went up to Rs.1.5 crore.""/Rizwan had a small business of air-conditioner repairs at Bhusawal. He said, ""I developed this technology after watching the air pollution levels in Delhi. We can't say there are no solutions to these problems. There are filter-based solutions, water scrubbing mechanisms, solvent-based solutions available in the market, however, the major problem in them is of sustainability. I made a device, much smaller in size, and which doesn't require a filter, or water or any solvent.""/Backyard invention/Explaining the technology used for the device, Rizwan said, ""The device works on the principle of electro static precipitator (ESP). ESP has been in the market since 1920. The smoke particles are charged with negative or positive ions by amplifying the current to 1 lakh or 2 lakh volts because of which the particles get attracted to the plates of ESP. Conventionally, water or hammering is used to clean the ESP plates, which also is time consuming resulting in more downtime at industrial sites. The filter gets clogged and has to be replaced frequently.""/""So, the question before me was how to optimise the working of ESP. Intention was to have a technology which needs very basic maintenance, which is very low on operational expenses and can give sustained results in reduction of emissions for a longer period of time. I was looking to make it efficient without having any periodic maintenance.""/""We have introduced the self-cleaning mechanism due to which we are able to reduce the size of the ESP from a three-storeyed building to a 10-feet product. Since it can be cleaned every 10 hours, we need less surface charge. This self-cleaning technology, developed in the backyard of my house in Bhusawal, is a proprietary technology of Pi Green Innovations and the entire patent is on this mechanism,"" claims Rizwan./Proof of concept/Shantanu, who is the director, strategy and finance, at the startup, met Irfan for his coffee business consultation. Shantanu did a small fundraise from a set of HNIs in Pune for Irfan. When he got to know about Rizwan's product, he was intrigued to get into this new business./Shantanu said, ""Rizwan did not have access to funds nor to heavy vehicles for his trials. He was doing trials on scooter. Our focus initially was to achieve proof of concept, instead of chasing investors for even the smallest amount of capital. We spent heavily on research and development, filing for patents, getting tests done with relevant agencies and getting some confidence out of the real efficiency that we are trying to achieve.""/Irfan said, ""We failed miserably many times. There was no big team and we personally had to do all heavy lifting. Our machine failed in front of investors too. For two years, 2016 to 2018-end, we were developing prototypes for different products. We were then focussed on heavy vehicles but we could not easily rent trucks for trials. Some small manufacturing companies helped us, but they took huge amount money for trials. Components were also not easily available. Rizwan had to use a part of home-cleaning mop to make the first prototype. He had ordered 350 such mops, just for trials because the plastic stick was of perfect size which we needed. We realised nobody helps startups.""/Resistance/The struggle for the entrepreneur trio did not stop at prototyping. Shantanu said, ""We tasted success with a full prototype when we tested the heavy vehicles device with a reputed certification agency in Pune. We got efficiencies of above 90 per cent. A lot of research and development is still happening with the product and we got a lot of feedback too. We tried meeting OEMs, auto ancillary businesses, but we were stonewalled. Either the technology or design or operations were not accepted. Since we did not have tag of any big educational institution, it was hard selling. Getting entry in the OEMs and telling them that we have found a solution to problem which they are trying to find with a budget of crores of rupees, was difficult.""/Pivot/The business graduated from the idea of having a retrofit for heavy vehicles to trying and addressing the issue of emissions from most of the sources which are huge contributors to particulate matter pollution. Pi Green Innovation team did prototypes and now has products for heavy vehicles, diesel generator sets, crematoriums and jaggery units./Shantanu said, ""The National Green Tribunal, in 2019, mandated to have retrofit for diesel gensets. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) further opened up an avenue for us. We have applied for patents in India, US, China, Japan, Singapore. India, and Japan patent is pending, while we have got approval in other countries. We also started our commercial manufacturing in October 2020 and till date deployed 150 genset retrofits in Tamil Nadu, Delhi NCR, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Goa. In Maharashtra, we have only five installations.""/Certification/Explaining the certification process, Irfan said, ""Earlier there was only a test to be carried out to become eligible to sell the product. In this test, our product was tested for longevity by subjecting it to non-stop 100 hours operation at the certifying agency. Beyond these 100 hours, the agency again conducts a rigorous test for 25 hours. Now it is certification based. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in February 2022, has come out with a policy on what kind of devices can be qualified and certified. We are expecting to get our certification from the Pune-based for genset retrofit device in a month.""/Shantanu said, ""Environment is regulation based and our business is dependent on regulations of government and its enforcement. Carbon cutting device or a PM capture device will not in any way give any kind of return on investment (ROI) to businesses. These are not wind or solar kind of investments where one invests and gets returns. It is an expense, an investment for environment with a regulation. Our business, in a way, depends on enforcement by each state.""/Expansion/After the certification mandate, Pi Green Innovations is looking at a multi-billion-dollar business opportunity just in the Indian market.

They need to curb emission and hence need retrofitting. We have seen diesel gensets as old as 43-year-old still being used. Also, even if the alternate fuel or renewable energy-based machines come, supply chain issues persist across geographies. The idea is to complete the lifecycle of the older machines like genset or boiler.

"Climate and Us | As temperatures rise, schools must make climate action plans","India, April 25 -- To the relief of parents and children, schools have reopened, and children are back to their normal lives of attending in-person classes and playing with schoolmates. The spike in Covid cases, so far, hasn't derailed this. But there is another concern affecting children and parents in several parts of the country: Extreme heat./The other day, I saw children packed to capacity in school vans on their way back home around 2 pm. Some children had their faces pasted to the windows as others stuffed in seemed to gasp for some air and cool. It's a routine sight in Delhi./But it's also very likely that many children are physically and psychologically impacted by extreme heat during their difficult commute. It's impossible to air-condition all schools in heatwave-prone regions. But, at the very least, schools can be built or retrofitted to keep the thermal comfort of children in mind and make their commute easier. Summer vacations will have to be also carefully planned, responding effectively to ongoing weather conditions./Perhaps one of the effective ways to beat the heat at school would be to have adequate foliage, with native trees on the campus and well-ventilated structures to keep school hours bearable for children of all age groups. These interventions could address the psychological stress of attending school during high temperatures. For many children living in unauthorised colonies and shanties, the school is the only escape from heat stress. This is what school authorities must address./The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an extended-range forecast for the two weeks from April 22 to April 28 and April 29 to May 5. The forecast shows above-normal temperatures during both the weeks, particularly between April 29 and May 5 over the entire country except parts of peninsular India./On Thursday, M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences (MoES), tweeted out a warning:/Are governments in heat affected regions considering an early summer vacation schedule factoring in the spike in maximum temperatures next week? More importantly, are schools considering the impact of climate crisis on children and how schools can help manage them? IMD experts have warned that parts of east India, including Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bihar, are likely to be significantly impacted by heat stress over the next two weeks. These are also regions with high humidity levels that can make even a minor increase in temperature difficult to handle./The time has come to consider these impacts because they are already pronounced now. We cannot underestimate the morbidity and mortality burden of heatwaves any more. According to ministry of earth sciences' response in the Rajya Sabha to a question on the number of casualties due to extreme weather events in India, there were 505 deaths in 2019 due to heatwaves out of 3,017 extreme weather casualties that year./In 2016, there were 501 heatwave deaths, 2,081 in 2015, and 1,433 in 2013. According to experts, these numbers are still a gross underestimation of heatwave mortality. In most states, all cause mortality (death from any cause) is not declared by districts, so its difficult to track the spike in deaths during heat extremes. The climate crisis is already increasing vector-borne and water-borne diseases, undernutrition, mental disorders and allergic diseases in Asia by increasing the hazards such as heatwaves, flooding and drought, and air pollution, in combination with higher exposure and vulnerability, according to the IPCC's report titled Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability released in March./In addition to all-cause mortality, deaths related to circulatory, respiratory, diabetic and infectious disease, as well as infant mortality are on the rise in Asia with high temperatures, the report said./Dilip Malvankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gujarat explained to me during my reportage that extreme heat puts an increased load on the circulatory system, which has to do additional work to cool the body by sweating. This can lead to dehydration and increased metabolism. Excess heat can also be linked to an increase in, or exacerbation of, complications of diabetes due to dehydration and increased metabolism. Infant mortality will, therefore, rise because children are not able to control their body temperature well. Their bodies can get overheated during heat waves./While planning for the extreme heat season, governments need to keep another issue in sight, that 1.5 degrees Celsius breach in global warming is now imminent. While the breach of this milestone in itself may not suddenly change our experience of extreme weather events, it does tell us that we need to adapt to the severe impacts of the climate crisis now./The amount of greenhouse gases like CO2 emitted by the world needs to peak by 2025 followed by a 43% reduction over the next 10 years in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IPCC said in its mitigation report released earlier this month. It warned that policies implemented till the end of 2020 will add more emissions and lead to a rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Instead of reducing, emissions between 2010-19 were around 12% and 54% higher than in 2010 and 1990. These findings show the breach in 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming compared to pre-industrial levels is certain./From the climate crisis to air pollution, from questions of the development-environment tradeoffs to India's voice in international negotiations on the environment, HT's Jayashree Nandi brings her deep domain knowledge in a weekly column/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The climate crisis threatens universal health care achievements,"India, April 26 -- The climate crisis-induced disasters are among the most relevant dangers to human survival. Children, in particular, are at the receiving end. Today, an estimated 2.2 billion children worldwide are growing up facing the impacts of the climate crisis, even though they have the right to healthy and nutritious food, good physical, mental and social health, and access to knowledge. The climate crisis directly threatens these basic rights of children./India is the third most disaster-prone country globally, next only to United States (US) and China, with children comprising 40% of its population. Any disasters impact the most vulnerable people and their children disproportionately./The Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), which ranks countries based on children's exposure to climate and environmental shocks such as cyclones and heat waves, and their vulnerability to those shocks based on their access to essential services. Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India are among four South Asian countries where children are at extremely high risk of the impacts of the climate crisis, with a ranking of 14th, 15th, 25th and 26th, respectively. In addition, CCRI has placed India as one of the 33 extremely high-risk countries, with flooding and air pollution being the repeated environmental shocks, leading to adverse socio-economic consequences for women and children./A human rights crisis/The climate crisis is a human rights crisis because the children of this and future generations will not have the basic requirement of life i.e. clean air, safe drinking water, and sufficient food and secure shelter./On a larger degree, the climate crisis is also looming over the achievement of universal health care (UHC) through adverse health outcomes and disruption of the health care system. Although it is already creating a substantial global burden of disease, the current Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to unsafe water, lack of sanitation and hygiene, urban air pollution, indoor smoke from solid fuels, and lead exposure dwarf the present-day effects of climate change on health. The incidence of many infectious diseases shows seasonality, and additional outbreaks frequently accompany extreme weather events. Since meteorological parameters influence vector reproduction, it is obvious to link disease outbreaks with climate change and to assume a correlation between increasing disease incidence and global warming./However, the factors responsible for the emergence/re-emergence of vector-borne diseases are complex and mutually influence each other. Many countries with the highest susceptibility to the climate crisis have the lowest UHC coverage. These regions stand to have colossal gains through an integrated approach. Climate-sensitive illnesses are on the increase due to the extremes of weather impact./Estimating the future burden of climate-related disease impacts on children is complex. The problem will affect the lifecycle of a child from the pre-conception period to his or her adolescence. Furthermore, people experience different inherent sensitivities to the impacts of the climate crisis at different ages and life stages. Hence, climate health strategies for children should be tailored as per their stage of life./Keeping this in mind, India's first National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) was released on June 30, 2008. In addition, a National Expert Group on Climate Change & Health was constituted in July 2015 to prepare an action plan, recommend strategies for adaptation, and capacity building./UHC strategies must work to improve the thoughtfulness of climate crisis, use novel climate-sensitive financial frameworks, and incorporate the mitigation of greenhouse gases. They should strive for evidence-based climate adaptation that protects the health and prioritises health system climate resiliency. Integration of the climate crisis adaptation within global health strategy could mean both better sustainability of the existing programmes as the climate becomes increasingly unpredictable and better inclusion of these climate crisis efforts in the near-term international health programmes by coupling with programmes that already have funding,/Children's environmental health indicators/Frameworks for prevention include the incorporation of climate crisis actions into the 10 essential functions of public health and the WHO's efforts to develop internationally comparable Children's Environmental Health Indicators (CEHIs). CEHIs-subdivided into categories of context, exposures, health outcomes, and actions-have emerged from several international agreements as a proposed tool for tracking the state of children's environmental health. Prevention through adaptation, resilience, and mitigation./Prevention strategies about climate crisis have primarily focused on reducing or mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) levels in the global system. However, the concept of prevention in public health is multi-tiered./To wrap up, there is a specified need to enhance monitoring of current children's environmental health status, better incorporation of climate change adaptation into existing programs, and new climate-sensitive disease prevention programs that have short- and long-term health co-benefits./Vikas Kaushal is head - health, Save the Children (Bal Raksha Bharat)/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Workshop discusses UP Clean Air Management Project,"India, April 27 -- The department of environment, forest and climate change, UP in collaboration with the World Bank, organized a two-day programme to discuss the proposed UP Clean Air Management Project (UP-CAMP) and to chalk out ways to curb the fast-increasing pollution levels in districts./Arun Kumar Saxena, minister of state (independent charge) environment, forest and climate change, UP was the chief guest and KP Malik, minister of state was the guest of honour./""Air pollution is a grave issue which is also causing serious health hazards. It is also observed that treatment of pollution-caused diseases is difficult, hence the focus should be more on prevention than cure. In present times when air pollution is on the rise, government departments and corporate sectors should team up to fight the issue,"" said Arun Kumar Saxena, while addressing the gathering at the programme on day one./Ashish Tiwari, secretary, department of environment, forest & climate change, UP said the state was in the heart of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) which was a global hotspot of air pollution. ""The factors responsible for air pollution also include long-range background pollution from the areas falling in the air shed which is outside the cities and the state,"" said Tiwari. Though the efforts to deal with the pollution had been made through city-level interventions under the City Clean Air Action Plans, they did not address the issues of background pollution, he said./""Realizing the background contribution in the air pollution of cities, the state has been a pioneer in formulation of Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Action Plan (UCAP) on adopting an ""air shed"" approach under technical support of the World Bank. The World Bank has proposed to provide financial assistance to the state for implementation of air shed-based UCAP,"" he added./Officials said this workshop was also part of the development for a 2022 Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Action Plan (UCAP). In the two-day workshop, the key findings and targets would be presented to government agency stakeholders, highlighting their critical role and efforts required to clean up the air for the health and prosperity of the people of UP. The workshop will also discuss sector implementation issues across a series of thematic clusters and how to align existing and supplemental budgets and schemes with the most cost-effective actions to reduce air pollution while identifying budget, policy, investment, capacity, stakeholder and engagement priorities./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

3 landfills have cost Delhi rRs.r450 cr in environmental damages: Study,"India, April 29 -- Delhi's three landfill sites - Bhalswa, Okhla and Ghazipur -- have cost more than Rs.450 crores in environmental degradation to the national capital so far and with no noticeable progress being made to reduce the millions of tonnes of waste at these dumping sites, according to a study by a team of experts that was submitted to the National Green Tribunal in January last year./The study conducted by experts from National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and IIT-Delhi assessed the damage due to Bhalswa was worth Rs.155.9 crore, Okhla caused ecological damaged to the tune of Rs.151.1 crore and Ghazipur has led to an environmental damage of Rs.142.5 crore. The experts considered factors such as the leachate generated over time and the legacy waste accumulated at the landfills and the violations of solid waste management rules to calculate the damage to the environment./The Bhalswa landfill site was commissioned in 1994 and has accumulated 8 million tonnes of legacy waste, with the site exhausting its capacity in 2006. The Okhla site was commissioned in 1994 and holds 6 million tonnes of legacy waste, with the site exhausting its capacity in 2010. The Ghazipur site is Delhi's oldest and was commissioned in 1984, and has already accumulate 14 million tonnes of legacy waste. In 2019, following an order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT order), the three municipal corporations started carrying out bio-mining and bio-remediation. However, with fresh dumping still continuing, the pace of clearing inert legacy waste has remained slow./Leachate polluting groundwater/""High level of chemical oxygen demand (COD) & Iron (Fe) reported in groundwater at all three sites, which may be due to leachate from the dumpsite. Chlorides, total dissolved solids (TDS), total soluble solids (TSS) and turbidity was reported in surface water body (Bhalswa lake) located within a radius of 0-1 km from Bhalswa site, which may be due to leachate from the dumpsite,"" the committee had said in its groundwater and water analysis./Leachate was found to be reaching as far as 3 to 5 kilometres away from Ghazipur, with high COD values reported at Sanjay Lake too, the report said./COD is an indicative measure of the amount of oxygen that can be consumed by reactions in a measured solution. The most common application of COD is to quantify the amount of oxidizable pollutants found in surface water (lakes and rivers) or wastewater./""Even a small amount of landfill leachate and highly concentrated heavy metals can pollute a large volume of surface as well as groundwater, making it unfit for consumption. These leachates and heavy metals can ultimately enter food chain and in the long run, can affect natural and human resources,"" the study said./Air carrying pollutants all around/These landfill sites are also a big source of air pollution, with contaminants from these sites travelling to as long as 5 kilometres away, aided by strong winds. Even when the landfill is not burning, these landfill sites are a constant source of greenhouses gases such as carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, toxic chemicals, furans, dioxins and unburnt hydrocarbons, and most importantly, methane, which is said to be 84 times as potent as carbon dioxide, in absorbing the sun's rays./People near these landfills breathe some of the worst air in the city, experts have said./While the NGT-formed expert committee was unable to find a direct correlation between air pollution within a 5-km radius of the dumpsite and the activities occurring there, these landfill fires are often seen to have an impact in terms of air quality at the nearest ambient air quality monitoring stations./Following Tuesday's landfill fire breaking out at Bhalswa, the hourly PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration spiked to nearly 9-10 times the national safe limits in the early hours of Wednesday at the Jahangirpuri air quality monitoring station, the nearest station to the site and located less than 5kms away from the landfill./Nearest ambient air quality monitoring stations to these landfill sites also feature among the list of 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi, official data shows. Jahangirpuri station is closest to Bhalswa, Anand Vihar station is near Ghazipur, the Okhla Phase-II station is located near Okhla landfill site -- and all three locations feature in the list of pollution hot spots drawn by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said even when these landfills are not on fire, they release pollutants into the ai. ""The data from these ambient air quality monitoring stations is evident and it underlines the fact that waste management is an important step towards tacking air pollution,"" she said./Richa Singh, programme officer, Waste Management Programme, CSE said that calling the three sites 'landfills' would be inaccurate, as they are without any proper leachate management system or a gas sucking system, and added that the three are ""dump sites"" that were built without adequate planning and are now constantly damaging the environment./""These major fire incidents are being captured, but these landfill sites are burning almost throughout the year with minor fires or smoke breaking out from one corner or the other and this process of mixed waste catching fire releases dioxins and furans which are carcinogenic in nature, along with polyaromatic hydrocarbons which are also carcinogenic. There are long-term health impacts including breathing problems for those regularly breathing such air near the landfill sites,"" she said./Dipankar Saha, former head of the air laboratory at CPCB said landfill sites have been found to be much warmer since they release large number of greenhouse gases, including CO2 and methane. ""There is a lot of activity occurring at a landfill site naturally, including the release of dioxins and furans, but the release of greenhouse gases means their impact is not limited to the neighbourhood or the city, but they are a nationwide problem,"" he said, and added that long-term planning is required to phase out these dump sites./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World Asthma Day 2022: How air pollution is giving rise to asthma,"Delhi, April 30 -- Asthma, a disease of the lungs, is caused by narrow airways which further leads to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing. Various asthma can cause serious damage to the lungs, if not treated in time. Asthma is caused by a series of environmental and genetic factors. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Jagda Nand Jha, Senior International Cardiologist, Associate professor, department of medical sciences, Noida International Institute of Medical Sciences gave us an overview on how air pollution is giving rise to asthma and how it is affecting the health of the lungs adversely./How Air Pollution Is Affecting Asthma?/Through Ozone: This air pollutant affects the lungs and the airways directly. It causes reduction in lung function and the collection of ozone is directly related to asthma attacks./Airborne particles - through breathing, airborne particles often pass through the nose and get accumulated in the lungs. Asthma patients are more prone to such airborne particles. This can have long-tern effects and can affect the lung function./Sometimes when the air quality of the area is poor and the air pollution is at its peak, it is best to stick to a few practices in order to avoid affecting the lung function and breathing. Jagda Nand Jha shared a few expert tips on what to do in case of poor air quality:/1) Take your reliever inhaler at the time of high air pollution./2) Measure the pollution forecast of your area./3) Avoid the pollution hotspots like main roads, junctions, bus stations and car parks, also you can use the quieter back streets as much as possible./4) Visit a doctor based in the community who treats patients with min or chronic illnesses and refers those with serious conditions to a hospital./5) Take medicines on time/6) Eat healthily/7) Steam therapy/8) Improve indoor air quality/9) Step outside only if necessary/10) Wear a mask all the time/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World Asthma Day 2022: How to recognise early signs of an asthma attack,"India, May 3 -- World Asthma Day is celebrated every year on the first Tuesday of May to spread awareness and the day was first observed by Global Initiative for Asthma, a medical guideline organisation founded in 1993. This year the theme is 'Closing Gaps in Asthma Care'. Asthma, the chronic inflammatory disease of airways, affects 300 million people worldwide and India alone has 15 million asthma patients. (Also read: Infinity walk to pranayama: Yoga expert on tips to manage asthma)/Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, Director - Pulmonology, Fortis Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road says coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and difficulty breathing are all symptoms of an asthma attack. Explaining how an asthma attack occurs, Dr Padegal explains: ""the attack occurs in the airways of your body, which are the passageways that supply air to your lungs, narrowing the swollen airways. Less air enters and exits your lungs, and mucus produced by the body plugs the airways."" It is important to recognise early warning signs or changes that might occure before or at the beginning of an asthma attack says the expert./""The symptoms of an early asthma attack are usually not severe enough to keep you from going about your daily routine. However, by recognising these indications, an asthma attack can be stopped or prevented from worsening,"" says Dr Padegal./Here are some of the early warning signals of an asthma attack you must watch out for:/* Extreme coughing, especially at night/* Reduced peak flow metre values/* Shortness of breath/* Fatigue or weakness/* Exercise-induced asthma/* Feeling weary, irritable, grumpy, etc./* Declined lung function/* Allergy or cold symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, and headache)/* Difficulty sleeping/""Because the intensity of an asthma attack can quickly worsen, it's critical to treat these symptoms as soon as possible,"" says the expert./What causes such attacks?/Exposure to certain triggers can cause asthma attacks and they can range from tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, cockroach allergen, pets, mold, smoke from burning wood or grass, and diseases like the flu. Being aware of your triggers can be key to preventing asthma attacks./What are the treatment options?/""To keep asthma under control, follow proper prescriptions prescribed by your doctor and avoid things that can provoke an attack. All asthmatics do not take the same medication as some drugs are inhaled, while others must be taken as pills,"" says Dr Padegal./The two sorts of asthma medications include those that provide immediate relief and those that provide long-term control./""Quick-relief drugs are used to control the symptoms of an asthma attack. Long-term control drugs can help you have fewer and milder asthma episodes, but they can't help you when you're having one. Inquire with your doctor about the possible adverse effects of your medications as well,"" says the expert./What happens if you don't treat your asthma?/Dr Padegal says of the medication or therapy is not taken asthma can worsen and one's breathing may become more laborious, and wheezing may become louder./Delayed treatment may cause you to be unable to talk and have a bluish hue around your lips, known as ""cyanosis,"" indicating that your blood is becoming increasingly depleted of oxygen. It can also read to a condition called silent chest./""Using a peak flow metre during an asthma attack will most likely result in a reading that is lower than your personal best. You may not be able to use the peak flow metre at all if your lungs continue to contract during an asthma episode, also known as the 'silent chest', a warning indicator,"" says Dr Padegal./He suggests that in case of a severe asthma attack, getting to the nearest hospital at the earliest is advisable./When should you see a doctor?/The expert says home treatment may be sufficient if the symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) values improve./""If your symptoms don't improve after trying home treatments, you may need to seek medical help right once./Use your quick-acting (rescue) inhaler as directed in your written asthma plan when your asthma symptoms flare-up. PEF values of 51 per cent to 79 per cent of your personal best indicate that you should take the quick-acting medications prescribed by your doctor,"" concludes Dr Vivek Anand Padegal./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Symptoms of Asthma and reasons why you should not ignore them,"Delhi, May 7 -- According to Global Asthma Report 2018, in India's 1.31 billion people, about 6% of children and 2% of adults had asthma. With an estimated 1.5-2 crore asthma patients across the globe, at least one in every 10 asthma patients globally lives in India and its prevalence in children is far more disappointing./A major noncommunicable disease (NCD), affecting both children and adults, asthma is caused due to inflammation and narrowing of the small airways in the lungs and its symptoms could range from cough to wheeze, shortness of breath and chest tightness. According to the World Health Organization, inhaled medication can control asthma symptoms and allow people with asthma to lead a normal, active life./Do you have asthma? Then, it will be imperative for you to seek timely treatment for this condition as neglecting it can invite various health complications that can turn life-threatening so, manage it and breathe freely throughout your life./In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Arvind Kate, Pulmonologist at Zen Multispecialty Hospital, revealed, ""Asthma causes inflammation of the airways. The cases of asthma are rising at an alarming rate in the country. For the majority of people with asthma, medicines and inhaler can help to control the disease and prevent serious complications but when it comes to people with severe asthma, the situation is different. ""/Those with severe asthma can be resistant to treatment but this condition can surely steal one's peace of mind. Dr Arvind Kate listed symptoms and reasons why ignoring asthma is a strict no-no./1. It disrupts one's daily routine: Asthma will interfere with your ability to carry out the day-to-day activities with ease. One will be unable to focus on his/her work. You will be unable to focus on your work./2. Airway remodelling: This condition can lead to permanent structural changes in the airways or airway remodelling. There will be airway wall thickening and loss of lung function./3. It will interrupt your sleep: Having severe asthma can lead to coughing or wheezing at night. You will not be able to get a good night's sleep, and that can leave you groggy the next day. Disrupted sleep can also cause lack of concentration, drowsy driving, and behaviour problems./4. Emergencies and hospitalisations: The symptoms of asthma can worsen and one will require emergency care or even hospitalization./5. Pneumonia: Those with this condition can also suffer from pneumonia and this can also take a toll on your overall well-being./6. Too much mucus production: Having this condition will cause too much production of mucus./7. Severe chest pain: Since you are constantly coughing or wheezing, this can lead to chest pain./Dr Arvind Kate advised, ""Along with proper treatment, you will also have to adhere to certain lifestyle modifications. Try to keep your home clean and dust-free, wash your hand with soap and water to avoid germs entering your mouth, stay away from pets, eat a well-balanced diet, exercise daily, use a humidifier at home to help you breathe freely, avoid air pollution and smoking and keep the inhaler handy.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution: Management tips for people suffering from lung or other forms of health problems,"Delhi, May 12 -- Studies have shown that air pollution can play a role in the development of cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and the cardiovascular effects of air pollution can lead to heart attack and stroke. Researches in the field point out that insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes suffered an increase in likelihood on exposure to air pollution hence, it is important to understand that pollution affects not only the lungs but other parts of the body as well and people suffering from chronic lung diseases or allergic to any indoor and outdoor environmental factors are prone to recurring infections, allergies and other respiratory ailments./In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Zafar Ahmad Iqbal, Pulmonologist at Fortis, shared, ""Children and elderly people are at a higher risk of pneumonia and patients who already suffer from COPD, asthma, allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, experience exaggeration of their condition due to air pollution. These conditions also escalate over time and lead to other health conditions like heart failure and stroke.""/He advised, ""People who are already suffering from any lung conditions must avoid direct exposure to air pollution by covering their faces before going out. Indoor pollution is one of the most common forms of air pollution that can harm the body. Therefore, one must always switch to using LPG or induction gases to avoid any indoor fumes. It is recommended that people suffering from comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and chronic lung diseases must get scheduled vaccination for influenza and pneumonia to avoid any risk in future.""/There are enough studies to support that there is a direct impact of air pollution on other organs which can cause life-threatening conditions like cancer and cardiovascular problems. Dr Sandeep Nayar, Senior Director and HOD, Chest and Respiratory Diseases at BLK Max Hospital, suggested, ""One must make individual efforts to take care of their lungs and keep an eye on the persisting symptoms. Based on the condition of the patients, we also suggest some precautionary medications to avoid any risk to the patients.""/He added, ""It is recommended that one must stick to their medications even when they feel better and get into the habit of routine check-ups. Staying hydrated and following a healthy lifestyle plays an important role in managing the risk of these conditions. Due to the continuous change in climate, one must always wear the right type of mask while going out as it may trigger breathlessness and other prevailing lung or heart conditions. Lastly, one must also manage the air quality around their vicinity and install air purifiers inside their homes for a better option.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Climate and Us | Plan for the vulnerable: India's heat emergency must be humane,"India, May 17 -- Oppressive heat is experienced differently by each one of us and that may be why the government's response to extreme heat has been slow and patchy so far. India's spring heatwave spell, when maximum temperatures went up to 46-47 degrees Celsius over several parts of northwest, central, and east India, made the global scientific community take note of the unprecedented event./The World Weather Attribution (WWA) network, a global collaboration of leading climate scientists who work on analysing whether a particular extreme weather event is linked to the climate crisis, will submit findings of their study on this year's spring heatwave in India and Pakistan (in March and April) within the next fortnight. WWA is expected to sum up the extent to which the climate crisis may have contributed to such an unprecedented heatwave event. WWA's statement will be significant to recognise India's vulnerability to extreme climate disasters./But, we need much more than that now. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, earlier this month, chaired a meeting on heatwave preparedness where he directed states and districts to come up with heat action plans. The urgency of developing heat action plans will never be understood until officials study how different people in different regions experience extreme heat. On days when the maximum temperature is beyond 45 degrees Celsius, the heat takes a heavy toll on the health of people on the margins of society./To understand how domestic workers experience heat, I asked some women in Govindpuri's slums to describe what they did to survive the heat. Most of them said they experienced low blood pressure, possibly linked to dehydration and throbbing headaches. Some of them longed to be in the air-conditioned homes of their employers, while some desperately needed a break from their work./Of the women I spoke with, Renu Singh, a migrant worker from Bihar faces multiple challenges because she is also a caregiver to her son who has cerebral palsy. ""I leave him for hours during afternoon hours in extreme heat. He cannot even drink water himself. What if he feels completely dehydrated?,"" asked Renu, while she has been dealing with dizzy spells on hot days for the past two months. Both of them cannot sleep well at night because they have to sleep by the door so that at least a little bit of air from outside keeps them cool. They have a tiny desert cooler that can only help them during spells of dry heat. Most women also avoid drinking too much water because they may not have access to toilets where they work and public toilets are usually far away. Just getting to the public toilet can lead to a heat stroke./Renu, however, points out that they are far better off than their family in Bihar who has to work outdoors no matter what. More than half of India may be experiencing a traumatic summer as the government chalks out how to deal with the crisis./The first thing to do is study the impact of the heatwave on both mortality and morbidity. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)'s study for some heat-affected states shows a clear correlation between the increase in the total number of deaths when maximum temperatures spike above 40 degrees Celsius. But when it comes to surveillance, NCDC is particular about the diagnosis of exclusion to determine if a death was only due to heatstroke or not. ""We use a checklist to exclude any other conditions that may have caused the death. That is how surveillance works,"" said Dr Aakash Shrivastava, National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health at NCDC during a heat stress training for journalists last week. Expectedly, NCDC has found only seven deaths linked to spring heatwave in India./But for anyone tracking heat stress in India, it's common knowledge that heat first kills those with co-morbidities - the elderly and infants are at great risk. Hence, a strict criterion of exclusion may not always work. It's also understandable that with a lack of resources, India's public health system is in a precarious state and cannot spare people to track the overall public health burden of heat./This year's heat spell should have been an opportunity to document the health burden of heat and come up with a humane plan for persons most exposed to this slow disaster. India will need cooling shelters; staggered work timings; cool roofs in slums; retrofitted architecture for passive cooling and a robust public health system to deal with the spike in heat-related illnesses and deaths. Time is running out./From the climate crisis to air pollution, from questions of the development-environment tradeoffs to India's voice in international negotiations on the environment, HT's Jayashree Nandi brings her deep domain knowledge in a weekly column/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Young & old join hands in battle against air pollution,"Lucknow, May 22 -- Uttar Pradesh chapter of Lung Care Foundation (LCF) organised an awareness drive, 'SHAPE UP', with the support of the Lucknow municipal corporation authorities near Mithaiwala Chauraha in Gomti Nagar on Sunday morning. People from various walks of life painted graffiti of lungs on the flyover walls to raise awareness about rising air pollution in the environment, one of the leading causes of lung ailments./The drive was organised under the direction of Dr AP Maheshwari, patron, LCF and former DG CRPF, Dr Arvind, pulmonary head of Medanta, and Rajiv Khurana. ""With the help of the municipal corporation officials, we launched our drive today at Gomti Nagar. Our goal is to raise public awareness about pollution and its causes by involving the public in the process and making them aware about the catastrophe looming over our heads, shortening our lifetime by 10-12 years. Multiple self-help groups (SHGs), media organisations, and eminent artists across the city have supported this noble cause. The municipal corporation approved selecting more than 50 locations throughout the city. We also intend to expand this to the rest of the state,"" said Dr AP Maheshwari./A nukkad natak was also performed by young artistes of the Arts College who highlighted the importance of having parks amid growing urbanisation and the importance of morning walks in keeping the lungs healthy. The event brought children, young enthusiasts and adults together in the drive. Over 200 people joined in, making it a more significant public movement./While describing the graffiti she painted, Rupam Shukla, a student of Lucknow University, said that people should be discouraged from using cow dung cakes or woods for cooking as the process produces a lot of smoke, which pollutes the environment./Some dignitaries from the city also joined the event, including Padma Sri Raj Bisaria, Runa Banerjee, Ravi Kapoor, Pankaj Gupta, Ajaish Jaiswal, Capt Paritosh Chauhan, Kanak Chauhan, Akhilesh Agarwal, among others. Dr Rakesh, Dr Sunil and Mala Kumar, Dr Pavitra, Dr Sandeep Kumar and Dr Lubna were also present from the medical fraternity./NSS's Anshumali and Childline's Sangeetaji arrived with a large group of volunteers. Ajay Dwivedi, municipal commissioner, praised the campaign and urged civic society to continue its efforts in other parts of the town./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
