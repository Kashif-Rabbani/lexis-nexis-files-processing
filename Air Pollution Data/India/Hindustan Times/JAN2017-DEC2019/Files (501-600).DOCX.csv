Haze engulfs Delhi as air pollution logs a big spike,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 25 -- Pollution shot up on Wednesday to a four-month high in Delhi, shrouding the national capital in a haze due to unfavourable weather conditions, including a dip in temperature, low wind speed, and a cloudy sky that combined to trap toxic pollutants in the air, according to experts from various government and private monitoring agencies./The Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) forecasting system and the forecast provided by SAFAR, which comes under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said pollution levels will continue to soar till Thursday, after which situations is likely to become better./""The level of particulate matter, particularly the natural dust particles, has shot up drastically since Tuesday evening. At 6pm on Wednesday the level of PM10 (coarse dust particles) shot up to 382.5 micograms per cubic metre which is 3.8 times above the daily permissible limit of 100,"" said a senior CPCB official on condition/of anonymity./The level of PM2.5 ultrafine particles - emitted mostly by vehicles, industries and open garbage burning- also shot up to 172 micograms per cubic metre which is nearly three times higher than the safe limit of 60./""Such high levels of PM10 concentration were last seen in the second week of June this year, when huge amount of dust gushed into Delhi-NCR because of a dust storm in Rajasthan. On June 14, the level of PM10 in Delhi had shot up to nearly 8.5 times above the permissible standards,"" said an official of CPCB who asked not to be named./PM10, at 10 micrograms per cubic metre, is around seven times finer than the human hair and can cause irritation in the nose and eyes. PM2.5, 30 times finer than human hair, can enter deep inside the lungs and cause trouble in patients suffering from bronchial ailments if inhaled over a prolonged period./Scientists from both CPCB and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) blamed the conditions this week on unfavourable meteorological conditions and not on any external factors such as stubble burning or a storm in west India./""Wind speed has dropped to less than 5km per hour. To aggravate conditions, they are coming from the east and south bringing in moisture. The sky has become partly cloudy. Because of all these factors, the dust is getting accumulated in the city's air and pollution is rising,"" said a senior DPCC official who asked not to be named./Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that wind speed dropped to almost zero around noon. The velocity picked up momentarily during the afternoon, but again dropped to zero at around 5.30 pm. The minimum temperature was 17 degrees Celsius, 1 degree below normal./The result was that Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) hit 328 on Wednesday - the highest so far this season. On a scale of 0-500, an AQI value between 301 and 400 indicates 'very poor' air quality. By 2pm on Wednesday, several areas in Delhi, including Anand Vihar, Mundaka, Bawana and Rohini, were reeling under 'severe' pollution with AQI levels breaching the 400 mark./Delhi witnessed a weeklong spell of smog in November 2017, when the AQI shot up to 486, prompting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to describe Delhi as a ""gas chamber"", declare a public health emergency, and order that schools be shut./""Spike in pollution levels is not uncommon in north India when winter is approaching. The frequent change in wind directions, helping moisture to gush in, drop in wind speed and dip in temperature are to be blamed. Once the northwesterly winds picks up speed, pollution levels will drop,"" said D Saha, former head of the CPCB's air quality laboratory./The Supreme Court-appointed panel Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has already rolled out the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) for very poor air quality since October 15. Diesel generators have been banned in Delhi till March 2019 and the Badarpur thermal power has also been shut down./EPCA will meet on Thursday to see if other measures need to be implemented at this stage./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pune's air quality crosses permissible limit of pollutants,"India, Oct. 25 -- The city's air quality has already crossed permissible limit of air pollutants, which was gauged by respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), two weeks before Diwali. According to Maharashtra pollution control board (MPCB), RSPM level recorded in various parts of city in the last 15 days was between the range of 105 g/m3 and 131g/m3 (Per metric cube) while the permissible limit is 100g/m3. There has been a consistent rise in RSPM as the winter is setting in./To check air quality, the Maharashtra pollution control board has conducted daily tests in various cities across Maharashtra with the help of ambient air quality monitoring network which is the systematic, long-term assessment of pollutant levels by measuring the quantity and types of certain pollutants in the surrounding, outdoor air.The data collected over the last two months indicates that the level of RSPM has increased steadily and in first week of October it crossed the prescribed limit of 100g/m3./In July, RSPM was found to be 41.97 g/m3 in Karve road); 51 g/m3 in Nal stop and 21.57 g/m3 in Swargate.It further increased to 93.75g/m3 at Nal Stop in August and while at Karve road, the average for August was 37.20 g/m3. The data by MPCB data also revealed that respirable suspended particulate matter reached 98 g/m3 on September 26,and within next 10 days it crossed prescribed limit and reached 120 g/m3 on October 6./Thereafter, RSPM has been continuously increasing and it peaked at 131g/m3 on October 15./The levels of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides are under permissible limits, according to MPCB.

Pollution has now become a national health crisis,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 25 -- India has 14 of the 15 cities in the world with the most air pollution. In Delhi, pollution levels attain dangerous proportions as Diwali approaches. The lungs and brains of a large percentage of children are getting irreversibly damaged. /The country has the highest rate of deaths from chronic respiratory diseases and asthma. This is a national health crisis which calls for urgent action. While there is no magic bullet such as odd-even, there are feasible measures which would make a huge difference in a few years. The easiest would be to get all households to use clean energy for cooking with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or, electricity. Burning of cow dung cakes and firewood for cooking not only harms the lungs and eyes of women, it is also a major source of all air pollution. Electricity is targeted to reach all households by next year. Its use for cooking can be promoted. LPG cylinders through Ujjwala can be made to reach everybody in a few years. However, the really poor cannot afford to pay more than Rs 200 or so a month for cooking. The first hundred units of electricity in a month, enough for lighting and cooking, could be provided at Rs 3 per unit, or, a LPG cylinder for Rs 300. This can be done through a subsidy from the government, or, cross-subsidy by the energy companies./A market-based solution for the burning of crop residue would work best. An attractive enough price for crop residue for conversion to briquettes to be burnt in coal fired stations, or, for generating electricity directly through gasification would put an end to crop burning. The transition would be driven by private investment and without any subsidy. Thermal plants need to offer a viable price for briquettes and the distribution companies for electricity from crop residue./Phasing out the most polluting vehicles, such as old trucks, buses and tempos, at the earliest, is an unavoidable necessity. This has to be a countrywide measure as air pollution moves across villages and towns. Implementation would be easier if there is a considerably lower price for a new vehicle when the old one is traded in and there is a system of scrapping old vehicles that can be closely monitored.It could easily be done by the government foregoing a substantial portion of the GST on such vehicles. Germany successfully implemented a trade in programme at the time of the financial crisis of 2008 to generate additional demand for their auto industry./The supply of fuel of contemporary international standards, Bharat Stage Six (BS 6), now being implemented, would make a difference only gradually as more new BS 6 compliant vehicles get on the road. But for an immediate impact, all new taxi, bus and three wheeler permits for running within cities should be given only for electric vehicles. Sufficient number of charging stations would naturally need to be created well in advance. The huge potential of electric vehicles in reducing air pollution is not being adequately recognised./Old coal-fired thermal power plants in, or, those close to major urban centres need to be closed down forthwith. This can be done without difficulty as there is surplus power generating capacity with much more in the pipeline. However, only a firm central mandate will make this happen. All industrial clusters need a diagnostic audit for air pollution. Technically feasible measures with state financial assistance and in partnership with industrial units would have to be implemented to reduce air pollution./Clearly, the use of coal for energy and heating by small industrial units has to be phased out. The extension of a gas grid to all industrial areas has been unduly delayed in the country. Electricity for continuous process industries to be provided at lower rates reflecting actual costs of supply would also help./For all this and more to happen, the central, state and city governments have to agree to do what it takes, including providing adequate funds. Finances can come from the coal, or, a new clean air cess./The health costs to the nation of inaction are far higher. Coordinated action across multiple institutions is never easy. Sustained political commitment would be an essential prerequisite./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurugram was nation's second most polluted city on Friday,"Gurugram, Oct. 27 -- AIR quality in the city was found to be the second worst in the country on Friday, recording 378 on the Air Quality Index (AQI), with PM2.5 levels touching an alarming rate of 406ug/m3 according to the National Air Quality Index web app. This is more than six times the safe limit of 60ug/m3. Faridabad was marginally worse, recording 381 on the AQI./A thick haze enveloped the city on Friday, creating smoglike conditions, which, experts said, were due to falling temperatures over the last two days./From 35.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, maximum daytime temperature dropped to 32.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday, and dipped further to 31.2 degrees Celsius on Friday./""The climatic conditions are causing particulate matter to settle closer to ground at shorter mixing heights, where they are reacting under the influence of sunlight, temperature and other conditions to create a haze of secondary aerosols,"" said citybased air-quality expert Sachin Panwar./He further explained that the atmosphere is replete with anthropogenic pollutants, such as sulphur dioxides, volatile organic compounds and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. ""Ozone levels might also be on the higher side these days,"" Panwar said./According to Central Pollution Control BOARD(CPCB) data, ozone levels in Gurugram showed a spike on Friday afternoon, touching 104.78ug/m3 at 1pm./On Thursday, too, ozone levels spiked, reaching 140.21ug/m3 at 4pm. The safe limit for ozone is/100ug/m3 for over eight hours, which has not been breached so far. However, even these 'safe' increases point towards rising pollution levels overall, said Panwar./Moreover, when compared to New Delhi, which scored 361 on Friday's AQI (also due to falling temperatures), Gurugram's atmosphere has a far higher content of soot and smoke, thanks to the widespread use of diesel generators, rampant construction work, vehicular emissions and open fires, all of which contribute to the smog-like conditions./Since the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to curb air pollution on October 15, Gurugram has spent eight days with 'very poor' air and just a single day with 'poor' air./Data from October 15-17 is unavailable due to a technical issue with the city's air quality monitor./During the first two weeks of the month, however, the city had one day of 'moderate' air, followed by six days of 'poor' air and four days of 'very poor' air. Moreover, all of Gurugram's three highest AQI scores were recorded in the last six days./A sub-divisional officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board said, ""We are actively enforcing the Graded Response Action Plan and carrying out all measures to fight rising pollution.""/JB Sharma, regional officer, HSPCB, however, could not be reached for comment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

"Deterioration of air continues in Delhi, Sunday records season's worst","India, Oct. 28 -- The national capital recorded this season's worst air quality on Sunday, with medical experts reporting a spike in respiratory ailments over the last two weeks. The overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi touched 366, up from Friday's level of 361. The AQI was in the 'very poor' category, above the hazardous 300-mark, for the fifth consecutive day./The level of PM2.5 - tiny particles of dust, soot and smoke - shot up to its highest since June at 232.2ug/m3. The safe limit for PM2.5 concentration is 60ug/m3. Prolonged exposure to these ultrafine particles, which enter the lungs and blood, can cause severe respiratory problems./Doctors in the city said the decline in air quality and a recent drop in temperature resulted in increasing number of patients reporting upper respiratory tract problems. The temperature dipped below 15 degrees Celsius last week, two degrees below normal./Patients are also reporting allergic respiratory problems. ""There is a steady increase in the number of patients coming to my clinic with allergic cold since mid-October. Usually, there is about a 30% increase in the number of such patients around Diwali, when the pollution levels increase and the temperature decreases, causing people's immunity to go down,"" said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh./Out of the 36 air quality monitoring stations in Delhi, four - located at Mundka, Narela, Rohini and Mathura Road - recorded the air quality as 'severe' on Sunday. Gurugram and Ghaziabad also recorded 'severe' air pollution, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. At the four Delhi stations, the prominent pollutant was PM2.5. The tiny pollutants are generated mainly in the absence of strong winds, with soot and smoke being released from burning waste and vehicular emissions. The air quality in Delhi is likely to deteriorate over the next few days, according to the CPCB's forecasting system and Safar, which comes under the Union ministry of earth sciences./At 7pm on Sunday, the PM10 level in Delhi was recorded at 389.5 ug/m3, well past the safe standard of 100ug/m3. ""PM10 and PM 2.5 levels are likely to shoot up further over the next three days. Pollutants are not getting dispersed and are getting trapping in the air because of the calm wind conditions,"" said a senior CPCB official who did not wish to be named./The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, a Supreme Court-mandated body to monitor pollution levels in the NCR region, has announced that pollution levels will peak after November 1, as winds flow from the northwest, bringing pollutants from burning stubble in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana. Epca said that the phenomenon, coupled with the onset of winter and the festive rush, will lead to a spike in air pollution. The Supreme Court recently lifted a blanket ban on the sale and purchase of firecrackers, which could also add to pollution in the first week of November./Doctors said more cases of respiratory problems were likely after Diwali. ""We will see an increase of nearly 20 to 30% in such cases in our OPD after Diwali. The pollution caused by bursting crackers is worse than from crop burning, because it releases sulphur dioxide and heavy metals into the air,"" said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consulting physician at Moolchand Medcity./Between November 1 and 9 last year, Delhi's air quality remained in the 'severe' category for a week, with AQI touching 486 on November 9. The toxic levels prompted authorities to declare a public health emergency. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 301 and 400 indicates 'very poor' air quality. A value beyond 401 indicates 'severe' air quality./Air pollution levels in the city have spiked despite the graded response action plan (Grap) being enforced beginning October 15. On?Saturday, Epca?announced a clutch of measures, including a complete ban on construction and excavation work across NCR between November 1 and 10, to curb pollution. The CPCB?also issued an advisory, asking citizens to avoid engaging in strenuous activity and exercising outdoors for extended periods.

Air pollution killed highest number of under-5 children in India in 2016: WHO report,"India, Oct. 30 -- India recorded the highest number of air pollution-induced deaths of children below five years in 2016, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report that analysed the impact of toxic air on the health of children in 194 countries./At least 100,000 children below five years died that year in the country due to health complications associated with high outdoor and indoor air pollution, according to the report titled 'Air Pollution and Child Health' released in Geneva on Monday./Nigeria (98,001), Pakistan (38,252), Democratic Republic of Congo (32,647) and Ethiopia (20,330) followed India, completing the list of the worst five countries in child mortality in the study./Death rates, or the ratio of deaths to population during a particular period, were higher in these four countries than that of India./Of the countries surveyed, India recorded the highest premature deaths among children under five years due to outdoor air pollution in 2016 and the second highest number of deaths due to exposure from indoor air pollution - only after Nigeria./About 98% of the children in that age group in India are exposed to PM2.5 levels that exceed WHO's annual standard of 25 micrograms per cubic metres. PM2.5 pollutants are particulate matters that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers./These tiny particles are so fine that they can enter the bloodstream and lodge deep into the lungs./Half of all deaths due to acute lower respiratory infections, which include pneumonia and influenza, in children below five years is caused by exposure to high air pollution levels in low- and middle-income countries, estimates WHO./Across the world, at least 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by air pollution in 2016./India also has one of the highest morbidity and mortality rates: at least 50 deaths for every 100,000 children due to such infections./Globally, premature birth is the only other factor that kills more children below five years than acute respiratory infections. In the African region, however, acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of death of children in that age group./When asked about the details of the methodology for the country-wise mortality figures, WHO said the sources to assess PM2.5 exposure was scientific modelling, ground measurements (provided by the likes of the Central Pollution Control Board in India) and satellite data. The methodology to assess risks associated with PM2.5 exposure is the one used in the Global Burden of Disease, a study on health impacts from various sources./WHO has also put together a list of health effects that children may be facing from air pollution, taking into account significant research studies published in the past 10 years and inputs from experts around the world./Poor birth outcomes like low birth weight and a rise in pre-term births and stillbirths due to the mother's exposure to high air pollution levels have been mentioned in past research./WHO's review has established that air pollution can also lead to behavioural disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; adverse metabolic outcomes such as obesity and insulin resistance; occurrence of otitis media (an inflammatory disease of the middle ear); and higher risk of retinoblastoma (cancer of retina) and leukaemia (blood cancer) in children./The report says that there is substantial evidence that exposure to road traffic-related air pollution or diesel exhaust is associated with childhood leukaemia./Authors of the study have listed why children are the most vulnerable to air pollution exposure and the various pathways through which air pollution affects their health - which include inhalation and ingestion of pollution particles./As children breathe at twice the rate that adults do, they inhale larger amounts of air pollutants. Pollution particles are also moved through the respiratory system faster, allowing them to reach the lungs, the alveoli and the bloodstream more rapidly, according to the study./Children are also more physically active than adults; so their ventilation is even greater. They are closer to the ground, where pollution concentrations are higher. Certain pollutants (small enough to penetrate the alveolar wall) inhaled by a pregnant mother can enter her bloodstream and then cross the placental barrier and reach the foetus, and, in turn, affect the baby's growth and development./Children are also exposed to pollutants through mother's milk. Pollutants from industrial sources, such as pesticides, fossil fuels, chemical by-products, flame retardants, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds, can enter the mother's circulation by inhalation or, more commonly, ingestion before being passed into breast milk, the report says.

"NorthEast beat Delhi, on top of table","NEW DELHI, Oct. 31 -- Goals from Federico Gallego and Bartholomew Ogbeche saw NorthEast United beat Delhi Dynamos 2-0 in an Indian Super League clash at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday, sending them to the top of the standings with 11 points from five games./With the ground being engulfed by a haze of smog - PM 2.5 crossed a hazardous level of 300 in areas in and around the stadium - conditions in the national capital were barely conducive for a game of football. The visitors, however, were backed by a majority of the 12,342-strong crowd and they took no time in taking control of the game./Just six minutes into the match, Ogbeche almost gave NorthEast the breakthrough when he deftly lobbed the ball above Dynamos keeper Francisco Dorronsoro, only for the ball to come back, off the crossbar. Like their last game here against Chennaiyin, it was turning into another struggle for the hosts./Ogbeche would continue to cause problems and had a big shout for a penalty in the 24th minute when he went down following a last-ditch tackle by Marti Crespi. The referee waved away appeals by NorthEast players./The visitors continued to dominate but suffered a blow late into the first half when defender Gurwinder Singh limped away with an injury. He was replaced by Lalthathanga Khawlhring./The second half saw fewer chances for either side, and a goalless draw looked well on the cards until the game sprang to life again in the 82nd minute when an attempted clearance from the Dynamos backline found NorthEast's Gallego at the edge of the box./The forward cut inside and shot towards the goal. His effort managed to sneak through Dorronsoro's near post, much to the delight of the NorthEast fans./The hosts' response to the goal was timid and NorthEast killed off the game deep into injury time when Gallego laid off the ball for Ogbeche from a counter-attack for the latter to finish from close range to double his side's lead. The win sees Dynamos remain third from bottom with just three points from six games./POLLUTION CONCERNS/Speaking of the rising levels of air pollution, Delhi coach Josep Gombau said, ""We are taking precaution; some players are wearing masks in training. But this is something we can't control. The health of my players is more important than anything else.""/ATK BANK ON JOHNSON/KOLKATA: Eyeing their maiden win against Bengaluru FC, ATK are banking on their defender John Johnson's input on the last year's runners-up, coach Steve Coppell said. Johnson was a regular in Bengaluru FC since the club's inception in 2013./The English defender will be now be donning ATK colours./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Schools turn to air purifiers, vertical gardens","Gurugram, Oct. 31 -- TAKING cognizance of the high pollution levels in the city, private schools are taking a host of precautionary measures to ensure that physical and mental health of the students is not adversely affected. From installing indoor air quality systems and air purifiers to monitoring the air quality index daily, schools are making efforts to maintain pollutionfree green campuses./Lancers International School in DLF-5 has set up a central air purification system and air purifiers in key areas of the school with real time AQI readings. These AQI readings are shared on the school's website and broadcasted to parents through the school-parent interface. School activities are also regulated depending on the AQI levels. A maximum of 60 minutes of outdoor activity is permitted if the reading falls between 200 - 250 AQI and outdoor activities are suspended if the AQI reaches a reading of 251 and above./""At Lancers, we've made it our goal to address air quality and health concerns so as to provide a safe learning environment for our students. A red flag is placed on the field for all to see when outdoor activities are suspended due to severe pollution. We have also revised our school calendar and extended the Diwali break,"" said YK Sindwani, head, Lancers International School./He added that the school routinely organises informatory sessions to create awareness among students about using masks and other steps that can be taken by them to avoid respiratory diseases./Other schools in the city are working towards setting up ventilation systems that have the highest efficacy. The management of The Ardee School in Sector 52 is planning to maintain 'American standards' of air quality and ventilation. Shefali Varma, the chairperson, Ardee Schools, said that health and safety of students are crucial for their academic performance./""The school is committed to enhancing learning and development of children. Keeping this in mind, we are putting in place facilities that will help us tackle air pollution,"" said Varma./Suncity School in Sector 54 is making use of 100 air purifiers, which have been installed in classrooms and the school premises. Additionally, the school limits outdoor activities for students during high pollution and encourages students to wear masks outside the school premises./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

"Delhi air pollution: Farm fires choke Delhi, air quality enters danger zone","India, Oct. 31 -- Farms in Punjab recorded a spurt in cases of crop residue burning over the weekend, satellite images show, and winds slowed down in much of north India - creating two potent conditions that resulted in the air quality in the national capital plunging on Tuesday to its worst level so far this season./The average air quality index for the day was 401 - classified as 'severe', the second worst of five grades of pollution - as satellite pictures released by the National Aeronautical Space Agency (Nasa) showed a band of haze stretching from across the border in Pakistan to Agra in western Uttar Pradesh./""It is because of unfavourable meteorological conditions that air quality has worsened. A cyclonic circulation over Odisha is blocking winds, as a result of which the wind speed [in north India] has dropped as has the 'ventilation index' (which determines how fast pollutants get dispersed),"" a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) official said. ""Mist in the morning and pollutants from stubble burning regions of neighbouring states are making the air toxic,"" he added./Farmers in Punjab and Haryana set fire to stubble left from paddy harvest in order to quickly turn their fields around for the next round of sowing, a problem that the state and Union governments have tried to solve through punitive as well as assistive measures such as subsidies on farming equipment./Farmers said more instances of burning will be reported in coming days, especially around the festival of Diwali when fireworks will add a cocktail of toxic gases that are anyway hard to disperse due to meteorological conditions typical for this time of the year./""Crop stubble burning will continue up to November 15 and overlap with Diwali. Farmers cannot help it because almost 50% of the crop is left to be harvested,"" said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)./Another farmer said the increase was inevitable since there is little time left for sowing wheat, which begins from November 10. ""Small farmers cannot purchase equipment to handle straw, thus they have no other option except to burn it,"" said farm leader Darshan Singh in Patiala./An official of the Punjab pollution control board, who asked not to be named, said another spike could come around Diwali. ""Many farmers will try to burn paddy straw by terming it as incidental fire,"" the official added./""The primary pollutants in Delhi's air - PM10 and PM2.5 - shot up alarmingly over the past one week. At 8pm on Tuesday PM10 level shot up to 454ug/m3 which is 4.5 times above the safe limit of 100ug/m3. The ultra fine particles PM2.5 shot up to 256ug/m3, which was 4.2 times above the permissible limit of 60ug/m3,"" said the CPCB quoted above./According to CPCB scientists, Safar and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the air is likely to remain as bad for the next two days at least./The highest recorded AQI Delhi has witnessed so far was 497 on November 6, 2016 when the city recorded its worst smog in 17 years. That day came less than a week after Diwali that year./Even though the Delhi government is yet to issue an advisory for schools, some are taking precautionary measures such as suspending morning assemblies and restricting outdoor activities for students./CPCB has asked people in Delhi to minimise exposure to the toxic air, and avoid strenuous exercise between November 1 and 10. Car owners have been advised to use public transport./""Avoid major traffic intersections during rush hours. Avoid other forms of pollution such as burning incense sticks and mosquito coils indoors,"" said Dr TK Joshi, a health expert of the CPCB task force./Most of the increase in crop burning on the weekend was registered on Sunday, when 3,162 cases of fire were reported. ""The farmers took advantage of a holiday when officials were not on field visits,"" said Kahan Singh Pannu, Punjab's agriculture secretary. He said senior officials now carry out inspections on holidays as well./He, however, said this was not the reason why Delhi's pollution levels had shot up./Lakhowal, the BKU leader, said the state government had not done enough to help them manage crop residue. ""Farmers asked for ?200 per quintal of produce as compensation to meet diesel costs of using machinery to mulch straw. The government didn't do anything about it. The government subsidy on machinery for straw management is useless because companies have increased the market price of machinery and farmers cannot afford them.,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution chokes, kills you silently: Experts","NEW DELHI, Nov. 1 -- Viral fever, infections with symptoms of cough, lung infection and fevers that usually end in September have persisted and steadily risen through October this year. The number of people complaining of throat and airway infections, in fact, have gone up by 20% in the past one week./People with asthma and chronic bronchitis are having increasing trouble breathing over the past three weeks, with doctors estimating the numbers to go up by 30-40% of the normal after Diwali./While short-term exposure causes airway and lung infections and aggravates breathing disorders, chronic exposure can lead to several life-threatening diseases. ""Pollution kills. Every year thousands die of pollutionrelated ailments in Delhi and NCR during the winters when the air is extremely foul. Pollution is a silent killer; it does not directly kill anyone but aggravates existing diseases,"" said Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS./This year, there has been no respite from infections. ""There is usually a rise in the number of people with upper respiratory tract infections in the end of August, when the rains stops and it starts getting colder. The next spike happens in October, when the temperature dips and the crop burning starts. There is a sharp increase after Diwali that continues to February of next year,"" said Vikas Maurya, head of department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh./The rains this year persisted for a fortnight longer and the end of the monsoon was quickly followed by farm fires that polluted the air. ""This year, the rains lasted well into September because of which the season-end infections occurred late. These then sort of bunched together with infections and conditions associated with pollution, leading to more than the usual number of infections,"" said Nevin Kishore, head of bronchology, Max Super speciality hospital, Saket./FIRECRACKERS MORE HARMFUL/A single snake tablet can produce 64,500 microg/m3 of PM 2.5 within three minutes and a garland (ladi) of 1,000 crackers produces 38,540 micro g/m3 of PM 2.5 within six minutes, according to a study conducted by the Chest Research Foundation, Pune. The permitted annual mean of PM2.5 is 40 micro g/ m3, according to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. But, it is not just the PM levels. ""Pollution from fireworks is more harmful than that from vehicular emissions or crop burning. This is because the chemicals used in the crackers release harmful heavy metals into the atmosphere,"" said Raj Kumar, director, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute in Delhi./""Increased particulate matter from burning fireworks mainly comprises fine and ultrafine spherical particles. Elevated levels of trace metals, ions and various forms of carbon are present in the particulate matter. Unique physical and chemical properties of ambient particulate matter during short-term firework burning can lead to substantial health damage,"" states a study from National University of Kaohsiung, Taiwan./The recent Supreme Court judgement has set a two-hour window period for bursting 'green' firecrackers, which will produce less pollution. The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) has to ensure that only fireworks with permitted chemical content are produced, sold, purchased and used./As per PESO specifications, the highest allowed content is 20% for sulphur, 57% for nitrates and 24% for aluminium. Lithium, mercury, arsenic, lead and antimony containing crackers are banned, so are potassium chlorate-based crackers./LONG-TERM DAMAGE/With Delhi's air quality hovering between 300 and 400 on most days through the winter months, the long-term consequences of pollution cannot be ignored./""Pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes,"" said Guleria./""It can also result in stunted growth of the lungs in children and cause respiratory problems later in life,"" he said./Long-term exposure also leads to people developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In India, 50% of all COPD is caused by ambient and household air pollution, a recent state-level burden of disease published in Lancet stated. Globally, 80% of COPD is caused by smoking./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Amid 'green cracker' pitch, Rajasthan lab comes up with e-crackers","Jaipur, Nov. 1 -- A Centre-run laboratory in Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu district has developed e-crackers that produce the same light and sound as traditional firecrackers without emitting any of the hazardous smoke that spike air pollution./Scientists at the Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CEERI) in Pilani have recently developed four varieties of battery-fitted e-crackers, the electronic version of firecrackers. The institute, which is under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), has invited people to see its demonstration on the Pilani campus on November 4./""The e-cracker produces different illumination patterns and sounds and is reusable. It uses a rechargeable battery and is absolutely safe and green,"" CEERI director Santanu Chaudhury said./""The e-crackers are a work in progress as we are working on different varieties and on a thermal simulation so that these crackers start when a fire source is brought near them. This is being done to give users an experience of lighting a cracker,"" Chaudhury added./The institute has developed an e-ladi, a string of crackers tied together to produce a continuous sound and illumination effect for some time. The traditional ladi is hazardous as some of the crackers often fly off the string while they are bursting and produce toxic smoke but the e-ladi is absolutely safe, said the CEERI director./Chaudhury said they were in talks with some investors for scaling up the project./This comes after the Supreme Court said last week that people across the country will get two hours between 8pm and 10pm to burst crackers during Diwali and made only the sale of ""green and improved"" fireworks mandatory at least in the national capital region (NCR) centred on New Delhi, in a ruling aimed at reducing air pollution that peaks in the festive season./According to a 2017 affidavit to the top court and explanations offered by the country's explosives regulator, green firecrackers would refer to products that do not contain metals such as barium, aluminium and iron which create toxic gases./It also imposed stringent restrictions on the chemical materials that are used in firecrackers, hearing a 2015 plea by three toddlers filed through their parents who sought a complete ban on the manufacture, sale and bursting of fireworks on account of the health risks they pose to citizens./Union environment minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday that Indian scientists have been working to create an entire range of fireworks over the past year to bring down pollution during Diwali without disrupting the Rs 6,000-crore industry that supports around five lakh families./He said that for the first time in India an emission testing facility has been established at Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CECRI) in Tamil Nadu's Karaikudi and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur in Uttar Pradesh testing is in progress for both conventional and green crackers for monitoring emissions and sound./CECRI researchers replaced aluminum, the primary heat source that produces the flash, with magnesium to reduce ignition temperature and minimise emission of particulate matter. The new product had less smoke and was less noisy. The particulate matter mission was reduced by 25% to 30%./At NEERI, scientists developed three prototypes named SWAS (safe water releaser), SAFAL (safe minimum aluminum) and STAR (safe thermite cracker). The particulate matter was reduced by 30-35% in SWAS and 35-40% in SAFAL and STAR./Cracker manufactures have reacted positively to the green crackers but would need approval from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), the nodal agency for safety requirements in the manufacture, storage, transport and use of all types of explosives and petroleum, before commercial production./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air pollution: Reactive, band-aid solutions will not solve the problem","NEW DELHI, Nov. 2 -- The Supreme Court petition that asked to ban firecrackers also pleads to control pollution created from other sources, such as burning of crop stubble, garbage and vehicular emissions. Crop residue burning in farms around India's capital directly affects high population density urban centres like Delhi and NCR. Latest satellite images show that these fires have reduced in recent days. But they're still contributing to almost 5% of the total pollution. Farmers who burn crop residue in northern India do so knowingly and because they don't have an alternate economical and viable option. As the first inhalers of that choking smoke, much before it gets into any city dwellers' lungs, they're also early sufferers. But they continue to burn because this is the fastest way they have to turnaround their capital, which is their acreage. This doesn't mean that they are justified in doing this at all. This, and anything that jeopardises human health to such a degree, is wrong, and must stop. It is our elected government's job to ensure that enforcement of such a mandate is being followed especially at a time when we are going through a national health emergency caused by pollution./But reactive, band-aid solutions and challans aren't going to help anyone. We need a comprehensive policy by a centralised, empowered and accountable authority tasked with quantifiable, timebound goals. And here is where every political party has let us - urban residents as well as farmers - down. As always, this is about money. But it is also about intention. Crop stubble burning isn't new. It is a recurring source which tips over an already high pollution baseload that north India suffers from due to geographical, meteorological and man-made factors./What could the government have done, and can still do? One: The Agriculture ministry can direct scientists and researchers from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the National Soil Research Institute, etc to create implementable solutions. Soil researchers can educate farmers on how burning damages the soil by depleting it of valuable nutrients, which, in turn, requires higher external application of fertilisers. Higher fertiliser use not just means a higher fertiliser subsidy outgo by the government but also higher input costs for farmers. Simultaneously, scientists can identify and encourage the use of those seed varieties with softer stalks that can be used as fodder. Farmers from Punjab who I met confirmed that the high silica in the paddy stalks of the varieties they grow makes them inedible as animal fodder. The government could easily get farmers to switch back to growing low-water use, nutrition-dense coarse grains such as pearl millet, finger millet, sorghum, barley, rye and maize by offering higher support price subsidies. These higher iron-content grains are perfect for a country where large swathes of the population are anaemic. Now that the government's biofuels policy allows inclusion of ethanol made from maize and sorghum, there is even less reason to further deplete north India's water table by growing a high water-use paddy crop in a water-scarce area. These grains can be planted later, allowing farmers a longer turnaround window to clear their fields. As well, the ethanol produced from them can help farmers augment their income, besides creating new employment opportunities and saving on oil imports./Two: Make waste valuable. Farmers won't burn it. Our scientists could be tasked to find solutions that reuse farm waste to monetise it. The government could directly pay farmers to deposit crop waste at collection centres or link it to their minimum support price payments. Simultaneously, they could subsidise entrepreneurs who create solutions like green refrigeration systems powered by farm waste or ecological crockery (which also reduces plastic use.) Three: The ministry of rural development can deploy free MGNREGS labour to farmers during harvest for acreage needing a quick turnaround, a much more productive use of our taxpaying rupee./Punjab farmers seem happy with the Happy Seeder, a machine that simultaneously performs the dual job of cutting crop stubble and sowing seeds. But before propagating - and subsidising - this as the only solution, it is important to check whether these diesel-run machines won't just end up swapping one source of pollution with another, not to mention will lead to increase in costs with further rise in oil prices. In a labour-rich country like ours, deploying capital-intensive techniques like Happy Seeders is counter-intuitive./But how do Uttar Pradesh farmers growing similar crops burn so much less? According to Chowdhury Pushpendra Singh, a Bulandshahar farmer, this is because farmers employ more traditional techniques that utilise most of the crop waste as fodder, animal bedding and compost. ""Crop stubble from basmati seed varieties 1121 and 1509 doesn't have very tough/ high silica stalks,"" he explains. Instead of working on solutions like these, the government hasn't even finalised its much touted National Clean Air plan. However flawed, it was a start. Now, it looks like another season - and election - must pass before beleaguered, vulnerable citizens can hope for respite./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Punekars take the green route, this Diwali","Pune, Nov. 4 -- Diwali, a festival of lights, calls for celebration, spending time with family and lots of sweets. However, Punekars this year are taking special efforts to ensure a green and clean Diwali. Right from choosing eco-friendly products to decorate their homes, to vowing not to burst crackers, these families are doing their bit for the environment. Some are also going the extra mile to bring smiles on the faces of the needy and underprivileged./Making the switch/For many years, artist Sandeep Sinha would burst crackers on all days of Diwali. An unfortunate asthma attack of one of his cousins, made him realise the damage he was doing to environment and people around him./""For a few years now, I completely refrain from including anything that can harm the environment in my celebrations. We should celebrate Diwali the way it is meant to be celebrated. Originally the first time when Diwali was celebrated in honour of Lord Ram's return to Ayodhya, it was eco-friendly with no crackers and only lamps. I don't see any religious or spiritual interest in bursting crackers. We do it in the name of Diwali, just for the sake of our happiness and bursting crackers are same as smoking because both gives happiness, but if happiness harms us then please avoid it,"" says Sandeep./Celebrating a eco-friendly Diwali for the past two years is 21-year-old photographer Mukund Thakkar. ""We do not burst crackers or do anything to pollute the environment during Diwali. We also focus on green products . We try and reuse decorations every year and avoid the use of single-use plastics,"" Mukund said./No crackers for us/For 33-year-old Trupti Rathod, Diwali has always been a time to celebrate with family and close ones. ""As a family motto, we don't believe in hurting or harming anything around us. So, our main focus through the year is to save our environment, protect nature and avoid any kind of pollution. This just becomes stricter during festivals. We stay away from crackers and ensure a green and clean Diwali festival, every year. In fact, my mom Meena has never burst crackers since her childhood."" Trupti said./On similar lines is the thought process of the management of NSS unit at Abhinav junior college, Ambegaon. The students of this unit have been taking an oath to stay away from crackers for the past 12 years. Vinod Kumar Bangale, programme officer, NSS, shares, ""The students of Class 11 take an oath every year to stay away from crackers. They also help in spreading the message across. The idea is to inculcate awareness in them from the right age. The age of 17-19 is when we notice most youth burning crackers. So, our initiative with the help of Rajiv Jagtap (president, Abhinav Education Society) and Varsha Sharma (principal) is to help them understand the ill effects of crackers and how to protect environment and avoid sound/air pollution.""/Interestingly, the students collect the money that they get from elders to spend on crackers and use it for a noble cause. They either buy stationery for underprivileged students or collect the amount and give it to an NGO./Spreading happiness/For 25 years, a cloth merchant Madan Wadekar has been donating clothes to the needy through his store on Tilak Road. At 53, Madan has come up with an interesting initiative to spread happiness during Diwali. For over two decades, he has been collecting old, but usable clothes from customers and distributing it to various NGOs across the city. He offers customers donating clothes a discount, which they can avail on purchase of new clothes from the store.""During festivals, I noticed that many families could not afford new clothes and it touched me. That's when I requested my customers to donate their old outfits and avail a discount and the initiative has running for over two decades.""His social drive is carried out only through word of mouth publicity./Eco-friendly Diwali products/Products made by the inmates of Yerawada Central Prison for Diwali are displayed at an exhibition at the outlet on Ahmednagar road.This year, the exhibition has focused on eco-friendly products including lanterns, diyas and temples.The raw material for most of the products are also made by inmates. Paper mash and cardboard made in the jail from newspapers is used to make diwali diyas, lanterns and paper bags. The saris, towels and bedsheets are made of pure cotton.

"From godowns to shops and cots, firecrackers being sold in Gurugram despite SC ban","India, Nov. 5 -- Gurugram/Despite the Supreme Court's October 23 ban on bursting firecrackers in the national capital region (NCR), an HT?spot check found that several shopkeepers in Gurugram were selling crackers. The apex court has fixed two hours on Diwali, which will be celebrated on Wednesday, from 8pm to 10pm for bursting green crackers. The court had banned use of the conventional fireworks in view of the rising air pollution in the region which has already hit severe levels and the graded response action plan (Grap)./HT?went to nine randomly chosen localities to check the implementation of the SC?ban and found that crackers were being sold on the sly in eight of them. Crackers were found stored in a godown, general stores, and under the bedstead of a teenager's room. The shopkeepers are not being identified here since there were no official complaints against them./During the spot check, HT?found crackers being sold in Sector 52, Gadoli, Madanpuri, Firoz Gandhi Colony, Vikas Nagar, Ravi Nagar, Sheetla Mata Colony and Sector 5 Huda market. In Kadipur, however, nobody was found selling crackers and all three godowns were shut./""No FIR has been filed against anyone selling crackers or bursting crackers till today evening,"" Subhash Boken, Gurugram police spokesperson, said on Sunday evening./Munish Sharma, additional deputy commissioner (ADC), said no licence has been issued to any trader to sell crackers. Selling crackers in the city is illegal./In Gadoli, around 7.30am on Sunday, a bearded man smoking a hookah directed this correspondent ""le lo andar se (take it from inside the room)"", when he asked about crackers. The man pointed to the gate of a godown, which was locked from inside. Two buyers were already inside the room. They said they do not have green crackers./In Madanpuri, a teenager ran up a narrow concrete stairway and opened a brown wooden door before pulling out four plastic sacks filled with crackers from under his bed./Along Basai Road, three people were found selling crackers placed on cots in Vikas Nagar and Ravi Nagar areas./In Wazirabad village in Sector 52, two general shops were selling crackers and a third person was selling it on a cot in the street./""There would not be any problem. I have a stock of Rs 4 lakh and I'm not facing any problem, then how will you face any problem?"" the owner of a general store in Sheetla Mata Colony, which also sold crackers said, when asked if there would be any problem in buying illegal crackers./Most of the traders said that they had got the crackers before the ban and some said they were selling leftovers from past season. Only one person said he bought the stock after the SC ban./""We are implementing the SC order strictly. There are no crackers being sold openly and if anyone is selling it secretly, we will look into it,"" Boken said./ADC?Sharma said, ""For crackers, the SHOs (station house officers) have been asked to first strike at the root cause - the markets - and then ensure that reported cases of violation are dealt with strictly.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air pollution affects young lungs more, say doctors","NEW DELHI, Nov. 6 -- Not just adults, even children have been landing up at city's hospitals and clinics with symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, runny nose, and chest congestion as their young lungs cannot cope with the levels of rising air pollution./Doctors say children are more vulnerable as they breathe in twice the rate than adults, which makes them inhale larger amounts of harmful pollutants. Children under eight, in particular, sustain more damage as their lungs are developing./Air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM 2.5 and 10), sulphur and nitrogen oxides trigger allergies, cough and lung infections, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety, tiredness and even diabetes, heart disease and irreversible lung damage over prolonged heavy exposure./""A child also gets exposed to all the component of Air Quality Index and not just the particulate matter, and each of these components have been studied individually by scientists and are known to cause serious harm. So, imagine what will happen to a child's lungs when all these pollutants are collectively inhaled in heavy measures,"" says Dr Krishan Chugh, paediatric pulmonologist, Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI), Gurugram./What makes the condition worse is high moisture levels in the air combined with drop in temperature around this time of the year that makes it conducive for viruses and bacteria to thrive in the atmosphere./Children also tend to catch infection quickly this time of the year as the air is loaded with disease-causing microbes, and because of high pollutants these microbes are suspended in the air longer and at lower levels./Precautions are the same for children as for adults that they should avoid areas where traffic is heavy as far as possible, and avoid venturing out during mornings and evenings when pollution levels are high./If travelling in a car with a child, keep the windows rolled up and fan of the car's air-conditioner on to avoid outside air comingin./""It is not practical to ask kids to stay indoors but what we can do is ask them to avoid outdoor activities during early mornings and evenings,"" Dr JS Bhasin, head of paediatric department, BLK Super Speciality Hospital. Allow them to go out to play only when the sun is out. Doctors don't recommend masks for kids. ""Masks are not practical for children as they won't keep it on.

Avoid walks and exercise in morning and evening,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 6 -- Avoid stepping out for morning walks and other outdoor exercises if the Air Quality Index (AQI) in your area crosses the 200-mark, say doctors./Saikat Pyne, a city-based marathon enthusiast, has stopped his training for nearly two weeks now because of the increasing pollution levels. ""The visibility is poor when I wake up at 5am these days, so I just go back to sleep,"" he said. And, whenever he does step out for short er sprints, he finds himself gasping for breath. ""There is irritation at the back of my throat and the nose. Sometimes the eyes also get red and itchy. And, of course, the performance goes down,"" he said./Walking on a treadmill in an air-conditioned gym or doing yoga indoors reduce the exposure to air pollution and provide the health benefits, the experts said./The air quality is considered to be poor between 201 and 300, very poor between 301 and 400, and severe between 401 and 500, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar)./""We all know that exercise is good for us - it is good for the heart and keeps illnesses like diabetes and hypertension at bay. However, the pollution levels in Delhi are so high that normal breathing can be bad, add to that the increased inhalation during high-intensity exercise and it is likely to be catastrophic,"" said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant of internal medicine at Moolchand Medicity. ""And, if people have to, it is better to do so in the noon, when the atmosphere is warmer meaning the pollutants and the smog would be higher up,"" said Dr Sharma./A 2016 study published in Preventive Medicine suggested that the benefits from active travel (cycling or walking) generally outweigh the health risks from air pollution and therefore should be encouraged./But, the study also put in a word of caution, stating that the benefits outweighed only when the background air pollution concentrations of PM 2.5 are below 80 micro g/m3, a concentration exceeded in only 2% of cities of the World./And, Delhi is one of them. For Delhi, the tipping point for cycling and walking - where benefits outweigh the risks - were 30 minutes and 45 minutes daily when the PM 2.5 levels were 153 micro g/m3./""In a city like Delhi, where the air pollution levels are continuously higher than the norms and than in the West throughout the year, people should definitely exercise.

"Delhi enveloped in smog as wind blows in smoke from farm fires in Punjab, Haryana","India, Nov. 6 -- The air quality deteriorated sharply as a change in wind pattern swept in smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana on Monday, shrouding the national capital region (NCR) in a thick haze made of tiny particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause health problems./Levels of PM2.5 shot up nearly five times in 24 hours - a phenomenon that officials said was not recorded in the three years since hourly monitoring began for the region. Sunday was the best November day since 2015./Scientists from government agencies said they expected pollution to increase but were taken aback by how fast it happened. ""The prediction was that air quality could deteriorate to 'very poor' levels. We have not encountered such an overnight spike in the last three years at least,"" said an official of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./The average Air Quality Index (AQI) value shot up from 171 on Sunday to 426 on Monday, settling in the 'severe' category, which is the second worst of five classifications of pollution./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), at least 33% of the pollutants originated from fires in farms in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers set fire to crop residue ahead of the next round of sowing later this month./Satellite images from the United States's National Aeronautical Space Agency (Nasa) showed that between Friday and Sunday, at least 5,000 instances of crop burning were seen in Punjab./A farmer leader said fields are still to be cleared and there will likely be more instances between Tuesday and Saturday, a period that is also likely to be affected by pollution from Diwali celebrations./Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) general secretary in Punjab, Harinder Singh Lakhowal, said the problem was that many farmers could not afford to use machinery that could clear crop residue. ""Those who can afford the additional diesel costs during the use of machinery are not burning stubble. Rest of the farmers are helpless,"" he said./But till now, he added, only about 30% of crop residue has been cleared through burning./Adding to the problem are the atmospheric conditions - high moisture content, calm winds near the surface and strong currents in the upper atmosphere that are bringing the farm fire pollutants it. ""It is almost as if there is a rain of particulate matter, which is being brought in by the upper air currents and being trapped in the moist, still surface air,"" a Delhi environment department official said, asking not to be named since he was not authorised to speak to the media./According to forecasts, the air pollution might relent to 'very poor' category - when AQI is between 300 and 400 - on Tuesday before it starts climbing back up again from Wednesday./Experts said that at this point, it was crucial that officials in NCR made sure that restrictions in place to curb local emissions were being followed.

Even half of crackers burnt in 2017 may cause severe pollution: Safar,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 6 -- Delhi could be engulfed by a thick layer of smoke and pollution could breach the severe level if citizens burn even 50% of the crackers that were burnt last year, the Union government's pollution forecasting agency warned on Monday./What is worse is that such severe pollution levels would linger over the next two days at least, it said./""Even if 50% of the total load of toxic firecrackers as compared to Diwali 2017 is added, the prevailing weather conditions will aggravate the smoke and cause persistent 'severe' air pollution for at least two days after Diwali,"" said a statement issued by Safar, the pollution forecasting wing of Union earth sciences ministry./The Supreme Court had banned the sale and use of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. The apex court had ordered that only green crackers would be allowed in the NCR. No such green crackers are, however, available in the market till date./Delhi witnessed its worst smog in 17 years in the post-Diwali period in 2016./In 2017, even though there was a ban on sale of crackers and less crackers were bursted, Delhi witnessed a very poor air quality the following day./""Delhi would witness highest pollution levels on intervening night of November 7 (Diwali) and November 8 (post-Diwali day) between 11am and 3am. The levels of particulate matter and toxic gases would shoot up if 50% of the crackers as compared to 2017 are bursted. It would improve only after November 10,"" the Safar statement said./Scientists of the forecasting agency said because of stubble burning and adverse wind conditions the share of PM2.5 - ultrafine particles which are 30 times finer than a human hair and can reach your lungs - already increased by nearly 20% in Delhi's air. If crackers are bursted the share of these more harmful particles could shoot up to 70% on the day after Diwali./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi goes up in smog after sharp AQI spike,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 6 -- The air quality deteriorated sharply as a change in wind pattern swept in smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana on Monday, shrouding the national capital region (NCR) in a thick haze made of tiny particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause health problems./Levels of PM2.5 shot up nearly five times in 24 hours - a phenomenon that officials said was not recorded in the three years since hourly monitoring began for the region.

"LIGHTS, DIYAS, ACTION","Mumbai, Nov. 7 -- Diwali is all about lights, diyas, sweets, crackers, and getting together with the family to celebrate this joyous festival. Most TV celebs are in favour of an eco-friendly Diwali, and many support the Supreme Court's decision of using ""green and improved"" crackers and a time window to burst them. We spoke to some stars from the small screen about their Diwali plans, memories of the festival and more./BARKHA SENGUPTA/This year, I've decided to not burst crackers. I will only light a few sparklers to bring in the festivities. I totally support the Supreme Court's decision on limiting the bursting of fireworks. This should have been done much earlier. It will help in stopping the already polluted environment from being exposed to more noise and air pollution. This year, like always, we plan to celebrate Diwali at home with our families. We will do the Laxmi puja, make rangolis, and cook food at home. I remember as a kid, I would wait for my dad to finish the puja so that we could eat the savouries made by my mum./SHRENU PARIKH/I have always been scared of crackers, and all my life I've wondered why we can't just light sparklers and celebrate Diwali? As I grew up, I found out that animals, too, get scared of firecrackers. I may be shooting on Diwali and I plan to take some Gujarati snacks on set. The day after Diwali is start of the New Year for Gujaratis, so it's auspicious to work and that's why I plan to shoot on that day too. I remember going to my uncle's place to celebrate Diwali, meeting family and friends, hanging out, munching on various snacks, dressing up, taking blessings and visiting temples. That is Diwali for me./DRASHTI DHAMI/It is important to celebrate an eco-friendly Diwali. The amount of smoke and pollution in our environment is increasing everyday, so the Supreme Court's decision of green firecrackers is a good idea. I would prefer if people didn't burst crackers at all. This year, I will celebrate choti Diwali with my family and Diwali with my in-laws and family. We have hired a villa. Our relatives will come there and we will all enjoy the day. Later, we will do puja at home and go to meet Neeraj's (Khemka, husband) grandmother./VIVIAN DSENA/I am a desi person and buy paper lanterns and earthern diyas. I won't be burning any crackers either. Diwali means family time and eating a lot of home-made food. My mum and aunt are fabulous cooks. I like eating dal baati churma and gujiyas during this festive season. In my home town Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, Diwali is always beautiful as you meet relatives and friends, and feel their warmth and love. In a city like Mumbai, the vibes are different. Here too, I meet and greet people but ideally the feeling in Ujjain is incomparable./RAVI DUBEY/Instead of polluting the environment, there are other ways of celebrating Diwali. I would love to see a firecracker-free Diwali this year, as it will not be harmful to people and animals. I stopped bursting crackers at the age of 14 and I urge people to stop too. The idea of Diwali was to eat good food and spend quality time with family and friends, but eventually it became all about the fireworks. This year, since my brother has had a baby, we will go to Delhi and celebrate with our family. Diwali is the most beautiful time of the year. During schooldays, I would look forward to Diwali vacations, even though my dad would insist that we study during the holidays, which never happened./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Entry of trucks in Delhi banned between Nov 8-10 to curb pollution,"India, Nov. 7 -- The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Tuesday issued directions to the Delhi government to ban entry of trucks in the capital post-Diwali between November 8 and 10. It has also asked the government to appeal to commuters to not use diesel-run cars during this period./There will be a complete ban on entry of trucks in city limits during this period except for those carrying essential commodities, according to EPCA's letter to the Delhi government./The directions were issued as emergency measures, as central government's pollution monitoring agencies have predicted that Delhi's air quality is likely to deteriorate sharply after Diwali. The forecast has said adverse weather conditions and crop stubble burning in neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana are likely to hit Delhi's air quality over the next few days./""We have sent a letter to Delhi government to issue a public notice regarding the emergency measures to be taken as directed during the post-Diwali period. Delhi-NCR could see a sharp deterioration in air quality on account of winds from northwest direction bringing pollutants from crop stubble burning and low dispersion because of wind speed remaining almost zero,"" said Bhure Lal, chairperson, EPCA./Under the SC-enforced Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), drastic measures such as the ban on entry of trucks, odd-even road rationing scheme and shutting of schools are enforced when the 'severe plus' level of pollution persists for 48 hours. The 'severe plus' levels is an emergency situation when the Air Quality Index (AQI) breaches 500, the highest value on the scale or when particulate matter - PM2.5 and PM10 - crosses the value of 300 and 500 microgrammes per cubic metre./On November 5, PM2.5 levels in the city entered 'severe plus' category for a few hours in the morning after which EPCA had asked the city government to ""intensify"" enforcement of all Grap measures./This is the second time that a ban has been enforced on the entry of trucks in Delhi. The first instance of ban on entry of truck was in 2017 during the second week of November after pollution levels had plunged to 'severe plus' category./EPCA on Tuesday also directed governments of neighbouring Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to stop the entry of trucks coming into Delhi. ""The state governments.. are requested to direct all authorities, particularly the police to coordinate action on this so that trucks are turned around before entry into Delhi. Also, the governments are requested to issue public notices appealing to people to not use diesel cars,"" the letter stated./According to government data, over 80,000 trucks enter city limit every day. Diesel emissions are extremely toxic and add to the severity of air pollution./Also, post-Diwali, the air quality is likely to worsen because of bad weather conditions. If fire crackers are burst despite a Supreme Court ban, then it would deteriorate further, central government's pollution monitoring agencies have predicted./The directions were issue after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)-led taskforce suggested these measures based on the air quality forecast during this period. The directions will be reviewed after November 10./""The predominant wind direction is likely to remain north-westerly from November 7 to November 8 with calm winds. Also, shallow fog and haze during daytime is expected, which can further lead to rise in pollution levels,"" said, a CPCB official, not wishing to be named./CPCB mulls artificial rain/CPCB officials said the agency is looking into the option of inducing artificial rain in the capital after Diwali in order to wash away pollutants. However, officials, said, it could only be done once meteorological conditions are stable and cloud seeding could be done./According to CPCB officials, they may consider it as an option to clear the air and are in talks with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur and the India Meteorological Department (IMD)./In 2016, when pollution levels had reached alarming levels, the government had proposed cloud seeding but the plan could not take off. The government had also proposed sprinkling water from helicopter to reduce dust./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Diwali's here, but Maharashtra pollution board fails to declare chemical analysis results of firecrackers","Mumbai, Nov. 7 -- After assuring it would follow through on a ban on heavily polluting firecrackers, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has failed to declare the results of its chemical analysis of firecrackers for the fourth consecutive year./With the latest Supreme Court (SC) order restricting the use of firecrackers to two hours, identifying harmful ones could help reduce air pollution and allow children and parents decide on buying less polluting firecrackers, said activists./On November 2, HT had reported that a chemical analysis and heavy-metal test for different firecrackers available for sale this Diwali found the presence of hazardous metals or metal oxides, which are unsafe for human health. Of the 36 crackers tested, lead was detected in 14. The use of lead was banned by SC last year./MPCB officials had refrained from commenting about the study, stating that there was no authenticity of the private laboratory where the chemical test was carried out./In a response, VM Motghare, joint director, air quality, MPCB, said a detailed report of their own analysis would be released on Monday, and based on the results they would send their recommendations to the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) to ban polluting crackers./""The analysis is still underway and has not been completed,"" Motghare told HT on Tuesday. ""There were some issues with the instruments and the results will take some time. However, real-time air quality and noise monitoring will be done for the entire Diwali period.""/Last year, MPCB issued a similar statement after failing to publish results./An officer from MPCB, on the condition of anonymity, said senior officers and scientists responsible for the chemical analysis were on leave. ""The results will not be declared before next Monday,"" he said./On October 23, the apex court passed an order directing all states to use 'green' firecrackers for a stipulated time frame of two hours. On Wednesday, the apex court modified its order by allowing all states, except the National Capital Region, to use its existing stock of firecrackers this Diwali but the two-hour time limit persisted. Meanwhile, anti-pollution activists said in light of the recent SC order and Awaaz Foundation's report on the presence of hazardous chemicals in crackers, it was imperative that MPCB released its findings./""I have appealed to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to look into this matter personally and to ensure no toxic crackers, which could adversely affect the health of millions of residents of Mumbai and Maharashtra are available for sale,"" said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation./""We supplied firecrackers to MPCB to analyse chemical content for the fourth year in a row, but we are unaware of the results of any of the tests.""/Adhering to SC guidelines, the state home department on Tuesday said the time period for bursting crackers across the state on Wednesday will be between 8pm and 10pm. Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary (home), said the time frame would be the same for the entire state as none of the districts raised any objections./SETTING THE LIMIT: BETWEEN 8PM AND 10PM/The Mumbai police said the two-hour time period for bursting firecrackers on Wednesday is between 8pm and 10pm, according to Supreme Court guidelines./""There is no separate two-hour time frame for the city. It is as mentioned by SC. We have instructed police stations across all zones to keep a watch in their respective areas.

"Stop polluting air, switch to eco-friendly options: BMC to bakery with wood ovens","India, Nov. 8 -- A bakery in Girgaum which used charcoal and wood in its ovens has been asked by the municipal corporation to switch to less polluting fuels after a resident complained of air pollution./Hemant Sukhathankar, 62, who lives next to Fernandes bakery at Bhalero Marg in Gaiwadi, said he had to undergo lung function tests and was briefly hospitalised because of the smoke from the bakery ovens./Sukhathankar had to undergo several exchanges with various central and state agencies for three years, before the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a show cause notice to the bakery last week. ""The bakery has violated air pollution norms and has to shift to cleaner fuel or an eco-friendly oven and install scrubbers that will absorb excess dust and carbon emissions. They need to comply with these directions or face closure,"" said VP Mote, assistant municipal commissioner, D ward, BMC. ""A compliance inspection of the bakery has been scheduled for next week.""/While bakeries in the city are not prohibited from using wood and charcoal, they have to install pollution amelioration measures like scrubbers in exhaust systems./The bakery owners said they had reduced the number of working days to thrice a week, and had installed electric ovens. They said they were using the wood and charcoal ovens less frequently. The bakery owners also said they have installed scrubbers in the air exhaust system. ""BMC directions have been complied with and we have informed the civic body. There is no pollution issue now,"" said Girender Singh, one of the owners of the bakery. Bakeries are third largest source (16%) of particulate matter (PM10) - small pollutant particles that can easily enter the respiratory system causing health ailments - in Mumbai. Landfilling open burning (30%) and construction activities (23%) are two top sources of PM10, according to the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)./After complaints to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) fell on deaf ears for the past three years, Sukhathankar wrote to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in August. ""It was originally MPCB that had given permission to this bakery despite complaints. The agency never understood the gravity of the situation. It is my constitutional right to breathe clean air, which has been denied for half a decade now,"" Sukhathankar said./In August, the PMO forwarded the complaint to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which asked the MPCB to take immediate action. HT has a copy of all the letters sent by central and state government agencies./Finally, the MPCB on September 9 directed the BMC to ensure that environment-friendly measures were taken, and dust suppression mechanisms were installed by the bakery. ""According to the state environment department laws, such issues need to be handled by the BMC. The bakery needs to use natural gas or electric furnaces immediately. We are overseeing this implementation,"" said J Sangerwar, regional officer, MPCB./HT had first reported about this issue in May 2015 when the MPCB had asked the BMC to act against the bakery. However, the pollution problem could not be reduced then./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Cities across India defy new cracker code set by top court,"India, Nov. 9 -- Most cities across the country failed to enforce the Supreme Court order to burst firecrackers only within a two-hour window with police action against violators not serving as a deterrent, reading to a smoky and noisy Diwali night, according to ground reports and multiple government officials./The top court's order set 8pm to 10pm as the stipulated time for firecrackers in most states, while Tamil Nadu and Puducherry allowed the crackers to be used from 4am to 5am and 9pm to 10pm in keeping with how the two places celebrate Diwali./A check by HT across cities, however, showed that firecrackers were used well beyond the window despite fines being imposed in some cities and arrests made in some others./On Thursday, monitoring agencies said air pollution levels doubled in Kolkata, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Agra, Hyderabad and Chennai, primarily due to the use of crackers./For north Indian cities, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s air quality index (AQI) bulletin on Thursday showed that Patna, Lucknow, Bulandshahr, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad were in 'severe' category with the readings going past 400./The air at these 'very poor' (AQI 301-400) and 'severe' (AQI 401-500) levels becomes hard to breathe even for healthy people./""The administration has failed to enforce the court's guidelines. About 1-2% people put paid to all the efforts,"" said Kolkata-based green activist Subhas Dutta, who added that an intense awareness campaign was needed to make people cautious of the hazards of firecracker smoke./In Bhubaneswar, where 127 were fined for violating the SC order, the police admitted it was difficult to monitoring firecracker bursting. ""But compared to previous years, there were lesser number of firecrackers shops open, and people mostly burst crackers between 8pm and 10pm,"" said the city's deputy commissioner of police Anup Sahoo./In Assam, police enforced prohibitory orders in Guwahati, but firecrackers could be heard well past midnight across the state.

Cities across India defy new cracker code set by top court,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 9 -- Most cities across the country failed to enforce the Supreme Court order to burst firecrackers only within a twohour window with police action against violators not serving as a deterrent, leading to a smoky and noisy Diwali night, according to ground reports and multiple government officials./The top court's order set 8pm to 10pm as the stipulated time for firecrackers in most states, while Tamil Nadu and Puducherry allowed the crackers to be used from 4am to 5am and 9pm to 10pm in keeping with how the two places celebrate Diwali./A check by HT across cities, however, showed that firecrackers were used well beyond the window despite fines being imposed in some cities and arrests made in some others./On Thursday, monitoring agencies said air pollution levels doubled in Kolkata, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Agra, Hyderabad and Chennai, primarily due to the use of crackers./For north Indian cities, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s air quality index (AQI) bulletin on Thursday showed that Patna, Lucknow, Bulandshahr, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad were in 'severe' category with the readings going past 400./The air at these 'very poor' (AQI 301-400) and 'severe' (AQI 401-500) levels becomes hard to breathe even for healthy people./""The administration has failed to enforce the court's guidelines. About 1-2% people put paid to all the efforts,"" said Kolkata-based green activist Subhas Dutta, who added that an intense awareness campaign was needed to make people cautious of the hazards of firecracker smoke./In Bhubaneswar, where 127 were fined for violating the SC order, the police admitted it was difficult to monitoring fire- cracker bursting. ""But compared to previous years, there were lesser number of firecrackers shops open, and people mostly burst crackers between 8pm and 10pm,"" said the city's deputy commissioner of police Anup Sahoo./In Assam, police enforced prohibitory orders in Guwahati, but firecrackers could be heard well past midnight across the state.

Beat air pollution!,"India, Nov. 10 -- Air pollution, as we all know, is on the rise in many cities in India right now. It affects the lungs and causes inflammation leading to allergy, asthma and many other breathing-related problems./Here are some home remedies to protect one's health from it's harmful effects:/Jaggery:This is an age-old and popular remedy for lung protection. In olden times, gur or jaggery was given as a daily ration to the coal mine workers to protect them from the coal mine pollution. So, consuming five to 10 grams of jaggery daily with hot water helps detoxify the lungs./Trikatu: An Ayurvedic preparation, this has long pepper (pippali), black pepper (kali mirch) and ginger. This unique combination of herbs can cut through chronic toxin and mucous problems. Take a pinch of trikatu powder and add to hot water. Stir this mix and add a teaspoon of honey or jaggery. This decoction is to be sipped slowly. Take this twice a day during the winter months./Tulsi: One of the most effective ways to use tulsi is by preparing a concoction of its leaves during winters for detoxifying. To do so, boil tulsi leaves in water, and add a pinch of jaggery and saunf. For best results, consume this twice daily./Chawanprash:Consuming chawanprash loaded with Vitamin C boosts immunity and fights diseases caused by air pollution./Hydration: Keeping the body well hydrated is very important to help remove toxins from the lungs by improving circulation and assisting in the process of removal of particles from the lungs./Turmeric: Not only does it help reduce inflammation caused due to viral and bacterial infections, but it also helps keep the allergic tendency of the respiratory system in check. For best results, the turmeric should be organic./Garlic and onion: Both these pungent vegetables, due to the presence of sulphur-like compounds, help reduce the bacterial and viral load in the bronchioles and digestive tract when they are consumed. This helps to prevent infection even if the bronchioles get inflamed due to allergy./From HT Brunch, November 11, 2018/Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch/Connect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Resident group decides to take up waste elimination at Kalyan dump yard,"KALYAN, Nov. 10 -- Residents living near Adharwadi dumping ground in Kalyan have had enough./Their long-pending demand to close the landfill, where a major fire caused severe air pollution two years ago, has repeatedly fallen on deaf ears of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC)./Fed up of this, a citizens' initiative, Jagruk Nagrik, has taken up the responsibility to clear the mountains of garbage - first by segregating dry waste from wet and then decomposing it using a special solution./Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of Jagruk Nagrik , has been trying to get the civic body to use a liquid solution - made of cow dung bacteria, jaggery and water - to spray on the wet waste so that it can decompose rapidly./He said this was a method he learnt from the National Centre of Organic Farming in Ghaziabad, from where he procures the bacteria in the form of a paste for just Rs.20./Though the KDMC has expressed interest in the method, Ghanekar said the citizens' group has to self-fund its project for now./""We have waited long for the civic body to come forward. We will spend from our pockets for the work. The work includes segregation of waste in the first phase. Followed by this, the decomposition work will begin,"" Ghanekar said./To help with the first phase, the group has employed around 10 to 12 women who live in the slums nearby to segregate the waste at Adharwadi./Ghanekar said they have obtained permission from KDMC to do so./He said spraying the solution on the wet waste at Adharwadi can reduce it by a third within 40 days./Currently, almost 75-70% of the trash dumped at the ground is wet waste. According to KDMC, 550 metric tonnes of unsegregated waste is dumped at Adharwadi dumping ground every day./Priyanka Gavili, a member of Jagruk Nagrik who supervises the waste segregation work at the dumping ground, said the women help them by removing plastic and keeping them out to dry./""We have managed to clear three to four feet of waste this week,"" she said./The other hazard that frequently plagues Adharwadi dumping ground is fire. The last blaze at the dump yard happened on April 19 this year. A month before that, a major fire broke out across the 15-acre plot and released hazardous smoke, causing suffocation among residents nearby./People took to the streets demanding KDMC close the Adharwadi landfill./Ghanekar, who was one of them, wrote to the KDMC?commissioner, Govind Bodke, about his residential society's 'zero garbage' project that helps decompose wet waste quickly using the liquid solution./Bodke, who visited to take stock of the method, gave the go-ahead for Ghanekar and his group to implement it at Adharwadi as a pilot project./A KDMC official, on the condition of anonymity, reasoned why the civic body could not undertake it./""We have already initiated a bioremediation project at the dumping ground. The project will also segregate the waste and help clear the dumping ground. The suggestions from residents could not be initiated as we did not have people for the work,"" he said./Ghanekar is still hopeful./""Once the segregation is over, we will spray the solution over some portions [of the waste] and wait. After we are sure the method is working, we will continue until the entire mountain of waste is cleared,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Thane saw cracker-free Diwali but air quality remained poor,"Thane, Nov. 11 -- Though Thane residents celebrated a quieter Diwali this year, there was no relief in air pollution./The Air Pollution Index for the city this year was more than 90%./""The Air Pollution Index is over 90 percent more than the normal limit of 25 %. The API index at Teen Hath Naka was 127 % followed by 111 % at Kopri. This indicates that the air is extremely polluted and not fit for breathing,"" said an official from Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC)./While most residents adhered to the Supreme Court directives on time restriction, bursting of smoke emitting crackers increased this year, leading to increase in air pollution levels./A TMC official said, ""As per the data of our real-time weather monitoring system, the air pollution levels were the highest during the three days of Diwali from November 7 to November 9. The pollution levels were the highest around 9pm. The data was collected from four spots - Teen Hath Naka, Naupada ward office, Kopri ward office and Raptacos Brett and Company in Vartak Nagar.""/The level of repairable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) is 226, lower than last year's 311./The official said, ""The permissible RSPM limit is ug/mg3. The RSPM increases to two-fold during Diwali as compared to normal days. The suspended particles were the highest at Kopri at 218 ug/m3 followed by 216 ug/mg3 at Teen Hath Naka.""/The suspended particles cause allergies, asthama and respiratory ailments. Fancy crackers do not emit sound but the smoke leads to air pollution./Thane-based environmentalist Vidhyadhar Walavalkar said, ""The air pollution levels were less on the first day of Diwali on November 6. However, the levels increased on the day of Laxmi puja. Residents refrained from bursting crackers, but there was lot of crackers burst in commercial areas such as markets Naupada and Kopri.""/Walavalkar said there was a positive change seen this year as most housing societies did not burst crackers. ""This should continue every year. It is necessary to educate people on the impact of firecrackers on our air quality,"" he added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The answer lies in better inspection of vehicles,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 12 -- Ninety percent of the world's population breathes polluted air. Seven million people die due to air pollution every year and most of these deaths occur in developing countries. India has 14 of the 15 most polluted cities in the world. As winter sets in, the national capital gets blanketed by severely polluted air every year. While there are multiple sources including biomass burning, industries, power plants and agriculture residue burning that are responsible for the deteriorating air quality, the transport sector is among the biggest contributors to air pollution./With a 28% share in Delhi's particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration during winters, the transport sector also provides a huge scope to introduce targeted interventions to curb air pollution. Studies have shown that around 60% of vehicular air pollution in India can be attributed to 20% of vehicles, the ones that are poorly-maintained or, simply, old. In the absence of an effectiveinspectionandmaintenance(I&#38;M) system, on-road reduction in emissions cannot be ensured even with the introduction of cleaner fuels./The current I&#38;M system in India comprises a mandatory periodic pollution under control (PUC) certification for all types of vehicles, and annual fitness certification for commercial vehicles. Gasoline/ CNG/LPG vehicles are tested for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions and lambda value (the ideal condition needed for effective functioning of catalytic converters), and diesel vehicles are tested for Hartridge Smoke Unit (HSU) which is used as a proxy for particle measurement. With the advancement in emission norms, new engines emit less particulate matter compared to older ones. This calls for newer technologies for accurate measurement. Moreover, in the current I&#38;M system, gasoline/LPG/CNG vehicles are tested on idle speed testing mode and diesel vehicles are tested on free acceleration mode (FAS). These modes do not represent real world driving cycles and mass emissions released during real conditions. Despite the provision of heavy penalties, in 2014, merely 21% of vehicles appeared for PUC testing. This low appearance rate indicates that the I&#38;M system only captures a small proportion of in-use vehicles, and most of the vehicles are running without PUC, possibly with higher emissions than prescribed standards. Moreover, the vehicles that appear for testing do not ensure compliance with the prescribed norms due to manual interference./A few recommendations to improve the current I&#38;M system in the country. First, the HSU-based testing of diesel vehicles can be replaced with improved laser light scattering photometry for accurate measurement. Second, the PUC standards for different parameters should be tightened and annual audits and verification of existing PUC centres conducted to phase out the noncompliant ones. Third, the on-board diagnostic system (OBD) should be made a part of the formal PUC testing in India. The OBD system is mandatory for all diesel vehicles and passenger cars manufactured after April, 2013. It monitors the potential areas in a vehicle which can influence emission. A false code is generated and stored in the OBD in case of malfunctioning of any component in the vehicle. This information can later be used by PUC centres to check the road worthiness of a vehicle. The standards to assess the OBD data set for desired performance of vehicles need to be developed. The existing PUC centres should be equipped with the capacity to collect and analyse OBD data sets. Finally, the vehicles failing the OBD testing should be sent to the advanced centres, such as those in Nasik and Manesar, where they can be tested for road worthiness. The vehicles in these centres are tested for PUC along with other safety parameters such as brakes, headlight and speed etc./To summarise, the cities in India require three kinds of testing centres./i) Traditional centres for vehicles without OBD; ii) Centres for vehicles fitted with OBD; and iii) Advanced centres for vehicles that fail the OBD test./A targeted intervention in the form of improved inspection and maintenance system for in-use vehicles will not only curb emission but also enhance and maintain air quality throughout the year./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mahrashtra Pollution Control Board's real-time data for pollution goes live,"Mumbai, Nov. 12 -- After a delay of more than six months and following criticism from anti-air pollution activists, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's (MPCB) real-time air quality monitoring system for the city went live on its website on Saturday./Air quality information from 13 stations - Vile Parle, Kandivli, Sion, Kurla, Borivli, Worli, Mulund, Powai, Colaba, Nerul, Kalyan, Vasai-Virar, and Mahape - is available with real-time updates on pollutants such as particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, etc. However, information from stations at Santacruz and Dombivli is yet to go live./The stations were proposed in 2017 and the data was expected to be made public from April 2018. The stations were inaugurated in June. Despite MPCB's claim that data would be available within 15 days of the inauguration, it took the state pollution control body four more months. ""Citizens will now have official and reliable air quality information of areas across Mumbai. Monthly and annual averages of this data will be submitted to the state and central agencies for final tabulation and declaration of ambient air quality reports for Mumbai,"" said E Ravendiran, member secretary, MPCB. He added the process took some time owing to some ""technical issues"", but information for the two additional stations will be uploaded soon. He also said MPCB intends to add more 24-hour online monitoring stations across Maharashtra. ""In a couple of months, work will start on developing a robust network for the state, along with an action plan for major cities.""/MPCB's move comes after criticism from activists. ""At a time when it should be addressing issues related to pollution sources and developing action plans, the MPCB is still completing the basic process of monitoring. There has to be more urgency,"" said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India. Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti, said the fact that Mumbai is classified as one of the most polluted megacities is because of MPCB's negligence./A 2017 study by the Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering (CESE), IIT-B, found Mumbaiites were most worried about air pollution as treating diseases caused by it costs a family of four in Mumbai Rs.1.68 lakh, or Rs.42,000 for every person, annually. As per data collated by Greenpeace India from 2015 and 2016, Maharashtra has 25 cities that witness air pollution above the permissible annual levels for PM10. Seventeen of them are non-attainment areas - where the air quality is worse than the standard set - by the Central Pollution Control Board in 2016./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Ban on crackers may not save Delhi, bursting them certainly kills it faster","India, Nov. 12 -- Bending rules is the rule of the game for most Delhi residents. This Diwali, they demonstrated that they could even turn suicidal in that pursuit./This year, the Supreme Court banned the sale and use of conventional firecrackers in the National Capital Region for a good reason. Fuelled by gunpowder, firecrackers are the worst possible cocktail of toxins. Since Delhi's deteriorating air quality was already making headlines and trending on social media, one imagined that for once, citizens of Delhi would see sense in not poisoning the foul air further in their already choking city this Diwali./However, a few hours into the celebration, the ban went up in smoke. Most people across the city, overcome by a strange self-destructive urge, found various ways to procure firecrackers illegally and burst them with abandon. Some people even wore pollution masks while bursting crackers, for good measure. Unsurprisingly, pollution levels on Diwali night were worse than last year's. Delhi has since been draped in unrelenting smog./For a long time, many of us have played down health risks by justifying Diwali as a once-a-year celebration. But toxic fumes from the city's massive fleet of private vehicles, unchecked garbage burning, dust from construction sites and stubble burning in neighbouring states are already filling up our lungs. Diwali firecrackers could well be the proverbial last straw that breaks the camel's back./Multiple studies have shown that foul air is compromising the lung capacity of children in Delhi. The latest one, released by the World Health Organisation last month and well publicised by the media, stated that in 2016, India recorded the highest number of air pollution-induced deaths of children below five years. Yet, on Diwali night, many people burst crackers because their ""children liked them""./It is easy to blame enforcement agencies. However, Delhi Police did arrest as many as 310 persons for bursting crackers on the Diwali night. However, why do we need the police to stop us from damaging our lungs?/The argument that bursting firecrackers on the Diwali night is a tradition we must continue does not cut much ice. In fact, Diwali has traditionally been the festival of light. Fireworks, in any case, are a borrowed fad we seemed to have rapidly internalised. Gunpowder and fireworks were invented in China more than a thousand years ago. The Chinese believe that the loud sound from firecrackers drives away evil spirits, and burning them during the Lunar New Year is an age-old Chinese tradition. But that has not come in the way of even the proud inventor restricting their use to fight air pollution./Unlike India, where such decisions have been left to the judiciary, it is the government that has banned fireworks in more than 400 Chinese cities and towns. Last December, the Beijing legislature prohibited fireworks within the fifth ring road and allowed them to be lit only in designated suburbs and at specific times./""The low-key celebrations (during the Lunar New Year) were in stark contrast to previous years when the streets were crammed with Beijingers setting off firecrackers and the sky was lit by near-constant firework displays, unleashing a deafening thunder until dawn"", the PTI reported from the Chinese capital in February this year./A ban on fireworks is not easy on local businesses. In China, the largest manufacturer of fireworks in the world, a ban on crackers has forced many factories to shut shop. In India, however, government scientists have prepared prototypes for green crackers, which promise up to 40% reduction in emission. After getting the mandatory license from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, the technology should be available to manufacturers for large-scale production./The switch is not going to be easy. Barring a few big manufacturers, much of the fireworks industry in India is small-scale. Technology transfers, investment in new types of raw material and equipment, training workers as well as monitoring staff will be a big challenge. To clear their inventories, sellers will continue to push old stocks in the market, perhaps even next Diwali./In the end though, it is the demand that will push production. Unless citizens themselves commit to a cleaner, healthier Diwali, no ban on crackers or switching over to greener versions will ever be successful. Foregoing fireworks on Diwali and other occasions will not end Delhi's air pollution. But bursting them will invariably make it much worse, every time. Delhi has to have a stubborn death wish to risk it for a lark./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi has since been draped in unrelenting smog./For a long time, many of us have played down health risks by justifying Diwali as a once-ayear celebration. But toxic fumes from the city's massive fleet of private vehicles, unchecked garbage burning, dust from construction sites and stubble burning in neighbouring states are already filling up our lungs. Diwali firecrackers could well be the proverbial last straw that breaks the camel's back./Multiple studies have shown that foul air is compromising the lung capacity of children in Delhi. The latest one, released by the World Health Organisation last month and well publicised by the media, stated that in 2016, India recorded the highest number of air pollution-induced deaths of children below five years. Yet, on Diwali night, many people burst crackers because their ""children liked them""./It is easy to blame enforcement agencies. However, Delhi Police did arrest as many as 310 persons for bursting crackers on the Diwali night./But then, why do we need the police to stop us from damaging our lungs?/The argument that bursting firecrackers on the Diwali night is a tradition we must continue does not cut much ice. In fact, Diwali has traditionally been the festival of light. Fireworks, in any case, are a borrowed fad we seemed to have rapidly internalised. Gunpowder and fireworks were invented in China more than a thousand years ago. The Chinese believe that the loud sound from firecrackers drives away evil spirits, and burning them during the Lunar New Year is an age-old Chinese tradition. But that has not come in the way of even the proud inventor restricting their use to fight air pollution./Unlike India, where such decisions have been left to the judiciary, it is the government that has banned fireworks in more than 400 Chinese cities and towns. Last December, the Beijing legislature prohibited fireworks within the fifth ring road and allowed them to be lit only in designated suburbs and at specific times./""The low-key celebrations (during the Lunar New Year) were in stark contrast to previous years when the streets were crammed with Beijingers setting off firecrackers and the sky was lit by near-constant firework displays, unleashing a deafening thunder until dawn"", the PTI reported from the Chinese capital in February this year./A ban on fireworks is not easy on local businesses. In China, the largest manufacturer of fireworks in the world, a ban on crackers has forced many factories to shut shop. In India, however, government scientists have prepared prototypes for green crackers, which promise up to 40% reduction in emission. After getting the mandatory license from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, the technology should be available to manufacturers for large-scale production./The switch is not going to be easy. Barring a few big manufacturers, much of the fireworks industry in India is small-scale. Technology transfers, investment in new types of raw material and equipment, training workers as well as monitoring staff will be a big challenge. To clear their inventories, sellers will continue to push old stock in the market, perhaps even next Diwali./In the end though, it is the demand that will push production. Unless citizens themselves commit to a cleaner, healthier Diwali, no ban on crackers or switching over to greener versions will ever be successful. Foregoing fireworks on Diwali and other occasions will not end Delhi's air pollution. But bursting them will invariably make it much worse, every time. Delhi has to have a stubborn death wish to risk it for a lark./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Very poor' Gurugram air least polluted among Delhi-NCR,"India, Nov. 12 -- Despite being in the very poor zone, air in Gurugram was least polluted in the National Capital Region for the fourth day in a row on Sunday. Gurugram had an Air Quality Index of 340 on Sunday, down from 363 on Saturday,, despite falling temperatures and low wind speeds. Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida all had 'severe' air with AQI values above the 400 mark./The concentration of PM2.5 in the city air has also reduced considerably since touching its highest ever reading on November 8. On Sunday, PM2.5 in Gurugram was 96ug/m3, according to Central Pollution Control Board data.?However, the daily average measure remained alarming, at 328ug/m3 (more than five times the safe limit of 60ug/m3)./Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, attributed the fall in the concentration of ultrafine particles in the city air to direction of prevailing winds. ""The pollutants are there, it's just that at the moment they are being carried away from the city, towards the capital,"" he said. While the wind speeds are certainly on the lower side, they are making incremental differences each day because of their eastward movement, Singh explained./An air quality expert, Sachin Panwar, concurred with Singh's explanation. ""Air speed in Gurugram these days, while low, is just slightly more than it is in Delhi,"" he said. Moreover, given that the winds are currently blowing eastward, cities lying east of Gurugram, such as Faridabad, Baghpat and Hapur, are all experiencing 'severe' air due to translocation of pollutants from Punjab and Haryana. Satellite images by NASA, dated November 11, also show a thick haze hanging over these cities, which is not present over Gurugram./However, an official from India Meteorological Department said the situation is precarious, and is expected to change in the next week. ""Winds are blowing eastward, but will soon change directions. When that happens, we will observe a reversal in this phenomena, and air pollution in Gurugram will escalate rapidly,"" the official said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Managing waste disposal sites can curb air pollution,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 14 -- In 2016, India revised the Solid Waste Management Rules, banning dumping of mixed waste in low-lying areas and open dumps. Yet, many such waste disposal sites are still operational in Delhi and Mumbai. Such sites are now as high as 50-60m above the ground level, and have also become unstable due to garbage disposal. In October 2017, one side of a Ghazipur waste disposal site, managed by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, collapsed, killing at least two people./However, the stability of the slope is not the only concern in terms of waste disposal sites. These surface fires emit particulate matter, including black carbon or soot, which is a short-term climate pollutant with global warming potential./While dousing such fires is relatively easy, subsurface fires are not. This occurs when biodegradable waste degrades anaerobically and produces landfill gases. The main component of landfill gas- methane - catches fire when it comes in contact with air. It is often challenging to quantify the actual spread of fire in the subsurface./Such fires, whether surface or subsurface, contribute to local air pollution. Waste disposal sites thus also contribute to an increased level of local air pollution and often add to the haze during the winter season. The ambient air quality monitoring around the active waste disposal sites has indicated higher levels of particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO) and methane than the prescribed standards. Apart from these pollutants, emission of traces of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from waste disposal sites is also a concern as even its small concentrations are toxic to humans. As per the TERI study, the landfill fires contribute to 0.4% of air pollution in terms of PM2.5 in winter season in Delhi./The present practice of using fire tenders for dousing waste dumpsite fires not only introduces water into the landfill which later percolates through as leachate, but also washes away good quality soil cover from the top of the slopes thereby exposing the waste./The practical way to deal with dumpsites, which are a source of local air pollution and fire accidents, is to stabilise the slopes. Once these dumps have been stabilised and most of the landfill gas recovered, the dumps can be opened, and their content mined into compostable, combustibles and inerts./The combustibles can be further processed into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and used as a source of energy. This can be done cell by cell on the disposal sites. The emptied cells should be lined and converted into sanitary landfills so that scientific disposal of residues of waste processing can be initiated, in compliance with the waste management rules of 2016./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air quality 'very poor', may worsen further on Tuesday","NEW DELHI, Nov. 19 -- Air quality in the national Capital plunged to 'very poor' category on Sunday after remaining 'poor' for three consecutive days. The deterioration in air quality has been attributed to slow surface winds and increase in moisture.

"Items of everyday use could push up indoor pollution, say studies","India, Nov. 20 -- Items of everyday use - room fresheners, deodorants, mosquito coil, incense sticks, wall-to-wall carpets and office printers and photocopy machines - could be pushing up indoor pollution levels at homes and offices, which could be as bad as the polluted air outside or even worse, at least two recent studies in Delhi have shown./Both studies found the concentration of volatile organic compounds and PM2.5 - ultrafine particles that reach up to the lungs - are higher than the permissible limits even inside closed rooms in residences, corporate and government offices and multiplexes./The concentration of bio-aerosols, which comprise disease-causing agents such as bacteria and virus among others, have been found to be at least 20 times higher in corporate offices and four times higher in multiplexes./While one study was conducted by a team of researchers from the CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) in their own offices, another study was done by the Indian Pollution Control Association (IPCA), a Delhi-based research organisation in 13 buildings across Delhi, including corporate offices, a multiplex, government buildings and residences./The CRRI study was published in Current Science journal on November 10 with data of 2014 summer. The IPCA study was conducted between January and September 2018./""The concentrations of PM1, PM2.5 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were found to be higher inside than outside. While concentrations of PM1 and PM2.5 were nearly double in indoor air than outdoor, the concentration of VOCs was even higher. VOCs accumulate more when air conditioners are used because the ventilation is less,"" said Manisha Gaur, one of the authors of the study and a research scholar at CRRI./Experts said that while any form of combustion such as smoking, or burning an incense stick or mosquito coil, could push up levels of finer particulate matters, the concentration of VOCs shoot up because of use of room fresheners, deodorants, paints, polishing and cleaning agents./""The concentration of VOCs was particularly found to be nearly two times higher than the safe limits prescribed by the World Health Organisation inside corporate offices and hospitals. It was also very high in the indoor air inside multiplexes. In residences, the level of PM2.5 was found to be 137ug/m3, which is more than two times above the safe limits of 60ug/m3,"" said Radhan Goyal, deputy director of IPCA./The IPCA study found that another pollutant, known as bio-aerosols, was much higher than the permissible limits. It was at least 20 times higher in corporate offices and four times higher in multiplexes. Bio-aerosols comprise airborne bacteria, fungi, viruses and their by-products, endotoxins and mycotoxins./""Indoor air pollution is particularly higher because of improper ventilation. In more than 90% of the air-conditioned buildings, it is the stale indoor air which is circulated instead of allowing fresh outside air to come in, as it requires consumption of more energy. Outside pollution also gushes in through leakages in door and windows because of difference in air pressure. The pollution tends to be higher towards the corners of the room. Secondly wall-to-wall carpets are known to be sinks of bio-aerosols,"" said Mukesh Khare, Mukesh Khare, a professor of environmental engineering at IIT-Delhi/Experts said that these studies are in tune with several other studies carried out across the world and also by the Central Pollution Control Board./""Indoor pollution often tends to be higher because of poor ventilation, cooler temperature and indoor activities, which include smoking and burning of coils and incense sticks. VOCs, many of which are carcinogenic, tend to move towards cooler temperatures. The wind inside a room is also stagnant compared to outdoor. Hence pollution tends to shoot up,"" said T K Joshi, environmental health advisor to the union environment and forest ministry./He said a previous study done by the CPCB a few years ago had also found that indoor pollution in flats (residences) was higher than outdoor pollution./""It is a myth that indoor air is less polluted that outdoor air and that you are safe whence you enter home or office.

Rural India still uses unsafe biofuel,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 22 -- Households using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as their primary cooking fuel have increased from 14% to 37% since 2015, but LPG continues to be the second fuel for majority of rural households in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, according to a new survey./The Access to Clean Cooking Energy and Electricity - Survey of States (ACCESS 2018) released on Wednesday finds that despite extremely high exposure to indoor air pollution from biomass burning, about 63% rural households continue to use firewood, dung cakes and agricultural residue as the primary fuel for cooking. However, some of them use LPG to supplement their fuel requirements./The number of households using LPG in these six states has increased from 22% to 58% since 2015 when the first ACCESS survey was conducted, but not all of these use LPG as primary fuel. The use of LPG as the exclusive cooking fuel has increased from 5% to 19% of rural households, which means that 81% of the homes surveyed still use biomass for a part of their fuel requirements./The survey of a representative sample size of 9,000 rural households in 756 villages and 54 districts found that the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) launched in May 2016 has been a major driver behind the increase in LPG connections in the six states./Between 2015 and 2018, of all homes that received LPG connections, at least 50% got them under PMUY. The yojana reimburses LPG connection charges (Rs 1,600) for women of below poverty line (BPL) households and oil marketing companies provide an EMI option to cover the cost of the cooking stove and first refill./But the scheme has not converted majority of the population to primary LPG users is because they still find LPG less affordable./""The predominant fuel for majority of the rural population in these states is traditional biomass or firewood. This is because the recurring cost of refuelling LPG continues to be an issue for people. The cost of a subsidised LPG cylinder is about Rs 490 which is reimbursed, but the cost upfront would be Rs 700 to Rs 1,000. Firewood is affordable in comparison as, in most cases, they gather firewood free of cost,"" said Abhishek Jain, senior programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and lead author of the study./The CEEW, which conducted the survey with support from Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation and the National University of Singapore, also found that the LPG distribution network had expanded between 2015 and 2018, with a higher proportion of rural households in the six states getting LPG cylinders delivered at their doorstep. However, people often have to travel four kilometres one way to procure a cylinder ./""Chulha pollution is one of the biggest killers in the country but the number of households still trapped in chulha pollution is extremely high. The Global Burden of Disease report shows that chulha pollution contributes more than 25% of outdoor air pollution. Most vulnerable are children and women. It's an unpardonable health risk, we need very quick transition to clean energy,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./According to the State of Global Air, 2018 report by US-based Health Effects Institute, India and China could be experiencing a ""double burden"" due to combined exposure from outdoor air pollution and household air pollution. In 2016, a total of 2.45 billion people (33.7% of the global population) were exposed to household air pollution.

Could my wheezing child be suffering from asthma?,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 25 -- Coughing and wheezing before the age of six years are signs that the child is having difficulty in breathing but these are not always a sign of asthma. With environmental factors such as pollutants, dust, changing weather, pollen, mites, mould, hazardous volatile compounds and food additives pushing up allergies and asthma cases, every cough and wheeze prompts panicked parents to call paediatricians several times a day./Paediatricians say more than children, parents need to breathe easy./Around one in three children under the age of five cough and wheeze when they have cold and other viral infections because infections cause inflammation, which may make the inner lining of airways to swell up and restrict air flow. Unless the difficulty breathing lasts for weeks after the cold or fever is over, the child is unlikely to develop asthma./SIGNS OF ASTHMA/Around half the children outgrow the symptoms by age six, but the rest continue to have airway sensitivity and asthma. Studies from India show asthma among children who are 13-14 years of age is lower than 6-7 years old. In some children, however, asthma may disappear for some years only to return at a later stage in life./Children with a personal or family history of asthma, allergies or eczema are at increased risk, as are those who have had frequent infections or are exposed to severe air pollution, which lowers maximal lung functional capacity and exacerbates of asthma./An estimated 10% to 15% children between the ages of 5 and 11 years have asthma in India, which makes asthma the most common chronic disease in children in the country. Between 15 and 20 million people have asthma in India, according to the World Health Organisation, with the Indian Journal of Medical Research estimating the number to be at least 30 million./The common symptoms in children include recurrent attacks of dry and hacking cough without fever that get more severe while sleeping or in the early morning hours. Some children may produce a whistling sound while breathing, while a few may complain of chest pain or stomach ache./Severe attacks rarely occur suddenly, but are known to occur without warning even in children with intermittent asthma, so testing for asthma is a must to start treatment to manage the disease and prevent acute attacks./AVOIDING TROUBLE/A major trigger for children is the narrowing of the airways because of physical exertion. Exercise-induced asthma causes breathlessness, wheezing, and coughing within five to 10 minutes of the cool-down period after physical activity, but it may also occur during running or playing sports, such as cricket, football, basketball or athletics. These symptoms usually disappear within 30 minutes of stopping./Sporting activities such as swimming cause less airway cooling or drying and rarely cause exercise-induced asthma. Sports involving short bursts of activity are better for children with asthma than prolonged exertion./Along with using prescription medication to dilate airways and lower their sensitivity to minimise attacks, identifying and avoiding irritants is also essential./Till the specific triggers are not identified, a child with airway sensitivity has to be protected from known allergens such as dust and other indoor and outdoor air pollutants, pollen, food colour and additives, secondhand smoke, poorly ventilated spaces homes and cold weather./Since asthma is a chronic disease, treatment has to continue for life. Even children with mild asthma must have SOS medicines, such as inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists, handy to prevent symptoms from exacerbating. Those with moderate to severe asthma need prescription medicines, such as anti-inflammatory medicines, to lower airway sensitivity and inflammation and prevent asthma attacks./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How Delhi's air pollution is affecting our children,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 26 -- Delhi, the capital of India and one of the largest cities in the world, is under severe stress, thanks to urbanisation, increasing population and alarming levels of pollution. Studies have proved that transportation, industrial and residential sectors are the largest polluters, and that the citizens are exposed to high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), black carbon (BC) and particulate matter (PM)./The 2015 Global Burden of Disease report attributes about 1.09 million deaths in India to PM 2.51 and identifies air pollution to be among the top 10 health risks in the country. As per the World Health Organisation, 37 Indian cities are among the world's top 100 cities with very high levels of PM10./Ozone formation requires both oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), along with sunlight and warm temperature. Therefore, the ground level ozone in the city exceeds the threshold limit largely during summer months./This is dreadful news for young children because studies show that ozone alters the epithelial permeability of the lung, and it is well known that lung development continues in the postnatal period. The seasonal variation in the concentration of pollutants shows that winter is the worst polluted season mainly because of the relatively stable meteorological conditions. Monsoon displays the lowest level of pollution. Air pollution leads to pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, bronchitis, shortness of breath and coughing./Policy changes are required to reduce the generation of ground level ozone through controlled vehicular emissions, and to monitor its ambient levels and health effects./There are five ways to document and control this problem: First, monitor associated illnesses through a health data system similar to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme. This system should document the type of illness and causes of death. Second, include documentation of effects (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections) and lung function capacity through the National Family Health Survey. Third, use the extensive mobile network connectivity to develop a secure and regulated portal for licenced medical physician or clinic to voluntarily upload medical information to a centralised database, helping visualise the enormity of the problem and identify hotspots of ill effects. Fourth, involve urban designers and town planners, automobile manufacturing and transport industry, oil and natural gas industry and health specialists to tackle the problem. Incentivising industry to adopt changes help improve public health. Fifth, developing cities that promote health and reduce multi-morbidities. This will reduce health costs for individuals and the state./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurugram grapples with breathing disorders as air turns toxic,"India, Nov. 27 -- Gurugram has witnessedhas witnessed a rise in the number of patients complaining of pollution-induced health issues this month, said doctors. Since Diwali, which fell on November 7, there has been a hike of almost 50% in the number of patients coming in with upper respiratory infections such as tonsillitis, sore throat and acute bronchitis at the Civil Hospital in Civil Lines. Private hospitals too reported a 20 to 30% rise this month as compared to the previous month./Though the city's air quality index (AQI) improved to the 'poor' category on November 15 (and has remained poor on most days since) from the 'very poor' category that persisted for a week after Diwali, doctors said the damage had already been done. They also warned of the flu that comes with winter and recommended influenza shots for those who are vulnerable and have underlying respiratory problems./City-based health experts said the number of children coming in with respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia had started increasing when the winter pollution set in more than a month ago. ""Children are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of air pollution because of their higher rates of breathing, developing lungs and narrower airways. They are also more frequently exposed to the outside air,"" said Dr Harish Sharma, a city-based pulmonologist, adding that he is seeing more than 22 people a day as compared to 15 a month ago. Dr Manjeeta Das of Columbia Asia Hospital too said that the out-patient department has seen more than 50 cases of acute bronchitis and other respiratory problems every day this month./A 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) report found that in India, 98% of all children under the age of five are exposed to PM2.5 levels above the WHO's air quality guidelines. According to a study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-D), the average annual PM2.5 level in Gurugram is 85.8ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air). The safe limit, as per the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) National Ambient Air Quality Standards is 40ug/m3./Sharma said that the rise in respiratory diseases is common with the change in season and the rise in pollution levels. ""When it's cold, one is more exposed to pollutants as they tend to remain suspend unlike in summers when the warm air drifts the pollutants upwards,"" Sharma said./Dr Himanshu Garg, head of department, respiratory diseases, at Artemis Hospital, said that the sale of respiratory medications has risen by more than 13% in the hospital over the past one month due to the pollution. ""But treatment can only help so much. We need to keep a check on the quality of air before we step out. People are reluctant to use masks but they are effective at reducing exposure to particles,"" Garg said./The air in the city is likely to become unhealthier with the fall in temperatures in the coming weeks. Doctors recommended maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time. ""Exercising for a few minutes daily and eating healthy helps combat pollutants. Don't step out when the AQI is in a 'very poor' or 'severe' category, unless something urgent comes up,"" said Garg./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India should take the lead on climate change issues,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 30 -- The global climate is changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilisation - a point made clear by the latest National Climate Assessment from the US Government published last week. The consequences of a warming planet are extensive and drawn-out,affecting the economy, ecology and health. The nature and scale of the response to climate change will shape the health profile of nations for centuries to come. The impacts of existing climate change is placed in stark contrast by recent analysis from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, focusing on extreme weather events and other unusual phenomenon witnessed across the planet./The Lancet Countdown is a multidisciplinary research collaboration between 27 leading academic institutions around the world. It is motivated by the idea that the response to climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century. Conversely, the failure to act could undo 50 years of public health gains./For India, the data is clear in our 2018 Assessment, Shaping the Health of Nations for Centuries to Come: unless the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, climate change will undermine the very viability of health systems across the globe./According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 97% of major cities in low and middle income countries do not meet safe air quality guidelines. Our research indicates that exposure to ambient air pollution has resulted in some 3 million premature deaths per year globally, with over half a million of these occurring in India./Declining air quality correlates with increased risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory disorders, such as asthma and COPD. WHO rankings of air quality have shown that Indian cities are among the most polluted in the world./As the sixth largest economy in the world, India's need for further economic growth is clear. This development will be most effective when coordinated with sustainability and climate action. A carbon intensive economy leads not only to poor air quality and high emissions, but a rise in extreme heat. In 2017, India experienced over 75 billion total hours of labour lost due to intense heat. This is 48.8% of the total global loss and 7% of India's total working population. The recent floods in Kerala were described as the ""worst flood [the state has seen] in a hundred years"" and resulted in 1% loss of the state's GDP./Outdated fossil fuel economies will only accelerate global warming and the spread of disease. Continuing to phase out coal demand is clearly crucial in meeting the target of the Paris Agreement. There has been a downward trend in coal consumption around the world, growth in India was 2.4% in 2016, which represents a decrease from previous years. Increases in renewable energy installation in recent years have doubled that of their fossil fuel counterparts, with indicators of investment proving that a transition to clean energy is already underway./Our report found, for the first time, that coal use accounts for nearly 16% of deaths globally due to ambient air pollution from fine particulates. Reversing this trend will require political will to make the transition./India is well placed to take action on climate change, and has voluntarily embarked on a path of higher ambition. Yet, the state of global climate is by definition one that requires collective international effort. The Conference of Parties (COP 24) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be held in Katowice, Poland, next week. Agreeing on robust guidelines to implement the Paris Agreement is essential in solidifying commitments made so far. India can and should take a lead as a country with a lot at stake./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Green tribunal fines Delhi govt Rs 25 crore for failing to curb pollution,"India, Dec. 3 -- The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday imposed a fine of Rs 25 crore on the government of Delhi for failing to curb pollution in the national capital./The Capital has been reeling under air pollution crisis. Delhi's air quality has been in the ""very poor"" category for the past one week. Pollution levels in the national capital showed marginal improvement on Sunday and came out of the ""very poor"" zone for the first time in six days./And on Monday, the air quality in Delhi oscillated between ""poor"" and ""very poor"" categories due to local pollutants as authorities predicted a further rise in the pollution level./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded an overall Air Quality Index or AQI of 314, which falls in the ""very poor"" category. The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) said the air quality in Delhi was ""very poor"" and that there was a ""insignificant intrusion (of pollutants) from outside of Delhi"" at present./An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"" and 401 and 500 is considered to be ""severe""./At these levels, there may be discomfort in breathing on prolonged exposure, while people with heart disease could face discomfort with short exposure./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

1 in 8 deaths in India due to air deadlier than cigarettes,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 7 -- It's official: Air pollution in India is more injurious to health - and more deadly - than smoking. Lung infections, chronic obstructive lung disease, heart attacks, stroke, diabetes, and lung cancer from air pollution cause more early deaths than smoking, according to most comprehensive estimates of deaths, disease burden and life expectancy associated with air pollution across each state in India./One in eight deaths was attributable to air pollution in 2017, making it a leading cause of death in India, according to a study titled 'The impact of air pollution on deaths, disease burden, and life expectancy across the states of India: the global burden of disease study 2017'./The study, which provides the ""India-centric"" data that environment minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and other policymakers have been vocally seeking over the past year, was published in The Lancet Planetary Health./Though most people associate air pollution with lung disease, 38% of the burden from air pollution in India is from heart disease and diabetes, according to the study. In 2017, air pollution led to 1.24 million deaths in India, which accounts for 12.5% of the total deaths./""Living in India is like being a chronic smoker. A substantial 8% of the total disease burden and 11% of premature deaths in people younger than 70 years are attributed to air pollution,"" said senior author Prof Lalit Dandona, director of the India State Level Disease Burden Initiative, which led the study./No state across the country had an annual mean particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5 micrometres are particles one-400th of a millimetre) lower than the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended level of 10 microg/m cube./About 76.8% of India's population was exposed to mean PM2.5 more than 40 microg/m cube, which is the recommended limit set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of India./PM is short for particulate matter. PM2.5 are fine particles invisible to the naked eye and can only be seen by using an electron microscope./Delhi had the highest annual mean PM2.5 in 2017, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana, all of which had mean values of PM 2.5 greater than 125 micro g/m cube./""Air pollution damages the health of every person living in India. Apart from causing lung diseases, cancers and cognitive loss, noxious air also damages blood vessels, causing strokes and heart attacks,"" said Prof K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India./The disability-adjusted life years (DALYS, or healthy years lost due to disease, disability or early death) from ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer attributable to air pollution were found to be similar to those attributable to tobacco use./""These are conservative estimates as we have deliberately taken an approach where we use only those diseases and conditions (heart disease, lung diseases, diabetes) for which there is firm evidence in scientific literature. For example, air pollution is also linked with low birth weight and cognitive impairment, but since these are early studies and there is no conclusive evidence, we have not included them,"" said Dandona./Cleaning air would raise the average life expectancy across India by 1.7 years, with people living in the highly polluted northern states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana gaining more than two years./""The intent of the study is to provide comprehensive data from each state that will be useful for policy makers. We did this using multiple satellite-based aerosol optical depth data and combined with a chemical transport model, which was then titrated with PM 2.5 data from ground level monitoring stations,"" said Dandona./""The study shows that even in places where pollution is low, it is exceeding norms during non-seasonal peaks, leading to cumulative exposure and sustained damage to the entire population. Action must be local, but policies have to address concerns of the entire population,"" said Reddy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Maharashtra doesn't breathe easy, air pollution killed 1.08 lakh in 2017","Mumbai, Dec. 7 -- Air pollution cost Maharashtra 1,08,038 lives in 2017, the second highest in the country, according to a study published in the Lancet Planetary Health on Thursday. The state saw 86.9 air pollution-related deaths for every 1 lakh people, making it the 15th in the average deaths in the country./Measuring the years lost by the affected population owing to ill health, disability or early death, the researchers said that for every 1,00,000 people in Maharashtra, 2,311 years were lost to air pollution. The study also revealed the average life expectancy of Maharashtra would have been 1.5 years higher if the air pollution levels were less./Professor Kalpana Balakrishnan, director, department of environmental health engineering, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, the first author of the study, said, ""It is the first comprehensive effort to produce a robust estimate of the health impact of outdoor and household air pollution in states of India. There is increasing evidence globally and from Indian states about the association of air pollution with premature death and disease burden. The findings are based on all available data on air pollution that were analysed using the standardised methods of the Global Burden of Disease Study.""/The study looked at the impact of indoor and ambient air pollution on the lives of people in terms of deaths, disease burden and life expectancy reduction in all 29 states and seven union territories. It was found that the levels of pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (pollutants that are 2.5 microns in size, small enough to easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments) in Maharashtra is between 40-59 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3) against the WHO standard of 10 ug/m3 and national standards of 40 ug/m3. The ambient air pollution alone has cost 62,677 lives in the state last year, almost 60% of the total deaths owing to air pollution./Speaking on how air pollution causes deaths or impacts lives, Professor Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the air pollution is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders and a major contributor to pneumonia and lung cancer. ""The study provides a comprehensive estimate of adverse health impact of outdoor and indoor air pollution in the state, which would serve as a valuable resource for planning air pollution reduction strategies,"" he said. ""Air pollution damages the health of every person, from a newborn to an adult,"" said Professor K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) that collaborated in the study, along with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Air in house often 10 times deadlier than outside',"NEW DELHI, Dec. 7 -- A large part of India's population would have lived seven months longer and contributed over a thousand healthy life years to the economy if it wasn't exposed to high household air pollution levels in 2017, a study published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal on Thursday said./According to the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative's study on the impact of air pollution on death and the disease burden in India for 2017, at least 50% of the country's population is dependent on solid fuels like wood, dung, agricultural residue, coal and charcoal for cooking and heating./In states with comparatively low social and development status like Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, over 75% population is dependent on solid fuels./The impact of household air pollution on life expectancy was found to be the highest in Rajasthan where the exposed population could lose a year, followed by Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh where it is expected to lose nine months./The disease burden from solid fuel combustion indoors includes acute lower respiratory tract infections, ischaemic heart disease, strokes and cataracts, among others./Of 1.24 million premature deaths due to air pollution, 0.48 million were due to exposure to household air pollution or solid fuel use in 2017, according to the study./The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched in May 2016 to provide free LPG connections to women from below poverty line families. But it was too early for the impact of the scheme to be seen in the 2017 data used for the study./The authors of the study say exposure to PM2.5 pollutants in the kitchen can often be 10 times higher than outdoor air pollution levels./""It can be anywhere between 200 to 700 micrograms per cubic metre. We couldn't capture the impact of PMUY because we used 2017 data, but having an LPG connection doesn't guarantee LPG use. So we can't wish away the problem of household air pollution, which is being felt even in states like Kerala or Tamil Nadu where outdoor pollution levels may be comparatively lower,"" said Kalpana Balakrishnan from the department of environmental health engineering, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research in Chennai, who is a co-author of the study./But the premature death rates from exposure to household air pollution are marginally lower than those from outdoor air pollution in India mainly because of an increase in LPG use./Balakrishnan was part of a World Health Organization study in 2000 that showed that the air pollution exposure contribution from household pollution was far higher than from outdoor air pollution. Household air pollution exacerbates the health impacts of ambient air pollution already being suffered by a lot of northern and low socio-economic status states./The Access to Clean Cooking Energy and Electricity - Survey of States (ACCESS 2018) conducted by the Council on Environment, Energy and Water found that households using LPG as their primary cooking fuel have increased from 14% to 37% since 2015./But LPG continues to be the second fuel for the majority of rural households in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal./Although the PMUY reimburses LPG connection charges (~1,600) for women of BPL households, and oil marketing companies provide an equated monthly instalment option to cover the cost of the cooking stove and first refill, the scheme has failed to convert a majority of people to primary LPG users because they find LPG less affordable./""Common logic dictates that using LPG rather than solid fuels would reduce household air pollution. And, the Ujjwala scheme is providing access to LPG. That said, we need to scientifically quantify whether there is any impact and we are doing those studies,"" said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

We need better reporting of household air pollution,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 7 -- The recent surge in air pollution levels in New Delhi has once again attracted a lot of attention. In normal conditions, this level of exposure to air pollution - particularly PM 2.5 - witnessed in the capital is a daily instance in households where solid biomass is burnt in poorly ventilated spaces. It is estimated that household air pollution (HAP) related to cooking causes 1.3 million premature deaths in India (WHO, 2018). It also leads to almost 30% of the ambient air pollution in the country. One of the major constituents of HAP is PM 2.5, which affects local and regional climate change, and can cause environmental degradation./Owing to these problems and to realise India's voluntary commitment as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the government introduced the Ujjwala Yojana, which aims at provisioning cleaner liquefied petroleum gas cylinders to poor households. So far, over 50 million households have benefitted from the scheme. Still, there are households that use cook stove and cooking fuel./In a recent study prepared by the Automotive Research Association of India and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), it has been highlighted that close to 3 million households in the National Capital Region (NCR) use biomass fuel. It is noteworthy that the use of traditional stoves and burning of solid biomass is not restricted to cooking only. It is also used for multiple purposes such as space heating, keeping the flies/insects away in the animal sheds, warming food/water for preparing an animal feed. While all of this is known for a long time, the wider focus has been given on replacing the cook stove that is used for cooking food only. This leaves the issue of HAP unaddressed. Exposure to HAP is detrimental to health. But household dwellers, who are regularly exposed to toxic fumes, do often not realise this or associated economic implications. At the macro level, the health impacts of HAP are estimates, which are generated using scientifically proven models. There is a need for exploring ways to strengthen the model by feeding data that is more reflective of the insights at the grassroots. In the current paradigm, we don't gather large scale micro level data pertaining to air pollution-related disease burden at short intervals./This can be realised by introducing institutional mechanisms for reporting HAP/air pollution-related disease burden. Having a more robust estimate of HAP/ air pollution-related health impact will enable in setting a baseline that can be leveraged in the long run to determine the benefits of mega energy access initiatives in any particular region./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Toxic air killing Indians faster, 2.5 yrs younger","NEW DELHI, Dec. 7 -- Creating a robust system to implement existing clean-air policies, promoting coordination between the Centre and states, and devising stateand district-level pollution control plans are vital to improve air quality, experts say./One in eight deaths in the country in 2017 was attributable to air pollution, making it the leading risk factor for death across India, said a state-level disease burden study published in Lancet Planet Health on Thursday./The statewise breakup of data, however, shows that there is a three- and six-fold variation in deaths and healthy life-years lost because of pollution. The heterogeneity among the states needs to be addressed by identifying local sources of pollution and developing policies to address them./""We need detailed emission inventories that not only tell us the type of pollutant but also what proportion of it is coming from where and what are the chemical properties. We get data on this from various studies conducted by the IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) but we need to strengthen our monitoring systems too,"" said Tushar Joshi, adviser on occupational and environmental health and chemical safety in the Union health ministry./""The government is in the process of adding more automatic air quality monitoring stations and it is needed in the rural areas too, where typically the high ozone pollution is leading to failing crops. The ozone is high as there is no nitrous oxides to neutralise it,"" he said./The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, under which women of poor households are being provided free cooking gas connections to reduce their dependence on firewood, is one step towards addressing the problem, said Sagnik Dey, one of the authors of the study and an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi./""For a county as large as India, source apportionment studies cannot be done everywhere, but modelling studies have shown biggest contributor, for the country as a whole, is use of solid fuels,"" said Dey./Experts hailed the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) that aims to reduce PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants by 30% and 20% respectively./""The NCAP is a good start as it allows states to formulate their own plans. However, it is more important to improve the coordination among states and with the Centre for effective implementation of already existing and any policies that are introduced in the future,"" said Dey./""For example, the 15-year diesel vehicles removed from the roads in Delhi are not discarded but sold off to other places where they continue polluting. Would that pollution not come back to Delhi?"" he said./Adding to the problem is the slow percolation of policies across the country. ""This is what we see with low emission diesel or CNG (compressed natural gas) vehicles, which are still not feasible in many parts of the country. The government has brought in the BS (Bharat Stage) VI standards, which may face the same problem,"" said Kamna Sachdeva, associate professor at the TERI School of Advanced Studies/India will move up to the toughest emission standards of BS-VI from the current BS-IV by 2020, skipping an intermediate level./Fixing accountability is also needed. ""The NCAP should be released incorporating the time-bound pollution reduction targets across sectors with fixed accountability and strong legal backing,"" said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India./And the focus should not just be on the polluting industries and the emissions from thermal power plants./""The government already has norms for the emissions from industries and policy on reducing dependency on fuelbased power. But we often forget that solid fuels are also used in the numerous dhabas across the country, or the dust pollution caused by sweeping, and inefficient municipal waste disposal that leads to people burning household waste.

Regional priorities must be set aside for cleaner air,"India, Dec. 10 -- Air pollution causes one in eight deaths and lowers life expectancy on an average by 1.7 years, according to a pan-India study that should end the policy indecision on the urgency to implement clean air strategies. In 2017, no state had an annual mean particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) lower than the WHO-recommended level of 10 micro g/m cube, with 76.8% of the country's population exposed to a mean PM 2.5 of more than the 40micro g/m cube limit set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of India. Not surprisingly, no one in India escaped the health damages, which include heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, cataract and diabetes, among others. Even people living in Kerala and Goa, which, by far, have the cleanest air in the country, died one year earlier than they would have if the minimum clean air limits were met./India's heterogeneity is reflected in the air polluting patterns, with the damage rates from indoor air pollution varying 145-fold among the states in 2017, and up to six-fold for outdoor particulate matter pollution. The health damage from outdoor PM2.5 was the highest in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan, and the household air pollution was highest in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Assam, according to 2017 data. It is this variability that needs to be addressed while planning policy interventions to lower the leading sources of toxic air, which include industry and thermal power emissions, transportation, construction activity, residential and commercial solid fuel use, waste and agriculture burning, diesel generators, and manual road dust./Strengthening the quality of healthcare at the population level also strongly mitigates health damage. Delhi had the highest annual mean PM2.5 in 2017, yet its comparatively good public healthcare system led to its population on an average losing 1.6 years of life expectancy, which is lower than the national average of 1.7 years. By comparison, other polluted but underserved states such as Rajasthan lost 2.5 years of life expectancy and Uttar Pradesh lost 2.2 years. Policy interventions show quick results, as is evident from the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which has been expanded to distribute LPG to 80 million homes by March 2019 to lower the use of biomass for cooking, which led to 0.48 million of the 1.24 million premature deaths from air pollution. The National Clean Air Programme, which aims to reduce PM 2.5 and PM10 by 30% and 20% respectively by allowing states to develop their own customised strategies, needs robust implementation at the state and district levels for sustainable results and realtime course correction, when needed. Air pollution doesn't recognise state boundaries, and regional priorities must be set aside for cleaner air and a healthier future./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

When it's okay to take a break from exercise,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 16 -- Most people who don't exercise blame it on lack of time, tiredness or air pollution. Little do they realise that physical activity boosts energy levels, improves sleep and lowers chronic tiredness even if the air is far from clean./The many benefits of moderately intense physical activity are clinically proven. Walking at least 10,000 steps a day or burning 700-1,000 calories a week improves mood, lowers stress and reduces the risk of depression, obesity, heart disease, diabetes and several types of cancer - particularly breast and colon cancers./To optimise health benefits, a combination of aerobic activity, strength training and balance exercises is recommended - the intensity depending on your fitness levels and age. In cold weather, outdoor activity is best done during the warmer part of the day when the sun is out and the air quality is better./Exercising to build muscle strength, flexibility and cardiovascular fitness is good for you most of the time but it's best to give it a break if you are recu-/perating from an illness or develop a sudden sharp pain or dizziness while working out. Take it easy when:/It's polluted: If the air quality index (AQI) is 300 or more, as they are across most parts of north India, don't exercise outdoors as the air does your body more damage than good. While exercising, we not only inhale more amounts of air but also breathe in through the mouth, which leads to air pollutants bypassing the filtration system of the nose and going straight into the airways and lungs, leading to cough, infections, and over time, lung damage. Download an AQI monitoring app to check pollution levels before venturing out. Studies show most commercially available face masks - even internationally certified ones - do not offer enough protection when the facial fits are poor. Inless you have one that fits snugly over your nose and mouth, exercise indoors./You have fever: While exercising with a common cold is not detrimental to health, avoid exerting yourself if you have fever. Besides pushing up your resting heart rate and making you dehydrated, fever could be a sign of respiratory infection, which can compromise your lung capacity and cause wheezing even if you don't have asthma./You risk an asthma attack: People with well-controlled asthma can exercise as much and as long as the next person but they must always keep an inhaler handy. Sudden exposure to cold can constrict airways and make it difficult to breathe or induce an attack as can asthma triggers such as dust and pollen. Those with exercise-induced asthma should opt for low-to-moderate intensity activity such as brisk walking and swimming. You have sudden pain:/Some amount of muscle ache is normal after strenuous exercise but stop the moment you experience sudden pain as it can aggravate an injury. Seek medical attention to rule out injury. If muscle pain is dull and persists for more than 24 hours, give the muscle groups a rest to promote healing. You have a cold, headache or sore throat: Mild to moderate exercise can help ease symptoms of common cold by opening up nasal passages to relieve a stuffy nose or minor sore throat but stop if you also have fever, chest congestion or a hacking cough. You're exercising after a long break: Fitness levels drop rapidly in as little as two to three weeks. If you've been away for longer than a week, begin with reduced intensity and gradually increase./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Spectre of air pollution: Health a casualty,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 20 -- Air pollution exposures in India constitute a major public health threat. To prevent a full-blown national health crisis, our policy conversations and actions need to first acknowledge, and then respond to, the enormity and severity of the problem. A significant part of the Indian population is exposed to air quality that is considerably worse than nationally and internationally accepted guidelines. What is the nature of this health crisis, how much do we know, and is there enough evidence to act? We need to engage with these questions as we demand action against air pollution./Impacts of air pollution on health in India are severe and prevalent across all states and sociodemographic groups. These impacts, whether estimated through mortality or morbidity rates, or through measuring reduction in life expectancy - are all growing at a significant rate. As a risk factor for disease burden in the country, air pollution is second only to child and maternal malnutrition, and ranks higher than unsafe water and unsanitary conditions - conditions we have long associated with poor health in India./As the previous article in this series showed, the annual mean ambient levels of PM2.5 are multiple times both Indian and WHO norms. Health-damaging air pollution exposures are an everyday reality for both urban and rural populations in India. And it is not only ambient air pollution. Household air pollution - primarily caused by burning solid fuels such as wood and dung for cooking, has significant health impacts as well, and 56% of India's population, largely in the rural areas, continues to rely on solid fuels, with the highest numbers in the states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. The most recent India State-Level Disease Burden estimates, released by an initiative co-ordinated by the Indian Council for Medical Research and the Public Health Foundation of India, and published in The Lancet Planetary Health, show that ambient and household air pollution contributes nearly equally to health impacts./In 2017, air pollution is estimated to have contributed to one in eight deaths in India for a total of 1.24 million deaths according to estimates published in the Lancet study mentioned above. The impact goes beyond mortality; air pollution significantly reduces quality of life by increasing the incidence of a range of illnesses. Health literature uses a metric called Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which includes both the years of life lost due to premature death and the number of years lived with less than ideal health. The Lancet study found that air pollution contributed to more than 38 million years of healthy life lost in India./The impact of air pollution on newborn babies and infants under the age of five years is particularly alarming. According to a recent WHO report, in 2016, 100,000 children under the age of five die annually due to exposure to air pollution - the highest in the world in this age bracket. This number is particularly astonishing, when compared to the overall under 5 years mortality in India in 2016 which stands at just under 10 lakh. Therefore, 10% of Indian children under 5 years are dying due to air pollution, a problem against which we continue to move at a glacial pace./Air pollution is also emerging as the single largest risk factor for non-communicable diseases. This is especially the case for women. Air pollution is the single largest risk factor for women for chronic respiratory diseases, while for men, smoking and other occupational risks are also important contributory factors. A similar profile is emerging for cardiovascular disease and diabetes./We are still discovering the scale and range of damage air pollution causes on our health. Cardio-respiratory diseases and lung cancer in adults, and acute lower respiratory infections in children are the more commonly known impacts of air pollution. However, emerging epidemiological research indicate a much wider range of health impacts of air pollution such as on birthweight, child growth and cognitive abilities, obesity and bladder cancer. For instance, recent studies in Tamil Nadu have provided convincing evidence for impacts of ambient and household PM2.5 exposures on birthweight. These impacts are not currently included in the burden of disease estimates, and therefore the totality of impacts of air pollution in India is likely grossly underestimated./While there are not many epidemiological studies on long-term mortality in low and middle income countries including India, there is evidence that adverse effects of exposure to air pollution seen in other parts of the world are also occurring in India. While further studies are critical for our understanding, we need not wait for these to act, particularly since pollution levels in India are higher than anywhere else. Changes in daily rates of mortality associated with short-term exposure to particulates in India are similar to those reported in multicity studies conducted in China, South Korea, Japan, Europe, and North America. Several Indian studies have contributed to the pool of studies included in meta-analyses for estimating relative risks of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases and cataracts in relation to household air pollution exposure. Arguments about lack of India-specific studies of air pollution on health do not hold water./The evidence we have now sends a loud and clear message - there is a health crisis unfolding in India. Commissioning additional studies on emissions and impacts will undoubtedly help guide future policy actions. But currently available information and knowledge on health effects and exposure attribution to sources is more than sufficient to move us into 'mission' mode. Reasons not to make this move, whether political, financial, legal, or technical, while perhaps compelling, pale in comparison to the following reality: we are consciously subjecting the current and future generations to conditions that increase the burden of non-communicable diseases, impact child mortality, reduce life expectancy, impair cognitive skills, adversely impact pregnant women and their unborn children, and create lifelong medical dependencies. We can no longer afford a lackadaisical response to a risk factor that is eroding rural and urban health, across every state in India./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Urgent solutions needed to mitigate the impact of climate change on health,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 28 -- As the sun comes down on 2018, one can applaud the enhanced visibility for ""health"" within the national discourse at various fora -- academic, social and political. Much of this is driven by air pollution levels that are causing concern both because of attributable illness and death but also because of the challenge they pose in terms of mitigation and control. A less recognised, but inextricably linked, challenge is climate change. Stated to be the greatest global health challenge of the 21st century, the role of climate change in undoing several decades of public health gains is worrisome./Globally, rising temperatures, increased precipitation and rainfall have resulted in greater frequency of climatic events ranging from fires and floods to droughts and heatwaves. In India alone, such events have been encountered at regular frequency in the last two decades. Air quality is a threat, vector-borne diseases are increasing, and depleting water resources are affecting agricultural production. The resultant impact on health, nutrition and economic development spans all ages. Low and middle-income countries like India with the most vulnerable populations are likely to be worst-affected, given weaker health systems and poorer infrastructure. This translates into further widening of existing health and economic disparities./Climate change resulting from growing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human (anthropogenic) activities is a prime cause for global warming and at current GHG emission rates, rising temperatures can have potentially harmful effects on ecosystems, biodiversity and human health and livelihoods. In India, the major sources of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (major component of GHG) emissions come from combustion of fossil fuels, principally coal, oil and natural gas, apart from emissions from transport, industrial activity, deforestation, changes in land use, agriculture (including livestock) and waste management. Reducing our carbon emissions therefore becomes of prime importance. Other short-lived climate pollutants include black carbon, methane and ground-level ozone which along with other air pollutants and particulate matter from these same sectors combine to aggravate air quality and cause climate change. The health and environmental co-benefits of addressing air pollution and climate change are therefore increasingly evident./Climate change impacts health. Air pollutants, including particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCS), carbon monoxide, black carbon, methane and ozone can affect respiratory and cardiovascular health. The physiological impacts of rising temperatures causing heat stress, heat exhaustion and stroke are particularly harmful, with children, elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses being particularly vulnerable. Exacerbations of heart failure and acute kidney injury from dehydration can also occur during heatwaves. Heatwaves in Ahmedabad in 2016 accounted for a 43% increase in all-cause mortality. The change in geographical distribution of disease transmitting agents (vectors) owing to climatic conditions affect disease trends for dengue and malaria, with annual waves of dengue-related hospital admissions and deaths increasing the burden on the health sector. Drought situations affecting crop yield as well as nutritive value and nutritive diversity of food production can have deleterious consequences on the nutritional status of affected populations, compounding effects in already malnourished communities. Increased incidence of post-flood waterborne diseases occur both because of affected water supplies infiltrated with disease agents and poor sanitation and hygiene conditions during these periods. The mental health impacts of climate change including stress in post-climatic events and increased suicides by farmers in post-drought situations have also been documented in several regions./The indirect effects of climate change are a consequence of detrimental social and economic impacts through altered labour capacity, loss of livelihoods, impacts on individual, household and national budgets and conflict situations arising from environmental stressors. These require to be addressed urgently through the focussed lens of mitigation and adaptation activities that are not just health-centric but encourage systemic changes. These must include strategic identification of polluting sectors with appropriate policies for controlling emissions and stringent measures where they are lacking; facilitating the phased move from coal to clean/ renewable energies; measures for resource efficiency for water, food, energy in hospitality, healthcare and industrial sectors with ""retrofitting"" of existing infrastructure and operations to facilitate this. Therefore, while building climate-resilient communities, a significant all-encompassing strategy that addresses health though the sustainable development agenda will go a long way in setting the trajectory for impactful changes to address health impacts of climate change. Meanwhile, recognising that India tops the table of nations that will face maximum social and economic costs of climate change at $86 for each additional tonne of carbon dioxide emission (the corresponding figures of the US and China are $48 and $28 respectively) should instigate political will for adequate climate financing. The implications of climate change for India cannot be understated and the time to act is now!/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Home remedies for asthma,"India, Dec. 29 -- With a rise in pollution levels and change in season, asthmatics are affected in a major way. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that affects the airways of the lungs and causes a frequent, recurrent cough, sneezing and breathing difficulty./This is caused by an allergic reaction to air pollution, which causes the airways to swell and thus narrow, leading to difficulties in breathing and a feeling of suffocation. People suffering from asthma know the true value of breathing./Here are some natural remedies that reduce the symptoms of this lung disease:/Warm drinks: Hot or warm drinks can help loosen the airways and relieve congestion. So, keep sipping hot green tulsi tea, ginger tea or peppermint tea or infusions./Note: Avoid milk tea as milk forms more mucus./Turmeric: Curcumin, turmeric's main component, is a phytochemical that has anti-allergic properties, which affect the histamine that causes inflammation of bronchioles. Add turmeric to warm water and drink as a decoction./Ginger: Its anti-inflammatory properties keep the respiratory tract healthy. Ginger works by relaxing the airway muscles, which relieves constriction and provides relief from asthma. Drink ginger tea or simply chew ginger./Tulsi: Tulsi is an excellent aid in the war against the symptoms of asthma. Make a decoction with tulsi leaves and water, and sip it throughout the day. Or, drink tulsi tea./Trikatu: This mixture of three herbs (long pepper, black pepper and dry ginger powder), when taken with a teaspoon of honey, can help to clear the airways and promote normal breathing./Chyawanprash: It is rich in antioxidants that boost immunity and fight the effects of asthma. Use only Chyawanprash made with organic ingredients, and take every day at bedtime./Warm mustard oil massage: Rub warm mustard oil combined with camphor on the chest. This provides quick relief from symptoms./From HT Brunch, December 30, 2018/Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch/Connect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Migratory birds in Kanpur zoo: They came, they choked, they left","Kanpur, Jan. 9 -- Each year thousands of migratory birds travel thousands of miles to settle around the beautiful lake of Kanpur zoological garden in this season./Not so this time./While the flocks of Asiatic sparrows and Pacific golden plovers arrived here last week, they flew back within days ostensibly after finding the air unpalatable, claimed veterinarian Dr Nasir (he goes by one name)./""The migratory birds were seen over the trees near the lake. They stayed there for four-five days and then left the place. A few species, which are also regular visitors, have stayed back but their number is much lower than previous years,"" he said./Dr Rakesh Kumar, who has been studying the behaviour of the migratory birds, said these birds come from the Himalayan region during winters and return to their native place at the onset of summer season./""Since most of the migratory birds live in pollution free zones they cannot adjust here due to high pollution rate and move out to another places,"" he said./""The Pacific Golden Plover bird is highly sensitive to pollution. It prefers to live in absolute pollution free areas,"" said Kumar./He said most of the bird watchers and the bird research scholars are disappointed as they did not get an opportunity this time to go ahead with their studies on the migratory bird./Senior officer of the zoo said the lake in the Kanpur Zoological Park has been the centre of migratory birds during every winter. But for higher air pollution many of the migratory birds did not prefer to stay here this winter./As against previous years, the number of migratory birds has decreased by 60%. Only two to three species of the migratory birds such as Painted Stork, Darter and black winged stilt were seen near the lake./Despite good ambience and plenty of feed materials for the bird in the zoo lake like unio (Ghongha) and Pyle (Seep), the migratory birds did not settle here. They, however, stayed for few minutes on the trees near the lake but soon flew away to some other places./The official said that the situation of Nawabganj Bird sanctuary was also bad. The sanctuary witnessed only 10% of the migratory birds due to air pollution in the area./The most probable cause of birds not settling here is the polluted air. The migratory birds are highly sensitive to air pollution./""We are taking extra precautions with the birds coming from Siberia as they are supposed to be the carrier of bird flu. Samples from all the six districts of the Kanpur division are being collected for bird flu test,"" said superintendent of divisional laboratory of animal husbandry department, Dr UK Bajpai./""Most of the Siberian birds are settled in Kanpur, Unnao, Kannauj and Etawah. We are collecting at least 30 samples every month,"" said Bajpai./High pollution also affecting humans.The air pollution has crossed the permissible limit in the city and has been posing serious threat to the people of the city. During this week, the PM 2.5 level was recorded as high as 412 microgram per cubic meter which was six times higher than the permissible limit. According to environmentalist, the pollution rate was high as the air flow was very minimal./According to the former principal of the GSVM Medical College and chest specialist Dr SK Katiyar due to high air pollution the lung diseases were also on increase. ""Besides it has also been affecting the eyes, throat and the respiratory track. Most of the children are facing breathing problem,"" he said./According to Dr Katiyar, the situation would further worsen if the air pollution was not contained by taking stringent measures./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Spike in bad air but govt not sure if pollution kills,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 18 -- Can India's bad air crisis lead to fatalities? There are two different answers, depending on which Union government ministry has been asked the question./The environment ministry told Parliament this month that there is no direct link between pollution and deaths or diseases even though a health ministry report published in a leading peer-reviewed journal last month estimated that one in eight deaths in the country are linked to air quality./The environment ministry's response to a question in Lok Sabha comes at a time when the national capital is shrouded in ""severe"" pollution - Thursday recorded the second-worst air quality of this year with the air quality index (AQI) at 440. This was the third-worst reading this winter, attributed by experts to low temperature and slow wind speeds at the surface level that were militating against the dispersal of suspended pollutants./Officials said the air is expected to remain in the ""severe"" category - a classification when AQI is above 400 - till Saturday./""There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death or disease exclusively due to air pollution. However, air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases,"" the environment ministry said in the January 4 response which first reported by Scroll.in on Wednesday. In 2017, environment minister Harsh Vardhan said: ""No death certificate has the cause of death as pollution.""/This sentiment is contradicted by findings by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), published on December 6 in Lancet Planetary Health, that 1.24 million deaths in 2017 were due to exposure to air pollution, and that bad air reduces life expectancy in India by 1.7 years on an average. ICMR is India's premier research body under the Union ministry of health and family welfare./Prior to that ICMR report, the health ministry released another study in 2015 that said air pollution exposure impact was no longer limited to chronic and acute respiratory disorders. ""It is generally accepted there are also impacts on ischemic heart disease, stroke, cataracts, and lung cancer. In addition, there is increasing evidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, TB, asthma exacerbation, other cancers, and cognitive impairments,"" said the report drafted by health experts such as Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan of the department of environment health engineering, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute; and Dr Kirk R Smith, professor of global environment health, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley./""Just as with tobacco smoking, which produces the same set of impacts, air pollution needs now to be considered within public health programs concerning noncommunicable and communicable diseases,"" the report added./The environment ministry, however, will launch its own assessment of the health impact of bad air. A National Environmental Health Profile has been commissioned to assess ""human health impact in consequence of exposure to outdoor air pollution"" in 20 selected cities across the country, the ministry told Parliament./""Yes, we have no data linking air pollution with death. It can definitely aggravate existing conditions. Obviously air pollution impacts health but it cannot be the cause of death. If you have morbidity, air pollution will aggravate it,"" CK Mishra, secretary, environment ministry, said on Thursday./Mishra added that he was aware of the ICMR and health ministry's steering committee reports./Balakrishnan, who was also the lead author of the ICMR study, said: ""We have observed that people exposed to high level of air pollution suffer tissue ageing and inflammatory responses alongside other risk factors. In areas with high air pollution there is higher premature mortality.""/She added that while India doesn't have long-term cohort studies on premature mortality related to air pollution, there are short-term studies./""So, there is no reason to doubt the relationship between premature mortality and air pollution. Long term cohort studies will take a very long time to roll out,"" she added./The Lok Sabha query answered on January 4 also says that ""there is no increasing trend in air pollution which reflects the air becoming more toxic in the country""./Emergency measures such as a ban on entry of trucks in city limits and stopping of construction and industrial activities come into effect in case air quality remains in the same zone for more than 48 hours as per the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) enforced by a Supreme Court-appointed committee to fight against Delhi's annual public health emergency due to winter pollution. The measures include radical steps such as shutting schools and curtailing private vehicles if the high pollution levels persist./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mishra added that he was aware of the ICMR and health ministry's steering committee reports./Balakrishnan, who was also the lead author of the ICMR study, said: ""We have observed that people exposed to high level of air pollution suffer tissue ageing and inflammatory responses alongside other risk factors. In areas with high air pollution there is higher premature mortality.""/She added that while India doesn't have long-term cohort studies on premature mortality related to air pollution, there are short-term studies. ""So, there is no reason to doubt the relationship between premature mortality and air pollution. Long term cohort studies will take a very long time to roll out,"" she added./The Lok Sabha query answered on January 4 also says that ""there is no increasing trend in air pollution which reflects the air becoming more toxic in the country""./Emergency measures such as a ban on entry of trucks in city limits and stopping of construction and industrial activities come into effect in case air quality remains in the same zone for more than 48 hours as per the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) enforced by a Supreme Court-appointed committee to fight against Delhi's annual public health emergency due to winter pollution./The measures include radical steps such as shutting schools and curtailing private vehicles if the high pollution levels persist./(With inputs from Vatsala Shrangi)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How foul air makes our life miserable,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 28 -- ""It must be good to get away from Delhi's pollution.""/That was the first reaction of almost everyone I met on a vacation in the southern hill town of Madikeri, Karnataka. It is almost as if the national capital conjures up just this one vision: of people in masks walking under a smog-laden sky, quite like the spectacle of Beijing's 'airpocalypse'./This, most Delhi residents would agree, is hardly an exaggeration. Air pollution has hit the national capital like no other health or environmental crises ever before. City doctors say it is suppressing our immunity, making us vulnerable to respiratory disorders, heart attacks and cancer, and is reducing the overall life expectancy./While past studies have indicated that long-term exposure to toxic air could impede overall cognitive performance among the elderly (Peking and Yale Universities) and school going children (Erasmus University), a new study from China now shows that acute pollution is also associated with a drop in people's happiness levels./Researchers from USA's Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and its China Future City Lab analysed 210 million geotagged tweets from China's largest microblogging platform, Sina Weibo, to track how daily pollution levels impacted people's happiness in 144 Chinese cities. They published the results in Nature Human Behaviour last week./Applying a machine-learning algorithm and merging this index with the daily PM2.5 concentration and weather data, the study found a significantly negative correlation between pollution and happiness levels. Women were more sensitive to higher pollution levels than men, as were those on higher incomes./Weather is known to affect moods. The Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), marked by a persistent low mood, irritability, despair and lack of energy, is common among people living in extremely cold climates./The impact can get grimmer with pollution./The Great London Smog of 1952 probably explains how the generational memory deepened the British obsession with weather./""Environment does play a role in the human mind. In the same context, noise and air pollution does disturb the mood and affects cognition,"" says Dr Rajesh Sagar, a professor of psychiatry at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./While no study has measured the impact of Delhi's foul air on its residents' moods yet, there are enough anecdotes to suggest that pollution is affecting our daily routine and behaviour./Last November, even a Supreme Court judge remarked how he could not go for his morning walk due to pollution. He is not the only one watching the air quality levels. Smartphone applications offering live feeds on air quality are among popular downloads, with many using one to decide their exercise regimen and outdoor activities./Schools shut down when air quality deteriorates to emergency levels. On days when pollution enters the severe zone, principals are advised to restrict or reschedule outdoor activities. Many parents I know avoid sending their children to the park when the air is very bad. We all know that playing is essential to the cognitive, physical, social and emotional wellbeing of children. But with research showing how air pollution has compromised lung function of so many children in Delhi, can we blame the parents and teachers for keeping their young ones indoors?/Not till long ago, October used to be the beginning of the tourist season in Delhi. Now, many residents, especially those suffering from bronchial diseases, leave Delhi to escape the weeks that witness farm stubble burning and the Diwali cracker blitzkrieg. Likewise, many non-resident Indians reschedule their annual homecoming and even tourists tend to avoid the city when air pollution peaks./Many have installed air purifiers in their homes, offices and even cars. However, being confined indoors is an unrealistic compromise to avoid pollution and no private measure can help when one steps out in a city where the air quality vacillates between poor and severe for more than 200 days in a year./In any case, private solutions to air pollution are never democratic. A vast majority of the citizenry cannot afford any air-purifying contraption. Their work demands that they spend long hours outdoors. Pollution is probably the least of their concerns. But that does not mean that they have given up their right to clean air. It is time the authorities stopped quibbling, went beyond whataboutery and honoured that right./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How to pollution proof your skin,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 2 -- It is a well-known fact that ultraviolet radiation, ozone, and cigarette smoke impacts the skin negatively. However, it is extremely necessary for us to be aware of the effects of air pollution on our skin so that we can take preventive measures actively./Other than the hazardous gases like carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), prolonged and repetitive exposure to particulate matter (PM) significantly damages the outermost barrier of the skin by breaking down collagen and lipids held within it./What is the much discussed PM 2.5?/PM 2.5 are fine particles, measuring less than 2.5micro m in diameter, which are emitted from automobile exhaust, open fires and power plants. These particulate matter attach with them various chemicals derived from fuels and pesticides, which when enter the skin, create free radicals and highly unstable molecules, causing skin sensitisation and ageing. Additionally, pollution can also cause allergic skin conditions and rashes, pigmentation and dark spots, dehydration and wrinkles, and breakouts. Studies also show that women who live in polluted cities have a skin that is 10% older than other women./How should we pollution-proof our skin?/Other than reducing exposure, we must focus on protecting and repairing the skin barrier. A regular skin care routine is a must for all, regardless of the skin type one has. Cleansing the face at least twice a day is the foremost step to remove off the dirt and grime. Next step is to moisturise. One must add this step to their skincare regimen to create a protective barrier. And then, 15 minutes before stepping out of the house, application of sunscreen with minimum SPF 30 is mandatory for complete protection. Do not forget to take off your makeup and moisturise your skin before you go to sleep./To get rid of the accumulated pollutants and to let healthy cells move to the surface of the skin, exfoliation can be done via chemical peels and microdermabrasion./To strengthen the immune function of your skin, oral anti-oxidants are extremely beneficial. Nutraceuticals available in the market combat the effects of pollutants. Also make sure to drink plenty of water and have citrus fruits and green leafy vegetables to detoxify your body!/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"World Cancer Day: High level of nitrous oxide, other pollutants in air lead to cancer","India, Feb. 4 -- Common mistakes in our daily lives have a strong link to various types of cancer. Doctors said history of patients in the OPD has found this link./""When patients of liver and gall bladder cancer were asked about their history a large number of them told they suffered with infections. Similarly those with oral cancer said that they consumed tobacco and paan masala,"" said Dr Shailendra Kumar of the general surgery department at the King George's medical University./He said that about 10% cases are of cancer in OPDs which indicate people are becoming vulnerable to diseases with sedentary lifestyle, lack of vitamins and other necessary elements to fight diseases. ""Cancer has also a link to high level of nitrous oxide and other pollutants in the air as many cases told they live in areas with high air pollution. The cancer cervix is linked to poor hygiene,"" said Dr Shailandra Kumar./""Young adults are fast becoming victim of the diseases. We have cases as young as 27-years, 29-years, and 32-years of age. There are patients who do not have any risk factor such as tobacco use or a family history. hence screening also becomes important in case people live in vulnerable atmosphere,"" said Dr Ved Prakash, senior faculty at the King George's Medical University./He said with advances in diagnosis it is now possible to get results even with small samples in biopsy which earlier were not possible. ""With microRNA the issue of sample size is also eliminated,"" said Dr Ved./Cancer burden in India has more than doubled over the last 26 years said Dr Harshvardhan Atreya, Medical Oncologist, Apollomedics Super Speciality Hospital in a press statement. He said that usually patient goes into depression when comes across such decease but here has been considerable progress in the successful treatment of cancer in past years./The superspeciality cancer hospital at CG City has organised a cancer screening camp on Monday from 9.30 am to 2 pm. ""Residents of Lucknow and its suburbs are requested to utilise the services of specialist doctors of the institute if anyone is having the signs or symptoms, which may be the warning signs of the disease,"" said Sharad Singh of the hospital./The common signs of cancer may be/# Unusual, rapid and unexplained weight loss / anemia/# Blood mixed urine/bleeding during urination, Blood with stools/# Chronic cough not relieved by any common medication/ blood mixed sputum on cough/# Lump in the breast/# Difficulty in swallowing, solid or liquid food/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Ganga flow may rise till 2050, then fall abruptly","NEW DELHI, Feb. 6 -- Climate change will begin altering water levels in the Ganga and the Brahmaputra in the next three decades, and after 2050, the rivers could record an abrupt decrease in flow, according to a study on the Hindu Kush and Himalayan (HKH) region that predicts disruptions which could jeopardise agriculture and access to drinking water./The findings are part of the 600-page report from Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which includes 210 authors who studied the ecology of the Hindu Kush and Himalayan region. The report, released on Monday, predicts that a third of glaciers in the HKH region will thaw if average global temperatures rise by 1.5 degree C./For the Ganga, Brahmaputra and Indus, the report adds that water flow will gradually rise till 2050 before they start to plummet. This, the assessment adds, will consequently diminish the water available for drinking, irrigating farms, and producing electricity for roughly 250 million people living downstream./""Although increases in meltwater are likely for the next few decades, melt water volume is likely to decrease abruptly once glacial storage is reduced,"" the assessment said. Glacial storage refers to the amount of ice buildup that will turn into meltwater./The impact will be most pronounced in the upper reaches. River flow in the plains are also influenced by rains. The report warns that these predictions are based on an assumption of 1.5 degreeC warming - a level the United Nations's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes will be hit in early 2040s - and if the warming is more, the consequences will be higher. Two-thirds of the ice could vanish if governments fail to rein in greenhouse gas emissions this century, the report says./According to an expert, the link between glacial melt with river flow depends on several factors. ""Whether glacial retreat is going to contribute to increase in meltwater depends on the nature of retreat... Glacial melt is not directly proportional to increase in meltwater in rivers.

"Vaccines saves lives, ignorance jeopardises them","India, Feb. 10 -- Rumours, falsehoods and blatant fabrications about the side effects of vaccination spread faster than the common cold, leading to misplaced fears and refusal to get vaccinated, which is among the most cost-effective ways of preventing disease and death. Vaccination prevents 2-3 million deaths worldwide each year, and an additional 1.5 million lives would be saved if everyone got vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)./Vaccinating at least 95% of the population builds community immunity and protects even those who have missed vaccination and remain susceptible to infection. Mass vaccination led to the global eradication of smallpox in 1979, with the last case reported in Somalia in 1977. Caused by the variola virus, smallpox was a devastating disease that infected at least 50 million people a year globally in the 1950s and killed an estimated 300 million in 20th century, compared to the 100 million people who died in wars and armed conflict during the same period./India was declared free of smallpox two years after the last indigenous case was reported in the Katihar district of Bihar on July 5, 1975. Mass vaccination campaigns made eradication possible within a year of smallpox devastating Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal in 1974, when India recorded at least 61,000 cases and 15,000 deaths./The global polio eradication efforts best exemplify vaccination's hits and misses. India got polio cases down from 741 in 2009 - the highest in the world -- to one within a year, with the last case was confirmed in West Bengal on January 13, 2011. Gaps in vaccination has lef to polio persisting in neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan, which together had 50 cases last year and have reported one case each in January, 2019./Resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases led to the WHO to list ""vaccine hesitancy"" - the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite availability and affordability - as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019, along with air pollution and climate change; non-communicable diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancers; global influenza pandemic; antimicrobial resistance; and infectious diseases such as ebola, dengue and HIV./India's public health gains accrued from polio eradication are being whittled away by the uninformed resistance to measles-rubella vaccine, which is given in two doses to children aged 9 months to 15 years. Parents are leading the charge in many states, including in Delhi, where they stalled the campaign by moving Delhi High Court, which issued an interim order saying all efforts must be made to get parental consent before vaccinating children./MR vaccination coverage ranges from a high 100% in Himachal, Arunachal and Telangana, to at least 95% in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Andhra, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, 87.62% in Maharastra. The campaign is currently running in Bihar (37.58% coverage till Feb 6) and Madhya Pradesh (51.04%), and are scheduled for July in Rajasthan and August in Sikkim./The MR vaccine is safe and has saved more than 21 million lives since 2000, , according to WHO.

Stubble burning cost $150bn in 5 yrs: Study,"NEW DELHI, March 5 -- A new study has found that people living in areas that see intense agricultural crop residue burning (ACRB) are three times as likely to contract acute respiratory infection (ARI) compared to those in other areas, with children under the age of five being particularly susceptible./The study, by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) University of Washington estimated that eliminating crop residue burning could add 14.9 million life years in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi that would otherwise be lost to disability and disease./The economic life years lost is estimated to be at least $150 billion over five years according to the IFPRI study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology./The study arrives at its conclusions by merging fourth districtlevel health survey data for 2013 with satellite data on crop fires in Haryana./Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu where there is no stubble burning were used for comparison./The frequency of ARI symptoms in Haryana closely related to the number of fires observed./In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu the frequency of ARI cases was far lower, the study found. Crop burning in Haryana and Punjab was most intense in 2013 according to the study. In Haryana, 5.4% of surveyed individuals reported ARI symptoms as compared to only 0.1% in the southern states compared./Delhi has amongst the worst air quality in the world. According to another recent study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi, the University of California, University of Illinois, and reported by Hindu stan Times last week, Delhi's air pollution sees two spikes - one coinciding with the stubble burning season in Punjab and Haryana, and the other with a sharp dip in temperature. Stubble burning during October and November in Punjab and Haryana contributes to air pollution in the national capital and creates toxic smog as it mixes with fog during winter every year. Even though overall air quality in 2018 was better than previous years, in December, Delhi encountered one of its longest spells of severe air./In Haryana 17.5% of people interviewed for the study lived in districts reporting 100 or more crop fires per day. Researchers concluded that living in a district with more than a 100 crop fires per day is associated with a threefold higher risk of ARI. Other risk factors include being less than five years old, living in areas with vehicular congestion, and using biomass for cooking among others./The Centre allocated Rs1,140.3 crore in the 2018 Budget for agricultural mechanisation in Punjab and Haryana aimed at clearing fields of stubble ahead of the new sowing season./Last year, a Nasa study, authored by scientists Hiren Jethva and Omar Torres from the Universities Space Research Association used data from the Indian agriculture ministry to show that rice crop production post monsoon in north-western India increased by 0.18 million tonnes per year between 2002 and 2016. The rise is consistent with the rise in crop fire numbers in Punjab and Haryana, from about 8,000 in 2002 to about 16,500 in 2016./Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union in Punjab, said, ""We notice a rise in respiratory diseases during stubble burning season but most farmers don't have access to straw management machinery [to deal with stubble and therefore resort to burning]. The 40% subsidy being offered on the machinery is just not enough because the cost of machines have also increased. For example, the cost of rotavator has increased from Rs70,000 to Rs1.2 lakh last year. Farmers should be compensated properly.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"For polluted NCR cities, it's time to act now, say experts","GURUGRAM, March 6 -- Gurugram has emerged as the most polluted city in the world in 2018, according to a new report. The report, compiled and analysed by IQ AirVisual, a software company that tracks pollution worldwide, and environmental NGO Greenpeace, found that the city had received highest annual concentration of PM 2.5 in 2018. The report once again puts the spotlight on the poor air quality in the city. While experts said the city had failed to take constructive steps towards curbing air pollution, they also expressed scepticism about the methodology adopted by the study./Dipankar Saha, former head of the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) air quality lab, said all the top polluted cities as per the report, including Gurugram, were in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which played a crucial role in determining the pollution levels in the city, says Saha. ""The air quality in this region is problematic due to accumulation of dust from neighbouring areas and poor ventilation index that does not allow proper dispersion of pollution,"" he added./Saha also said there were other important local factors that contributed towards the city's air quality./Ground-level emissions were another important influencing factor. ""The city receives a lot of transported dust from the northwest and west. Additionally, ground-level emission problems are severe in Gurugram,"" Saha said. The Aravallis, he said, was crucial and could act as buffer for the city. However, recent amendments to the Punjab Land Preservation Act, and proposals that sought the construction of a road through the Aravallis have experts in the city worried./""Time and again, the government keeps announcing plans that either seek to build a road around the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, or more recently the amendment to the PLPA. Moves like these simply demonstrate the government's lack of political will,"" said Namita Gupta, an air quality expert in Gurugram, and founder of a city-based air quality consulting company./She also said little was being done on the ground to keep a check on construction activities, a major source of dust. ""Everywhere you go, the roads are dug up. Delhi has pockets of construction going on, but Gurugram has construction going on everywhere. It is a developing city, but one cannot override environmental concerns in favour of development,"" Gupta added./She also said vehicular emission was an area of concern. ""Delhi has CNG requirement for public transport. Gurugram doesn't even have that. They have done nothing to remove vehicles spewing black smoke. Vehicular emission is probably higher in Gurugram. They haven't taken any of the good enforcements from Delhi and applied it here,"" she said./Excessive dependance on diesel generators was also an important factor why emissions were being added. ""Everyone use these gensets. Why can't the government promote solar energy and control the use of these gensets? There is no will from the government's end to take concrete steps."" said Gupta./Sachin Panwar, an air quality scientist, said that while the CPCB had issued multiple guidelines regarding checks on construction in the city, there was little implementation on the ground./NOIDA POLLUTED TOO/According to a recent report by an international NGO, Ghaziabad is the second most polluted city in the world, while Noida is sixth. This is despite tall claims made by departments of both cities that complaints were regularly addressed and many steps were taken to control pollution./Officials, however, said that real time statistics are monitored differently from parameters used in the report compiled by environmental NGO Greenpeace.

"'Green cracker' formula close, but petitioner raises red flags","New Delhi, March 6 -- Months after the Supreme Court said only ""green firecrackers"" can be used in parts of the country during Diwali and other festivities, an expert body on Tuesday said for the first time that such firecrackers could be produced by reducing certain harmful chemicals./The expert panel, comprising members of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), told a bench led by justice AK SIkri on Tuesday about the trial production of crackers with less barium nitrate and potassium nitrate in Tamil Nadu's Sivakasi, the country's biggest firework manufacturing hub./While banning the use of conventional fire crackers during Diwali last October because they contributed to noise and air pollution, particularly in parts of north India including the National Capital Region (NCR), the court permitted the use of ""green crackers"" in NCR./But vendors across NCR?said at the time that they did not know what ""green crackers"" were since no such products were in existence./A report by a research group Urban Emissions said that in 2018, as much as 5 million kilogrammes of firecrackers were burnt in the region./This was despite the Supreme Court virtually banning all conventional firecrackers (the only kind being produced at the time) and that led to an emission of 150,000 kilogrammes of PM2.5, which lingered on in the atmosphere as a thick, choking haze./Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the petitioner, told the top court that the new formulation includes barium nitrate and potassium nitrate, and that the government should review the new formulation since it had said that barium nitrate cannot be used in firecrackers. He added that the two chemicals cannot be added to the ""green"" formulation./The expert committee conducted the trials in Sivakasi following last year's court order to work out a new formula for ""green crackers"" that didn't contain toxic chemicals. According to the committee, the reduced quantity of conventional formulations such as barium nitrate and potassium nitrate could reduce PM2.5 emissions significantly. The court on the last date of hearing on February 20 rebuked the authorities for not notifying the standards for green crackers in line with its order banning polluting fireworks and promoting the use of environment-friendly ones. It directed Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) to fix the norms soon, rejecting a request for three more months to carry out the task. The minutes of a meeting of the expert committee handed over to the bench on Tuesday said new formulations with additives provided by NEERI-CSIR had been prepared and fireworks were developed and tested for the efficiency of green or improved crackers./The bench told PESO counsel to file a proper affidavit with details of the formulations and asked the petitioners' lawyer to file a response to the expert body's suggestion before the next date of hearing, which is March 12./The petitioners in the case are three minors who had moved the top court seeking a ban on the use of fireworks. Justice Sikri said the report was based on the finding of technical experts and cannot be brushed away. The court also asked for the Centre's response to the report./Earlier senior advocates CS Vaidyanathan and Rajiv Datta, appearing for cracker manufacturers, pleaded that the court pass some interim orders for the resumption of production of crackers. About 800,000 families depend for their livelihood ion the hundreds of cracker manufacturing units in Tamil Nadu and other parts of the country, they said./The petition was filed in September 2015 on behalf of three infants - two six-month olds and a 14-month old. Their fathers represented the petitioners, expressing concern over the health of the children./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

What makes Gurugram the most polluted city in the world,"India, March 6 -- Gurugram has emerged as the most polluted city in the world in 2018, according to a new report. The report, compiled and analysed by IQ AirVisual, a software company that tracks pollution worldwide, and environmental NGO Greenpeace, found that the city had received highest annual concentration of PM 2.5 in 2018./The report once again puts the spotlight on the poor air quality in the city. While experts said the city had failed to take constructive steps towards curbing air pollution, they also expressed scepticism about the methodology adopted by the study./Dipankar Saha, former head of the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) air quality lab, said all the top polluted cities as per the report, including Gurugram, were in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which played a crucial role in determining the pollution levels in the city, says Saha. ""The air quality in this region is problematic due to accumulation of dust from neighbouring areas and poor ventilation index that does not allow proper dispersion of pollution,"" he added./Saha also said there were other important local factors that contributed towards the city's air quality./Ground-level emissions were another important influencing factor. ""The city receives a lot of transported dust from the north-west and west. Additionally, ground-level emission problems are severe in Gurugram,"" Saha said. The Aravallis, he said, was crucial and could act as buffer for the city. However, recent amendments to the Punjab Land Preservation Act, and proposals that sought the construction of a road through the Aravallis have experts in the city worried./""Time and again, the government keeps announcing plans that either seek to build a road around the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, or more recently the amendment to the PLPA. Moves like these simply demonstrate the government's lack of political will,"" said Namita Gupta, an air quality expert in Gurugram, and founder of a city-based air quality consulting company./She also said little was being done on the ground to keep a check on construction activities, a major source of dust. ""Everywhere you go, the roads are dug up. Delhi has pockets of construction going on, but Gurugram has construction going on everywhere. It is a developing city, but one cannot override environmental concerns in favour of development,"" Gupta added./She also said vehicular emission was an area of concern. ""Delhi has CNG requirement for public transport. Gurugram doesn't even have that. They have done nothing to remove vehicles spewing black smoke. Vehicular emission is probably higher in Gurugram. They haven't taken any of the good enforcements from Delhi and applied it here,"" she said./Excessive dependance on diesel generators was also an important factor why emissions were being added. ""Everyone use these gensets. Why can't the government promote solar energy and control the use of these gensets? There is no will from the government's end to take concrete steps."" said Gupta./Sachin Panwar, an air quality scientist, said that while the CPCB had issued multiple guidelines regarding checks on construction in the city, there was little implementation on the ground./""While we keep hearing that fines have been issued, one can't really say if that is being done. Officers often say the area is not falling in their jurisdiction and no steps are taken to fine people. Similarly, there are talks about controlling garbage burning, but one can still find that these continue to happen,"" said Panwar./Panwar also said it was important to hold the report to scrutiny./""When we label a city with titles like these, it is important to assess the data set being used. The data in the city is not truly representative since there are few air quality monitors, and they do not work accurately all the time."" Gupta also said it was important to factor in the methodology adopted./""It depends on the sample size. Additionally, due to the lack of air quality monitors in the city, one needs to be careful while drawing such conclusions from these reports,"" said Gupta./Government officials, however, said they are taking adequate steps towards improving the city's air quality./""We are actively taking steps to ensure that construction activity and other activities that add to pollution are controlled. The city did fairly well in implementing the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). Additionally, we will take steps to ensure that those who violate the rules are fined. We also plan to get more air quality monitoring stations,"" Kuldeep Singh, regional officer (Gurugram), Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said./Residents, however, said pollution had been a major cause of concern for them over the last year. Tanya Sharma, a private school teacher, said her health troubles had increased over that time. ""I moved to the city in May last year. Since then, I have been experiencing breathing problems. Doctors tell I have allergic bronchitis and the poor air doesn't help. In fact, it's only after moving to the city that these concerns became a constant.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Remove barriers, promote culture of walking in Delhi","India, March 15 -- Walking conditions in the city were never in favour of pedestrians due to segregated land use, low population density and vehicle-centric primary street network development, which increased the distance of travel, encouraged high speed motorised vehicles and incentivised heavy ownership of private vehicles./In the absence of a comprehensive mobility plan, the road-owning agencies continued to construct flyovers, elevated roads, etc, for decongesting roads and subways/foot overbridges for safe pedestrian crossings - all as stand-alone construction projects, which failed to solve both traffic congestion and pedestrian safety problems./With this background, a sincere effort was made by the Central government to create a notified body - Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre - in 2008 to oversee planning and development of all transportation infrastructure in the city, by coordinating with all agencies, monitoring mobility planning proposals for integration and approving projects after due deliberations with all stakeholders. To provide guidance for inclusive and environment-friendly mobility system planning UTTIPEC came out with various guidelines that were deliberated and approved for the adoption and implementation of mobility-related infrastructure development for the city.

Global environmental problems have no national solutions,"India, March 18 -- Last week, the United Nations released a landmark report, The Global Environment Outlook (GEO), which made two important points that all national governments need to take seriously: One, environment damage (deadly emissions, chemicals polluting drinking water, and the accelerating destruction of ecosystems) is responsible for a quarter of premature deaths and diseases across the world. Second, there is a growing chasm between rich and poor countries as rampant overconsumption, pollution and food waste in the developed world is leading to hunger, poverty and disease elsewhere./While the report, which was six years in the making, and has been compiled by 250 scientists from 70 countries, does not paint a positive picture of the world, the heartening news is that scientists feel that, despite the challenges, the situation can be rectified. This is true. Food waste, for instance, which accounts for 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, can be reduced. The world currently throws away a third of all food produced. In richer nations, 56% goes to waste. Then the report says 1.4 million people die each year from preventable diseases such as diarrhoea and parasites linked to pathogen-riddled water and poor sanitation. This can also be tackled by providing clean water and also investing in processes that can lead to a behavioural change in people./In the past one year, there have been several reports that have warned national governments about the perils of ignoring such mounting environmental challenges. While each of these reports have appraised the scope and nature of different challenges - from air pollution to biodiversity - the most important takeaway from all these reports is that many of these are global problems. Many of these environmental problems (climate change being the big one), as Israeli academic and author of the bestseller, Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari, says, have no national solutions. Global cooperation is the first and necessary step to successfully face these challenges. With many world leaders such as US President Donald Trump showing a lack of interest in combating climate change, the road ahead will not be easy. Unfortunately, the brunt of such irresponsible behaviour will be borne by developing countries such as India./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Omega-3 rich diets linked to lower asthma symptoms in children: Study,"India, March 29 -- A new study has found that consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids is linked to fewer childhood asthma symptoms which are triggered by indoor air pollution./The study published in 'American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine', lays out that families and health care providers may be able to protect children from harmful effects of indoor air pollution by serving a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids while reducing foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids such as soyabean oil and corn oil./""Our group is working on ways to reduce the levels of indoor air pollution in Baltimore City homes,"" said lead author of the study, Emily Brigham./""Results are promising, but we don't want to stop there,"" Brigham added./The study found that for each additional gram of omega-6 intake, children had 29 per cent higher odds of being in a more severe asthma category. Conversely, with each 0.1-gram increase in levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet, researchers saw 3 to 4 per cent lower odds of daytime asthma symptoms./Indoor air pollution, from sources including cooking, cleaning activities and cigarette smoke, is a known trigger for asthma symptoms./Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found abundantly in fish and certain nuts and seeds, are considered healthy as they are known to reduce inflammation. Omega-6 fatty acids, primarily found in vegetable oils (including corn, soybean, safflower, and sunflower), as came out in other studies, have mixed effects on health, but have the potential to promote inflammation./The researchers, however, noted that it doesn't prove the relationship between fatty acids and asthma severity./""Among populations known to be disproportionately affected by asthma, we may find that improving diet and air pollution together has the greatest impact on health,"" said Brigham./Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Residents of Wagholi in Pune hold silent protest to fight garbage woes,"India, March 31 -- At least 200 residents of the Wagholi housing societies association held a silent protest on Saturday, against the delay in setting up a garbage composting plant in the area. Due to the absence of a composting plant, garbage is being burnt in an open area which causes air pollution and health problems, allege the residents./After discussing the issue with the administration for a year, the residents of Wagholi got a garbage processing plant approved by the gram panchayat, but even after ten months, the plant is not operational. The agreement states that work will commence in four months./The protest began from the Wageshwar temple to the garbage dumping depot. The residents demand that the gram panchayat should complete the work and make the plant operation by April 10, 2019./""Since many months we are suffering from health problems due to the smoke that is generated from the burning of garbage at the depot,"" said Haracharanjeet Bhutalia, a resident of Wagholi./Lynne McGready, who shifted to Wagholi three years ago, said, ""Despite promising that the garbage will be collected and segregated daily by the gram panchayat, there has been no change in the system at all.""/""The gram panchayat is aware of the issue and we want to bring it to their notice that their promise has not been fulfilled,"" she added./After a discussion of members of the gram panchayat, contractor, police and residents, the gram panchayat agreed to complete the work and make operational the garbage composting plant by April 10./""If the plant does not get operational by April 10, then a special gram sabha will be held on April 15, to oust the current agency and penalise and confiscate their current setup. Also, a joint committee of residents and gram panchayat officials (ward wise) will be formed to look into the garbage issue,"" said Nitin Kumar Jain, member of Wagholi housing societies association./The gram panchayat will also conduct an awareness campaign for garbage segregation in Wagholi.

Diabetes deaths due to air pollution highest in India,"NEW DELHI, April 3 -- The burden of Type 2 diabetes contributed by exposure to fine particulate pollution is the highest in India, according to the State of Global Air 2019 report released on Wednesday. Air pollution lowers insulin sensitivity, contributing to diabetes./In 2017, exposure to PM 2.5 pollution was found to be the third leading risk factor globally for Type 2 diabetes-related deaths and disability after high blood sugar and excessive body weight./Globally, such exposure contributed to about 2.76 lakh deaths and 15.2 million life years lost to disability in 2017. This burden was highest in India, where it accounted for 55,000 deaths and 2.7 million life years lost, according to the report by Health Effects Institute (HEI) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease project. India was followed by China, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil./""PM 2.5 particles are endocrine disruptors. They can affect insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. They can also damage the beta cells in the pancreas that produces insulin... the exact pathways are not known yet. But increasingly, research is showing these connections. So apart from poor diet, obesity etc., air pollution definitely plays a role in diabetes,"" said Dr Vishwanathan Mohan, diabetologist and chairman of Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialties Centre/Diabetes affected at least 65 million people in India in 2017, according to The Lancet Global Health study released last year./In 2017, diabetes accounted for more than one million deaths and 57 million life years lost globally - an increase of 175% and 141%, respectively, since 1990./India also tops a list of 13 countries, with populations over 50 million, in which more than 10% of the population was exposed to household air pollution by use of solid fuels. About 60% of India's population was exposed to household pollution, followed by China with 32%. However, the report recognises that the proportion of households cooking with solid fuels in India has dipped from 76% in 2005 to 60% (846 million) in 2017, ""due in part to a major government program to shift households from solid fuels to liquefied petroleum gas.""/""India has initiated major steps to address pollution sources: the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG program, accelerated Bharat Stage VI vehicle standards, and the new National Clean Air Programme. These and future initiatives have the potential, if fully implemented as part of a sustained commitment to air quality, to result in significant health benefits in coming years,"" said Robert O'Keefe, vice president, Health Effects Institute, Boston, US./Exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution together contributed to over 1.2 million deaths in India and China in 2017, the report said. Globally, air pollution (PM 2.5, household and ozone emissions) is estimated to have contributed to about 4.9 million deaths - 8.7% of all deaths globally and 5.9% of all life years lost to disability. India and China have the highest health burden from air pollution, followed by Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Nigeria./Since 1990, there has been a 68% jump in the number of deaths attributed to PM 2.5 exposure, with the largest spike between 1990 and 2010./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution can affect your heart,"New Delhi, April 7 -- The level of air pollution in Delhi is the worst in comparison to other major cities around the world, says a WHO survey. It also has the fifth largest death rate of 1.5 million people dying every year. The short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) present in air pollution contributes to acute cardiovascular, and may reduce life expectancy by a few years./Air pollutants have been linked with blood vessel lining (endothelial) injury and construction of blood vessel, raised blood pressure, hypercoagulability, systemic inflammatory and oxidative stress response. Particulate matter can also cause autonomic imbalance leading to arrhythmia. The main source of PM 2.5 throughout the world is due to the human combustion of fossil fuels./The existing evidence suggests that particulate matter air pollution is capable of augmenting the development and progression of blockage in arteries. Most recent studies support that the overall absolute risk of mortality due to PM exposure is greater for heart diseases than lung diseases./TIPS TO FOLLOW/All patients of heart diseases should be educated about the increased risk posed by air pollution Consideration should also be given to educating the patients with multiple risk factors like diabetes and hypertension Reducing vigorous activities and choosing less strenuous activities (such as going for a walk instead of a jog) Certain filters and room air purifiers are available that help in reducing indoor particles/Drive with closed windows, exercise indoors and avoid traveling and commuting during rush hours./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution a public health disaster, needs a concerted combat strategy","India, April 10 -- I am writing this article after starting a five-day course of antibiotics, as advised by my ENT specialist. The advice also includes wearing a mask. He was clear that this is nothing to do with the change of season or last Sunday's thunderstorm, but the level of air pollution, as the city air continues to remain toxic. While my ENT was precise with his advice and observation, I wonder, if we, including policy makers, have really understood the impact of air pollution on human health?/I, unfortunately, think not. The air pollution conversation in India usually develops around the start of winter. This coincides with two episodic events, i.e., Diwali and crop burning. The conversation ends around the new year, which again coincides with the change in weather. However, pollution does not disappear for the rest of the year, as we often think./For example, Gurugram had only three good air quality days in all of 2018. Yes, three good air quality days out of 365 days!/So, while we may doubt the data or argue that there is no conclusive evidence of the impacts of air pollution on public health, the fact of the matter is that all new data and studies are suggesting that air pollution is a much bigger problem than we anticipated. Let me give three recent examples:/India is the diabetes capital of the world, with over 5 crore people suffering from this chronic disease. It's a condition wherein the body cannot produce insulin. Changing lifestyles and diets have often been blamed for this disease but air pollution could also be a reason. A research by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences' Fuwai Hospital and Emory University from USA showed that for every 10 cubic metres of long-term exposure of PM2.5, the risk of diabetes increased by almost 16%. PM2.5 are particulate matter that are less than 2.5 microns and includes toxins such as sulphate black carbons and sulphates. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and have also been associated with lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, heart diseases but this new study also links them to diabetes. It is estimated that by 2030, nearly 9% of the India's population is likely to suffer from diabetes. This is surely a large number to ignore./So, before we doubt data, as we normally do, and, in this case, it is Chinese data, numerous empirical research and data shows that air pollution is a serious issue in India. According to recent data collected by an IT firm and a travel portal for their employees in Gurugram, about half the respondents in the survey of these two companies confirmed that someone in their families have suffered from air quality related diseases in the last one year. Around threefourth of the employees suggested to move out of Delhi due to winter smog and an equal number of employees preferred to skip the annual increment in lieu of better air./What was even more surprising that on an average the family spends around Rs.15,000 per annum for treating air quality related diseases. As per NASSCOM, there are 3.5 lakh IT BPO jobs in Delhi-NCR and assuming the same rates are applicable, this means that Rs 260 crore is spent every year on air pollution related illnesses. This is only by the IT BPO companies. If one adds other employees, the number will be hugely significant. Also, the expenditure comes from the employees' pay, putting them on a huge financial strain./The World Health Organization's report on air pollution and child health highlights damaging impact of air pollution on health and survival of children. The report estimates that 180 crore or 93% of world's children breathe toxic air. A third of these are children are under the age of five./The result is that around 7 lakh children under the age of five die every year due to air pollution. Also, the problem is much more acute in India as the WHO report indicates that 14 of the 15 most polluted cities in the world are in India. WHO's study estimates that 1 in 10 children, under the age of five, dies in India due to air pollution./The number is in excess of over one lakh a year. In addition, air pollution is also responsible for cancer in children, asthma, pneumonia and other types of acute lower respiratory diseases./This clearly shows the impact of air pollution on health and survival of children./A couple of days ago, London rolled our ultra-low emission zone program with the objective to reduce road transport emissions almost half. It's time for Delhi-NCR take this fight against air pollution and be the champion for change./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
