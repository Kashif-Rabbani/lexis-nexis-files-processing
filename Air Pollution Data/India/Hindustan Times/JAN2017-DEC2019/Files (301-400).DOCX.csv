""Wearing masks for 12 hours can get uncomfortable. They obstruct the airflow into the nostrils, making it very difficult to breathe,"" said assistant sub-inspector Lakshman Singh Baghel./Many policemen complained of throat and nose infections, which doctors said were possibly caused by reuse of masks after they had outlived their utility./""These are disposable masks; and the high levels of pollution that we are seeing these days one needs to change it every day. Carrying forward can actually be counter-productive as a combination of dust and moisture gives rise to growth of bacteria and fungus,"" said Dr RK Singal, head of internal medicine department, BLK super speciality hospital./""Infected surfaces close to the airway can cause severe infection. It's worse in case of developing fungal infection that is hard to treat and takes longer to respond to medicines.

"After a brief lull, pollution in city again in severe zone","NEW DELHI, Dec. 5 -- Delhi is on the brink again. The city is plunging into severe levels of air pollution once again, more than a fortnight after it was engulfed by a week-long haze in November./Monday's average Air Quality Index of Delhi shot up to 390 from 351 on Sunday. An AQI value above 400 on the scale of 500 is considered as severe pollution. Such high levels of pollution were last seen on November 14 when the city had just come out of the week-long haze./""Even though the average AQI is yet to hit severe levels, several monitoring stations in the city such as Shadipur, RK Puram, Anand Vihar, Siri Fort and CRRI had already entered the severe zone,"" said a senior official of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee./The levels of particulate matter - the dominant and one of the most dangerous pollutants - also shot up to alarming levels. At around 7 pm on Monday, the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 had already shot up around 4.5 times the safe standards./While PM concentration had touched 448ug/m3 around 7 pm, the level of PM2.5 had soared to 272ug/m3./According to the Graded Response Action Plan, if the level of PM10 and PM2.5 hits the 500 and 300-mark respectively and stays there for at least two days, emergency measures such as road rationing, shutting down of schools and ban on construction activities would be introduced./Experts said that it is because of the adverse meteorological conditions that pollution levels have spiked again./""The low wind speed and high moisture levels in the air have pushed up pollution levels. While on one hand the moisture is trapping the pollutants in the air, the calm winds are not being able to flush out the pollutants. Pollutants are accumulating,"" said D Saha, head of the air quality laboratory at CPCB./The regional weather forecasting centre at New Delhi has forecast that there could be light rain on Wednesday. Monday's partially cloudy sky was a prelude to the coming rains./""An outflow of the cyclone has reached northwest India. This is likely to trigger some light rain or drizzle on Wednesday. There could be some thunder on Tuesday evening. On Thursday we are expecting some shallow fog after which the sky could clear up as winds could pick up speed again,"" said Kuldeep Srivasatava, a scientist with the regional weather forecast department./SAFAR, India's official pollution forecasting system under the union ministry of earth sciences, has forecast that pollution levels could rise till Thursday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

NGT blasts authorities as players wear masks,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 5 -- The National Green Tribunal on Monday rapped the authorities for holding the third test match between India and Sri Lanka when pollution levels were in very poor category./The tribunal also criticised the Delhi government for failing to file an action plan on how to bring down pollution, when air quality hits emergency levels./On Sunday, Delhi's toxic air had halted the Test match at Firozshah Kotla twice when a thick haze brought down visibility, arguably the first time an international game was disrupted by pollution./""Every newspaper had been carrying headlines that pollution was going to be higher this week. Still you took no action. Even the players were wearing masks. You should not have held the match if the air quality was so bad. Are people of Delhi supposed to bear this?"" said a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar./Pollution levels had been shooting up over the past few days because of low wind speed and high moisture levels. On Sunday while AQI had touched 351 on a scale of 500, levels of both PM10 and PM2.5 had shot up four times above safe standards. On Monday the AQI touched 390, just ten notches below severe category of pollution./The NGT bench had on November 17 directed Delhi government and other NCR states to submit an action plan. The plan was supposed to contain measures that could come into force automatically when pollution hits emergency levels./Even though Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan have already submitted their plan, Delhi is yet to do so. The counsel for Delhi government said it needed more time to file the action plan as the chief secretary and environment secretary have been recently changed./""Where is your action plan? Why have you not submitted it? What can we do if you keep on changing everybody? Tell us a single action or step you have taken in the last four days to combat air pollution,"" the bench said./The bench also came down heavily on the Delhi government for not introducing odd-even road rationing measure when the air quality is on the brink of hitting severe levels once again./""You want exemptions for twowheelers but you don't apply your mind that these 60-lakh vehicles cause the maximum pollution,"" the bench observed./It also said that despite assurances from the government that 4,000 buses would be introduced to decongest the city roads, not a single bus has been added to the existing fleet over the last three years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution harms kids' brains, lowers memory & IQ: Unicef","NEW DELHI, Dec. 6 -- Air pollution causes irreversible damage to young children's brains, says a new Unicef report./Toxic air lowers children's IQ and memory, affects test scores and triggers neurological-behaviour al problems such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and development delays, according to the study./The report estimates 17 million babies worldwide - 12 million of them in South Asia - live in areas that record pollution levels six times higher than the international safe limits of 20 microgram per cubic meter for PM10 and 10 microgram per cubic meter for PM2.5. Pollution hurts children's brains through several mechanisms, with infants before their first birthday being the most vulnerable./""Most of the brain's development happens in the first 1,000 days of life, which makes children vulnerable to damage by a smaller dosage of toxic chemicals... Children also breathe more rapidly and are more likely to breathe through their mouths, which increase the amount of pollutants they inhale,"" said Dr Krishnan Chugh, senior paediatric pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital in Gurgaon./Ultrafine particulates such as PM2.5 enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain. These damage the blood-brain barrier - a thin membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances - and cause neuro-inflammation, which is linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in elderly people, the Unicef report says./The findings come amid a raging debate over the dangerous air quality in New Delhi. When pollution peaks in Delhi and northern India, as it did this November, air quality is 10 to 12 times above safe standards./The level of PM2.5, a fine dust that causes lung diseases, was 16 times more than the national standard and 40 times higher than the WHO-prescribed grade after Diwali./""Not only do pollutants harm babies' developing lungs, they can permanently damage their developing brains and, thus, their future,"" Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said./Another major urban pollutant is magnetite nanoparticle, a magnetically-charged dust that enters the body through the gut and the olfactory nerve. The pollutant causes neurodegenerative diseases./Chemicals released from burning of coal, petrol and diesel are known to damage neural connections in the brain that are the foundation of learning and development. These chemicals - called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - are abundant in the air as Delhi has more than 10 million registered vehicles./Children skipping classes in school because of frequent pollution-related infections and diseases compounds the damage to learning. ""Air pollution is associated with pneumonia, which kills 18 lakh children in India every year, and triggers asthma, bronchitis, and other throat and respiratory infections, forcing children to miss school and further limiting their learning and development potential,"" said Dr Vinod K Paul, member Niti Aayog and professor of paediatrics at AIIMS./The risk begins in the womb. Exposure to air pollutants during pregnancy leads to toxins crossing the placenta and lowers birth weight and affect the developing brain of a foetus, with studies linking it to development delays at age three, psychological and behavioural problems, a fourIndia), point drop in IQ by age five, the Unicef report says./""Indoor air pollution has gone down because people have switched to cleaner cooking fuels, but outdoor pollution is threatening to even out the gains. Parents must protect children from outdoor pollution and tobacco smoke and cooking fumes,"" Dr Paul said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

GOVT TO INFORM NGT TODAY ON EXEMPTIONS FOR ODD-EVEN PLAN,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 7 -- The National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the Delhi government on Wednesday to tell it within 24 hours if it would enforce the odd-even car rationing system with or without exemptions should the city's air quality dip to severe again./The tribunal's order follows the government's assurance to implement the odd-even formula to reduce air pollution in the national capital./""Are you sure you won't grant any exemption when odd-even is implemented. Let's be clear about it. Please tell us whether you will exclude two-wheelers or not?"" the NGT asked./In November, the government scrapped plans to enforce odd-even after the NGT refused to exempt woman drivers, two-wheelers and government officials from its ambit. The tribunal said the system cannot be implemented with exemptions./The Delhi government tested the odd-even formula for two separate fortnights in 2016. The system designed to reduce pollution allows vehicles to ply on odd and even dates based on the last number of their licence plates./The mechanism is supposed to kick in as part of a ""graded response system"", which the Supreme Court cleared last December, whenever the city's air quality dips to severe levels./But that hasn't happened when the city was engulfed by a thick toxic haze after Diwali, prompting the NGT to seek an explanation from the government over measures taken to clean up the air./A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar directed the Delhi chief secretary to hold a meeting with the special secretary to the state environment department and the government counsel. ""Have as many people as you want. You should also have all the commissioners. Tell us what steps you are going to take when pollution levels deteriorate from one category to the next. We will take up the matter tomorrow,"" the bench said./The directive came after the tribunal rapped the Delhi government on Monday for failing to file its plan to combat air pollution, though UP and Haryana had submitted theirs. Delhi submitted its plan on Wednesday but the tribunal was not happy as it failed to specify measures that would automatically kick in at different levels of pollution./Tarunvir Singh Khehar, the government's counsel, informed the tribunal that at least 14 measures, including the odd-even system, would be enforced. The bench directed the government to ""use your own expertise""./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Patna air quality worse than Delhi, but state agency breathes easy","Patna, Dec. 9 -- The capital city of Bihar is reeling under the worst kind of air pollution. Pollutants in Patna's environs have been categorised in 'severe' category over the past one week, even as it remains within 'very poor to moderate' range in much-maligned Delhi./The air quality index (AQI) of Patna was assessed to be 421 on December 7 and 462 a day agothe level around which the schools in Delhi were shut down. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), watchdog for monitoring pollution in the state, however, breathes it easy./BSPCB member-secretary Alok Kumar said it had not yet reached an alarming level. ""Don't mistake AQI with presence of atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5). The AQI of Patna hovers around 60-75. Hence, there is no point of worry./However, a general advisory has been issued,"" he told HT./Contrary to claims of the member-secretary, Central Pollution Control Board (CBCP) data released for December 7 said Patna had the worst kind of air, only next to Varanasi (AQI411) and Gaya (322). The AQI of Patna hovered between 520 and 421 in the past one week./Even concentration of PM 2.5 particles in the air was assessed to be seven times higher than the prescribed limit./Earlier in November, the Delhi government had ordered closure of schools after the national capital's AQI had reached 448./On December 1, AQI of Patna was calculated to be 520 and categorised 'very severe', said the Centre for Energy and Environment (CEED), a voluntary organisation striving for clean air in the country. A CEED bulletin said the concentration of PM 2.5 particles in Patna hovered between 246 g/m3 and 406 g/m3 in the past one week (from December 1 to 7) against the CPCB prescribed safety limit 60 g/m3./Senior programme officer of CEED Ankita Jyoti said they had apprised the state pollution board functionaries about the severity of the condition and urged them to switch on to emergency mechanism to tide over the situation. ""This is a recurring problem of Patna and hence it urgently requires source apportionment study to check the source of pollution,"" she said./Noted physician and former head of cardiology department at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Dr U C Samal, said the flow of patients with respiratory problems and disease caused due to air pollution had increased manifold in the past one week./Former BSPCB member Ashok Ghosh said a strong advisory should instantly be issued by the board so that the district authorities should take corrective steps./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Fighting cancer by living right,"India, Dec. 9 -- Cancer cases in India are shooting up, not just because life expectancy has increased by more than a decade in 15 years -- from 57.9 years in 1990 to 68.3 years in 2015 - but also because of tectonic shift in the way we live our lives.Tobacco and alcohol use, processed food and diets low fresh food and vegetables, air pollution, inactivity and obesity are among the primary triggers, which have made non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) like heart diseases, cancers and stroke account for 61% of all deaths in?India, up from 37.9% in 1990./Around 1.45 million people in India are diagnosed with cancers each year, with the leading sites being breast and cervix in women and lung and mouth cavity in men . By 2020, cancer cases are projected to cross 1.73 million./""A research analysis in 2016 investigated the links between nutrition and development of 16 different types of cancers, including breast, lung, esophageal, gastric, renal and prostrate, "" said CSE's new report, Body Burden: Lifestyle Diseases. Processed foods that contain little or no proteins, vitamins or minerals, and are high in processed salt, sugar, fats and energy (calories) push up cancer risk by up to 30% in developed countries and 20% in the developing world, said the report./Weight Matters/Being overweight or obese is linked with at least a dozen cancers, including cancer of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), esophagus (esophageal adenocarcinoma), stomach (gasttic cardia cancer, liver, kidneys, multiple myeloma, meningioma, bowels (colorectal), gallbladder, breast, overies and thyroid./""Obesity is also associated with a higher risk of cancer of the food pipe, as it leads to acid from the stomach reaching the lower end of the food pipe, says Dr Ashish Bakshi, medical oncologist at the city's Dr L H Hiranandani Hospital./With obesity doubling in India between 2005 and 2015- 20.7% of women and 18.6% of men are obese, shows National Family Health Survey-4 data released earlier this year - there's a cancer epidemic waiting to happen./A healthy lifestyle includes having five servings (500 gm) of vegetables and fruits a day, exercising regularly for 45min every day, limiting alcohol use and quitting tobacco use. ""It has been observed that a diet of fruits and vegetables not only decreases the risk to colon cancer, but also plays a protective role,"" says Dr T Sundararaman, dean at the School of Health Systems Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai./""Eating processed meat such as sausages, cold cuts, salami, hot dogs, bacon, ham, smoked and dried meat raises the risk of colon, pancreatic and prostate cancers,"" says Dr Mehboob Basade, medical oncologist at Mumbai's Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre. This is due to the preservatives, and salting and fermenting agents added to it, which are indirect carcinogens./Environmental Toxins/Environmental factors such as chronic exposure to chemicals and pollution also plays a role, with metals, pesticides, dyes, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, chlorinated solvents and drinking water disinfectants causing toxicities that lead to malignancies. Commonly used household chemicals and cosmetics - asbestos, nickel, cadmium, radon, vinyl chloride, benzidene, and benzene - also contain cancer-causing compounds./""All of these are cancer-related high risks and can act as a trigger, but the fact is that close to 60% of cancers in India are preventable,"" Dr PK Julka, former head of radiation oncology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). ""Around 40% cancers in India are caused by tobacco use and another 20% are from infections such as hepatitis B that causes liver cancer and HPV that causes cervical cancer. Cancer risk can be significantly reduced by stopping tobacco use, getting vaccinated and adopting a healthy lifestyle,"" says Dr Julka./""I have had people as young as 20 come in with oral cancer,"" says Dr Basade. ""This is due to the tobacco-chewing habit, which is a common cause of cancer. Even 25 years after quitting tobacco use, former users have a 4% higher risk of cancer.""/Occupational Hazards/Geography and occupation can also increase an individual's risk of developing cancer. ""Prolonged exposure to radiation from nuclear power projects, accidents in laboratories that cause radiation leaks, or even radiation from items in the trash put people working or living in these areas at higher risk,"" says Dr Sundararaman./No direct link has been established between electromagnetic field radiations emitted from cellphones and cellular towers and cancer yet, ICMR experts, who are conducting an India-specific study to assess the health impact of cellphone use, say one should err on the side of caution. ""No definitive link between cancer and RF radiation has been established, we advise people to use cellphones when absolutely necessary and use of headphones/earbuds while taking calls,"" said a researcher at ICMR, requesting anonymity./A healthy lifestyle has to go hand-in-hand with a good diet to lower your risk, doctors say. ""There is no excuse for smoking or drinking. You cannot say that I exercise, so it is okay for me to drink,"" says Dr Basade./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

WHY I FLED DELHI - A CITY I CALLED HOME FOR 45 YEARS,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 17 -- Although I have shifted from Delhi, its air continues to haunt me. The thought that so many old friends, including students I have taught, are breathing that toxic air upsets me. Their helplessness reminds me of how I felt up until a few months ago. I was in a position to make a choice./The compulsion to live in a place with a serious health risk seems grossly unfair. I don't understand how those holding high offices endure this injustice. Senior civil servants who live around India Gate surely feel the grit in the air. Have they too given up but can't say so? Or, is it that they still don't care?/The problem of air pollution is not new, but many of my generation felt it could be resolved before it turned into a chronic crisis. When the late Anil Agarwal, the founder of the Centre for Science and Environment, fought to switch over to CNG, it felt like a great victory and a turning point. Similarly, about a decade ago, when several schools persuaded their children to shun crackers, it seemed Delhi was going to recover. If crackers could go, why not construction dust, why not garbage burning, and so on? But the situation started to look dire after the 2010 Commonwealth Games (CWG)./There was something reckless about that event. It was organised as theatre, hiding Delhi's reality: Its descent into traffic chaos and toxic air. Excessive construction activity marked the preparatory period. Thousands of trees were uprooted in the Delhi University campus. One third of its famous botanic garden was slashed to accommodate a rugby stadium - to be used for two days of rehearsal matches. The CWG reinforced the attitude among authorities that they could pull the wool over the public's eye. Once the event was over, the city started to crumble./Over the years that followed, alarming levels of pollution became normal. Garbage collection became somewhat more efficient without a parallel improvement in the common mode of its disposal - by burning./The tipping point reached in the winter of 2014. One morning, the smog was so dense and visibility so poor that during my morning walk I bumped into a tree I had known for years. Throughout that winter, doctors advised people to avoid taking morning walks. On several mornings, I stepped out only to come back quickly. My eyes stung, and the air felt dead. It took a year to discover the modest miracle of an air purifier. From day one, they became my lifeline, but I could hardly carry it to my classes./I started to consider my students, their mental fatigue and restlessness. How could I blame them for lack of concentration? I felt convinced that they were victims of bad air. I certainly was. Yet, it was difficult to make a point like that to anyone. A discourse of pollution had already emerged. It allowed you to claim victimage if you had standard ailments like bronchitis, cough, or asthma. A general feeling of exhaustion and ina bility to sustain focus for long didn't count./My decision to leave Delhi meant wrenching myself out of places and things I had grown used to since 1971, when I first came to the city. Life then was starkly different, and not just because I was young. Riding a bicycle to work was not regarded as a sign of low status. Nor was taking a bus. The society of Delhi was neither as acquisitive nor extravagant as it became over the 1990s./A city needs its people and administrators to identify with it. When the latter bulldozed the Hall of Nations at Pragati Maidan, I became alienated for good. That demolition indicated an end of hope of sanity and recognition of the city's crisis. As its citizen, I felt helpless. All I could now do was to flee./The authorities deny that they are taking pollution lightly. Debaters on TV often claim that Delhi's problems are not unique. Who are they trying to fool? Many eminent doctors have pointed out that a worrisome future awaits children growing up in Delhi today. Even that thought doesn't inspire sustained radical action. The mountains of garbage on the outskirts smoulder day and night. Coming into Delhi for a visit prompts nostalgia, but these smoking mountains instantly set me right./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi's air pollution levels this year much better than that of 2016,"India, Dec. 29 -- Despite the toxic haze that engulfed Delhi for more than a week in November, the national capital breathed comparatively cleaner air this year than it did in 2016./The air quality was ""severe"" for eight days in 2017 as against 26 the previous year, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Besides the three-time drop in ""severe"" days, the air quality was ""very poor"" for 76 days as against 97 in 2016 and ""poor"" for 114 days as compared to 122 the previous year./""In 2016, Delhi didn't witness a single day when air quality was 'good'. In 2017, the city got at least two days of 'good' air, which means pollution levels were bare minimum,"" said D Saha, head of the CPCB's air quality laboratory./Hindustan Times air quality monitor/An air quality index (AQI) of 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe. There was no comparative data available for the whole of 2015 as the national AQI came into effect in May that year./Experts said that the credit for this upswing goes largely to favourable weather conditions, and suggested that some tough anti-pollution measures introduced in 2017 may have worked./""Meteorological parameters play an important role in determining Delhi's air quality. Strong winds from the north during the winter helps flush out pollutants,"" Saha said./Stringent measures under the Supreme Court-mandated graded response action plan (GRAP) to control pollution were enforced for the first time since October 17. They will run till March 15 next year./A range of additional steps such as mechanised sweeping of roads and a crackdown on the burning of garbage were carried out through the year to reduce street dust and smoke that leads to smog./""The duration and frequency of smog episodes have come down to some extent. But pollution levels are still very high. More sustained and aggressive action is needed to bend the pollution graph,"" said Anumita Roychoudhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment./The Supreme Court's ban on firecrackers during Diwali also had an impact. A report by SAFAR, an agency under the ministry of earth sciences, had stated that the level of emission from fireworks fell around 40% during the festival this year, compared to 2016./But some experts pointed out that it would be too early to conclude that the steps were showing results./""We can only say air quality has improved when we monitor pollution data over a period of at least five to 10 years. Secondly, a simple AQI data doesn't give a fair idea of the level of pollutants. We need to monitor each pollutant over a period before coming to a conclusion,"" said SN Tripathi, coordinator at the Centre for Environmental Science & Engineering in IIT Kanpur./Tripathi also warned that the authorities should not be complacent just because there were some signs of improvement./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi witnessed 40% rise in deaths due to respiratory diseases in 2016,"India, Dec. 30 -- Delhi registered an alarming increase in deaths due to respiratory ailments in 2016, the year the national Capital witnessed its worst pollution crisis in at least two decades, according to data released by the state government on Saturday./Deaths linked to breathing disorders shot up by 40% in 2016 from 2015 -- 6,502 to 9,149 -- the highest jump from the previous year since 2010. Incidentally, both 2016 and 2010 had seen a sharp rise in dust pollution, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board. Dust is a major cause of pulmonary and cardiac ailments./From 2009 to 2010, the number of deaths linked to respiratory problems had gone up from 5,328 to 7,525 - an increase of 41%./Hindustan Times had reported on Saturday that pollution levels have been high in 2017 as well, but not as bad as 2016./""This data proves that air pollution is taking a heavy toll on our health. We need stricter and sustained measures to bring down pollution levels,"" said Anumita Roychoudhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment./In 2016, the annual average PM10 particulate level in Delhi shot up to 260ug/m3, more than two-and-a-half times the permissible limit of 100. The city was also engulfed in its worst smog in 17 years in November that year./Hindustan Times air quality monitor/Data submitted in the Lok Sabha last week by the ministry of environment and forest had shown that Delhi accounts for the highest number of respiratory ailment deaths after Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Earlier this year, British Medical journal The Lancet had published a report that more than half-a-million Indians were estimated to have died prematurely in 2015 due to high levels of the smallest PM 2.5 particles, which can penetrate deep into the lungs and trigger a range of respiratory and cardiac ailments./Ironically, other statistics released by the government showed a sharp drop in diesel consumption between 2015-16 and 2016-2017 despite the fact that its vehicular fleet has shot up by 8%, crossing the 10-million mark. Experts attributed a fall in diesel consumption to various court rulings, which acted as a deterrent for buying such cars./Diesel exhaust fumes are classified as more polluting than fumes released by vehicles that run on petrol./The consumption of diesel dropped from around 1.5 milllion metric tonnes in 2015-16 to around 1.2 million metric tonnes in 2016-17, while the consumption of petrol went up marginally from .902 million metric tonnes to .906 million metric tonnes, the data showed./""Various court rulings and directions by the National Green Tribunal have resulted in the drop in diesel vehicles. There is a ban on 10-year-old diesel operated vehicles in Delhi-NCR. Earlier the apex court had temporarily banned the sale of large diesel cars with an engine capacity of over 2000cc. These rulings have resulted in drop in diesel vehicles in Delhi,"" said Kamal Soi, member of the National Road Safety Council./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

More vehicles on Pune roads has residents 'breathless',"PUNE, Jan. 1 -- The city's air quality could soon be as bad as that of Delhi. According to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the city's air pollution levels have taken a serious hit in the past few years with the percentage of pollutants arising from vehicle emissions increasing considerably./Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, ""Pollutants like sulphur, nitrogen dioxide, PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles were found to be higher than the prescribed level in the city's air. Vehicle emission is the major reason for the problem and is dangerous because these particles can reach deep into one's lungs and cause serious health hazards."" But the PMC is undertaking consistent efforts to curb the rising pollution through awareness campaigns, he added./The fuels used in vehicles can increase the amount of sulphur dioxide in air. According to PMC's environment department, the city's air had an average of 42 microgram/cubic metre of sulphur in 2017 as against 32 microgram/cubic metre in 2016. According to the PMC, the optimum limit of sulphur in air is 50 microgram/cubic metre./As far as nitrogen is concerned, city's air recorded an average level of 57 microgram/cubic metre of nitrogen in 2017, which is 12 points higher than the prescribed limit of 40 microgram/cubic metre, according to MPCB./Experts have blamed the growth in number of vehicles in the city and the absence of efficient public transport systems for the consistently worsening air quality./According to PMC's environment department, PM-10 and PM 2.5 are injurious to human health as it causes lung-related diseases. The city recorded an average of 80 ug/m3 PM-10 and 68 ug/m3 PM 2.5 particles for 2017 while the permissible limit for these particles are 60 ug/m3 and 40 ug/m3 respectively./Dr Sneha Limaye, a researcher at the Chest Research Institute, Pune, said,""Since the number of vehicles in the city has increased, proportionally, the amount of toxic gas in the city's air has also increased. This has caused pollution to grow significantly. PM-10 and PM 2.5 are very dangerous particles responsible for pulmonary diseases.""/System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) has forecasted 152, 83 and 155, 84 PM-10 and PM 2.5 particle levels respectively for first two days of new year./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"DTU home to heavy vehicles, foul air","NEW DELHI, Jan. 10 -- Air pollution monitoring station inside the campus of Delhi Technological University (DTU) recorded PM2.5 levels at 740 on November 7 - almost 12 times the healthy levels. With the particulate levels so high, students inside the campus felt they were choking despite the fact that it is the only green lung in this neighbourhood./""There is a stark difference in pollution levels inside and outside the campus. You feel it as soon as you step out of the gate. This year, however, five out of 10 students had trouble breathing when pollution peaked and complained of a sore and raspy throat,"" said Divyendu Thakur, a fourth-year engineering student at DTU./""Not only did the symptoms of students and teachers with respiratory disorders worsen. I also know of healthy friends complaining of difficulty in breathing when the pollution levels were high. But what we put up with is nothing compared to what people in the neighbouring areas have to face,"" he said./You just need to step out of the wellmanicured DTU campus to see he is right. The engineering college campus is surrounded by highly congested Shahbad Daulatpur, Samaypur, Bhalaswa and Badli, which are arguably the worst neighbourhoods to live in terms of air quality. Different polluting agents choke the air and wreck the health of residents with every breath./TRUCKING SNARLS/Just 3km away from the monitoring station, around 300 trucks move in and out of Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar every day. Apart from being one of the biggest parking grounds for trucks travelling in and out of Delhi, it is also the place where most trucks in the city - and some even from across the country - are customised to suit the goods being transported./These heavy trucks rumble in and out on unpaved roads, throwing up clouds of diesel fumes and dust. ""There is dust everywhere; you feel it inside your mouth all the time. People keep talking about pollution peaking Delhi, here it is at severe levels every day. The roads are unpaved and narrow which leads to traffic jams and idling trucks even at off-peak hours, which adds to fumes,"" said Gopal Singh, 38, who has been running a grocery store in the area for six years now./The Bhalaswa dumping ground, which is 4 km away from the pollution monitoring station, adds smoke to the toxic mix as piles of garbage burn and simmer through the year./The Bhalaswa Dairy neighbourhood is almost always filled with smoke, causing respiratory problems./""When we talk about pollution in this area, the burning garbage at the dumping ground is a major source, along with the unauthorised small scale industries in Shahbad Daulatpur and Prahladpur, just 2-3km away. These industries do not follow any pollution control norms,"" said Professor SK Singh, head of the department of environmental engineering, DTU./ILLEGAL INDUSTRIES/Small factories manufacturing plastic bottles, utensils and cutlery, rubber parts for vehicles, metal vessels and denims fight for space with residential houses in every lane. Many of these manufacturing units operate under the guise of godowns, where the merchandise is stored./The manufacturing activity, however, is apparent from the cacophony from whirring machines, high-pressure waterlines spraying water, and the pervasive smell of burning rubber from behind the closed doors. Some people even have manufacturing units inside their homes, running machines using LPG-powered hot presses./""Though everyone knows about it, it is hush-hush. Nobody wants to talk about who makes what, we all just know it happens from the smoke and the effluents,"" said a resident, who did not want to be named. The proximity to Badli and Bawana industrial areas, each of which houses nearly 500 companies, further compounds the problem./""We don't have a choice, we live here and we will die here. And it will happen sooner than it would have if we had lived in a clean, green place,"" he said./""There is enough evidence to suggest that people living in areas with high concentration of pollution are at an increased risk of developing chronic respiratory problems like bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They are also at risk of heart diseases - including heart attack - and strokes,"" said Dr Raj Kumar, head of National Centre for Respiratory Allergy, Asthama and Immunology at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi's pollution hotspots: Housing hub Patparganj forced to inhale toxins,"India, Jan. 10 -- Diwan Singh, in his late 50s, had very fondly purchased a second-floor flat, exhausting most of his life's savings, in one of the many apartments at IP Extension in east Delhi's Patparganj./Owning a flat at one of east Delhi's prime locations - overlooking the greenery of IP Park and the NH-24 at a stone's throw with vehicles whizzing past - is a dream for many. But ask Singh and he says that 'all that glitters is not gold'. The reality in Patparganj is somewhat different from what seems apparent./""Life has become a hell here. My five-year-old son often falls sick, complaining of a sore throat and cough. The local doctor says it is mainly because of pollution. The winter season is particularly bad,"" said Singh. While nearby Anand Vihar had earned notoriety long back for being one of the most polluted places in Delhi, 20 new monitoring stations added to Delhi's network have blown the lid off from some other areas where air pollution is equally bad or sometimes even worse./Patparganj is one of them. One of the new monitoring stations of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee is located at the Mother Dairy plant at Patparganj. Hindustan Times tried to find out the sources of pollution that have made this area one of Delhi's new pollution hotspots./While Patparganj has its own industrial zone, the Sahibabad Industrial Area in UP is located a few kilometers east. A few hundred small-scale units, many of which run illegally and use non-permitted fuels, operate from these two zones./""We recently issued show-cause notices to 126 units in Patparganj Industrial Area as they were operating without consent,"" said a senior official of DPCC./When HT visited the spot, open burning of garbage was spotted in several corners of the industrial area. A large number of vehicles, including trucks and two-wheelers, were seen parked on the roads and lanes. These vehicles also contribute significantly to the area's pollution levels./""Every day when I come here for work, I can feel the pollution. There is garbage burning and dust pollution is tremendous. In winters, I get a burning sensation in my eyes,"" said Snehlata who comes from all the way to Patparganj Industrial Area from Indirapuram in Ghaziabad./Dust pollution is not new in developing cities. But it assumes alarming proportions when it comes to east Delhi because of undergoing projects such the expansion of NH-24 for the Meerut Expressway project and the Metro./Such is the level of dust pollution that EPCA chief Bhure Lal had said in a meeting : ""NHAI is one of the worst polluters. Every time a vehicle zooms past on NH24, it churns up a smoke of dust,"" he said./As one leaves the Noida Link Road and takes the NH-24, residential colonies, high-rises, and hotels can be spotted along the highway. Look closer, and you will find that most windows are shut fast. ""We can't open the windows. Everything in my house gets covered with dust. I am an asthma patient. I am able to breathe properly only in monsoon,"" said Jasjeev Singh, a resident of Khichdipur-Block 8, an area close to Patparganj./Open construction sites and debris of razed houses remain scattered on the roadside, while mini tar boilers deployed for patchwork on broken roads emit thick black fumes./Burning of garbage in the open is banned in Delhi under the Graded Response Action Plan. The National Green Tribunal has also directed municipal authorities to crack down on garbage burning as it triggers pollution. However, HT spotted many cases of garbage burning both in the industrial zone and in residential areas. People, mostly office goers and locals, were seen covering their nose with cloth as white fumes filled the area./""Garbage burning is a major problem in this part of the city. Though it is somewhat restricted in the residential areas, as the locals complain, it is rampant in the industrial zone,"" said Manav Banshi a resident of Madhu Vihar./Industrial waste of all kinds - paper, scraps of leather, polythene - was found dumped in heaps in several corners in the Patparganj Industrial Zone./Another major source of pollution is the Ghazipur landfill site, located around 4 km east of Patparganj./Fires at the site are usually caused when the trapped methane gas comes in contact with air. In some cases, however, the rag-pickers set the garbage on fire in order to quickly sift through the trash for recyclable items./""Such fires are common, but when the fire is big it becomes unbearable. The situations worsen when the wind blows in from that side carrying the fumes. At times you can feel it even inside your home,"" said Manabi Adhikary, a resident of a housing society in Patparganj./With time, east Delhi has attained a neat and chic look with upscale residential areas, malls and indulging restaurants. Some important commercial and administrative centres are located in east Delhi./Patparganj also has its own fleet of vehicles with two-wheelers comprising a major portion. The narrow lanes and by-lanes of Patparganj, including Patparganj Village, increase the demand for two-wheelers./""There are around 300 flats in our society but around 500 vehicles, including two-wheelers which are maximum,"" said a local, who refused to disclose his name./Emission from vehicles is aggravated as two major arterial roads - Noida Link Road and the NH24 - pass close to Patparganj. Lakhs of vehicles hit these two roads every day./Apart from this, other residential, commercial zones and administrative areas such as Preet Vihar, Nirman Vihar and Mayur Vihar that border Patparganj also have their own vehicular, fleet which adds to the pollution levels. The known pollution hotspots of Anand Vihar and Ghaziabad are within a close range too and pollution levels are pushed up when the wind brings in pollutants from these areas./Wind speed also plays a key role in determining the air quality in this area, just as in the rest of the city. Pollution levels in Patparganj also fluctuate with wind direction. Some of the pollution hotspots of Delhi-NCR such as Anand Vihar, Ghaziabad and Noida are located in the east and north-east of Patparganj. Every time the easterly winds blow, pollutants from these hotspots reach the city and Patparganj is the first to bear the brunt./""Easterly winds push up pollution levels in Patparganj as this area has some of the most polluted places on its eastern side,"" said D Saha head of the air quality laboratory at Central Pollution Control Board./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

All brick kilns to adopt zig-zag model in a month,"Gurgaon, Jan. 11 -- The Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB) on Tuesday started a drive to convert all brick kilns in the state to the zigzag model with an aim to lower the air pollution caused by these kilns./According to officials of the pollution control board, the zigzag model aims to increase airflow inside brick chimneys thereby ensuring effective burning of coal to reduce carbon emissions that cause pollution./This drive will continue for a month and all brick kilns in the state will be converted to the zigzag model. The board on Tuesday converted one brink kiln in Haria Hera village in Gurgaon to the zigzag model./In November, the average air quality index (AQI) in the Gurgaon was 377, in the 'very poor' category. The highest AQI was 494, on November 9./This drive on kilns was initiated as the region witnessed high levels of pollution over the last two months./""The unit in Haria village used to emit more than 20 tonnes of carbon. Now, after the conversion, the emission will be as low as 11 tonnes. Thus, pollutants in the atmosphere will also be reduced at a remarkable rate,"" JB Sharma, regional officer of the Haryana state pollution control board, said./The city has more than half a dozen brick kilns - around Sohna and Mewat area- which are a major source of pollution, claimed the experts of pollution department./The brick kilns will have to reconstruct their trenches with a view to make them the environment friendly and energy efficient. The waste generated in the zigzag model is brunt completely, and, as a result, less smoke is emitted from the kilns./Last year, in April, the board had issued a notice to all brick kilns in the district to change the pattern from a straight trench to zigzag by September 30. However, many kilns are yet to make the change./""We have got eight applications from brink kilns owners who said they need assistance to convert the existing unit into the new model. We will be providing them all support,"" Sharma said./""All these units will be monitored by the pollution control board and will be given a nod to operate once the emission is lowered,"" Shakti Singh, environmental engineer, HSPCB, said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

The Delhi government had planned a similar initiative earlier, but it never took off./The panels display hourly AQI readings. AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'. Each category comes with its own advisory. In case of 'moderate', it warns of breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases, while 'severe' means the air quality is so bad that it might affect even healthy people and seriously impact those suffering with breathing problems./""The CPCB has not put up separate panels for this purpose; it is using the existing display boards of traffic police where short video clips on road safety are usually played,"" said a senior official of the CPCB./Talks are also on with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and some of the city's hospitals so that their LED panels could also be used to alert the citizens of the ambient air quality and the health risks./Such advisories become all the more important because Delhi registered an alarming increase in deaths due to respiratory ailments in 2016 - the year the national capital witnessed its worst pollution crisis in at least two decades, according to data released by the state government in December 2017./Deaths linked to breathing disorders shot up by 40% in 2016 from 2015 - 6,502 to 9,149 - the highest jump from the previous year since 2010. Incidentally, both 2016 and 2010 had witnessed a sharp rise in dust pollution, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board. Dust is a major cause of pulmonary and cardiac ailments./The NCR states have also been asked to take similar measures. ""We have also directed the pollution control boards of NCR states to intensify pollution mitigation efforts in the region in view of the Asean summit starting from Friday"", said D. Saha, head of CPCB's air lab./Last month, a CPCB-led task force had recommended closure of all coal-based industries operating in the Delhi-NCR region for a fortnight, beginning January 15 to contain air pollution during the summit./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Diet to combat heavy metal toxicity in a natural way,"Mumbai, Jan. 24 -- Toxic metals like lead, mercury and cadmium are those metals that accumulate in our body (as a consequence of modernisation) and are, in fact, quite difficult to remove from the body. These are the metals which are of no biological use and may be present in the wrong form, hence toxic to the body. The common sources by which heavy metals like mercury enter the body through the skin and other tissues is either through tooth filling amalgam, cosmetic products or seafood, air pollution, drinking water and soil. Symptoms of chronic heavy metal toxicity includes fatigue, depression, weight gain and joint pain, that can lead to serious health issues such as cancer, kidney disease, degenerative bone conditions, heart disease, among others./DETOXIFICATION PROCESS/For a detox process to work, the body's critical organs including liver, kidney, the lymphatic system and the intestinal systems need to function optimally./One of the key ways to remove heavy metal toxicity is the chelation therapy. This therapy uses chelating agents to remove heavy metals from the body and also to prevent the danger of reabsorbing toxins. Always go to a chelation expert who can chelate heavy metals from your body./Apart from using chelating agents, there are green methods too, to help detoxify the body. Besides providing essential vitamins and minerals, these green herbs and vegetables are filled with antioxidants, phytochemicals and powerful detoxifying agents./A few plant-based detox agents are given below: Foods rich in vitamin C: In high doses, vitamin C can reduce heavy metal toxicity. Lime juice can be consumed every day to ensure daily cleansing. Coriander leaves: They are known specifically for their excellent detoxifying properties. Compounds present in coriander leaves bind with the heavy metals in the blood stream and can be easily flushed out of the body./Sulphur-containing vegetables: Garlic, cabbage, cauliflower and onions are rich in sulphur and can help the liver detoxify itself of heavy metals such as lead and arsenic. Increasing intake of sulphur-containing veggies is your best bet for reducing loads of heavy metals. Flax and chia seeds: These omega-3 fatty acid containing seeds can help with detoxification of the colon and reduce inflammation./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Don't put public health at risk by junking the environment index data,"India, Jan. 26 -- The 2018 Environmental Performance Index report, a biennial report by Yale and Columbia universities along with the World Economic Forum (WEF), has put India among the bottom five countries in the world . The country has slipped from 141 in the last ranking in 2016 to 177 among 180 countries this year. India's low scores are because of its poor performance in the environmental health policy objective: Deaths attributed to PM2.5 (particulate matter of a diameter of 2.5 micron) have risen over the past decade and are estimated at 1,640,113, annually (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2017). India's annual prescribed standards of PM 2.5 and PM 10 are 40 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3). The corresponding 24-hour standards are 60 and 100 respectively. ""Despite government action, pollution from solid fuels, coal and crop residue burning, and emissions from motor vehicles continue to severely degrade the air quality,"" the report said of India./The results are not surprising: Air pollution is a mega crisis in India and several reports have indicated that the country's future looks grim if serious measures are not taken to fix the problem. A report by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in 2017 said that air pollution is responsible for 30% of premature deaths in India. Every third child in Delhi has impaired lungs./Here's what is surprising. Despite data, the Indian government continues to go on the defensive whenever such scientific analyses come out. Last year, the then environment minister, Anil Madhav Dave, made headlines for denying there was proof that air pollution was singularly responsible for a significant number of deaths in India. Dave conceded that air pollution ""could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory associated ailments and diseases"", but he blamed the negative health effects on other issues: poor diet, occupational hazards, socioeconomic status, and genetics. His successor, Harsh Vardhan, who is a trained physician, had a similar reaction to the Environmental Performance Index report. ""These are just rankings,"" he said on Wednesday at a conference. ""We have been doing our work sincerely and will continue to do so. The rankings will take care of themselves.""/No government likes negative reports on its performance. Every government is quick to accept reports that give it a pat on the back - as the Indian government was after the latest ease of doing business report. But when it comes to negative human rights reports or one on the environment, it rubbishes them. This kind of behaviour isn't going to solve the problem. Instead of contradicting, ignoring, or dismissing such reports, the Centre must take the Environmental Performance Index seriously and use it to strengthen its green policies and environmental governance structure./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India is losing productivity worth billions due to cancers that can be prevented,"India, Jan. 30 -- The BRICS grouping of countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are losing billions of dollars in productivity owing to cancer, says a research paper published in the Journal of Cancer Epidemiology. India recorded a total productivity loss of $6.7 billion in 2012 because of cancer, representing 0.36% of our GDP. This is second only to South Africa which recorded a productivity loss of $1.9 billion, or 0.49% of its GDP. While the cost per death of productivity lost in India was less than $20,000, the lowest among BRICS countries, the highest productivity losses - $0.74 billion - because of the lip and oral cancers are a cause for alarm.Beyond the impact on public health and loss of human life, the disease also imposes a steep economic cost on a country's economy. Taking the loss of productivity owing to premature death into consideration can provide policymakers additional perspective when they chart out strategies for prevention and control of the disease. Originally grouped together as rising emerging economies, the five BRICS countries today comprise more than 40% of the world's population and 25% of global GDP. The five economies collectively lost nearly $46.3 billion in 2012 on account of cancer-related deaths that could have been prevented with proper treatment and adequate infrastructure, says the paper./The costs and logistical difficulties in implementing screening and treatment programmes in the BRICS countries underscore the importance of cancer prevention. Doctors say close to 60% of cancers in India can be prevented. Around 40% cancers in the country (such as lung cancer and cancers of mouth) are caused by tobacco use and another 20% from infections such as hepatitis B that cause liver cancer and human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer. Cancer cases in India are rising not just because of better diagnostic facilities but also owing to the shift in the way we lead our lives. Tobacco and alcohol use, consumption of processed food, air pollution and obesity are among its biggest triggers. India recorded an estimated 3.9 million cancer cases in 2016, data available with the National Cancer Registry Programme of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows. Obesity grew two-fold in India between 2005 and 2015 - 20.7% of women and 18.6% of men are obese, shows National Family Health Survey-4 data released this year. ICMR estimates say India is likely to have more than 17.3 lakh new cases of cancer and more than 8.8 lakh deaths due to the disease by 2020./But the silver lining is that cancer risk can be slashed significantly by curtailing tobacco use, getting vaccinations for certain types of cancer and adopting a healthier lifestyle. Changes that reduce the burden of cancer will also have a positive effect on the economy. A combination of tobacco control, alcohol control, vaccination programmes and cancer screening will lead to significant gains for both the health as well as the economy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Faridabad second most polluted city in country, Gurgaon 12th","Gurgaon, Jan. 30 -- The National Capital Region (NCR) cities of Gurgaon and Faridabad were among the most polluted cities in the country, shows a report on air pollution data compiled by Greenpeace India./The report vindicates what the residents have been warning about for years-pollution level is dangerously high and serious measures need to be taken by the government to bring the situation under control./The report revealed that the average level of PM10 in Faridabad was 272 making it the second most polluted city in the country. Though Gurgaon fared better than Faridabad, the PM10 level stood at 227 making it the 12th most polluted city in the country./The list of most polluted cities in the country was topped by Delhi, with PM10 level at 290./With 15 of its cities among the 30 most polluted cities of the country, Uttar Pradesh is India's most polluted state, shows the second edition of Airpocalypse, by Greenpeace India, which was released on Monday./Airpocalypse-ii is based on the air pollution data collected from the Central and State Pollution Control Boards' and committees' annual reports and websites, and through applications under the Right to Information Act./The report, which exposes the bitter truth about the poor air quality in Delhi-ncr brought out the list of most polluted cities in the country based on particulate matter data of PM10 levels for 280 cities during 2016, and, in some cases, also 2015./The detailed report on the air quality of Indian cities reveals that none of the 280 cities covered comply with the level of PM10 as fixed by the World Health Organisation at 20. As many as 80% of these cities also do not even comply with India's PM10 level-60, which has been set by the CPCB./The data holds significance for 630 million people. Of these, a staggering 550 million are living in the virtual red zone where PM10 levels are more than the nationally acceptable limits. Of these, 47 million are children below the age of five./Particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter, about 1/7th the thickness of the a human hair, are known as PM10. It is among the most harmful of all air pollutants. When inhaled these particles evade the respiratory system's natural defences and lodge deep in the lungs. PM10 is often responsible for much of the haze that we call smog./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Cancer takes a toll on both health and economy,"Mumbai, Jan. 31 -- The BRICS grouping of countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are losing billions of dollars in productivity owing to cancer, says a research paper published in the Journal of Cancer Epidemiology. India recorded a total productivity loss of $6.7 billion in 2012 because of cancer, representing 0.36% of our GDP. While the cost per death of productivity lost in India was less than $20,000, the lowest among BRICS countries, the highest productivity losses - $0.74 billion - because of the lip and oral cancers are a cause for alarm. Taking the loss of productivity owing to premature death into consideration can provide policymakers additional perspective when they chart out strategies for prevention and control of the disease./Doctors say close to 60% of cancers in India can be prevented. Around 40% of cancers in the country (such as lung cancer and cancers of mouth) are caused by tobacco use and another 20% from infections such as hepatitis B that cause liver cancer and human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer. Cancer cases in India are rising not just because of better diagnostic facilities but also owing to the shift in the way we lead our lives. Tobacco and alcohol use, consumption of processed food, air pollution and obesity are among the biggest triggers of the disease. Indian Council of Medical Research estimates say India is likely to have more than 17.3 lakh new cases of cancer and more than 8.8 lakh deaths due to the disease by 2020./But the silver lining is that the risk of cancer can be slashed significantly by curtailing tobacco use, getting vaccinations for certain types of cancer and adopting a healthier lifestyle. Changes that reduce the burden of cancer will also have a positive effect on the economy. A combination of tobacco control, alcohol control, vaccination programmes and cancer screening will lead to significant gains for both the physical and the economic health of India./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

North Delhi civic body to buy 5 more mechanical sweepers to curb road dust,"India, Jan. 31 -- Five more mechanical sweepers will be deployed on central Delhi roads in the next financial year./The New Delhi Municipal Council, in its recent budget for the financial year 2018-19, has made the proposal. ""In order to strengthen the road sanitation activities, I propose to procure five mechanical road sweepers at a cost of Rs 3 crore. In addition, it is proposed to provide comprehensive operation and maintenance for existing five mechanical road sweepers for a period of three years, so that they may be used in at least two shifts in a day. This will go a long way in curbing air pollution,"" NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar said in the budget speech on January 15./According to an IIT-Kanpur study, which was carried out between 2012 and 2015, road dust is the biggest contributor to both PM10 (particulate matter) and PM2.5 emissions in Delhi. These particles which are less than 10 micrograms per cubic meters in diameter are deadlier as they go deep into the airways and lungs, and cause irreversible injury to the tissue, leading to chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema and lung cancer./A month back, Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had asked all three municipal commissioners to procure requisite mechanical sweepers, litter pickers, water sprinklers within a stipulated time./Earlier, in a stock taking meeting on air pollution, the L-G was informed that currently only 15 per cent of road sweeping is mechanised. ""Baijal directed all agencies that this should be increased to at least 40% in the next four months and as such, procurement and hiring processes will need to be expedited,"" a Delhi government official said./Other agencies, too, have deployed these vacuum cleaning machines, which have circular brooms and vacuuming mechanism to make the roads dust free. Fifteen mechanical road sweepers are in operation in South corporation, four in East while North has four and officials are the process of getting four more./However, in a city with 30,000km of roads, not even the full 1,250km of Public Works Department roads are getting the service of these machines, as the department has just two machines at its disposal and three more are yet to come./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mumbai breathes 'poor' air for seventh consecutive day,"Mumbai, Feb. 8 -- The city's air quality on Wednesday was the worst since October 19, the day after Diwali when authorities had to issue a 'health alert' because of toxic pollution levels./The Air Quality Index (AQI) - a pollution measuring indicator - was 275 (classified as poor air quality) for PM2.5, which are pollutants of size 2.5 microns and smaller that can enter the lungs. It dropped marginally to 273 in the evening./Mumbai's air was worse than Delhi, which reported 211 (poor)./The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) classifies AQI levels up to 50 as good, between 51 and 100 as satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 400 and above as severe./Concentration of particulate matter was twice the safe limit on Wednesday./As against a safe limit of 60 microgrammes per cubic metre (mu g/m3) over 24 hours for PM2.5, Mumbai recorded levels at 119mu g/m3. For PM10 - larger particles of 10 microns or less - the readings were 199mu g/m3 against a safe limit of 100mu g/m3./Meteorologists said weather conditions were the primary reason for the rise in pollution levels. Heavy cloud cover over the city led to a significant rise in night temperatures. ""Over the past three days, moisture incursions over Mumbai increased significantly, making the air heavy. With a rise in humidity, the pollutant-carrying capacity of the air increases, suspending particles close to the earth's surface forming a layer of smog,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. ""This phenomenon is happening mostly during the day, but as soon as there is sunshine, the rise in temperature does not allow pollutants to remain suspended close to the surface and the pollution decreases.""/However, these weather conditions are not unusual this time of the year. HT had reported that in January and February, 2016 and 2017, the air quality had occasionally surpassed the 'very poor' category, pushing the city's air into hazardous category./""During this season, with fluctuating temperatures, the withdrawal of western disturbances over the northern parts of the country allows the increase of moisture levels and cloud formation to take place, which happens every year,"" said Beig./Ajay Kumar, scientist, Regional Meteorological Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, ""A trough [weather depression] over the Arabian Sea, combined with western disturbance, are allowing westerly winds to carry more moisture over the sea. Cloudy conditions traps heat during the night, and the phenomenon is expected to continue till Friday.""/Humidity level at Colaba - representative of south Mumbai - was 88%, and at Santacruz - indicative of the suburbs - as 69%. The weather bureau has predicted a partly cloudy sky and SAFAR predicted an AQI of 271 (poor) for Thursday./Beig added air quality is expected to improve by the weekend./Doctors said there was a rise in lung-related ailments in the city this winter compared to previous years. ""From November onwards, significant rise in health problems have been witnessed. Every month we have an average of 150 cases as a direct result of air pollution. With smoggy conditions over the city now, the numbers might increase further,"" said Dr. Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist, Lilavati Hospital, Bandra. ""Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, pneumonia to minor cases such as burning in the eyes, sneezing, sore throats etc., have all been observed through the winter."" Six of 10 locations that monitor air quality in Mumbai recorded 'very poor' AQI levels. Mazgaon was the most polluted location in Mumbai with an AQI of 339, followed by Bhandup and Bandra Kurla Complex at 327, Borivli and Colaba recorded 320, and Navi Mumbai was at 308. Chembur had the cleanest air in the city at 97 (satisfactory)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Respiratory ailments rise by 25% in pet dogs, cats in Mumbai this winter, 11 deaths so far","Mumbai, Feb. 9 -- The high pollution levels in the city are affecting our furry friends too./Data from the Bombay Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) in Parel revealed that between November 1 and January 31, the animal hospital recorded 223 cases of respiratory ailments for dogs and cats, mostly pets, and 11 deaths - six street dogs, three cats and remaining pet dogs - where the post-mortem revealed that it was due to cardio-respiratory failure for all./Officials said they have been recording 75 such cases per month this winter. The cases were 25% higher than last year, when only three stray dog deaths were recorded and 167 lung-related ailments were administered. ""We have witnessed an unusual increase in cases this season. While some minor cases include coughing, sneezing, and breathing troubles, major cases of bronchitis, asthma, chest congestion, upper respiratory infections and other pulmonary disorders have been recorded,"" said Lt Col Dr JC Khanna, the chief executive officer in charge, BSPCA./Inhaling dust while walking pets close to busy traffic junctions over a long period of time is leading to congestion or respiratory infections to develop, he said. ""Dust or particulate matter (PM2.5 pollutant) - small pollutant particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause ailments - severely affect dogs and cats as the filtering process in their lungs is not as fast humans,"" he said, adding that as far as the deaths are concerned, most of the cases were of street dogs./""These dogs were brought in when they were already critical, and it is clear that there was continuous exposure to dust. Owing to the increasing number of cases, we have had to accommodate these animals in two extra wards,"" said Dr. Khanna. ""In such cases, we immediately administer oxygen supply, and ensure they have adequate rest. After carrying out blood and urine tests, we administer drug injections such as derryphilline that help ease congestion in the lungs.""/The Bombay Veterinary College and veterinarians from different parts of the city confirmed that there was a 10-15% increase in such cases over previous years. ""The change in weather conditions, unusually cloudy activity, air pollution and increased moisture in the city's air, are all adding to the sudden rise in such ailments among dogs and cats. As per cases seen by us, pet animals are more vulnerable as natural resistance is less as compared to strays,"" said Dr. Rajiv Gaikwad, professor and head of department, veterinary services, Bombay Veterinary College. ""Controlling indoor air pollution and minimising exposure outdoors for these animals is necessary.""/Dr. SV Vishwasrao, Bandra-based veterinary surgeon practicing for last 30 years, said other symptoms for respiratory ailments include lethargy, low appetite and fever. ""In dogs, the respiratory pathway has receptors and nerves which get stimulated by chemical factors, smoke and aspirated material. In some breeds, it could lead to serious life-threatening conditions. This effect of increase in pollution affects the pediatric pets and older dogs more,"" he said, adding that a thorough clinical examination sometimes followed by chest radiographs is helpful. ""Acute cough must be treated promptly to prevent it from turning into a chronic one. It's high time to look at pollution as a life threatening problem which will affect not only humans but each living individual human or animal.""/""While there is hardly any research about this even internationally, the effect is being felt in all major cities across India, and pet owners, animal lovers, need to alert local vets regarding such incidents at the earliest,"" said Dr. Trisha D'souza, private veterinarian from Chembur./ACTIVISTS SPEAK/""The civic body does not allow pet owners to walk their dogs or take their cats to parks and green spaces. As a result they are being forced to breathe polluted air along various traffic junctions in the city, automatically leading to an increase in respiratory troubles,"" said Anand Siva, Chembur based animal activist./WHAT CIVIC BODY HAS TO SAY?/""We have not received any such complaints so far. However, it is a matter of concern if such cases are increasing, and we will direct various NGOs under our department to take step by step action to at least move stray animals away from areas prone to dust,"" said Dr. Yogesh Shetye, general director, Deonar abattoir and head of veterinary services, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation./GUIDELINES FOR PET OWNERS, ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS TO PROTECT PETS FROM POLLUTION/-Avoid walking pets during early morning and evening hours/-Try walking pets closer to green spaces and away from traffic junctions/-Ensure they drink adequate water/-Ensure air quality at home is clean and there is enough ventilation/-Pet owners may notice cough which ranges from faint moist cough to a honking cough followed by retching. Sometimes a pet may retch after cough, and owners confuse it for vomiting. Inform your local vet about it before it becomes chronic/-Ensure pets have a lot of rest after daily walks/-If the animal is lethargic, has low appetite and fever for more than a week, visit the local veterinarian/-If there is dust, open burning or any other emissions near residential areas, file complaint with the police and keep doors and windows shut/(Source: BSPCA, private veterinarians and Bombay Veterinary College)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Smokeless crackers this Diwali? First prototype made in Mohali,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 12 -- The aim to create pollution-free firecrackers in time for Diwali this year has got a major boost, with the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali developing a prototype in which there is light and sound, but no smoke, scientists said on Sunday./Further testing can pave the way for the mass production of crackers that significantly reduce the harmful after-effects of Diwali, particularly in Delhi and other north Indian cities./""The prototype that we have developed produces only sound and dazzling light. There is no smoke. Unlike a traditional firecracker, which produces a range of noxious gases that add to air pollution, this firecracker produces droplets of water on combustion. It is also reusable,"" said Samrat Ghosh, assistant professor of chemical sciences at IISER Mohali who led the team that developed the prototype./HT had reported on January 16 that Union minister for science and technology Harsh Vardhan had asked scientists from government-backed research institutes to develop e-firecrackers to check the post-Diwali pollution spike./Last year, the Supreme Court had banned the sale of firecrackers in the National Capital Region, where poor air quality has forced authorities to declare public health emergencies for the last three winters./The IISER, Mohali prototype is made up of a plastic bottle loaded with a combustible gas. It is mounted on a handheld device, which is basically an improvised gas lighter. When triggered, the lighter produces a spark and the gas is ignited. It produces a dazzling light and loud bang. Unlike traditional firecrackers, it can also be fired when it is raining, scientists said./The prototype has a second version that can be fired from a ground-based launcher, akin to the traditional 'rocket' firecracker./""We have not decided on the price yet. But as the bottles can be refueled, just like your LPG-gas cylinder. We are sure that it won't cost much,"" said Ghosh, adding that the IISER team has initiated talks with some entrepreneurs to go for mass production./Meanwhile, researchers at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) are also working on smokeless prototypes, which are expected to be ready in the six months with the aim that they will be on the market before Diwali this year./""The one which has been developed by scientists at IISER, Mohali appears to be based on some chemicals, which need to be ignited. We are developing a different type, which will actually be an electronic firecracker,"" said Santanu Chaudhury, director of CSIR's Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CEERI) in Pilani, Rajasthan./Traditional firecrackers are highly polluting because manufacturers use a range of compounds that use metals such as barium, antimony, copper and lithium, which emit toxic fumes./Delhi suffered its worst smog in 17 years after Diwali in 2016. In 2017, despite the Supreme Court ban on the sale of crackers, there was again a spike in pollution levels, triggered by crackers procured from outside the region, experts said./""It is a welcome move. All kinds of innovations in the field of developing smokeless firecrackers are invited. Efforts are also on to make smokeless and electronic firecrackers. We are expecting some results in the next two to three months,"" said Rakesh Kumar, director of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Patna faces 'breathing' trouble; state agency plans long & short term air pollution mitigation strategy,"Patna, Feb. 15 -- The state capital, which is on way to joining the league of smart cities, has turned into a virtual dreaded zone for its citizen in terms of ambient air quality./In a recent survey, Greenpeace-an environmental watchdog-has rated Patna as the fourth worst polluted city in the country./Another national-level agency working in the field of environment and energy, Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), too, has come out with its assessment of air quality, declaring that Patnaites could breathe 'good air' only for three days last year./Quality of air in the capital city was found to be either 'poor' or 'severe' on 55% days of the year 2017. On the day when nation celebrated Children's Day-november 14th-patnaites had to face the most degraded air in the year, with concentration of PM2.5 going as high as 643 g/m3, which is over 10 times higher than the national standard./Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who also holds environment and forest department, said the quality of air was not as grave as what was being projected through the analysis based on Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) statistics./""There is only one monitoring station of the CPCB, located near the busiest road of the capital. Assessment of ambient air quality through single monitoring station might not produce holistic view of the entire city,"" said Modi, adding that five new monitoring stations were being set up in different areas soon for more realistic analysis of air quality./Modi also questioned the authenticity of survey reports, wondering how the level of pollutants could go up in air such alarmingly, even as construction activities remained jeopardised for the past one year due to ban on trade of sand and suspension of brick kilns' operation./CEED'S bulletin for 2016 admitted dip in annual average concentration of particulate matter (PM)2.5 of Patna this year as compared to last year. ""Annual average of PM2.5 concentration in the air was found to be 138.6g/ m, whereas it was 144.2g/m last year. However, it was still 4 times more than the national standard and 14 times more than that of the WHO safety limits,"" said the bulletin./Higher concentration of PM2.5 in the air is a major health hazard. Health experts felt that being an ultra fine particle, PM2.5 easily sneaks into lungs and cases respiratory diseases and hence a prominent source of lung cancer. Vehicular emissions including road dust, solid fuel burning for cooking and heating, brick kilns emission, open burning of waste and contribution of sources outside city's airfield are major contributors of particulate matter, particularly PM2.5 in Patna. The city has an estimated 15% of the annual PM2.5 pollution sourced only from the transport sector./Additional analysis of the 24-hour concentration of PM2.5 for 311 monitored days by CEED yielded that the concentration of PM2.5 was recorded within its safety limits for only 81 days, which is 60g/m3./In 2017, the 24-hour concentration of PM2.5 in 71 days was 3-6 times higher than the safety standard, and there were 11 days when the pollution level (PM2.5) was measured more than 6 times of the safety standards. For 106 days, the concentration was measured as 1-2 times more than the safety limits./Former head of cardiology department, PMCH, UC Samal said the people should at least put breathing mask on while moving around in the congested areas./""Ultra fine particles (PM2.5) can cause severe damages to inner surface of lung. Continuous exposure PM2.5 could make lung stiff and spastic instead of spongy, and lead affected persons to suffer from interstitial lung diseases,"" added Dr Samal./Chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) Ashok Ghosh, an academician, said besides installing new pollution monitoring stations, the board was looking to draw both short-term and long-term action plan to rid the city of air pollution./""The action plan may include source apportionment study as well to find the actual sources of emission of toxic gases,"" said Ghosh./CEED chief executive officer Ramapati Kumar appreciated the BSPCB'S gesture and said his organisation would extend all help in the government's drive to keep the city free from pollution./While keeping the urgency of the situation in mind, the state government has stopped registration of new auto rickshaws, which are believed to be a main contributor for bad air. The state government also urgently require an affirmative 'clean air action plan', which should involve the process to identify emission source, recognise and stipulate regulations, and also includes institutional arrangements that will set it on track to mitigate pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Expanding Pune: Director of WHSA on why the area needs serious attention from civic authorities,"India, Feb. 24 -- Sanjeevkumar Patil, director, Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) is one of the seven directors of the residents' group trying to improve the civic amenities and infrastructure in Wagholi. WHSA has emerged as one of the strongest civic voices in the city. Patil spoke to Nadeem Inamdar about the main concerns of the citizens in the area./Which are the most immediate issues of concern for WHSA?/Waste management has to be planned on priority. The complete mismanagement of garbage disposal and the burning of garbage has been resulting in respiratory problems among children and the elderly. We are facing serious air pollution due to the smoke and foggy atmosphere. Sewage water lines have not been laid out in Wagholi forcing residents to create soak pit. The percolation of wastewater in the ground has been causing water pollution and the polluted water in borewells could cause serious health issues./What about water supply and approach roads?/Provision for drinking water for Wagholi residents by the government is our fundamental right. As of now, everyone is forced to purchase water from water tankers due to scarcity of water supply. The approach roads to various parts of the locality have not been well-developed and this has been causing a lot of inconvenience. The civic body has failed to address the urban concerns of the residents and it is high time that better planning is introduced on fast track in Wagholi to prevent a complete breakdown./What has WHSA able to achieve so far?/We have reached out to every civic body officials and peoples' representatives such as MP Anil Shirole, PMRDA metropolitan commissioner and others. The gram panchayat of Wagholi has started Gram Swachhata Abhiyan on a weekly basis due to the impact of WHSA . We have been instrumental in the inclusion of 3,400 new voters in Wagholi voting list. The Wagholi gram panchayat has planned the installation of a waste management plant on priority. The demands of WHSA have been placed by the Wagholi gram panchayat before the gram sabha/How do you propose to proceed with a view to achieving your objectives?/We want to increase civic engagement with all the stakeholders and make Wagholi livable. We will work closely with the PMRDA and ensure that the residents get their fundamental civic rights at the earliest. Besides, there is a need to come up with a visionary development plan for Wagholi where the citizens will be active initiators and implementors of the project with complete support from the government./Info Box/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution: Delhi enjoys cleanest February in three years,"New Delhi, Feb. 27 -- As air quality improves and with winter gone, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) is likely to lift the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) from March 1, two weeks before it was scheduled to come to an end./Delhi is enjoying its cleanest February in three years as far as the air quality index is concerned. The number of days with 'very poor' and 'poor' air quality has gone down while days with 'moderate' air quality have risen./Data released by the Central Pollution Control Board shows that the number of days in February with 'very poor' air quality dropped from 15 in 2016 to four in 2017. In 2018 it dropped to three./Similarly, 'poor' quality days have dropped from 22 in 2017 to 18 this year. Days with 'moderate' air quality has gone up from 0 in 2016 to two in 2017. In 2018, there were six days of moderate air quality in February./""There were two 'moderate' days in February 2017. The AQI was 162 on February 7, 2017. This year the AQI dropped to 140 on Monday - the lowest AQI recorded in February in last three years,"" said a senior CPCB official./Scientists said the clean air is a combined effect of measures taken to curb pollution and favourable meteorological conditions./""A slew of measures had been rolled out to keep pollution levels under control. Other measures such as the ban on pet coke and furnace oil have also yielded results. Meteorological conditions are also favourable. Strong winds are blowing and temperature is rising, which is aiding better air circulation. This is helping in dispersal of pollutants,"" D Saha, former head of the CPCB's air quality laboratory, said./Officials from the regional weather forecasting centre said the wind speed had been high over the past 10-12 days. On Monday, it was around 35 km per hour. In winter, wind speed drops to less 5 km per hour./""Measures under the GRAP to combat 'very poor' and 'severe' pollution levels were rolled out for the first time from October 17, 2017. It was scheduled to end on March 15, 2018. But with air quality better and showing signs of further improvement, the plan is likely to be withdrawn from March 1,"" said an EPCA member./Even though measures to control levels of 'severe' and 'very poor' are likely to be lifted, ban on open burning will continue throughout the year./Hindustan Times had earlier reported that despite the toxic haze that had engulfed Delhi for more than a week in November 2017, the Capital breathed comparatively cleaner air in 2017 than in 2016./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

An ecological emergency: Act now,"Mumbai, March 7 -- Erik Solheim, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), was in Delhi recently to announce, along with the Union minister of environment and forests, Harsh Vardhan, that India will be the global host of this year's World Environment Day (WED) on June 5. The day (WED) has been observed every year since 1974 after a decision taken at the World Environment Conference of 1972. Each year, the activities are centred on a particular theme. This year, the focus is on plastic pollution (""Beat Plastic Pollution"")./According to UNEP, the world uses 500 billion plastic bags and, in the last decade, produced more plastic than the whole of the 20th century. What is more, about eight million tonnes of plastics are dumped into the ocean each year, killing a million sea birds and 100,000 sea mammals./What is worse, 50% of the plastics consumed are for single use, which adds to the volume of waste. Some categories of plastics may persist in the earth's ecology for 500 years. In India, plastic litter is everywhere from beaches to mountains because people do not think twice before dumping it. Plastics in oceans break down into micro elements, which are then ingested by fish and find their way into the food chain. In India, stray cattle are seen feeding on plastic waste. If India is to live up to its role as host of the WED, it must take the lead in tackling plastic pollution that threatens to engulf and strangulate an already fragile ecology./There are some hopeful signs. India has a very high rate of recycling of plastic waste, thanks to its army of poor and hardworking ragpickers. They not only pick up all kinds of waste, but sort them out and aggregate them, making it much easier to recycle. But for their contribution, India's problem of waste management, already a major preoccupation, would be an even bigger challenge. Their role needs to be acknowledged and an effort should be made to integrate them into a well-structured recycling chain, which is not only efficient but also ensures reasonable compensation for their hard work./Some useful research has been done in converting plastic waste into biodiesel for commercial use. This should be intensified rapidly since it can also contribute to the country's energy security./Sikkim has been a pioneer in making the state plastic free. The use of bottled drinking water has been banned but at the same time clean potable water is made available through water ATMs. These have been introduced in some locations in Delhi as well. A concerted drive to provide such ATMs across cities would not only reduce the use of plastic but also yield significant health benefits by making clean potable water available to people. According to UNEP, a million plastic bottles are consumed every minute in the world and Indians are major consumers./As host of the WED, India must tackle the problem of air pollution, which has become a major health hazard. One should study the experience of Beijing, which has achieved a dramatic reduction in air pollution after years of being one of the world's most polluted cities. It is now our capital city, Delhi, which has assumed that sorry mantle. One of the major sources of air pollution in some Chinese cities has been the use of coal for domestic heating in winter. This has now been stopped and relatively cleaner gas is being promoted instead. In Indian cities, nearly 20-25% of daily cooking is still through burning biomass and urban waste, a significant source of air pollution.

An ecological emergency: Act now,"NEW DELHI, March 7 -- Erik Solheim, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), was in Delhi recently to announce, along with the Union minister of environment and forests, Harsh Vardhan, that India will be the global host of this year's World Environment Day (WED) on June 5. The day (WED) has been observed every year since 1974 after a decision taken at the World Environment Conference of 1972. Each year, the activities are centred on a particular theme. This year, the focus is on plastic pollution (""Beat Plastic Pollution"")./According to UNEP, the world uses 500 billion plastic bags and, in the last decade, produced more plastic than the whole of the 20th century. What is more, about eight million tonnes of plastics are dumped into the ocean each year, killing a million sea birds and 100,000 sea mammals./What is worse, 50% of the plastics consumed are for single use, which adds to the volume of waste. Some categories of plastics may persist in the earth's ecology for 500 years. In India, plastic litter is everywhere from beaches to mountains because people do not think twice before dumping it. Plastics in oceans break down into micro elements, which are then ingested by fish and find their way into the food chain. In India, stray cattle are seen feeding on plastic waste. If India is to live up to its role as host of the WED, it must take the lead in tackling plastic pollution that threatens to engulf and strangulate an already fragile ecology./There are some hopeful signs. India has a very high rate of recycling of plastic waste, thanks to its army of poor and hardworking ragpickers. They not only pick up all kinds of waste, but sort them out and aggregate them, making it much easier to recycle. But for their contribution, India's problem of waste management, already a major preoccupation, would be an even bigger challenge. Their role needs to be acknowledged and an effort should be made to integrate them into a well-structured recycling chain, which is not only efficient but also ensures reasonable compensation for their hard work./Some useful research has been done in converting plastic waste into biodiesel for commercial use. This should be intensified rapidly since it can also contribute to the country's energy security./Sikkim has been a pioneer in making the state plastic free. The use of bottled drinking water has been banned but at the same time clean potable water is made available through water ATMs. These have been introduced in some locations in Delhi as well. A concerted drive to provide such ATMs across cities would not only reduce the use of plastic but also yield significant health benefits by making clean potable water available to people. According to UNEP, a million plastic bottles are consumed every minute in the world and Indians are major consumers./As host of the WED, India must tackle the problem of air pollution, which has become a major health hazard. One should study the experience of Beijing, which has achieved a dramatic reduction in air pollution after years of being one of the world's most polluted cities. It is now our capital city, Delhi, which has assumed that sorry mantle. One of the major sources of air pollution in some Chinese cities has been the use of coal for domestic heating in winter. This has now been stopped and relatively cleaner gas is being promoted instead. In Indian cities, nearly 20-25% of daily cooking is still through burning biomass and urban waste, a significant source of air pollution. If this could be gradually reduced through greater use of LPG, there would be a positive impact on air quality./It is unfortunate that year after year the problem of extensive burning of crop residue in northern Indian states continues to persist despite there being cost-effective solutions. There are machines available not only to extract crop residues but to aggregate and compact them and even use them as organic fertiliser. While they may be expensive for individual farmers to buy, they can be leased for use through farmer service centres on nominal payment. The problem of winter haze in northern India would be resolved once and for all./Solheim has welcomed India's decision to host the WED and his agency is more than ready to offer its cooperation to help the country meet its environmental goals.

Farm fires behind Capital's worst air days: Global study,"NEW DELHI, April 4 -- Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana may contribute up to 78% of Delhi's pollution in the months of October and November, a new study by researchers from Harvard University and NASA claims./The two months, which also coincide with the onset of winter in the northern plains, see the most burning of the agricultural residue./""Depending on the year and emission inventory, our method attributes 7%-78% of the maximum observed PM2.5 enhancements in Delhi to fires,"" said the study, which was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters./Since the 1980s, many farmers in northwest India have switched to mechanised combine harvesting to boost efficiency. This harvesting technique leaves abundant crop residue in the fields that farmers typically burn to prepare their fields for subsequent planting./The researchers from Harvard University, NASA, Columbia University and other research institutes in the US gathered data for October and November, for the years 2012 to 2016, and fed them into the particle dispersion model - an algorithm that accounts for geography, wind patterns, and physics - to predict how far and in what direction smoke particles travel./The study showed that the maximum effect of stubble burning on the levels of PM2.5 in Delhi was felt in the years 2012 and 2016. The effect was less in 2013, 2014, and 2015./""Smoke from these fires consists of black carbon and organic particulate matter. The harvest season coincides with post-monsoon conditions that favour stagnation and weak surface northwesterly winds in the Indo-Gangetic plains. These conditions allow smoke to slowly permeate throughout the region, including Delhi,"" the study says./Previous studies have attempted to analyse the various sources of pollution in Delhi, but none have been conclusive./A study, Socioeconomic and Environmental Implications of Agricultural Residue Burning published by Springer in 2015, says that each tonne of crop residue on burning releases around 3kg of particulate matter, 60 kg of CO, 1,460 kg of CO2, 199kg of ash and 2kg of SO2. ""Stubble burning also takes a heavy toll on the soil, resulting in loss of nutrients and micro-organisms that help to enrich the soil,"" said Polash Mukerjee, senior research associate (air pollution), Centre for Science and Environment./Though the National Green Tribunal banned crop burning in 2015, an estimated 35 million tonnes of stubble are still set on fire in Punjab and Haryana alone to make room for the winter crop./The primary reasons behind farmers setting crop residue afire are cost concerns and the short time gap between summer and winter crops, besides lack of incentives and equipment to manually cut down the stubble./To put an end to the menace a High Level Task Force (HLTF) led by the principal secretary to the Prime Minister has been constituted for management of air pollution in Delhi NCR in 2017. The HLTF constituted a sub-committee on prevention of stubble burning in NCR States./In its latest budget the union government allocated Rs 1151.80 crore for promotion of agricultural mechanization for in-situ management of crop residue in the north western states./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Noida, Gzb on list of districts with critical air pollution level","ALLAHABAD, April 6 -- Around six of the 24 major districts in the state, including Lucknow, have critical levels of air pollution causing severe breathing disorders.According to the recent ambient air quality report of UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), of the 24 major cities in the state where ambient air quality check was conducted in February 2018, six districts were found to have nearly four times the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) or Particulate Matter 10 (PM10) against a maximum permissible limit of 100 micrograms/ cubic metre./The report revealed that Ghaziabad district topped the list of 10 cities with 371.25 microgram/ cubic metre being recorded in its Khoda colony residential area. This was followed by the Hazratganj area in Lucknow with a PM/10 level of 370.38 microgram/ cubic metre. Kanpur came in third with an RSPM of 350.80 microgram/cubic metre./As per UPPCB, fourth highest level of PM10 was recorded at/342.62 micrograms/cubic metre in Golf Course area in Sector 37, Noida, while fifth highest level of/342.02 micrograms/cubic metre was recorded near Sarai Mali Khan area in Lucknow./The sixth highest PM10 level of/324.0 micrograms/cubic metre was recorded in Sahibabad industrial area in Ghaziabad while seventh and eight highest air pollution level was recorded at 312.50 microgram/cubic metre and 312.25 micrograms/cubic metre in Greater Noida./The ninth spot went to Hapur district with PM10 level recorded at 312.15 micrograms/cubic metre while Lucknow again found a place in the list in the 10th position with 311.36 micrograms/ cubic metre of RSPM, in Talkatoraarea./As per prescribed norms of the Board, PM10 level recorded between 0 and 50 micrograms/ cubic metre had minimal impact on human heath while between 51 and 100 microgram/cubic metre could cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people./Similarly, PM 10 level between/101 and 200 micrograms/cubic metre could result in breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart disease, children and elderly people. A reading between 201 and 300 micrograms/ cubic metre could cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure./Further, level of PM10 between/301 and 400 micrograms/cubic metre could cause respiratory illness to people on prolonged exposure while that above 401 microgram/cubic metre will adversely affect even healthy people./SK Mishra, regional officer UPPCB, Allahabad, said excessive vehicular emissions, besides dust, has contributed to rise in PM10 level./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Noida & Ghaziabad.

"Sport injuries not restricted to players alone, say experts","Lucknow, April 8 -- Sports injuries are not limited only to players or athletes. In fact, routine work like riding a bike can also cause injuries such as tennis elbow - a known injury among tennis players, say experts./Addressing a gathering on World Health Day on Saturday, Prof Shish Kumar, HoD, sports medicine department at the KGMU said, ""Accelerating a bike has similar impact on muscles as taking a backhand shot.""/Explaining further, he said the muscle that facilitated that movement stretched from wrist to elbow and the base too was at the elbow. So if the pull on the muscle was extensive, the outer side of the elbow would pain, which non-players fail to guess correctly./""Every week I get such cases where non-players are diagnosed with sports injury,"" said Prof Kumar./He said the pain in the inner side of the elbow happened to be golfers' elbow and could occur even while lifting a bucket full of water. The other examples of common sports injury are jumpers' knee, caused by incorrect manner of rope skipping./LUNG DISEASES ALSO A MAJOR PROBLEM/Prof Surya Kant, HoD, respiratory medicine, KGMU spoke on the major respiratory problems troubling people. Lung diseases account for 11% of all the deaths occurring in India and for 10% of all hospital admissions./""According to WHO report, in 2014, of all the cases of tuberculosis, 1/4th were from India (approx.28 lakh). Every third person dying due to TB is an Indian. There are about 7.5 lakh people suffering from TB in Uttar Pradesh out of which 2.5 lakh approach government hospitals and 2.5 lakh seek private medical consultation. The rest of the 2.5 lakh TB patients are unaccounted for,"" he said./COPD is also one of the major chronic lung diseases, affecting around 3 crore people in India. The major predisposing factors were smoking, bio-mass fuel exposure and any kind of smoke causing air pollution, Prof Surya Kant said./To summarize, the major causal agents of respiratory disorders in India included air pollution, smoking, exposure to chulha-smoke (biomass fuel), toxic gases released from automobiles and industries, infection, dietary habits (over consumption of fast food) and lifestyle, he said./These respiratory disorders may be prevented or controlled by control of air pollution which could be achieved by afforestation, minimal use of automobiles, keeping industries away from residential areas, banning of smoking in public places and promotion of LPG gas stoves replacing chulhas./CYCLE RALLY/A cycling event was organised by the Indian Medical Association at Janeshwar Mishra Park in the morning where doctors organised a camp for respiratory problems and provided free check-up.

"Firecracker fumes can cause miscarriage, stunt growth: Govt","India, April 13 -- Harmful fumes from crackers can cause miscarriage, hinder growth of children and aggravate respiratory illnesses among children and pregnant women, the Union women and child development (WCD) ministry has said in an affidavit while pushing for stringent regulation of firecrackers across India./The ministry has given its views to the ministry of environment and forests last fortnight so the two can present a consolidated view of the Centre before the Supreme Court, which is hearing a matter seeking a ban on the sale of crackers in the country./The ministry in its affidavit has also said that the firecracker industry is ""ridden"" with child labour and forced labour, seeking control over its use./""We wanted to become a party in the case going on in the apex court as the issue directly concerns us. Bursting of firecrackers has grave implications on the health and well being of women and children. We have submitted our views in an affidavit to the environment ministry,"" a senior WCD ministry official, who did not want to be named, said./Last October, the Supreme Court reinstated its ban on the sale of firecrackers in and around New Delhi ahead of Diwali, with a view to stopping a toxic haze from engulfing the region. The court's order came following a petition on behalf of a child to recall its earlier order in September 2017 relaxing the ban./"".. the applicant would humbly like to state that after firing the crackers, fine dust particles get settled on the surrounding surfaces which are packed with chemicals like copper, zinc, sodium, lead, magnesium, cadmium and pollutants like oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. These chemicals, in turn, irritates the respiratory tract causes anaemia by reducing the capacity of blood to carry oxygen, fever, vomiting, harms the nervous system and causes burns .,"" the WCD ministry has said in its affidavit./"". children, pregnant women and those suffering from respiratory illness suffer the most due to excessive noise and chemicals emitted by firecrackers.. the harmful fumes while firing crackers can lead to miscarriage.. petitioner is of the view that due control is necessary on firecrackers to eliminate or limit risks to women and children from such noise and air pollution,"" it adds./The WCD ministry has cited a study carried out by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) in 2013, which found that fireworks, matches, and incense stick producing factories of Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu employ children aged between 5-15 years who work for more than 12 hours a day, on the issue of the firecracker industry promoting child labour./Health experts agree to the harmful effect of smoke and noise from firecrackers on the health of old people, children and pregnant women.

The maximum number of such brick kilns (33) are situated at Maner, on the bank of the Ganga./The BSPCB has sent letters to the Patna DM and SSP to implement the decision and ensure closure of these brick kilns./These brick kilns have failed to adopt the new 'cleaner technology' or 'zigzag kiln' that ensure complete burning of the fuel, coal, and continued with the old technology having huge emissions of toxic gases in the air./The remaining brick kilns whose closure has been ordered are situated at Patna sadar (20), Danapur (2), Phulwarisharif (5) and Fatuha (1)./Confirming the action to HT, BSPCB chairman Dr Ashok K Ghosh said the brick sector flourished unmindful of its hazardous impact on environment./There were altogether 265 brick kilns in Patna district, mostly located in five blocks Maner, Danapur, Patna sadar, Phulwarisharif and Fatuha -- of which 109 have already adopted the cleaner technology recommended by the CPCB./Over 60 brick kilns are lying closed, some already demolished but 61 continued to run and produced bricks through the old technology and hence have been ordered to silence their chimneys./""It flouted the norms of CPCB and added to the worsening of the air quality in the state capital leading to threat of several diseases to human life,"" Ghosh said and added that, the chimneys based on cleaner technology had more heights so as to disperse the smoke farther from human habitation and thus safe for environment./Brick kilns are considered a major cause of air pollution besides automobile exhaust, dust, chemical fertilisers and pesticides and biomedical wastes./A few days back, the BSPCB has sent notice to over 300 nursing homes pathological units and other health centres for not following the government norms for disposal of their biomedical waste./SPECIAL DRIVE AGAINST TRAFFIC JAM/DM Kumar Ravi on Monday directed the district transport officer to launch a three-day special drive to end the nagging problem of frequent traffic jams in urban areas of Patna as also unchecked use of pressure horns causing noise pollution. The DM'S direction came in light of a high court order on traffic jams and other problems./In a meeting with DTO, subdivisional police officers and other officials, Ravi sought reports from DTO, SDPOS and SHOS of different police stations falling under the Patna Municipal Corporation area detailing how many shops illegally sold pressure horns and what action was taken against dealers as well as users of such horns./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

BSPCB to form inter-departmental council for checking pollution,"Patna, April 24 -- Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has documented causes and remedies for air pollution in the state, with special focus on Patna. The board would hold an inter-departmental meeting on May 9 where an inter-departmental council (IDC) would be constituted to tackle the menace of air pollution./The IDC would be constituted in urban development department, road construction department, Patna Municipal Corporation, transportation department and others. BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said representatives of various departments would come together to sketch out a plan to curb pollution in Bihar./He said the main culprit for air pollution was old vehicles that were not fit to ply and emitted black smoke./""These include public transport buses, autos running on kerosene and private vehicles that do not have a proper pollution under control (PUC) certificate. We will suggest the transport department to ban the vehicles that are older than 15 years or more. Moreover, there are many pollution checking stations that are defective and many people get the PUC certificate from them without even taking their vehicles to the station. In a drive run 15 days back, we found many defective machines. We will also suggest the transport department to keep a strict eye of such stations,"" Ghosh said./Talking about other causes of pollution, he said regular construction in the city gave rise to dust and air pollution besides depleting green cover. ""We will discuss all the aspects and chalk out a solution in collaboration with the departments concerned. Moreover, we will also work to ban plastics in Bihar as early as possible,"" he added./Patna till now has only one air pollution monitoring station at Planetarium. However, last year, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi had announced to sanction a budget to install five more monitoring stations for Patna. Talking about the progress in this regard, he said, ""Two monitoring station devices have been purchased and they would be installed in Kankarbagh and Patliputra industrial areas by the end of this month or in the first week of May, however, other three devices are yet to be purchased. The budgetary provision for the same have been completed and we are hoping to get them installed by June.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Bad air killed 7 million worldwide: WHO data,"NEW DELHI, May 2 -- Inhaling polluted air affects lungs the most, shows data analysis released by World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday (India time) analysing particulate matter (PM) in the air across the globe./Of all the deaths linked to severe air pollution, 43% were associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs, and 29% succumbed to lung cancer./WHO estimates close to 90% of people globally were exposed to severely polluted air, and about seven million died around the world in 2016 due to reasons attributed to air pollution./""There is a 100% correlation and COPD is triggered by both outdoor and indoor air pollution. We had done a study in the hospital years ago that gave us enough evidence to prove it. The study observed our patients for about a year and found that emergency visits due to COPD had increased by 24% within 24 to 48 hours of rise in pollution levels,"" says Dr GC Khilnani, professor, department of pulmonary medicine, AIIMS./Lung cancer, which is one of the fast spreading cancers if not diagnosed early, is also one of conditions linked with inhaling severely polluted air over a long period. ""By the time people notice symptoms, the cancer has reached second or third stage, and becomes difficult to treat,"" said Dr Khilnani./Heart disease and stroke were other reasons for death that were linked to air pollution. It included both ambient (outdoor) and indoor pollution, with 25% dying of a heart disease and 24% suffering stroke./""High air pollution levels definitely impacts functioning of the heart but we need further studies to establish the exact magnitude. It could be one of the precipitating factors,"" says Dr VK Bahl, head of cardiology department, AIIMS./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Mumbai, the air you breathe has tiny, deadly pollutants","Mumbai, May 7 -- The city's air is full of deadly, tiny pollutant particles that are less than a micrometre in diameter - a human hair is 100 micrometres - a new study of air pollution levels in three Indian cities found. Just days earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO)?declared Mumbai the fourth most polluted mega city in the world./So just how harmful are these particles, called particulate matter 1 (PM1), and why should it worry you?/""PM1 particles are like micro needles that can travel to different organs of the body through our blood,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), which conducted the study./The study found that Mumbai recorded the highest concentration of PM1 in the larger PM 2.5 pollutants that float around in the air, across seasons in 2017. PM 2.5 are slightly larger particulate matter - 2.5 microns in diameter - and are also harmful as they easily enter the lungs. Unlike PM2.5, and the even larger, coarser PM10, there are no international or Indian standards determining a safe limit for PM1./This means, calculating its levels as a part of PM2.5 is one of the few ways to assess how much damage it can do to the human body. The study found the average concentration of PM1 in PM2.5 was the highest in Mumbai (50%) in summer, winter and monsoon 2017./In Delhi, it was 48% and in Ahmedabad, 38%. ""The high concentration of PM1 in Mumbai's air is a health concern because 50%?of the PM2.5 pollutant in Mumbai's air is made up of PM1,"" Beig said. ""This is dangerous for all citizens, but especially children and senior citizens."" Beig said that while the overall concentration of PM1 levels in Mumbai was lower than Delhi's, its high concentration in PM2.5 showed that more citizens were breathing polluted air./Further, the probability of inhaling PM1 particles is high as they stay suspended in the air and closer to the surface much longer when compared to coarser particles that get dispersed faster, Beig said./According to the SAFAR study, the share of PM1 in PM2.5 for Mumbai during the monsoon and summer was 67% and 46%, the highest among all three cities. Delhi recorded 61% during the monsoon and 44% during summer, while Ahmedabad saw 40% and 35% during both seasons. During the winter, Delhi saw the highest concentration of PM1 in PM2.5 at 47%, followed by Mumbai and Ahmedabad at 46% and 41%. Meanwhile, the average individual concentration of PM1 in 2017 was the highest in Delhi at 48 microgrammes per cubic metre (ug/m3), followed by Mumbai at 30ug/m3 and Ahmedabad at 27ug/m3. ""The individual concentration of PM1 is not indicative of a pollution problem as there is no safe limit for the pollutant. However, when the concentration is high within PM2.5, it shows how citizens are exposed to these tiny, deadly small pollutant particles,"" said Beig./Where is PM1 coming from? SAFAR found the major source as the transport sector./""Vehicular emissions at busy traffic junctions are the main source of PM1 in PM2.5. This can be tallied as the number of vehicles in Mumbai and Delhi is much higher as compared to Ahmedabad,"" said Beig, adding the three-city study highlighted the sources of PM1 that need to be controlled in order to reduce this 'invisible killer pollutant'. ""During the summer and monsoon months, owing to high humidity and low wind speed in Mumbai, pollutants remain suspended close to the surface longer. The other source of this pollutant, mainly observed in Delhi and some parts of Mumbai was bio-fuel emissions, most likely be black carbon from domestic cooking. Higher the fossil fuel emissions, worse is the PM1 problem."" Doctors said health ailments such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue) and asthma are all triggered as a result of these ultrafine particles./""PM1 particles can damages our respiratory system the most, as compared to any other pollutant.

"Brick kilns choke Wakad residents, pollute air","India, May 8 -- Residents of Wakad have alleged that the brick kiln in the area is contributing to air pollution, with many residents complaining of health problems./Residents of Shonest Towers Co Operative Housing Society, Omega Paradise, Tiara Society and Blue Earth Society on DP road, Wakad, have been complaining about the harmful effects of the smoke emitting from the brick kiln adjoining their boundary since the last two years. Some of the residents claimed that they are suffering from breathing ailments, while asthma has aggravated among senior citizens./When HT?team visited one of the housing societies in the area, smoke was emitting from the kiln due to which most residents kept their apartment terrace doors closed, to avoid brick ash and soot from covering their floors./""We have written several complaints to various authorities and every one seems to be passing the buck,"" said Tejaswini Dhomse Sawai, chairperson of Shonest towers society./""Even as the brick kiln is very close to residential areas, we were told that there would be a road running through the place where the brick kiln is operating, and hence, we thought of settling here,"" Dhomse said./Another resident said that despite the road being approved, its construction is not yet complete. ""The new DP road in Wakad would connect us directly to the national highway and will also be a parallel to the Dutt Mandir road,"" said Rajneesh Mishra, another resident, adding that there is no sign of the road nearing completed as the plot housing the brick kiln is in dispute and on rent with three kiln owners./The society has written letters to the Pimpri Chnichwad Municipal Corporation's (PCMC) environment health department; Shravan Haldikar, PCMC commissioner,and also to the tehsildar, to take cognisance of the problem. However, the efforts have not yielded results./Ward number 25, Wakad, is also most neglected as it has political rivalries with each trying to prove the other in terms of new projects./Speaking to Rahul Kalate, who was elected in this ward, ""I am aware of the problems faced by the residents, but they did not approach me, until recently. The kilns belong to two local families, Nimhan and Kathawade. They have been served several notices earlier, but there has been no further action from the tehsildar in removing the kilns from the area. When approached, the brick makers asked for 10 days to clear the area.""/""The kiln closest to our society was recently closed, but the other two are still continuing and causing us a lot of harm, especially in terms of respiratory problems,"" said Niranjan Manneri, a resident of Shonest towers and whose terrace overlooks the kilns. Manneri's family keeps the doors and windows closed to avoid soot and smoke./""With all windows and doors closed, there is no respite from heat either. The heat and smoke emitting from the kiln adds to the rise in temperature to the extent that even the ceiling fan circulates hot air,"" Manneri added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"No horn, please, for health's sake","NEW DELHI, May 13 -- Dust mixed with toxic fumes from vehicular exhausts exacerbate lung and heart diseases and trigger death from heart attack, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung infections like pneumonia, and cancers of the lung and respiratory tract./What is less known is traffic noise adds to this incessant vehicular assault on human health. Revving motors, ceaseless honking, overloaded vehicles and blaring music not just damage the health of commuters but also those who live or work around busy roads./Annoyance, irritability and hearing damage are the obvious fallouts, but several studies show that traffic noise leads to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, heart failure, diabetes, depression, memory impairment, disrupted sleep and hyperactivity in children./With the time spent commuting growing by the day in noisy cities, both big and small, even those who do not live close to busy roads risk sacrificing more than just sleep./HEART DISEASE/Environmental noise from traffic and aircraft disrupts the body on cellular level to raise heart disease risk factors, according to a review of underlying mechanisms that lead to noise-induced heart disease. Sound pollution causes metabolic abnormalities and autonomic imbalance, which is characterised by dizziness and exercise intolerance, said the study./Noise activates the sympathetic nervous system to induce a stress response, which raises the blood levels of the stress hormones such as cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenalin, even during sleep. These hormones prepare the body to survive an imminent ""fight for flight"" threat by making the heart beat faster, constricting blood vessels and pushing up blood pressure to feed more blood to the brain and muscles. When this physiological stress becomes constant, it leads to heart disease and diabetes, among others./MEMORY, LEARNING/Traffic noise harm children's ability to learn as they are more affected than adults by noise while doing tasks involving speech perception and listening comprehension. It also affects learning that doesn't involve speech perception and listening comprehension, such as short-term memory, reading and writing. This, over time, affects their cognitive development./Another study in Teheran found it affected the auditory verbal learning and memory of boys more than girls. Exposure to traffic noise causes behavioural problems, particularly hyperactivity and inattention symptoms, in early childhood. Sleeping while exposed to sound of night-time traffic raises children's blood pressure, raising their risk of heart disease in later life./SLEEP, MOOD/Night-time traffic noise lowers the quantity of sleep, leading to irritability, lowered attention, delayed response, tiredness and fatigue. People who live near busy streets have difficulty falling asleep, wake up frequently during the night, and get up early, found a population-based study from Norway, where traffic movement is quieter than on India's roads./People living in areas with high traffic noise were 25 percent more likely than those in quieter neighbourhoods to have symptoms of depression such as sadness, loneliness and trouble concentrating. In developing countries such as India where traffic movement is often more chaotic, mounting stress and irritability fuels hostility and road rage./NO HORN, PLEASE/Noise hazards can be mitigated by improving traffic management and regulating driving behaviour, which should include both motor and nonmotor road transportation. According to Section 190 (2) of the Central Motor Vehicles Act (2), ""Any person who drives or causes or allows to be driven, in any public place a motor vehicle, which violates the standards prescribed in relation to road safety, control of noise and air pollution, shall be punishable for the first offence with a fine of Rs 1,000 and for any second or subsequent offence with a fine of Rs 2,000.""/Along with fines, the challenge is to make aggressive road warriors aware that noisy driving harms their own health as much as others./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Puneites breathe air that is 4x more dangerous than normal,"India, May 15 -- Pune has four times more polluted air than the standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The startling revelation came to surface during a discussion at the day-long workshop on Air Pollution: Is The NCAP An Adequate Response To The Crisis. The workshop was organised by the legal initiative for forest and environment (LIFE) and parisar (a civil society organisation working on lobbying and advocacy for sustainable development), on Monday, at PYC Hindu Gymkhana./Experts believe that the amount of particulate matter (PM) in the city air is regarded as the most dangerous urban pollutant as it can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the blood stream. This can inturn lead to lung and heart-related ailments./The city, in 2017, had PM2.5 concentration at 40 ug/m3, which is four times higher than WHO standards set at 10 ug/m3, while PM10 during the same period was 85 ug/m3./Ritwick Dutta, a noted environment lawyer and managing trustee of the organisation legal initiative for forest and environment who has been creating awareness about the national clean air programme (NCAP), sounded the alarm with air pollution-related statistics./He said, "" Pune is already showing four times WHO standards of air pollution. What this city requires is at least 30 continuous air monitoring stations, while it currently has only five; four manual and one continuous station, under the PMC.""/Pune had an estimated modelled urban average ambient PM2.5 concentration of 56.3 +/- 12.9 ug/m3 in 2017, according to Dutta. ""We need to aggressively promote public and non-motorised transport as a part of the city's urban development plan, along with the improvement of road infrastructure to reduce on-road dust re-suspension,"" he added./He also pointed out that planning at a regional level is important and that the city level action plan is not the right way to handle the issue of air pollution as most of the industrial development takes place outside city limits, and any mitigation plans would exclude these areas./The workshop was attended by prominent environmentalists, activists and environment lovers who had been passionately combating the rising tide of urbanism which is gradually eating into the green lungs of the city./Explaining the rationale behind organising the workshop, Dutta said, ""The main idea is to make people aware of what inputs they should give for the national clean air programme, launched by the government to sought public comments till May 17, 2018,"" adding, ""We felt it necessary to hold such workshops as the national clean air programme, is only available on the ministry of environment website in English and can be accessed only on that particular website, with no other agency having any link. Besides, the government on its own has not organised a single consultation, except a single meeting with stakeholders, including the World Bank, the Energy and Resource Institute (TERI) and the government department.""/The workshop on a similar topic was also held in Bhubaneshwar, Chennai, Delhi and Pune./Mangesh Dighe, PMC environment officer, who gave a brief overview of the rising pollution in the city, said that the vehicle population in Pune had gone up significantly and was one of the important factors which contributed to pollutants suspended in the air for a long time leading to pollution./""Regional Transport Office (RTO) data from Pune says that, in a year, 2.06 lakh vehicles are registered and annually, it is increasing each year. This is a wake-up call for the residents and all the stakeholders,"" Dighe said./Pollution level highest during summers, winters: PMC environment department/Pollution in the city is at its peak during the summer and winter seasons, while during monsoons they are significantly low, said Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)./Dighe was speaking at a day-long workshop, on Monday, jointly organised by NGOs legal initiative for forest and environment (LIFE) and Parisar to highlight, as well as seek comments, on the National Clean Air Action Plan (NCAP) recently announced by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC). The plan is out for public comments until May 17, 2018. The workshop was attended by environmentalists, activists and experts./During the workshop, Dighe shared the current status of air pollution in Pune as per the environment status report 2017, which stated the number of registered vehicles in the city to be around 33 lakhs; exceeding the population of 31 lakhs. The report also highlighted that two-wheelers constitute 70 to 75 per cent of the total vehicles./He was of the opinion that public transport should be strengthened in order to control the number of vehicles on the road which will help reduce vehicular pollution./Sujit Patwardhan, founder member of Parisar, stressed on the need for questioning the path of development India is following. ""We are heading towards a car-oriented society, and hence, there is a constant demand for flyovers and wider roads. The maximum requests for cutting trees in Pune comes from the road department, and yet there is little support to improving the public transportation in the city.""/Patwardhan stressed on the need for doing away with a car-oriented approach and suggested implementing alternative modes of transport to curb the rising level of pollution and urban chaos in Pune./Dust, diesel are worst pollutants/Dust, diesel are among the top air pollutants, said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, green peace NGO. Dahiya, who spoke about the collective efforts of the NGO towards reducing air pollution in Pune, at Beijing, China, said, ""Dust, diesel, increasing registration of vehicular population and solid waste are some of the pollutants adding to severe air pollution.""/Dahiya, who was speaking at the workshop on the national clean air programme, began with a presentation on air pollution beyond Delhi - NCR and cited examples of Beijing that was working on reducing air pollution./Ritwick Dutta, managing trustee for the organisation, legal initiative for forest and environment, said that India ranks 177 out of 180 in the list of polluted countries, while 14 out of the 20 most polluted cities from across the world are from India, revealed the WHO global air pollution database. This is alarming and all of this is on a rise due to the weak rules of the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act (1981) of India, said Dutta./The Act was created to take appropriate steps for the preservation of the natural resources, which among the other things includes, the preservation of high quality air and ensures controlling the level of air pollution, although there is no provision of rigorous penalty system in place. The objectives of the Act were to evolve effective and proficient ambient air quality, have proper monitoring network across the country and have reliable database./They were also to include public outreach for implementation of policies on air pollution and to have a feasible management plan for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution./""While there is an Act, we find that there is lack of synchronisation between projects, approval or rejection without consideration of any key environmental issues; even cumulative impact assessment studies are missing and the projects approved by the state environment impact assessment authority do not list merits/ demerits of the projects with relation to environment./""If one looks at the state environment clearance board(ECB), they have granted 121 clearances and 82 per cent are in the building and construction sector above 20,000 square metres, where Pune is the highest followed by Mumbai,"" said Dutta./The health session was conducted by Manas Ray, former head, department of experimental haematology, Chittarajan National Cancer Institute, who stressed upon the carcinogenic elements that were found in air pollution. ""We conducted research even on incense sticks. One incense stick is equal to 10 cigarettes a day. Even non smokers complain of anaemia and allergies as a result of being exposed to air pollution,"" said Ray./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

204 fines imposed during cleanliness drive,"Gurugram, May 22 -- In a special 80-hour round-the-clock cleanliness campaign, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) fined/204 residents found burning garbage, dumping construction and demolition (C&D) waste in public areas and disposing sewage waste on open land or drains./The civic body created 40 teams in four zones and divided the work in eight-hour shifts for the campaign which began at/10am on May 17. A total of 36 fines were imposed for burning garbage, 73 for dumping C&D waste in public areas, and 78 for disposing of sewage in drains. A total of 17 fines were imposed on residents found wasting water, dumping construction material on roads and for illegal advertisements./The MCG said that it transported 500 tonnes of waste lying in its jurisdiction to Bandhwari during the campaign./""The main objective of the campaign was to remove the garbage from roads and punish those violating rules. Burning garbage adds to air pollution and the smoke and fumes emitted cause many respiratory problems. Similarly, disposing waste in public areas leads to land and water pollution,"" MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav said./Yadav added that the people who pick up garbage and clean sewers should get themselves registered with the civic body by May 31./He said sewage tankers that are registered with the MCG can dump sewage waste in Mcg-operated sewage treatment plants. Similarly, garbage trucks registered with the MCG will have to dump the garbage in the waste management site located at Basai-the sole location for legally dumping C&D waste in the city./MCG spokesperson SS Rohilla said that once registered, all vehicles will need to display their registration number and paint the MCG logo on the exterior of their vehicles. Those found not complying with the rules will have to pay a heavy fine and their vehicles will be seized, he added./An MCG survey showed that the city generates an estimated 700 tonnes of C&D waste per day, with an average 10% increase each year./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

"Heat wave fuels spike in gut, lung infections","Gurugram, May 26 -- The prevailing heat wave condition in the city has put residents at risk of respiratory problems./The Palam weather observatory in New Delhi has confirmed that Delhi-ncr experienced its first heat wave of the season on Wednesday./According to city-based doctors, the rise in the temperature, coupled with the heat wave, have led to a spurt in cases of people suffering from respiratory problems./Doctors said that the rise in the number of hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory tract infections, especially among residents who are 65 years of age or older, is a direct fallout of the rising day temperature and heat wave in the city./The city recorded a maximum temperature of 43.6dC on Friday and the minimum temperature was recorded at 24dC./The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a heat wave alert for the next three to four days./""Generally, adults and the elderly find it more difficult to adjust to rising temperatures than the younger lot. As one grows older, his body starts losing the ability to keep itself within a range of temperature which is considered healthy,"" Rajesh Kumar, senior consultant, internal medicine, at Paras hospital, said./""There has been a 10-20% rise in the number of cases of chest infections, especially among the elderly, due to prevailing the heat wave condition. The condition of patients suffering from asthma has worsened and they are taking longer to recover,"" Kumar said./Doctors said heat, humidity and sudden changes in weather can make it harder for residents to breathe and may trigger symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing in people suffering from asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Collectively, these lung conditions are known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the doctors said./During a heat wave, there's a greater risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare-ups and infectious gastroenteritis, the doctors said./Naveen Kumar, a senior physician at the Civil Hospital, said, ""The number of people with gastrointestinal problems have also risen due to the heat wave. We get at least 10 patients, complaining of stomach problems, every day. Most of them say that they drank lemonade sold on the streets. Eating outside should also be avoided during a heat wave.""/The increase in pollution from unchecked waste burning and vehicular emissions is also a reason for the rise in cases of respiratory problems, the doctors said./According to data released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city's air quality index was marked 'very unhealthy', at 306, on Friday./""There is a high concentration of suspended particulate matter such as fine dust, smoke and fly ash in the air currently. These, coupled with disconcerting levels of heat and humidity, have led to an increase in patients suffering from breathing problems. I have tended to around 10 to 15 patients in my OPD a day over the last few weeks,"" Manoj Goel, director and unit head, pulmonology, Fortis hospital, said./Himanshu Garg, a pulmonologist at Artemis hospital, said that while crop burning, which is usually attributed to be the prime reason for rising air pollution, is only a seasonal issue lasting for 30-45 days, rampant open burning of waste is a local trigger for a dip in air quality./""Because of the rising incidents of waste burning in the city, the level of particulate matter in the air remains on the higher side throughout the year,"" he said./According to data available with the CPCB, in 2017, the average PM 2.5 level was more than 60 ug/m3, which is considered safe, for 300 days./Ruchika Sethi, a resident of Nirvana Country, said, ""Every now and then, a huge black cloud of smoke rises from the pile of garbage in the nearby slum clusters. Burning of waste in the open is an old habit here and people simply don't understand or are aware of the risks involved.""/According to an official of the Municipal Corporation Gurugram, the corporation received 29 complaints of burning of waste in the open from across the city till April this year. Of these, 21 were received in January, six in February and two in March. The civic body received 92 such complaints last year./A spokesperson for MCG said as many as 36 fines were issued for burning garbage during a cleanliness drive on May 17./MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav said,""the concerns raised by the residents will be looked into and appropriate measures will be taken to resolve the issues.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

HOW HEALTHY ARE OUR HOMES?,"Mumbai, May 26 -- Most of us spend at least half of our lives inside our homes without realising there is a connection between our homes and our health. Our homes can make us feel safe, but they can also make us sick. We spend nearly 80% of our time indoors, whether it's at home or office. This World Interiors Day, we help you understand the hidden dangers within the four walls of your home./There are many dangers around our home, though we seldom know what they are. So, let's look at this list of common household items that truly put you and your health at risk./NoN-Stick cookware/As Indians, we love to cook, and the use of non-stick cookware has proliferated over the years, thanks to its easy availability and attractive price points, in addition to its ability to cook food with less oil. But are these utensils safe? If you use your non-stick pots and pans on a daily basis, they are likely to scratch and break at some point, releasing toxic gases in your home./air FreSheNerS/Over the past decade, the humble incense sticks have been replaced with air fresheners that promise odour removal without the smoke.However, scientific studies have shown that many common household air fresheners contain chemicals that may be potentially harmful. Toxins found in air fresheners can accumulate in the body over time. It's advisable to minimise the use of air fresheners./houSehold cleaNiNg SupplieS/The chemicals in cleaning supplies bleach and disinfect to make our dishes, bathtubs and countertops germ-free, but many also contribute to indoor air pollution - these are harmful if inhaled or touched. Fragrances added to many cleaners, most notably laundry detergents and fabric softeners, may cause acute effects such as respiratory irritation, headache, sneezing, and watery eyes in sensitive individuals or in allergy and asthma sufferers./carpetS, curtaiNS aNd MattreSSeS/Things that are not cleaned daily - carpets, curtains, and mattresses - absorb a lot of allergens, dust and bacteria. They also tend to attract dust that is difficult to get rid of even with vacuum cleaners. They are also potential sources of Formaldehyde which can lead to sore throat, itching and may also cause Leukemia. Also, your new carpet or cabinet could be subtly poisoning you with chemicals such as benzene, ethylene glycol, or formaldehyde./FlooriNg/Choosing non-toxic flooring for your home might sound like a simple task, but unfortunately, many of the flooring options available contain harmful chemicals. There have also been concerns with regards to formaldehyde poisoning by vinyl and laminate wood flooring./wallS/While floor cleaning is a daily routine in most homes, the walls always remain ignored barring a monthly mopping. However, this frequency might not be enough, as walls tend to assimilate germs and bacteria that over time put one's family health at risk. Some of the bacteria get activated depending upon weather conditions./Being mindful about the choice of materials we use in our homes can make a huge difference to the quality of our indoor health. The most ubiquitous items that we use every day can be the triggers for many health disorders; being aware of these will help us in making better choices for our homes./Cuddle up in Cotton/It is time to embrace cotton for your pillows and blankets instead of potentially hazardous materials like polyester and memory foam. Cotton is easily available in most markets, thanks to it being locally produced on a large scale in India./Go natural for your floors/Natural stones are one of the most heat-efficient materials that can be used for flooring - they act as a naturally cool surface during Indian summer, and also gain a lovely sheen with each passing year./Wood is Good/Using natural hard wood is not only a healthier alternative for home furniture but also something that retains finish better and extends durability of the furniture./Home-made floor Cleaners/A quick way to replace floor cleaners with harmful chemicals is to make one at home. Floor cleaners made with vinegar and hand soaps are a great replacement for these./CookinClay/Earthen cookware, the choice of older generations in the kitchen, is making a comeback in 2018. These are not only made from natural clay, but are also terrific when it comes to retaining the nutritional quality of one's food, and do not emit harmful chemicals upon continuous exposure to heat./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution of Punjab waters: Can't just go with the flow anymore,"India, May 26 -- Punjab's rivers are in a bad shape, with large stretches contaminated by toxic waste and sewage; and require a comprehensive clean-up plan without any further delay. On this, five leading stakeholders agreed at a roundtable organised by Hindustan Times on Friday./Kahan Singh Pannu, chairman of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB); Sachit Jain, chairman of CII (northern region); Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal, environmentalist; and IS Paul, chairman of Drish Shoes; and Birinderjit Singh, environment engineer who worked in the PPCB, participated in the 80-minute discussion moderated by Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak. They dissected the grave problem that has come under the spotlight after spill of tonnes of molasses from a sugar mill killed thousands of fish in the Beas./(To Pannu) As head of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), can you tell us how serious river water pollution is in Punjab?/Pannu: As Ravi's major part is not in Punjab, we mainly have three rivers - Beas, Sutlej and Ghaggar. Beas is by and large OK, except last week's incident. In Sutlej, we get B-grade water at Nangal. When it crosses Kiratpur Sahib, water becomes C-grade. When it cross Ludhiana, it becomes E-grade, and that's the last grade. So is the case with Ghaggar. We get D-grade water from Haryana, and by the time it crosses Patiala, particularly Khanauri, it becomes E-grade. So the water in our water bodies is polluted. As there is no grade below E-grade, all the rivers are in a bad shape. We have to accept that, and work out methods to clean them./(To Seechewal) There are two reasons for pollution, one is industrial pollution, second is untreated sewage or urban waste that flows into rivers. You did a lot of work on it and cleaned the Kali Bein. You have played a big role in projecting environment issues on to the centre stage. When you started your efforts, President APJ Abdul Kalam also visited you in 2006. Do you think there are any positive changes?/Seechewal: Abdul Kalam took river water pollution very seriously and raised the issue world over. Since 2008, we examined water in different rivers (water channels) - Kali Bein, Chitti Bein, Kala Sanghian drain and the Sutlej river. More than Kali Bein, the Chitti Bein and Sutlej are dangerously polluted. We raised a bundh on Kala Sanghain drain for not allowing polluted water to fall in it. Before the 2009 general elections, we took all candidates to the drain and I visited a cancer hospital in Rajasthan to know the causes. Through Budha Nullah and Kala Sanghian drain, toxic water of Ludhiana's electroplating industry and of leather industry in Jalandhar, which uses cyanide, is flowing for decades. Then, through Chitti Bein, it falls into Sutlej and further flows through the bird sanctuary. Then this water mixes with Beas, and the quality of Beas being good it is used for drinking in Malwa belt of Punjab and Rajasthan. Because, subsoil water of Malwa belt has sulphur content, and in Rajasthan the water is saline and not fit for drinking. We are sitting for discussion today because molasses from Kiri Afgana mill have flown into Beas, large number of fish got killed; but what about industry dumping chemicals into the rivers? Have you ever heard of fish getting killed in Sutlej? No, because here they are extinct! There was a time when fish died in the Sutlej, people noticed too; but after that the fish never survived in the river. Now people are getting killed due to cancer. Imagine, people are drinking water that flows from Kala Sanghian drain and Budha Nullah, same water is used in gurdwaras and places of pilgrimage! People in Rajasthan don't know what is mixed in the water that they drink; we are sending them industrial waste. With the death of fish, the focus is again in the river water. There was a time when A-grade water used to flow into Sutlej and Beas from Himachal Pradesh, now both rivers receive B-grade water. Earlier (polluted) water of Sutlej used to get diluted when Beas water mixed with it. What now when water from Beas is also polluted? As a member of PPCB, I used to take samples of polluted water, but I was not heard. We raised the issue at all levels, even before the previous CM. We are fed up with political leaders. We now pray before God so that better sense prevails on the government./(To Jain) I have data from PPCB that about 13,000 industrial units have dysfunctional effluent treatment plants, or do not have any. Why can these anti-pollution measures not be implemented? What are the practical difficulties from the industry's point of view?/Jain: There are three main sources of pollution - industry, municipal waste which is huge, and the third is excessive use of pesticides in the farms that reaches this water. It is a serious problem, and entire society is to be made aware. The problem happens when industry is attacked straightaway and then industry tries to put up a defensive mechanism. There are pollution norms here that are nowhere else in the world. At CII, we don't support any company violating the norms. Spill of molasses is a serious case of negligence and should be investigated./Can you please elaborate on norms which are not practical?/Jain: Like, 'zero liquid discharge' norm discussed here are nowhere in the world. You make these norms applicable, and large companies will close down and smaller companies, which are anyway not complying with the norms even today, will not comply. Better compliance needs to be enforced first. Move out industry from a location where installation of effluent treatment plants is not possible. Shift them to big industrial parks. For example, electroplating industry should be shifted to one place and an environment treatment plant should be installed./(To Paul) You belong to an industry (leather) seen as the villain of the piece. As Baba Seechewal also said, Kali Bein and Chitti Bein are polluted due to effluents from tanneries. What is your perspective?/Paul: Contribution of pollution by leather industry is very small - in Kali Bein, 50-55 MLD water comes from 14 kilometers, and the leather complex is at the end, contributing 3.5. The model of leather industry followed everywhere else is that there is one outlet for effluents, after treatment by the CTP. I want to make 3-4 points - polluting industry should itself be made responsible for treatment; if solutions are imported they will not work; make industry accountable as it's the biggest stakeholder. Make sure land allotted to industrial units has sufficient place to install treatment plants. Solid waste management is also a big problem to which we need to give attention./Seechewal: No doubt, 90% of pollutant in Kali Bein is municipal waste./Jain: Sewage if properly treated can be used for irrigation, hence less load on groundwater. Treated water can also be used in industry. We need to diversify away from paddy in Punjab so as to reduce water consumption. I think free power to agriculture sector though a political compulsion should also go, because it leads to misuse of power and groundwater./(To Birinderjit) What went wrong with CTPs and ETPs in Punjab?/Birinderjit: Major issue is: Why is sewage entering water bodies? All sewage grids were laid with water bodies as final outlets; instead, sewage should have been collected at one place and used for irrigation. We should cut off all sewage systems from water bodies. Industry says sewage is also coming into drains. But sewage doesn't contain toxic material, we can easily treat it. No natural compound will treat chromium and nickel from electroplating and dying units! I had refused the NOC to Tajpur Road on the banks of Buddha Nullah, but now it's an industrial zone./What is the present position of CTPs in Punjab?/Birinderjit: The local bodies department is to be blamed. They don't have the expertise to operate these plants. Three plants were installed in Ludhiana by the water supply and sewage board and handed over to the local bodies department./So untreated water is still flowing beyond the treatment plants?/Birinderjit: Yes, not all but some part of it. We have spent huge money on plants; they should work./(To Pannu) PPCB has an important role of enforcement. It is generally believed that it is reeking of corruption which is coming in way of strict compliance of water and air pollution norms. What are your views?/Pannu: No, it is not that the PPCB is a big institution. We are a team of 100 engineers, with lakhs of industries. In the past four years, for four months the engineers are busy in checking stubble burning. Of 166 cities in Punjab, only 66 have effluent treatment plants; 100 engineers can't solve the entire problem. We have told the CM that we need sewage treatment plants in all our cities and towns. Don't talk of environment alone; talk of education, policing and governance - we need to spread awareness and should not shift the onus onto others./What about norms that are unrealistic?/Jain: There are times when suggestions that are not realistic are given. PPCB officials are scientific people. They know what is possible and what is not. If someone who may not understand the issue but gives them directions anyway, they are forced to carry out orders. The idea of zero liquid discharge, for example, was considered in the US in the 1970s in the Congress, and they realised it was not practical. The consciousness of every citizen has to be raised. Just imagine Swachh Bharat; the impact it has started having on people. There is new awareness. If leaders through their communication start creating awareness, things will change. Where people are digressing, action has to be there. As an industry body, we will support it fully. If you want to close companies which are blatantly violating rules the norms, we don't support such companies./Buddha Nullah in Ludhiana is a test case of water pollution. Crores have been spent on the plans of cleaning, but nothing has changed./Pannu: I don't think crores have been spent. The kind of investment it needs was not made. If money had been spent, things would have been better. Ludhiana has a population of 30 lakh. As per norms, water discharge should be 400 MLD. We have STPs to treat 450 MLD, but total water discharge is 750 MLD. Both power and water are free, so people just use water as per their free will. We need to stop that. When we go to the World Bank or other agencies for funds for STPs, they say you have adequate capacity. We need to check water consumption as per norms. It is the same situation is Jalandhar and other cities./Paul: The political class also has to show conscientiousness. Wherever an STP is to be set up, they start opposing. There have been such instances in Amritsar, Jalandhar and other places./People say STPs lead to a stink in the area./Birinderjit: The state has been divided into 7 ones. A pilot city has been decided which also takes care of waste of adjoining cities. Biodegradable waste putrefies and produces a fetid smell if it lies there for two or more days. In some seasons, it putrefies faster. It depends on how efficiently the system is run./Pannu: We look for solutions abroad and try to get technologies that are expensive. There is talk of use of waste to generate electricity at, let's say, Rs 8 per unit. When you can get electricity at Rs 2 to 2.50 per unit, why go for power that costs Rs 8 a unit. Punjab has 166 municipal committees that generate huge amount of solid waste daily, posing a huge problem. We need local solutions to solve our problems. If we look for solutions from abroad that cost a lot, these problems cannot be solved. For instance, we are focusing on water conservation in industry and doing water audit. Five paper industries in Punjab are using 100 KLD water. When they told me that they reduced it to 50 KLD, I asked them to try and bring it to 30 or so. We are working on it. Similarly, Punjab has 3,100 brick kilns with a huge amount of smoke billowing out of them. They have been told to use new zigzag high-draft technology from next season. It will cost them about Rs 30 lakh per kiln, but will ensure substantial reduction in pollution. In leather industry complex also, we got a pre-settler tank and solved 50% of the problem. If we can import technology that suits us, it is okay. But it is our problem, and we have to find the solution./(To Seechewal) You have been running a campaign for clean environment for a long time. Do you notice any change in awareness or a proactive approach among people and governments? Also, why have we not been able to produce another Seechewal?/Seechewal: When we started, bureaucrats and politician had their own different views. Politicians saw no harm in waste water from homes flowing into rivers. We said that we want to stop polluted water from polluting our rivers. Now, Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) speaks on the subject and addresses the nation. How the issue of dead fish in Beas became international headlines reflects more awareness among the people. As for another Seechewal, we all have to start from our homes, streets and towns. We need to work together for a better environment. Everyone should take responsibility and take the lead. Sewa Singh ji is working it. SGPC is distributing saplings. In 100 villages, NRIs spent their money to lay sewerage. Wherever STPs have been set up, they should be run efficiently. Crores spent on them from taxpayers' money are being wasted. Municipal committees, PPCB and other departments have to have accountability./What is an overall solution for ensuring that our water bodies are not polluted?/Jain: It's difficult to give an overall solution. Awareness is important, and this has to start from our leaders, because they are the ones whose voices are heard the most. Also, each person has to start from within. We need to focus on water conservation in our homes, industry and farms. Each company has to see to it that it has pollution control equipment and is operating them. It has to be understood as a crime if you are not treating your water. We have to have public ostracisation of people who are not treating their water. Just like black money has now become a bad word. Earlier, everybody said, Why should I pay tax?', and it was considered a norm. That has become (a reason for) ostracisation today. Not treating your water and air has to be seen as bad./Pannu: As a society, it seems we are on the verge of extinction. What we are doing with water is unpardonable. There are vested interests that say, 'Allow me, but stop others!' We tried to get strict with the dyeing industry in Ludhiana. They downed their shutters and went to politicians to complain. When we stop farmers, they lock up our teams. The Captain government is serious and wants to take efforts to check water pollution to the next level. A committee has been set up under environment minister OP Soni plan for the cleaning of rivers. The Beas disaster was due to reaction in a tank storing molasses. PPCB has no control on that. Our role is with regard to effluents. But the department dealing with this (molasses) is not willing to take its responsibility. We cannot shirk our responsibility and have taken strictest action. Such action has not be taken anywhere in the country. Government has also said that enough is enough./Paul: Role of the press is also important in creating consciousness. Also, cropping pattern needs to change. Underground water is available at 22 metres, but we are still insistent on paddy and sugarcane, ignoring the associated problems./What about political interference?/Birinderjit: When you are in the state services and an appointee of the government, it will have control over you. Like IAS and IPS, an environment service was also thought of, but was not allowed to be successful. Politicians intervene, but they often do not know the gravity of the issue./(To Pannu) You said awareness has increased, but the quality of river water has not seen any change./Pannu: Awareness has improved, but investment has not. This can be achieved with investment. We have been only talking about crores and not spending. Piecemeal efforts are not going to work. We need a comprehensive plan. In his meeting, the chief minister asked the departments not to make individual efforts but collaborate for a solution in a timebound manner. The chief secretary has been told to arrange funds. However, Buddha Nullah is the biggest challenge for bureaucrats of our generation. For 35 years, governments have been talking about cleaning it without any success, because what is required has not been done./(To Seechewal) You are in touch with NRIs. Are they willing to help as the government does not have funds?/Seechewal: How can NRIs take care of the problem of solid waste in areas of municipal bodies? MCs are a huge problem. They take taxes, but don't do enough. Polluted water comes from industry, but PPCB gets blamed. Why not prosecute them (offenders)? Those responsible should be made accountable./(To Pannu) What deterring action is being taken?/Pannu: There is provision for criminal prosecution under the law, and hundreds of prosecutions have been launched. But there is a problem. I have 100 engineers, and prosecution means they have to go for hearings in courts. Cases have been pending for 10 years without any decision, and hearing dates are given. There are 250 cases. I am not sure if anyone has been prosecuted so far. Conviction rate is negligible. It is time-consuming. We shut down factories and forfeit security./Birinderjit: The spill in Beas has posed a serious problem. Beas water has reached Harike wetland which also gets water from Buddha Nullah that has nitrogen and phosphorous. These two constituents will lead to algae bloom, and interfere with the drinking water system.

Mumbai's air is weakening your heart,"Mumbai, May 28 -- Agreeing to the findings of a phone application, Shoot! I Smoke, that breathing Mumbai's air is equivalent to smoking four cigarettes a day, doctors from Mumbai said exposure to such high pollution levels over the next 25 years can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)./The international app, which was launched in Paris last month based on a study by the University of California, Berkeley, calculates real-time equivalence between air pollution and cigarette smoking./""Our studies in areas close to the sea such as Juhu showed that the lung function of non-smokers was poor. The situation worsened as we moved into the city,"" said Dr Sanjeev Metha, pulmonologist and senior specialist, Lilavati Hospital in Bandra. ""In one of our studies, we found that the lungs of people in the age group of people of 22 to 30 were performing 30% less than expected. They were non-smokers and not exposed biomass burning, so the main reason for the poor performance was particulate pollution.""/""With increase in vehicles and biomass emissions in major urban cities, air pollution will lead to diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. The comparison with the number of cigarettes smoked is accurate because the situation is getting worse by the day,"" said Dr Nilkanth Awad, head of department, pulmonary medicine, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, Sion. ""The earlier generation was prone to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) owing to exposure to biomass burning. The current generation is under threat from exposure to particulate matter. Those inhaling this air for more than 25 years will easily develop COPD over time,"" said Dr Mitali Agrawal, chest physician and MD, pulmonary medicine, SRV Hospital, Goregaon. ""We have been researching it and are planning a lung function test to establish this comparison.""/Environmentalists expect the readings to be worse during winter. ""This confirms that Mumbai is becoming not livable as far as the air quality is concerned and people are unaware of it. We are not seeing this as a serious problem and shrugging it away by popping pills. This app will help people realise that we are in serious trouble,"" said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti./Air quality experts, however, said there can't be any comparison between cigarette smoking and air quality. ""Such apps and studies only create panic. There is a difference between something being inhaled from the environment and something that is carcinogenic. It should not be compared. The impact of the environment may vary depending on the constituents of the particulate matter, but cigarette smoking is altogether harmful. Factors such as age, biochemistry, exposure, location, food habits need to be considered before comparing it,"" said D Saha, former additional director, Central Pollution Control Board./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Planning to take a smoke break? Just breathe in Pune's air which equals 9.1 cigarettes a day,"Mumbai, May 28 -- Breathing Pune's air is as bad as smoking nine cigarettes a day, estimates a new smartphone app that calculates real-time equivalence between air pollution and cigarette smoking. In Delhi, it's 7.7 cigarettes while in Mumbai it's four./Other big Indian cities aren't far behind, with the effect ranging between two and eight cigarettes a day./A new smart phone application, 'Shoot! I Smoke', launched in Paris last month, attempts to put in perspective just how dangerous the levels of air pollution across the world is./On Sunday, May 27, 2018, the reading on the app for Pune had the air quality on Bund Garden road as being as polluted as smoking 9.1 cigarettes./The overall reading for Pune on Sunday was also 9.1 cigarettes. ""There two factors responsible for the increasing pollution in the city, one is the increase in construction sites and the other is vehicular traffic.The pollution affects the health of human beings and physical disorders like respiratory infection, sore throat, nasal infections, asthma and allergic symptoms would increase,""said Dr Sneha Limaye, scientist at the Chest Research Foundation Pune./The app uses location-specific data for the PM2.5 pollutant to calculate the quality of air in relation to cigarette smoke. PM2.5 is floating particulate matter that include both organic and inorganic pollutants./Their diameter is less than 2.5 microns, which means they can enter the respiratory system easily. It uses a study by Berkeley Earth, a California-based climate science analysis to make the calculation. It's available free on both Android and iOS platforms./""PM2.5 particles are small enough to work their way deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream, where they can trigger heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and asthma,"" reads the study, co-authored by Richard Mueller, a physics professor at University of California, Berkeley. ""Here is the rule of thumb: one cigarette a day is the rough equivalent of a PM2.5 level of 22?g/m3. Of course, unlike cigarette smoking, the pollution reaches every age group,"" he added. The study, based on several others across China, found that Beijing had, on an average, a PM2.5 level of 85?g/m3 - equivalent to smoking four cigarettes./""The air pollution in New Delhi, in winter 2017, was 547?g/m3 (for PM2.5) - the same as about 25 cigarettes a day,"" Mueller said./Officials from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), however, said it was incorrect to compare cigarette smoking and the effects of air pollution. ""Such studies, including a recent one by the World Health Organisation (WHO), are incorrect as they do not have a standard method of collecting data from any of the regulatory agencies, and conclude on whatever data is available, and come out with their own conclusions,"" said A Sudhakar, member secretary, CPCB./""Neither is this data updated nor validated,"" he said, and added that the Union environment ministry had already issued a clarification to WHO. ""It will be simultaneously issued to all other international agencies, that from now on, data sourcing should be done only from CPCB.""/The app's developers used real-time air pollution data from the World Air Quality Index project (aqicn.org) as their main data source. The app geo-locates one's phone through the global positioning system (GPS), and connects it to the database, which shows the number of cigarettes smoked that day./The distance to the air quality station measuring data in Pune is cited on the app for Bund Garden road as 1km. The app developers said people were only vaguely aware of the extent of air pollution in mega cities. ""Air-quality monitoring stations only provide numbers that are very specific to professionals who work on environmental issues. So, when you make this conversion to cigarettes, it makes it easier for people to understand what they are dealing with, and the consequences air quality has in their daily lives,"" said Paris-born app developer Amaury Martiny, who developed the app with designer Marcelo Coelho from Brazil. He added that when users open the app, they will learn how detrimental their local air is to their health, in a quantitative way./""The air pollution in New Delhi, in winter 2017, was 547?g/m3 (for PM2.5) - the same as about 25 cigarettes a day,"" Mueller said./Officials from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), however, said it was incorrect to compare cigarette smoking and the effects of air pollution.
