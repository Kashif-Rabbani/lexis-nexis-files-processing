Buses without PUCs will not be allowed in Delhi's bus terminals,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 18 -- The Delhi government has decided to crackdown on 'visibly polluting buses' and those without pollution under control (PUC) certificates./Authorities have decided to bar buses that create visibly create pollution or those without PUC certificates from entering Delhi's inter-satte bus terminals from October 1./The Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (DTIDC) Limited said the crackdown had been necessitated to control air pollution which sees a spike during winters./""Any bus not having a PUC certificate will not be allowed to take passengers from the ISBTs and will be challaned. Buses that have pollution under control certificates, but are visibly polluting will also be treated the same way,"" said KK Dahiya, managing director of DTIDC./Out of over 5,400 buses that daily ply from Delhi's three ISBTs in Anand Vihar, Kashmere Gate and Sarai Kale Khan, nearly 3,400 are buses that come from outside the city./Officials say local buses are mostly CNG-run, but it is the diesel run buses coming from neighbouring states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana that are most polluting./The Delhi government is also going to write to these states urging them to conduct a drive in two week's time to check PUCs of buses entering Delhi and also phase out old ones as they emitted more smoke./While the move already should have been a usual practice seeing Delhi's failing air quality, Dahiya explained enforcement was going to be a problem due to the staff crunch. Till now, the task of checking PUCs was being done only by traffic police and enforcement teams of the transport department, which was not enough, Dahiya said./""Therefore, additional teams of DTIDC officials will be deployed specifically at ISBTs. The PUCs and the health of the buses would be checked at the entrance of the terminal at the time of collection of the parking fee,"" he said./Out of the three ISBTs, the one at Anand Vihar, which is on the Uttar Pradesh side of Delhi's border, is the most crowded terminal witnessing a daily footfall of 1.25 lakh passengers./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Nothing religious about poisoning air and water,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 24 -- It's that time of the year. Time to look forward to misty mornings, early evenings, festivities, food, celebrations, holidays. And by the end of it, a littered cityscape, a dirtier river, and stubborn air pollution that will refuse to subside till the end of winter./Yes, it is that time of the year when along with ads on festival discounts, newspapers are awash with public advisories on the ills of chemical-laced idol immersions and bursting of crackers. Every year, this pitch falls on deaf ears./Hundreds of half-melted chunks of Ganesha idols are still floating around in the Yamuna. Since last month, their noxious chemicals have made the polluted waters more poisonous. This week, the Durga Puja will culminate in hundreds of immersions into the Yamuna./The air will not be spared either. Last Diwali, fireworks fouled up Delhi's air so much that it broke three years' pollution record. The thick smog was compared to the world's worst, leaving people gasping for breath for days on end./For a culture that reveres its rivers, mountains, trees, animals and the earth, how did Indian festivals become so reckless?/There is no tradition of using chemicals and heavy metals in idol making. On the contrary, customs specify clay and straw as the main ingredient, and that too for a reason./Clay gives form to the formless and dissolves with immersion, merging with the elements and thus, completing the circle of life./But now with idol-making reaching an industrial scale, statues are modelled out of plaster of paris, which takes years to fully dissolve in water. Instead of natural vegetable dyes, they are now coloured in paints containing heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium and lead, which poison the water for good./Last year's idol immersions shot up Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), which indicates the level of organic pollution, to 38 mg/l at some ghats on the Yamuna. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee says that for any aquatic life to survive, the BOD must not exceed 3 mg/l./Yet, Delhi is again set to conclude the celebrations in the Yamuna. A proposal to conduct visarjan of all the idols at Chittaranjan Park in a temporary pond in the neighbourhood was shot down because of lack of space and will./Many play down these risks by justifying a festival as a one-off phenomenon. But they add up. Anyway, can one of the world's most polluted capitals afford such indulgence?/No religious excuse can justify environmentally disastrous rituals like clogging and polluting water bodies with idols or turning the air foul with sulphur and gunpowder smoke./Even the Delhi high court made it clear. ""Diwali, though called a festival of lights, has religious context only in illuminating the buildings traditionally with diyas. There is nothing to suggest that bursting of firecrackers is related to any religious tenet,"" the court noted two years ago./But why do we need so much coaxing to stop doing something we know is bad for us? The Yamuna's toxic water is not just an assault on the olfactory system, it also poisons the groundwater and any fruit and vegetable that grows on its floodplain./The lethal fumes from Delhi's massive fleet of vehicles, emissions from coal-fired power plants, and dust from numerous construction sites are already filling up our lungs. We have to be suicidal to add smoke from Diwali crackers to this list./In 2010, the Central Pollution Control Board issued guidelines on idol immersion, a complete user's manual to make the process eco-friendly. Two years ago, the National Green Tribunal banned dunking of non-biodegradable idols into water bodies. But these instructions are hardly followed./Authorities must help by building dedicated idol immersion tanks but that won't make the festivals less toxic. As long as there is demand for cheaper, chemically coated statues, the market will thrive./The same is true for the sale of crackers. Last November, the Supreme Court had suspended all licences to sell fireworks within the National Capital Region./Two weeks ago, it permitted resumption of sale, on certain conditions and by reducing the number of licenses. But as enforcement records of such bans show, there is no point in issuing orders that cannot be implemented./Unless, of course, citizens themselves commit to greener and cleaner festivals./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Machine that turns 'waste into wealth',"Patiala, Sept. 25 -- To reduce air pollution in Mandi Gobindgarh, also known as the steel town of Punjab, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has set up a zinc recovery plant in collaboration with a private firm. The plant will recover waste (metal particles) from the smoke (having metal dust) emitted by iron furnace units and recycle it./This will also help check pollution, said PPCB chairman, who inaugurated the plant set up at a cost of 2.5 crore by Madhav Alloys Pvt Ltd. Pannu said the plant was a result of consistent efforts of the board to persuade industrial units across the state to adopt waste minimisation techniques by way of recovery of useful products from hazardous waste./Induction furnace units in Mandi Gobindgarh and Ludhiana produce hazardous dust as air emission, which is collected in air pollution control device (APCD). ""Every furnace unit has to pay 5,000 per tonne to dispose of this waste in underground cemented blocks at a plant in Zirakpur,"" said DS Mangat, adviser of the project./The plant, set up near Gobindgarh, has a capacity to handle 10 tonnes of waste dust released by induction furnaces per day from which four tonnes of zinc will be retrieved. The process involves calcinations, precipitation of iron, lead and copper in the form of sludge and electrolysis. Industrialist can reuse the recovered metal or sell it./""It's a first of its kind unit in India. We have applied for patent. It will turn waste into wealth by reusing hazardous waste,"" said Sudhir Madhav, owner of company. He claimed that the unit will reduce hazardous waste by 70%./There are 102 induction furnaces in Mandi Gobindgarh of which 60 are operational. The town also has 245 operational rolling mills. Of the 1 tonne (1,000kg) iron produced, 5kg is hazardous industrial waste./The plant runs on a technology for utilisation of flue gas cleaning residue generated from steel scrap melting induction furnace for zinc extraction. The company has planned to install such plants in other industrial towns of the state. The Central Pollution Control Board has also and asked other state boards to set up such units to check pollution./Pannu said the board was making efforts to develop a technology to recover zinc from effluents of electroplating industries. He said that board is in advanced stage of setting up units for recovering ferrous and ferric chloride from hydrochloric acid based effluent of pickling units manufacturing engineering goods based in Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Mohali.

"Hadapsar, Navi peth, Mandai have the worst air quality in Pune","India, Sept. 26 -- In an alarming revelation, the Pune Municipal Corporation's environment status report (ESR) 2016-17 claimed that Hadapsar has been recorded as one of the most polluted regions in the city followed by Navi peth./PMC's environment status report 2016-17 shows that air pollutants like Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Nitrogen Oxide (NO) and particulate matter were seen to have crossed the standard permissible limit set by the Central Pollution Control Board./As per the data released by Pune Municipal Corporation, the areas where Nitrogen Oxide was found to have been above the average level includes Hadapsar, Navi peth and Mandai. The standard permissible limit for Nitrogen Oxide is said to be 40ug/m^3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air) while in Hadapsar area it is found to be 60ug/m^3./Apart from this, Nitrogen Dioxide, too, is found to be above the standard permissible level in areas including Pashan, Lohegaon, Shivajinagar, Katraj and Hadapsar. This increase in Nitrogen Dioxide was recorded especially during the month of November./According to the report, the other important factor which is above the standard average level is the dust particulate matter present in the air./The report states that dust particles of up to 10 microns and 2.5 microns are found to be more in the air. The report added that even as their levels were found to be decreasing since 2011, they are still above the standard permissible level laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board./The presence of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the air was found to be below the standard value of 2ug/m^3 in the city. Yet in January and February this year its presence was more compared to last year. However, Carbon Monoxide was found mainly in areas like Shivajinagar, Hadapsar and Katraj./Similar to Carbon Monoxide, the proportion of Sulphur oxides in the air is also said to be rising. Although, it is still found to be below the standard level laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board, the increasing number of vehicles is inturn increasing the levels of Sulphur-based pollutants in the air./According to Dr Mahendra Kawedia of Jehangir hospital, the rise in air pollutants is affecting the health of citizens in various ways. He said, ""Over the years, cases of bronchitis and asthama have been on the rise. With rising air pollution, people who are more susceptible to it start suffering from lung problems and sometimes these diseases become chronic.""/Dr Sanjay Gaikwad from Sassoon General Hospital, too, said that rising air pollution level is a serious concern as the percentage of airborne diseases is significantly growing in the city, thus putting the lives of the residents at risk./Rising number of wheels worsen city health/With over 40 lakh vehicles registered in Pune, the city is also witnessing rise in factors contributing to its increasing air pollution levels./The Pune Municipal Corporation's (PMC) environment status report for 2016-17 clearly shows that air pollutants, including Nitrogen Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and particulate matter in the air are constantly increasing./Many of these pollutants, including particulate matter, Nitrogen Oxide and Nitrogen Dioxide, are found to be above the standard set by the Central Pollution Control Board. Other pollutants, including Sulphur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide, are below the standard permissible levels, but are still rising./According to the statistics available with the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Pune, close to two lakh new vehicles are seen on city roads every year. The total number of vehicles registered in Pune till July this year is 43,30,635. Out of these 25,07,428 are two-wheelers while 6,07,886 are four-wheelers./Speaking about this rising air pollution in the city, PMC's environment officer Mangesh Dighe told Hindustan Times that this rise in air pollutants is mainly because of the rise in the number of vehicles in the city./""Pollutants like Nitrogen Oxide, Carbon Monoxide and Sulphur are a result of the smoke emitted from the vehicle's exhaust. With rising number of vehicles on the roads, these pollutants are also rising,"" added Dighe./He further stated that even as various industries also contribute to rise in air pollutants, those kind of industries are not there in the vicinity of Pune in large numbers./""Pune mainly has assembling industries or service industries which do not release pollutants like Sulphur, Nitrogen Oxide or Carbon Monoxide. Hence, the only major factors for rising air pollution are the vehicles, "" he added./He further stated that with this rise in number of vehicles, the dust also does not settle and keeps floating in the air, thus increasing levels of particulate matter in the air./Dighe stated that the Bharat Stage IV vehicles are seen to cause less pollution compared to the older vehicles which are still seen in large numbers on the roads./""If vehicles use alternate fuels like CNG or LPG, then this rise in air pollution can be controlled as these are clean fuels. Hence, the use of CNG and LPG needs to be popularised in the city,"" he added./Environmentalist Vinod Bodhankar stated that apart from the air pollution caused due to vehicles, a significant component in the particulate matter present in the air comes from burning of plastic. He stressed on the need to reduce plastic consumption as only seven per cent to nine per cent of the plastic is genuinely recycled./The number of vehicles in the city has seen a constant rise with growing population. The population of Pune, whihc was 35 lakh in 211 has increased to 45 lakh in 2017. The absence of a proper public transport system in Pune has propelled the number of private vehicles, particularly two-wheelers./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

School curriculum to include climate change,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 27 -- Climate change and its impact on human health will soon be made part of the school curriculum, so children can learn how to protect themselves from climate sensitive illnesses such as heat stroke and respiratory diseases./The proposal is a part of the ministry of health and family welfare's National Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health (NAPCCHH) that is aimed at protecting women, children and marginalized sections of the society./""We are planning to include climate sensitive illnesses and related mitigation and adaption measures in students' curriculum. We are working in tandem with the ministry of human resource development (HRD) to integrate climate change with nutritional status and health into school and college curricula,"" said Jagdish Prasad, director general of health services (DGHS), ministry of health and family welfare./The health ministry, working with the HRD ministry, plans to integrate the health effects of extreme heat events in students' curriculum./Teachers will be trained in first aid measures for heat waves. Schools and colleges would be advised to prevent outdoor activities during heat waves, according to the proposal./Apart from heat waves, air pollution-related diseases would also be a focus in lessons./""We have also proposed the inclusion of harmful health effects of environmental pollution in the school curriculum, including current policies and mitigation practices that are designed to reduce air pollution,"" said Prasad./""Communication interventions in schools are effective approaches to disseminate important information. We are in the process of developing materials for teachers' training so that they can educate children,"" he said./The health ministry has said children should be regularly screened for climate sensitive illnesses and provided a pollutionfree environment in schools and colleges./""We have proposed regular screening of school children for early detection of diseases, which can be attributed to the existing air pollution. We have also urged the HRD ministry to improve indoor air quality of educational institutions nationwide,"" said Prasad./""Walkability and access to educational institutions by nonmotorized transport should also be improved, thus minimizing the air pollution in the school surroundings. We have proposed that students and teachers should be sensitized to use the Air Quality Index (AQI) in planning outdoor school activities,"" he said./Research studies across the world have shown that climate change may have negative health effects. A rise in heat-related illnesses and deaths, increased precipitation, floods and droughts are costing lives./With climate change, there is an increase in transmission and spread of infectious diseases due to changes in the distribution of water-borne, food-borne and vector-borne diseases, experts say./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Reap the benefits of barley,"India, Sept. 30 -- Among the treasure trove of herbs and spices that ancient humans used to treat their illnesses, barley grass reigned supreme./Much like the wheat plant, barley is a kind of grass. We call its grains jau. Barley grass shoots are a storehouse of Vitamins B, B2, B6, and C, folic acid, pantothenic acid, calcium and iron. In fact, the calcium content in barley grass is far more than in milk, and its Vitamin C content is far more than oranges. This makes barley grass an excellent addition to the diet of menopausal women and sports people./Barley's nutrients help in healing several problems caused by air pollution, water pollution, pesticides in food, fast foods and stress. Combined, these issues lead to the rise of dangerous free radicals in the body, which might cause diabetes, ageing, high cholesterol and heart disease./Here are the many benefits of barley grass:/Skin and hair: The minerals and enzymes in barley grass help heal skin and hair, and make them stronger./Patients with liver issues: Barley grass powder or juice is an excellent source of 18 amino acids. This is useful for people who have liver problems and hence cannot digest animal protein. Being easy to absorb, it's also a good source of protein for vegetarians./Patients with ulcers and digestive disorders: Many digestive disorders like stomach ulcers and Crohn's disease, which are caused due to stress, improve when barley grass juice is added to the diet of the patients./Patients with tumours: A combination of wheat grass and barley grass is recommended due to its powerful antioxidant and cell repairing properties. Tumours thrive in an acidic milieu, but slow down when the body becomes alkaline. The same property of barley grass and wheat grass slows down the ageing process./Diabetes patients: Barley grass juice mixed with a vegetable juice can be an excellent tonic for diabetics./Heart patients: Barley grass reduces cholesterol. This works best when combined with a plant-based diet that is free of trans-fats./From HT Brunch, October 1, 2017/Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch/Connect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

TOP TEN REASONS FOR DEATH IN INDIA,"Mumbai, Oct. 1 -- Do you worry about your airplane crashing each time you take a flight? Don't be. There is one in a 1,000,000 chance of a traveller being harmed in an aircraft. Your risk of being harmed during medical treatment is one in 300./Most of us have misplaced fears about what is most likely to kill us, but those who fear heart disease have got it right, shows data for India from The Global Burden of Disease, which is an observational epidemiological study of risk to health and life from diseases, injuries and risk factors, such as bad diets, tobacco use and high blood pressure. Unhealthy diets alone are a risk factor in one in five global deaths, raising the risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, among others./HEART DISEASE/Heart disease has remained the leading cause of death In India for more than two decades fuelled by unhealthy diets, leading to high blood pressure and the build up of blood fats (plaque) inside the walls of the arteries; inactivity, obesity and smoking./CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including pulmonary hypertension, occupational lung disease, and interstitial lung disease, cause irreversible damage to the airways and other lung structures to lower breathing capacity. Lung diseases are not curable, but can be managed using treatments that dilate major air passages and improve shortness of breath. Smoking, air pollution, occupational chemicals and dust can aggravate lung conditions./DIARRHOEA/Diarrhoeal diseases are one of the biggest causes of under-5 deaths, killing between 800,000 and one million kids, hospitalising 900,000 and causing 327,000 visits to clinics each year. Adding Rotavirus vaccine to India's universal vaccination programme in 2016 to protect children against the leading cause of severe diarrhoea in young children, helped lower numbers rapidly./STROKE/Stroke, which was ranked as the sixth biggest cause of death in 2005, rose to become the fourth biggest killer in India. The risk factors for stroke, which is also known as cerebrovascular disease, are the same as heart disease, but the disability caused by a brain attack is often higher as it may cause partial or full paralysis./LOWER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS/With improved diagnosis and infection management, lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia, lung abscess and acute bronchitis have slipped one position down to become the fifth biggest cause of death. It's among the most common infection in older adults and people with lowered immunity. Symptoms including shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and fatigue that persist for more than a week must be investigated./TUBERCULOSIS/India accounts for 2.8 million of the 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases globally, according to the World Health Organization's Global TB Report 2016. India's national programme provides free medicines and treatment to all but many patients do not complete the full course, which lasts six to eight months. This leads to drug resistant infection, which takes longer to treat using more toxic and expensive medicines./NEONATAL PRETERM BIRTH/With 80.8% of India's 226 lakh annual births taking place in hospitals, health centres and clinics, deaths from premature birth-related complications such as low birthweight have dropped since 2005, when it was the fourth cause of death./SELF HARM/Ranked the 10th cause of death in 2005, self harm or suicide is now India's eighth biggest killer. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau has recorded a corresponding increase of 17.3% - 1,33,623 in 2015, up from 1,13,914 in 2005 - in suicides over the past two decades./ROAD INJURIES/Death from traffic accidents rose three points over two decades. Road accidents rose by 3.1% in one year - from 4,50,898 in 2014 to 4,64,674 in 2015 - with deaths going up by 5.1%, from 1,41,526 to 1,48,707 during the same period, shows NCRB data. States that show the sharpest increase are Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh./OTHER NEONATAL CONDITIONS/Breastfeeding, vaccination against common infection and neonatal care is helping more babies thrive and survive neonatal infections such as septicaemia, birth asphyxia and birth trauma./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

City air pollution level rises four-fold after Dussehra,"Gurgaon, Oct. 2 -- Even as Gurgaon ended Durga Puja on an eco-friendly note, the city's air pollution on Sunday was over four times higher than the permissible limit after citizens burnt effigies of Ravana on Dussehra./The PM2.5 level was 274g/m against the permissible limit of 60 g/m-over four times higher. The enthusiastic bursting of crackers has left little for citizens to cheer for as the city was covered by a cloud of smoke on Sunday./At least 25 effigies of Ravanas-with the tallest rising to a height of 75 feet at the Laser Valley Ground-were burnt across the city. If we account for Meghnad and Kumbhkarna, the total number of effigies burnt in Gurgaon with permission was at least 75, said a police officer. Many neighbourhoods build and burn effigies on Dussehra without police permission as well./Even as the city prepares for the winter smog, which mostly settles post Diwali and the stubble-burning season in neighbouring states, all is not lost for Gurgaon./Many Gurgaon residents also burnt a tech version of the Ravana with a pollution-free laser show./Residents of Vatika India Next, sector 82, organized a pollution-free Dussehra at club lawns. A virtual image of Ravana was created and the good won over evil in a colourful display of laser lights and sound./The denizens' love for their land could also be seen in the green initiatives taken for an environmentally-responsible immersion of the Durga idol./The Bengali community in the city bid farewell to Goddess Durga on the 10th day of Durga Puja on Saturday./With a heavy heart and tears, the residents performed the rituals. Saturday started with residents performing 'Devi Boran' and 'Sindur Khela' and several puja associations opted for the eco-friendly method of immersion of Goddess Durga's idols./This year, five puja associations, including the DLF City Durga Puja, the Bangiya Parishad of sector 56, Sushant Lok Durga Puja Committee, Aravalli Sanskritik Parishad, Suncity and Valley View Puja Committee took the initiative to perform an eco-friendly immersion./""We have seen the condition of river Yamuna. We want our environment to remain safe. So, for the first time we agreed to immerse the idols in a large water-filled mud pit that we dug up and the idol was put in it. After the idol was immersed, we covered the pit with soil,"" said Avijit Basu of Sushant Lok Durga Puja Committee./Another member, Partho Dey, secretary of Bangiya Parishad, sector 56, said, ""Before immersing the idol we also remove the non biodegradable materials. We started this initiative last year. We are happy that more people have joined in this year.""/Debasis Das of Valley View puja committee, said, ""We used to go to river Yamuna in Delhi for immersion. However, because of pollution in river, which also affects the environment as a whole, we decided to opt for more eco-friendly ways.""/Similarly, DLF5 residents celebrated the immersion day with much enthusiasm at the sports complex in Club5./Aside from the eco-friendly theme, several cultural hubs and societies also showcased traditional theme events to mark the five-day festival which started on September 26./Thousands of people joined the i mmersion processions taken out by various societies in different parts of the city./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Learn a unique lesson from Bapu,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 2 -- Today is Gandhi Jayanti. On this occasion, all of us remember Bapu in our own ways. Some of us idolise him even as others perceive him as full of follies. That is the power of Mahatma Gandhi. Every discussion about him further consolidates his eternal legacy./Let me tell the uninitiated that Gandhi had an important role to play in the launch of Hindustan Times. On September 26, 1924, while presenting this newspaper as a daily to the people of the country, he had expressed a wish that it play a role in the struggle for independence and the quest for social reforms. At that time, his son Devdas Gandhi was on the editorial board of Hindustan Times. He went on to successfully become the editor of the newspaper. Even today the objective of the Hindustan Times group is national service and social reform. Therefore, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while dedicating the fortnight preceding Gandhi Jayanti to cleanliness, gave the slogan: Swachhta Hi Seva (cleanliness is the real service), our sister publication Hindustan took it up like a mission./Swami Vivekananda used to say that a healthy mind can only reside in a healthy body. Still, lakhs of people lose their lives every year owing to lack of hygiene. A report by World Health Organization says that for a population of 1 lakh, more than 133 deaths take place because of air pollution. As many as 2.7 million people die of diarrhoea and waterborne diseases in India every year. The lack of hygiene causes 15 serious ailments including malaria, diarrhoea, cholera, dengue and hepatitis B . This can be tackled only with a people's movement./Before embarking on this movement, we decided to have a conversation with the people themselves. In the first phase, simultaneous dialogues were held in every district of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Jharkhand. We were happy to discover that the people, who turned out in numbers larger than we expected, had their hearts in the right place when it came to playing a part in our mission. As I write this, lakhs of citizens in more than 3,500 awareness programmes have taken the pledge to maintain cleanliness. I am not quoting exact statistics because our mission will continue till the evening of October 2 and the numbers are growing every day. The pledge hasn't been taken just for namesake. People have already begun implementing it./Here's one example. On September 23, even as it was raining in Dehradun, my colleagues in Hindustan discovered that a number of people ventured out to clean the streets clad in raincoats or holding umbrellas. This is the kind of self-sufficiency that Gandhiji wanted us to display. It was a pleasant surprise to learn that instead of relying on government machinery, the people had taken an initiative on their own to clean up their neighbourhoods. Every colleague from Hindustan had similar stories to narrate. It isn't possible to share all of them in this column, but it is clear that if this tradition of volunteerism goes on, a number of health-related problems in the country will be resolved on their own./Next year the nation celebrates the 150th birth anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhi. If in this year, thanks to the cooperation between the government and the common man, India emerges a little cleaner, then it will be a real tribute from the country to the father of the nation./Here we would like to make a special mention of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das. Not only did they cooperate in making our campaign successful, but they also individually participated in the programmes hosted by us./Apart from these, many other state and central ministers and people's representatives took part in the campaign. Cleanliness is a subject of social reform. It is a matter of great satisfaction that our politicians have risen above their ideological differences and considered Hindustan's mission as their own mission./We would also like to thank from the bottom of the heart people of the Hindi belt who have adopted the motto of Swachhta Hi Seva and taken the pledge: ""Maa kasam, Hindustan swachh rakhenge hum."" One hopes this campaign will be an ongoing endeavour that will lay a foundation for the clean and healthy India that all of us deserve./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurgaon's air quality to be assessed pre and post Diwali,"Gurgaon, Oct. 4 -- The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in association with the state pollution department, plans to assess air pollution symptoms of respiratory diseases among residents of Gurgaon before and after the festival of Diwali./A survey will be conducted to assess the degree of lung function impairment in persons chronically exposed to the city's air. Officials said that areas to be assessed will be finalised within a week. Four zones will be demarcated for the survey, which will be conducted to assess the correlation between the health effect and air quality, officials said./The survey will be based on questionnaires and also comprise health camps./This initiative was planned as every year, the city's air quality turns 'poor' following the Diwali festival. As per a World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2010, outdoor air pollution is considered the fifth largest killer in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking and poor nutrition. It was stated that around 6, 20,000 deaths take place in India every year from air pollution-related diseases./""We have been asked by the CPCB to monitor the air quality index of the city and take necessary steps immediately (when it worsens) to curb pollution in case of poor air quality,"" said JB Sharma, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB)./Sharma said the board will also conduct weekly meetings to assess the condition of air quality in the city for the next three months. The survey will be conducted in residential, industrial and commercial areas of the city, officials said./""Vehicular emissions and chemicals from crackers, when trapped in atmosphere for a long time, can lead to harmful effects on health. Air quality of Gurgaon should be monitored at regular intervals, in prominent areas, to figure out solutions for high level of pollutants in the atmosphere,"" Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said./Dr Rajesh Kumar, senior consultant, internal medicine, Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon, said, ""During Diwali festival, there will be an increase in the level of harmful gases such as the suspended particulate matter(SPM) CO, NOx, hydrocarbons and SO2 . Pregnant women, children and those having chronic asthma are more vulnerable. Fireworks can also cause respiratory problems such as chronic or allergic bronchitis, bronchial asthma. Exposure to excessive sound levels could lead to restlessness, temporary or permanent hearing loss, high blood pressure, and sleep disturbances./According to a study by CPCB last year, open burning of solid waste and bursting of crackers emit pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2)./Doctors are of the opinion that poor air quality has been impacting the health of residents. Dr Piyush Goel, consultant pulmonologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon, said, ""The alarming pollution level is making the air around us fatal and is one of the most important factors leading to precipitation of asthma attacks.

"Polluted air from factories is choking us, say Mumbai residents","Mumbai, Oct. 6 -- Residents of Chandivli, who have been complaining about the air pollution caused by the factories in the area and the apathy exhibited by the authorities in resolving the issue, held a rally on Monday to drive the point home./About 250 residents took out a protest rally and alleged that the factories operational in the area were illegal./When contacted, civic officials said they are verifying the claims made by the residents./The civic officials said they had written to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), requesting it to act on citizens' complaints. The latter said their sub-regional officers had been asked to survey the area./""We have already initiated action and are investigating whether these industries have licence to operate or not. We are also checking whether air pollution norms are being followed. If we find any violation, closure notices will be issued subsequently,"" said a senior MPCB official./Besides taking to the streets, the residents also started a signature campaign to shut down the polluting industrial units. They also plan to file a public interest litigation (PIL) soon./Residents said they formed Swachh Chandivli group after repeated complaints to MPCB and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) failed to yield result in the past six years./The group has now written to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis./""We have written to the chief minister requesting his intervention because the air pollution is now taking a toll on our health. We are confident that we will get justice and our voices will be heard in the court of law,"" said Lavita Powell, another resident./Another resident SL Dhingra, professor at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, said the industries do not operate as per government working hours prescribed in the Factories Act, 1948./""All these small industrial units are flouting health and safety norms. There is also a possibility of them catching fire, which could be disastrous for not just the nearby slum pocket but even the adjoining Nahar International School, which has about 1,000 students and staff,"" he said./There are 150 industrial units in Khairani Road, Jangleshwar Mahadev Mandir Road, Saki Vihar Road and Andheri -Kurla Road, and pollution is affecting housing colonies such as Nahar Complex, Sangharsh Nagar, Lake Homes and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) in the area./""The chemical-laden smoke emitted by these illegal industrial units is causing severe health challenges, especially to children and senior citizens.

"Haryana farmers unite to challenge ban on stubble burning, to burn paddy waste after protest in Kurukshetra","Kurukshetra/Karnal, Oct. 9 -- Angry with Haryana government's direction of taking action against farmers found burning paddy residue, defiant farmers have decided to challenge the authorities./With a view to unite farmers, Bhartiya Kisan Union has decided to hold a protest in Ladwa of Kurukshetra district and are also planning to burn paddy waste in fields along the Kurukshetra-Saharnpur road./""We will bring 50 tractor-trolleys laden with paddy waste and take a round of the city to try and find a buyer. If we fail, we will burn it,"" Haryana BKU president Ratan Mann told Hindustan Times./He said that the decision has been taken to make the government and the district administration aware of the problems being faced by farmers due to lack of support. We are ready to sell paddy straw if there is a buyer, farmers say. The district administration is increasing security deployment and is also planning to hold talks with the defiant farmers./Haryana BKU members have decided to challenge the authorities as farmers in neighbouring Punjab are already holding protests against the stubble burning ban./The farmers are also alleging that the government's decision to ban burning of paddy stubble has resulted in a labour crisis as many farmers are avoiding harvesting with combine harvesters, which spreads paddy straw in fields, following which the manual harvesting cost has increased to Rs 7,000 per acre from Rs 5,500./However, the government has assured that they were providing subsidies on the happy seeders and straw reapers, but farmers allege that announcements remain only on paper. There are no straw reapers even in nearby villages and we cannot wait as fields need to be prepared for the next crop cycle, farmers say./Following pressure from the National Green Tribunal (NGT), Haryana government has directed district administrations to issue strict warnings to farmers regarding stubble burning and also imposed Section 144 to ensure implementation of the ban. WhatsApp numbers have also been provided to ease the process of filing complaints so that immediate action could be taken against erring farmers./Karnal district administration has booked 18 farmers under Section 188 of the IPC and a fine of Rs 2,500 per acre has also been imposed on them. Though the state government also announced an incentive of Rs 50,000 to a village panchayat for not burning the waste and some district authorities also deciding to take action against the village sarpanch if any case of stubble burning reported in his village, but farmers say nothing will help till the government provides them with an alternative./As per officials in the pollution control board ill-effects of these fires are not limited to Haryana as the smoke reaches Delhi because of winds, causing major health problems. Smoke from stubble burning was a major contributor to Delhi's winter air-pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

SC bans firecracker sale in Delhi-NCR till Oct-end,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 10 -- The Supreme Court reinstated on Monday its ban on the sale of firecrackers in and around New Delhi ahead of Diwali, in a preemptive step to stop a toxic haze from engulfing the region like last year./The festival of light falls on October 19 this year./An acrid smog forced authorities to close schools and ban construction activities after Diwali last November.

A cracker of a judgment,"Mumbai, Oct. 10 -- Diwali, this year may be celebrated truly as festival of lights in the National Capital Region (NCR) . The Supreme Court on Monday banned the sale of firecrackers in the city for the next 20 days. It is an extraordinary step that the top court has taken to deal with an equally urgent condition arising from alarming air pollution levels in the city./Last year, Delhi woke up to distressing levels of pollution after Diwali, when the average PM (particulate matter) 2.5 level reached an unprecedented levels of over 700 mu g/m cube- one of the highest recorded the world over and 29 times above WHO standards. The court calls this a health emergency. Medical evidence suggests that severe air pollution in NCR is leading to multiple diseases and other health related issues among the people. The city has seen an increase in respiratory diseases like asthma, lung cancer, bronchitis primarily attributable to the worsening air quality in the NCR. The damage being caused to people is irreversible. What makes matter worse for the city is also the fact that the festival season coincides with the setting in of winters in north India which reduces wind speed, the marriage season and the burning of crop residue by farmers of Punjab and Haryana at the same time./In passing the ban order, the court may have departed the time-honoured way of celebrating the festival, but the choice for it was not a difficult one to make - when it concerned the lives of people. Justifying the ban on sale of firecrackers, the court says that it needs to test, if banning sale of firecrackers during Diwali will have a positive effect on air quality in Delhi. The court feels, as far as adverse effects of burning of crackers during Diwali are concerned; those have been witnessed year after year. The air quality deteriorates alarmingly and the city chokes on the foul air. However, the court needs to be lauded not just recognising and protecting the health needs of future generations but also tilting the balance in favour of a vast majority of citizens against the commercial interests of a few./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution no reason: Firecracker sale ban becomes an 'attack' on Hinduism,"India, Oct. 10 -- The Supreme Court has reinstated its ban on the sale of firecrackers in and around Delhi before Diwali to prevent toxic haze, but try explaining that logic on social media./Tweets and Facebook posts alleging 'Islamic rule' and 'targeting' of Hindu festivals started trending after the court's ban on Monday. People who alleged conspiracy in the court's order appeared to have ignored the toxic impact of firecrackers./Dense smog in Delhi had forced authorities to close schools and ban construction activities after Diwali last November. That year the city struggled with its worst air pollution for two decades and air quality was categorised as ""severe"". Schools had to be shut down and hospitals reported a rise in cases of respiratory distress, with elderly and children the worst hit./Experts said fireworks, burning of crop residue in neighbouring states before winter, vehicular emissions and construction dust were the main culprits for the toxic smog. Preventing pollution isn't a good enough reason for some on social media though./A trader in Sadar Bazaar, Delhi's firecracker market, believes Hindu festivals are being ""banned"". A video of him speaking out against the ban was retweeted over 2,000 times./Meena Das Narayan, who has a verified Twitter account and calls herself a Narendra Modi supporter, said she would rather light firecrackers than ""cut a thousand cows""./Best-selling novelist Chetan Bhagat tweeted after the top court's ruling: ""Can I just ask on cracker ban. Why only guts to do this for Hindu festivals? Banning goat sacrifice and Muharram bloodshed soon too?""/Others echoed his sentiments. ""NO firecrackers in Delhi-NCR on Diwali as Supreme Court bans sale until November 1. But does SC have guts to ban slaughter on Bakra Eid?"" questioned Twitter user Jagrati Shukla./Another user, Shefali Vaidya, took a defiant stand. ""Every Hindu household in Delhi should make it a point to get firecrackers from outside NCR and light them outside the SC!"" she wrote./To counter conspiracy theorists, there were appeals for logic. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor responded to Bhagat: ""Your examples of practices integral to those observances; banning them would be like banning lamps on Diwali. Firecrackers are unholy add-ons.""/The annual episode of air pollution on the onset of winter has already begun this year. Farmers in villages of neighbouring states Haryana and Punjab have set fire their farmlands on fire, leaving behind black ash. NASA images showed stubble-burning has already begun and firecrackers during Diwali are known to be a major source of pollution before winter./Delhi's air quality has already started deteriorating, and PM10 and PM2.5 levels are gradually shooting up. With a health hazard in the making, the question is: ""How did an environmental issue like banning firecrackers turn communal? Guess it happens only in India #crackerban (sic),"" said Ashwin./Others argued that the ban was simply a pre-emptive step to stop smog from engulfing Delhi-NCR. Some, however, pointed out that bursting crackers has nothing to do with Diwali and it is a practice fuelled by commercial markets./For tweets, please visit here -- /<a href=""http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pollution-no-reason-firecracker-sale-ban-becomes-an-attack-on-hinduism/story-ywth3ygu5pzvcvpuggqoem.html"">http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pollution-no-reason-firecracker-sale-ban-becomes-an-attack-on-hinduism/story-ywth3ygu5pzvcvpuggqoem.html</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

One step towards cleaning Delhi's toxic air,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 10 -- The Supreme Court has come to the rescue of Delhi-NCR residents yet again banning the sale of fireworks till November 1, 2017. Unless one of the other parameters that contributes to the rise of particulate matter in the air (such as crop-stubble burning or burning of garbage at landfills) changes significantly and suddenly over the next 10 days, it will soon become clear how greatly the combustion of firecrackers over one single evening contributes to Delhi's pollution./The court has been circumspect in limiting its order to November 1. What will be key for all stakeholders and advocates of clean air is to ensure that when the court revisits the issue after that date, it is presented with accurate, unambiguous and error-free data from multiple unbiased monitoring sources, which include but aren't limited to government sources such as the CPCB. Because this isn't about Diwali or festivities. Its about the collective health of Delhi residents, rich and poor alike - and that includes manufacturers, workers as well as end-users of fireworks, the very demographic protesting the ban./Poor air is harmful for even animals and plants - any living being that respires - although there isn't enough research available to scientifically validate that./The first red herring being used by interested lobbies in court to divert attention from the issue is whether PM2.5 is indeed so terrible for human health. That breathing polluted air (specifically PM2.5, particulates smaller than 2.5 microns) is harmful for human health is now beyond debate. By now most people are aware that of the five pollutants that populate our Air Quality Index-Sox Nox, CO, Ozone and PM2.5-it is that last solid particulate matter that causes the worst irreversible harm to our organs./Leaving all that aside for now, if we just take the evidence previously accepted by governments, courts and people globally, that smoking cigarettes is injurious to our health, then there can be no doubt that PM2.5 is also equally, if not more injurious, given that inhaling air isn't even a choice and we breathe PM2.5 in involuntarily not once, but 25,000 times in a day. If there was still any doubt, a recent Lung Care Foundation video has a surgeon telling us PM2.5 is harmful, complete with gruesome images of healthy pink versus PM-tainted black lungs./The fact that PM levels multiply sharply after Diwali has been well studied and the petitioners are banking on that. What isn't as well known is that they themselves have highlighted the Delhi PM2.5 numbers before and after Diwali to the Supreme Court and attached these to the court documents last year itself, even before the November 11, 2016 order was passed. All that remains to be done is for monitoring stations and air pollution scientists to take accurate measurements after Diwali this year- the first (though hopefully not the only) one after the ban on sale of firecrackers is enforced and compare it to previous years. Which is where our scientists, pollution control boards and myriad monitoring stations come in. The ball is now in their court to provide accurate numbers to convince the court, if we want to see the ban extended beyond November 1, 2017./Banning sale of fireworks is just one tiny step. But it is a very important one to begin. Not just because it is relatively easier to enforce and control than some of the other pollution sources. Not even because it will take away at one stroke the single highest contributing factor that kicks off the season of poor air in Delhi. But because the ban will raise awareness across all socio-economic groups about the irreversible damage PM2.5 causes to the body; and if enforced strictly, will demonstrate the government's willingness to take such an important issue seriously./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

A farmer's dilemma: Can stubble be more than just waste?,"Patiala/Karnal, Oct. 10 -- As the thick white smoke, billowing from a corner of the field filled the air, a 63-year-old farmer was busy moving some of the still-burning hay with a shovel. He was spreading it to another corner to allow the flames to spread./""We have no option but to set our farmlands on fire. We know that it triggers heavy pollution, but the stubble needs to be removed before we prepare the farm for the winter crop,"" said Balwant Singh (name withheld on request)./The practice of burning agricultural residue had been banned by the National Green Tribunal two years ago. But it is largely still prevalent across major farming states like Punjab and Haryana./Before the pollution from these burnt farms reaches Delhi, the farmers say it takes a heavy toll on them and their families. But with little option and despite being aware of the consequences, thousands of villagers across Haryana and Punjab set their farmlands on fire soon after the monsoon retreats./While the governments in both states have been trying to find a solution to put an end to the practice, Hindustan Times visited some villages, speaking to farmers, government officials and experts in an attempt to find a possible solution./Solutions from farmers/For the villagers of both Haryana and Punjab, stubble burning has turned out to be a Hobson's choice. With cost concerns, the short gap between summer and winter crops, lack of incentives from the government and shortage of equipment to manually cut down the stubble, most farmers take to residue burning./But amid the dark patches, a ray of hope is slowly emerging. Hindustan Times found some farmers who said they have refrained from the practice./Resham Singh, a 50-year-old farmer from Kamalpur village in Patiala district, has cut the stubble of his one-acre plot and lined it up on the side./""We won't burn it this year. Instead, we will put water on it and let it decompose and become khaad (manure). Due to government pressure, most farmers this time will not go for the quick-fix solution,"" he said./His nephew Dharmender Singh said that a little more government help could make it easier for them to dispose the stubble without burning. ""We get five hours of electricity a day. Instead, if we get power for eight hours, we can pour water on the parali (crop stubble) to turn it into khaad,"" he said./At Behmna village, smoke from farmer Darshan Singh's farm could be seen from a distance. However, he claimed he was not burning freshly cut stubble. ""This one is from last year. The residue from this year has been put on the edge and won't be burnt. We are not breaking any law,"" the 52-year-old said./In Haryana, too, hope seems to be emerging./""This time we have decided to cut the stubble and store it. It would be fed to the cattle in the days to come,"" said Angrez Singh, a farmer from Karnal./Government offers options/Stacks of briquettes made from of stubble are seen lying in a corner of a farm at Jundla village in Haryana. Villagers said that a private liquor company has asked them not to burn these, and that they would be purchased./""Haryana Liquors Pvt Ltd came up with this proposal last year. They undertook a pilot project last year which proved to be successful. This year, they have already purchased 200 tonnes of stubble and have set a target to buy 5,000 tonnes. It would be used to fuel their furnaces,"" said a senior official of the Haryana Pollution Control Board./With an estimated 35 million tonnes of stubble burnt across Punjab and Haryana, 5,000 tonnes seems a small figure, but officials said that at least they had a start. An acre of paddy farm yields around two tonnes of stubble./""Who would burn this stubble to create pollution if there's another alternative?"" asks Amrinder Singh, a villager in Kurukshetra./Officials in Punjab and Haryana said that some companies have been showing interest in buying the stubble, which could be used to co-fuel power and biomass plants./""We are ready to sell it off.

Only then can we think of putting it to use,"" said Polash Mukerjee, senior research associate (air pollution) at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./Experts from CSE and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) said that a business module and market needs to be developed to do away with stubble burning.

In May 2016, the tariff was increased from less than Rs.7, and was fixed at Rs.8.30 per unit. This has been announced to provide better incentives for farmers to sell their stubble./Burning the stubble in power generating plants or other industries as co-fuel would generate less pollution as these industries need to follow emission norms. ""They use electrostatic precipitators which can reduce the pollution by more than 90%,"" said Sharma./Experts said that proper mechanism and infrastructure needs to be developed through which aggregators can collect the stubble from the fields and store them in warehouses. This could be used throughout the year./""The constant availability is necessary because power plants would need a supply of this fuel throughout the year.

It will not be sustainable,"" said Mukerjee./Bagasse, pellets and briquette made out of stubble could be used for other purposes as well, such as in the cardboard industry./""Nearly 300 million households across India use firewood as fuel in their kitchens. These pellets and briquettes could be used instead. Pollution from these products is significantly less than firewood,"" said Mukerjee./Solutions may be there, but the change cannot be expected overnight. Experts said the development of a comprehensive interdepartmental policy is need of the hour./""District-level planning committees need to be developed.

Life in Aravallis: Villagers say mining destroyed ecology of the hills,"Gurgaon, Oct. 11 -- Life in the lap of Aravallis used to be simple, says 80-year-old Chandi Pehalwan, a resident of Pali village in Faridabad. ""People from villages in Yamuna catchment area would send their cattle here before monsoon and get wheat and jaggery in return,"" he recalls./In the last two decades,however, Pehalwan's village, like many others in the region, has undergone a sea change. Large tracts of Aravallis, that once provided villagers necessary means of sustenance, now stand barren. Village economies that thrived on exchange of cattle, grains and forest produce have collapsed and the age-old ecological balance of the region stands shaken./Around 240 villages in the Aravalli range, mainly inhabited by clans of Gujjars, abandoned cattle grazing and agriculture in favour of mining in the 90s. Though the business brought money and prosperity, it was banned by the Supreme Court in 2002 due to its disastrous ecological imprint. Dr Gopal Krishan from National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, said mining caused considerable damage to the ecology of Aravallis as it resulted in heavy deforestation and decline in water quality./""The built up area increased in the Aravallis. The lakes that were filled with water in about 45 hectares vanished. Agricultural land was diverted to mining and reduced along with vegetation,"" said Dr Krishan, who along with Naval Kishore and Deepa Nathalia, conducted a survey in 2015 about the ecological impact of mining. The survey found that the symbiotic relationship of the villagers with the Aravallis was shattered with the advent of mining and the consequent ban on it crushed the villagers./The transformation/There are around 90 villages in Gurgaon and Faridabad that are located in core Aravalli hills and another 150 in the foothills and catchment areas. During nearly one-and-a-half decades of mining, villagers turned into transporters, contractors, and labour suppliers. Village economies changed overnight and every family in the core mining area developed a stake in the industry./Before the onset of mining, around 30% of the population was engaged in animal husbandry, according to the survey in 2015. ""During our growing up days I recall people taking cattle daily to the hills. There was plenty of grass, tree leaves, and other forest produce,"" said Jitender Bhadana, founder Save Aravallis, an NGO./The region supplied milk to Faridabad, and even as far as Delhi. The sale of forest produce, comprising Dhak, Ber and Krail, was widely undertaken. Chandi Pehlawan said that everything coming from 'Pahar' was once utilized. ""All these things have now vanished,"" he said./As their wealth increased with the mining business, villagers scaled-up their lifestyle. ""Most of the youth left education for a job or contract in the mining sector. People built swanky houses, bought trucks, took huge loans, every house had a luxury car,"" said Gajraj Bhadana, a resident of Pali. Bhadana lost his job after government banned mining and the Haryana forest department took control of the forest land, imposing strict controls on economic activities in the hills./A survey in 2015 - titled 'Socio-Economic change impact after the closure of mining activities; A case study of Aravalli Hills of Faridabad District, Haryana' - revealed that in 2002 almost 35 to 40% people were engaged in mining in core areas. The study was conducted by Dr Gopal Krishan, Deepa Nathalia and Naval Kishore from National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, and Department of Geology, Panjab University, Chandigarh./Almost 90% village youth did not study beyond Class 10th during this period. Less than 1% youth were found to be graduates in core mining villages, whereas only 5% had cleared Class 12, the survey revealed./Many villagers had even taken loans to buy dumpers and mining equipment. The loans have now turned a liability as the work has stopped and incomes have dwindled, the survey found./Post mining era/Ban on mining had a major fall out as incomes dropped and sources of employment dried up./Families that had gained power and pelf during the mining boom saw a sharp decline in fortunes. ""The Mercedes cars are gathering dust and the SUVs are difficult to service, but who will bell the cat and change the mindset,"" said Bhadana./Over 300 youth in Pali and Pakhal villages alone are now struggling to get married as there is no sustainable source of income, says Bhadana. ""The boys did not focus on education, their parents never thought that mining could stop one day. The situation is same across the hills,"" said Horam Singh Bhadana, a retired school principal, who lives in Pawta./Landholding, considered a big source of income in Delhi-NCR, also suffered due to mining ban as people had to sell off their land to finance their lifestyle. The 2015 survey revealed that almost 48 per cent villagers had a holding of 2 acres to 5 acres in 2002, which dropped by 30 per cent in 2015./Less than 18% now earn more than 15,000 per month, a number that was much higher during the mining years, according to the survey. The number of people who owned four wheelers in 2002 also went down in 2015 indicating that the sources of income have largely dried up./The ban on mining has, however, somewhat stemmed the degradation of Aravallis. Some also claim that a number of health ailments - such hearing loss, lung diseases, respiratory issues, asthma, tuberculosis, and skin allergies - have gone down. But water pollution caused by mining has ensured that water borne diseases like malaria, cholera, bone problems and gastric problems continue. ""There has been considerable increase in diseases caused by water pollution. Air pollution also continues due to operation of crushing zone,"" said Horam Singh Bhadana./The solution to these problems, locals say, is in not treating the 'Pahar' as source of endless income. ""This hill is our mother and it should be treated with respect. It needs to be saved if Delhi, Gurgaon and Faridabad have to survive as it is a storehouse of oxygen and water. It also protects us from desertification,"" said Jitender Bhadana./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

This could be used throughout the year./""The constant availability is necessary because power plants would need a supply of this fuel throughout the year.Just providing them with the fuel for a few months would not be helpful,"" said Mukerjee./Bagasse,pellets and briquette made out of stubble could be used for other purposes as well./""Nearly 300 million households across India use firewood as fuel in their kitchens. These pellets and briquettes could be used instead.Pollution from such products is significantly less than firewood,"" said Mukerjee./Solutions may be there, but change can't be expected overnight. Experts said the development of a comprehensive policy is need of the hour./""District-level planning committees need to be developed. They would have to come up with region-based plans on how to utilise the stubble. A single business module may not be applicable everywhere,"" said Sharma./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

No good reason to not regulate fire crackers use,"Mumbai, Oct. 12 -- Mumbai's air quality is way better than Delhi's, even during Diwali. It's a statement of fact as much as a statement of one-upmanship, often repeated with misplaced glee by Mumbaiites. Indeed, the air quality index numbers register lower levels for Mumbai than for Delhi at all times but it does not mean that air quality in Mumbai is healthy or within permissible limits./On Diwali nights last two years, Mumbai's air quality index (AQI) breached permissible levels: The morning after Diwali last year registered 320 which rated as ""very poor""; it was 313 the previous year, also ""very poor"", according to the System for Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). Delhi registered an AQI of 450-500, even breaching the 500 mark last year, earning it international disrepute as the world's most polluted city./The spike in pollution levels during Diwali is, of course, directly linked to burning fire crackers. In a continuing effort to monitor their exact impact, the Supreme Court earlier this week banned their sale in the National Capital Region till November 1. This led to much brouhaha. Commentators questioned it on various grounds: how would banning sale help when burning them is allowed, why are fire crackers targeted when the sources of air pollution lie elsewhere, is this a selective curb on a Hindu festival and so on./Of course, the major sources of air pollution whether in Delhi or Mumbai - or any Indian city - are vehicular emissions, road dust, garbage and landfill burning, construction activities and industrial emissions./The average air quality regularly breaches the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other acceptable levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and dioxide, and particulate matter (PM). But during Diwali, the air quality is worse, and the PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels (particulate matters that are 2.5 or less and 10 or less) rise to extremely unhealthy levels. The WHO has labelled both PM 2.5 and PM 10 as carcinogenic./Doctors and health activists have noted a marked rise in respiratory diseases during and after Diwali, especially among little children, senior citizens, and people with chronic respiratory problems./Six of the most popular fire crackers emitted PM which was 200 to 2000 times of the WHO's safe limits, showed a Pune-based study last year. As it is, lung function capacity of most Mumbaiites is compromised, as a limited study two years ago found; almost half of a hospital's medical staff had weak lung function with some 30-yearolds showing the capacity of 50-year-olds./Mumbai enjoys geographical and climatic advantages that Delhi does not. The sea breeze along its western and eastern waterfronts helps to clear away many pollutants routinely. But the city's air quality has shown a dramatic drop in the last decade. Both empirical and anecdotal evidence show a rise in diseases and ailments linked to air pollution. Mumbai is the fifth most polluted megacity in the world, according to the WHO./It will not do any more to brush off the impact of fire crackers. Sure, other activities that cause and raise air pollution should be regulated and existing laws implemented, but what is the harm in addressing a clear cause of raised pollution levels? The other activities like construction and transport at least have economic reasons; fire crackers are burned for pleasure./Regulating their use should not cause so much distress. To see this with political or religious colour is to do ourselves disfavour. Bad and polluted air harms all, equally./The two countries that Indians love to compare theirs with, the United States of America and China, do not allow all private citizens to burn fire crackers at will. Their sale and use are highly restricted. And citizens watch a public display of fireworks at designated places. They must have good reasons./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air pollution on rise in state capital, equipment gathering dust","India, Oct. 12 -- Air quality of the city is getting worse due to rise in concentration of particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5 and situation is expected to worsen after Diwali. What's more worrying is that the state is not properly equipped to measure its air quality and its deterioration is fast emerging as a major health hazard./Last year, the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) had purchased three devices to measure concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5. But all the three devices are gathering dust due to lack of filter papers required for reading the pollutant levels and measuring the air quality./Of late, it has been observed that the air pollution across the state capital breaches the 'safety level' during Diwali. But the JSPCB has been able to measure air quality at just one place, i.e. Albert Ekka Chowk, due to lack of infrastructure. Experts say tiny particulate matter reaches deep into lungs, at times leading to diseases such as Asthma and Tuberculosis./JSPCB has eight machines to measure PM 10 but only five are in a working condition. Out of the five, one was installed at Albert Ekka Chowk, two were on stand-by and the remaining two were used for surprise checking in industrial areas, officials said./The officials, however, said the level of PM 2.5 had never been measured in any part of the state during Diwali due to absence of filter paper./Such condition prevails at a time when it has been observed even in other parts of the country, including national capital, that the level of harmful pollutants in air increases drastically during Diwali due to bursting of firecrackers coupled with foggy weather conditions./Taking cognisance of the high pollution level during Diwali, the Supreme Court earlier this week banned sale of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region till Diwali./In Ranchi, the recorded data on Diwali last year at Albert Ekka Chowk showed respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM 10) had escalated to 199% from the permissible limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre (mg/m3)./The only automatic ambient air quality monitoring display installed in the city is at Doranda, where pollution level is considerably lower than other parts of the city, which has witnessed concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 above the permissible limit many times./Concentration of PM 10 was recorded highest at 985 micrograms per cubic metre in Doranda, 10 times higher than the permissible limit, on World Environment Day on June 5 this year./Kirti Abhisek, a professor of environment studies at Birla Institute of Technology (BIT), Mesra, said, ""With rising number of vehicles, PM 2.5 level has also increased in the capital city and it needs to be monitored for people's awareness.""/He said proper monitoring would help people and planners introduce preventive measures as PM 2.5 invites several health problems, mainly related to the respiratory system./Indian Medical Association's, Jharkhand chapter president, AK Singh said over 15% rise in number of Tuberculosis and Asthma patients had been recorded in the state over the past 10 years, which could be attributed to the rising air pollution./JSPCB member secretary SK Suman, however, said air quality in the city was 'still safe'. ""We have been monitoring noise and air pollution levels in Ranchi and other cities of Jharkhand under guidance of CPCB,"" he said./Suman said order to procure filter paper to read PM 2.5 had been placed./JSPCB analyst RN Kashyap said, ""We have ordered for Whatman filter paper from UK to measure PM 2.5. All procedure to import it has been completed. We are expecting to get the filter by end of this month.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Banning crackers alone won't help Gurgaon residents breathe easy,"Gurgaon, Oct. 12 -- With the increase in pollutants in the air, doctors in the city have said that number of patients with respiratory, heart problems and skin infections has increased./At present, the PM2.5 level is above 100g/m3. According to the air quality index of central pollution control board (CPCB), such conditions make breathing difficult for people with asthma and heart diseases./PM2.5 is suspended particulate matter 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter and is a major component of air pollution. As it is very fine, it can settle in the lungs and worsen asthma and other respiratory problems. The permissible limits of PM 10 and PM 2.5 are 100g/m3 and 60g/m3, respectively./Doctors at Civil Hospital said the air pollutants can affect endocrine system that regulates growth and development in human beings. ""Poor air quality can lead to hormonal changes and it can hamper the growth of children,"" BK Rajora, chief medical officer, Civil Hospital, said./The number of patients with skin and eye infections is also increasing because of high pollutants in the atmosphere, doctors said./""We are seeing more than 40 patients a day with respiratory problems and eye diseases at the government hospital,"" said SS Saroha, deputy civil surgeon, Civil Hospital, Gurgaon./Health experts said staying for more than 48 hours in a highly polluted atmosphere can lead to damage of vital organs such as heart and lungs./""Air pollutants, once inhaled, are absorbed by the blood and transported to the organs. It can lead to cardiovascular illness. A wide range of chemical and biological substances can directly affect the cardiovascular system and can lead to structural damages, such as necrosis degenerative and inflammatory reactions. Some pollutants may also affect contractility of the heart. If these functional changes are serious, they can be fatal,"" Dr. Rajesh Kumar, senior consultant, internal medicine, Paras hospitals Gurgaon, said./Keeping in mind the changes in air quality, doctors advised people to wear masks or stay indoors./Dr. Bornali Datta, associate director, respiratory and sleep Medicine, Medanta- The Medicity, said, ""Go for walks during daytime and wear masks. Residents should use purifiers at homes and people with respiratory problems should use medication and inhalers. The patients should follow a healthy lifestyle. If a respiratory problem persists, seek medical attention.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

"Firecrackers can affect development of unborn babies, kids: Pollution board study","Mumbai, Oct. 12 -- People exposed to firecrackers, which commonly have copper, sulphur and charcoal in them, are at a higher risk of suffering from diseases that can lead to cancer, while the presence of nitrates can cause developmental disorders in unborn babies and children, a study by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has revealed./The CPCB's study, which came out last month, analysed various firecrackers available in the market for their chemical composition and health impact. The findings were submitted in the form of an affidavit in September to the Supreme Court, which has since banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi./For the study, commonly used firecrackers were selected on the basis of four main categories set by the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization (PESO): atom bomb, Chinese crackers (not related to the country), maroons and garland crackers. ""We studied their combustive features, broke down crackers on the basis of common ingredients and checked for their effects post combustion,"" said D Saha, additional director, in charge of air quality, CPCB./Six primary ingredients were identified in these firecrackers: fuel (charcoal is most commonly used); oxidising agents such as nitrates and chlorates; reducing agents such as sulphur; colouring agents such as calcium, barium, copper, sodium, strontium, lithium and aluminium; and binders such as dextrin (for glue and paper)./Nitrates and chlorates can lead to bio-accumulation [increase in the concentration of a chemical in a biological organism over time] as the chemicals remain airborne for days after combustion. They pose a developmental danger for children and unborn babies, and are poisonous for plants and animals as well, the study said./Other unsafe ingredients include charcoal, which releases toxic dust and is a carcinogenic sulphur-coal compound. ""Colouring agents such as copper that releases a blue colour on combustion can also lead to bio-accumulation and causes cancer risk. Green colour released from barium is poisonous as its fumes can irritate the respiratory tract,"" the study said. ""Dextrin on combustion forms glycogen, which can irritate the respiratory tract, and cause headaches. It can also damage the liver, kidneys, the central nervous system, and is carcinogenic.""/All these firecrackers have metallic oxides and are dangerous. ""These chemicals can cause permanent damage to the lungs, especially in children,"" said Saha. ""With the rise in population in megacities like Mumbai and Delhi, the use of firecrackers is increasing year on year. Ten years ago, the use of firecrackers was an average of 50 grams per family, and this has risen significantly. The environment does not have enough carrying capacity to handle this much combustion, so regulations are a must for all megacities.""/The solution may be for people in big cities such as Mumbai to celebrate Diwali by bursting firecrackers as a community event, rather than every family buying and bursting them separately./As reported in HT's October 5 edition, a pre-Diwali firecracker testing operation conducted in Mumbai on October 4 revealed that explosives being sold this year have higher noise and air pollution levels. ""We've found that a tremendous amount of chemicals is being released from a few crackers this year. Directions have been issued to the department to analyse them. Once their chemical components are studied, we will send our recommendations to the Controller of Explosives in Nagpur,"" said VM Motghare, joint director, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB)./Activists believe that the sale and use of firecrackers should be banned in India. ""It is in the interest of the environment and people's health that firecrackers are banned across the country,"" said Sumaira Abulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. ""The issue of firecrackers is becoming increasingly politicised, and their impact on people's health is not being considered. It is very important to involve citizens to decide what is right for them.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The mountain of life stands barren now,"GURGAON, Oct. 12 -- Life in the lap of Aravallis used to be simple, says 80-yearold Chandi Pehalwan, a resident of Pali village in Faridabad. ""People from villages in Yamuna catchment area would send their cattle here before monsoon and get wheat and jaggery in return,"" he recalls./In the last two decades,however, Pehalwan's village, like many others in the region, has undergone a sea change. Large tracts of Aravallis, that once provided villagers necessary means of sustenance, now stand barren. Village economies that thrived on exchange of cattle, grains and forest produce have collapsed and the age-old ecological balance of the region stands shaken./Around 240 villages in the Aravalli range, mainly inhabited by clans of Gujjars, abandoned cattle grazing and agriculture for mining in the 90s. Though the business brought money and prosperity, it was banned by the Supreme Court in 2002 due to its disastrous ecological imprint. Dr Gopal Krishan from National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, said mining damaged the ecology of Aravallis as it led to deforestation and decline in water quality./""The built up area increased in the Aravallis. The lakes that were filled with water in about 45 hectares vanished. Agricultural land was diverted to mining and reduced along with vegetation,"" said Dr Krishan, who along with Naval Kishore and Deepa Nathalia, conducted a survey in 2015 about the ecological impact of mining. The survey found that the symbiotic relationship of the villagers with the Aravallis was shattered with the advent of mining and the consequent ban on it crushed the villagers./THE TRANSFORMATION/There are around 90 villages in Gurgaon and Faridabad that are located in core Aravalli hills and another 150 in the foothills and catchment areas.

"Firecracker ban will remain, don't give it religious angle, says SC","NEW DELHI, Oct. 14 -- The Supreme Court refused on Friday to modify its order banning firecracker sales in Delhi-NCR, saying it was anguished at people giving the ruling a communal angle./On Monday, the SC reinstated its ban on the sale of firecrackers in and around New Delhi ahead of Diwali, a preemptive step aimed at preventing a toxic haze from engulfing the region like last year./""We are pained to hear when people give a communal angle. Everybody knows I am a very spiritual person but this is something different,"" said justice AK Sikri who heads the bench that issued the order. The other judge is Ashok Bhushan./The court was hearing applications filed by traders who said the order barring sale of crackers till November 1 had hurt their business. They said huge amounts of money were invested in the purchase of crackers post after the September order. However, the latest order has caused them severe financial loss./Both judges said they welcomed criticism of their order since people have a right to express./But to give it a communal angle was anguishing. Also, there was not a ban on bursting crackers nor has the court disallowed anyone from celebrating the festival./""The matter is still pending. This is an experiment which we want to try for this year. We will take a stock of the situation,"" the court said, refusing to get drawn into the argument that culturally crackers were an integral part of Diwali celebrations in India./""Our order was not influenced with history nor do we want to get into that debate.""/At one point the court was keen to clarify that crackers can be burnt till 11 pm only./However, it did not do so when the counsel for the three toddlers who asked for a modification of the September 12 order impressed upon it from doing so./An acrid smog forced authorities to close schools and ban construction activities after Diwali last November. The city of more than 20 million people struggled with its worst air pollution for two decades, shrouded in smoke from millions of fireworks lit during the festival, burning of crop residue in neighbouring states before winter, vehicle exhaust and construction dust./The court then banned the sale of firecrackers, but relaxed the restrictions on September 12 this year after a plea from fireworks manufacturers. The court said a complete ban would be a ""radical step""./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Stress leading to rise in breast cancer cases,"Gurgaon, Oct. 15 -- As October is 'breast cancer awareness' month, doctors in the city have advised residents to get regular medical consultations for early detection of the disease./This came as the city is witnessing a disturbing trend of cases of breast cancer on the rise among young women, said doctors at Civil Hospital, Gurgaon./""High levels of air pollution, changes in lifestyle and improper sleeping, eating habits contribute to a rise in breast cancer cases in the city,"" said BK Rajora, chief medical officer, Civil Hospital, Gurgaon./He also pointed out that the city is recording a rise in the number of breast cancer cases as young women are leading stressful lives./However, the doctors were of the opinion that breast cancer is curable if detected early./Only increased awareness, better lifestyle and regular screening tests such as a mammography can ensure improved survival rates./""We are now witnessing a very disturbing trend of more and more young women being diagnosed with breast cancer. Most of them are in their 30s and 40s. The prevalence of breast cancer among younger women is as high as 8% to 10%. Unfortunately, most young women tend to ignore warning signs thinking they are too young to suffer from breast cancer,"" Dr Jyoti Arora, associate director, radiology, MedantaThe Medicity, Gurgaon./Health experts also advised people to avoid irregular eating and sleeping habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, and junk and packaged food consumption. Mothers were advised to breastfeed babies to keep the disease at bay./As per the World Health Organisation (WHO) 2016 data, breast cancer accounts for 29% of all new cancer cases among women in the world./Thus, taking the data into account, the doctors recommended that women should check for symptoms of breast cancer for early detection. The symptoms include a change in the texture of nipple, pain in the breast, lump on breast or lump under the armpit. In some cases, bleeding from nipple is also reported./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Why bursting a cracker is equal to lighting 500 cigarettes at once,"PUNE, Oct. 15 -- At a time when awareness about damage done to environment from the burning of fire-crackers is taking the centre stage, a recent study shows that its is even more harmful for health. According to the study, burning a single cracker emits pollutants which equals to the burning 500cigarettes at a time./Pune-based Chest Research Foundation (CRF) reported that burning of fire-crackers during the Diwali festival in a residential society of Pune produced very high levels of gaseous air pollutants. Levels of sulphur dioxide in the ambient air reached 200-times above the safety limit suggested by the World Health Organisation./In a study conducted in November 2016 by CRF, along with Dr Rohan Shah and Dhammasagar Ujagare, postgraduate students of Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences from University of Pune, proved that the snake tablet, burnt for only nine seconds, produced the highest peak of PM 2.5 (64,500 micro g/m3)-the equivalent of smoke generated from 500 cigarettes and the 'laad', which burnt for 48 seconds, produced high PM 2.5 levels of 38,540 micro g/m3, equivalent to particulate matter emitted by 300 cigarettes.The snake, laad and pul-pul were the top three PM 2.5 producers, while the anar produced the lowest amount of PM 2.5. The anar produced the lowest levels because the smoke was measured at a height of 3 ft and a distance of 6 ft or because it had a better combustion rate, the researchers inferred./PM 2.5 are very tiny particles (less than 2.5 microns in diameter). Because of its fineness, they are more dangerous. They have the ability to accumulate in human organs and blood and the ability to reach the deeper portions of the lung, damaging it./Dr Sneha Limaye, senior scientist from CRF who supervised the study, said that,""if people ask us which are the most harmful fireworks in terms of PM 2.5 air pollution, then we can advise people to avoid burning these fire crackers. Children, in particular, burn the fulzhadi, pulpul and the snake tablet barely a foot or two away from them and in doing so, inhale a large number of smoke particles that reach deeper into their lungs.The levels of PM 2.5 were measured only when an individual firecracker was burnt, but in real terms, many people burn many firecrackers together, which means the cumulative levels of PM 2.5 could reach 'extremely high levels'. ""/According to WHO, small particulate pollution has health impacts even at very low concentrations so much so that no threshold has been identified below which no damage to health is observed. Therefore, the WHO 2005 guideline limits aimed to achieve the lowest concentrations of PM possible. WHO has a lower standard of 25 micro g/m3 for PM 2.5, however,India has set a 24-hour mean standard of 60 micro g/m3./Researchers burnt different types of crackers, each individually, five times and then collected the average reading of each in an area that simulated the front portion of a house area. Firecrackers not only release particulate matter but also other harmful gases such as nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. PM2.5 levels were measured using 'Thermo PDR 1200', USA, a light scattering photometer. All the firecrackers were kept at a distance that one would normally keep, for example, the fulzadi was kept at a distance of 1 feet, while the laad and anar were kept at a distance of 6 feet./""Burning of firecrackers cause both gaseous as well as particulate matter air pollution. Both are harmful for lungs, eyes, nose and the heart. It is time that we understand the seriousness of air pollution produced during the burning of firecrackers as the extremely high levels of air pollutants generated during the burning of firecrackers worsen asthma, allergic diseases of the eyes and nose, respiratory tract infections, pneumonias and heart attacks,"" said Dr Sundeep Salvi, the director of CRF./Name of Cracker Peak levels of PM2.5 in micro g/m3 Cumulative levels for PM2.5 micro g/m3/Snake 64500 64849/Laad of 1000 38540 47789/Pulpul 28950 34068/Fuljadi 10390 10898/Chakri 9490 10475/Anar 4860 5640./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Monday Musings: Don't let your children smoke cigarettes... or firecrackers,"India, Oct. 15 -- Taking your children to purchase firecrackers is like taking them to a cigarette shop and asking them to purchase cigarettes of their choice./No sensible parent would do that and yet, we give in to the demands for firecrackers from our innocent little darlings out of a misplaced sense of love and affection./Firecrackers are undoubtedly enjoyable and we all had our thrilling moments in our childhood. The time has now come for us to help and encourage our children to find that joy in something that is less harmful and polluting. We are already overwhelmed by pollution and carcinogenic elements on all fronts - be it in our food and water in the form of chemical flavourings and taste-enhancers in our junk foods, pesticides in our fruits and vegetables and hormones and adulterants in the milk that we force our children to consume./Why compound all of this by purchasing expensive firecrackers and then getting ourselves and our children to inhale toxic smoke? We ourselves add to the air pollution during Diwali - and the soil and water pollution from the firecracker garbage, by the hundreds of tonnes, that ultimately goes into the water bodies and landfills. It returns to us in various ways, through the things we consume. Talking of air pollution alone, we complain round-the-year of high air pollution and rising incidence of a variety of ailments, especially asthma among children, while knowing fully well that Diwali firecrackers are a contributing factor./There's little that we can do at the macro level, apart from put pressure on a government which, like all governments, is slow to act. At the individual level, however, we can take instant action by cheering the Delhi high court's severe strictures against firecrackers and voluntarily imposing a personal ban on these ugly pollutants. Imagine the joy of breathing fresh mountain air in the company of friends and family at one of the many agri-tourism farms or hilly spots around Pune, instead of suffering intense air and noise pollution from firecrackers?/The winds of change have arrived and people who are wise are doing exactly this. They escape the pressure from their children to purchase firecrackers by going on an enjoyable Diwali vacation and return fully refreshed - physically and emotionally - from that short vacation./The business and trading communities will of course take pride in bursting firecrackers by the thousands on the roads and the places where they live. They take pride in showing-off their expensive firecrackers - the best of which of course, come from China. They see the nuisance they create as a part of their tradition so it will take them a while to wake up. The rest of us can be smarter and move ahead./There is a way for all to enjoy firecrackers while fostering the community spirit of Diwali and without causing harm to anyone. Take the example of the community fireworks that are seen in the United States on the occasion of their Independence Day on the fourth of July. Entire families take their picnic baskets, sit on the lawns and enjoy the magnificent fireworks in the sky organised by the city council./The days of Indian families bursting firecrackers and creating a nuisance are clearly numbered as can be seen from declining sales and growing public sentiment against this tradition which needs to be discarded quickly. We don't want our children to smoke cigarettes or firecrackers. Happy Diwali!/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Metro Matters: Beyond tradition or commerce, public health is non-negotiable","India, Oct. 16 -- Besides its terrible traffic and spiralling crime, the pathetic air quality remains one of Delhi's biggest worries. So many were relieved when the Supreme Court banned the sale of firecrackers during this Diwali./The extent of air pollution caused by fireworks is not clear in the absence of empirical data. But no one who spent a Diwali in the national capital needs any statistics to tell how fireworks choke the city./Born and raised in Delhi, I have seen my house fill up with smoke from fireworks every Diwali. Shutting doors and windows would not help. The all-engulfing pollution was often thick enough to beat the world's worst pea-souper./After each Diwali, the agencies would release pollution data telling us how it was worse than the last. Yet, many criticised the Supreme Court order for being anti-business, anti-religion and anti-tradition./Manufacturing and sale of fireworks is a multi-crore business in India and also provides livelihood to thousands of labourers and small-time shopkeepers. It will indeed be a ""black Diwali"" for many wholesalers and retailers who will make losses on inventories./But they will not be the first ones in Delhi to make such sacrifices. Following public interest litigations against hazardous industries and vehicles, the judiciary in the early 2000s ordered the closure of polluting factories and directed all public and commercial vehicle owners to switch from diesel to Compressed Natural Gas./Delhi went without commercial transport for weeks when owners took their vehicles off the road in protest. Riots broke out as the city government shut down illegal industries./But the strong court mandate made the government enforce cleaner factory norms and shift the polluting units to industrial zones./Both private transporters and government took a financial hit, but by 2002, the Capital's CNG-run public transport became the largest such green fleet in the world. It is only in the last decade that the manic growth in the number of private vehicles reversed the benefits of the CNG switchover./Many argue that the sources of air pollution lie elsewhere and that Diwali is anyway a one-day phenomenon. Indeed, a study by IIT-Kanpur listed vehicular emissions, construction and road dust, fumes from coal-fired power plants, smoke from farm stubble burning, and urban garbage and leaf burning the main contributors to Delhi's air pollution./Ideally, Delhi should simultaneously address these factors. But that would take an administrative miracle. And every time there is an attempt to tackle one of these issues, critics point to the rest. The city folks cite stubble burning as the real problem to question the odd-and-even road space rationing. The farmers point at vehicular pollution to make light of polluting farming practices./Whataboutery does not help. Firecracker burning should stop precisely because the air is already so bad due to so many factors. Otherwise, for the suffering and susceptible, it will add insult to injury. The counter-argument is akin to telling someone who is being slow-poisoned by residual pesticides and chemicals in food round-the-year that a one-off dose of cyanide would make no difference./Fuelled by gunpowder, fireworks are the worst possible cocktail of toxins one could inhale. The metallic compounds that colour their explosions can damage the brain, lungs and hamper bone growth among children. They often contain carcinogenic or hormone-disrupting substances that can seep into soil and water, not to mention the lung-clogging smoke they release and plastic debris they scatter./One has to be suicidal to ignore the damage./The religious arguments do not cut much ice. Gunpowder was unknown to mankind for several hundreds of years after the city of Ayodhya was lit up to celebrate the homecoming of Lord Ram. Fireworks were invented in China. Like many borrowed practices, we probably adopted and made it an Indian tradition. But even China, the proud inventor, is limiting its use./According to Xinhua news agency, at least 444 cities, including 10 provincial capitals, have banned fireworks or restricted the time and place to set them off. Both Beijing and Shanghai have imposed stricter regulations on their use. As a result, their sales have tanked over the years, HT reported last week./In Delhi, the highest court had to intervene because the administration and the civil society failed in their duties. Public health is non-negotiable. We do not need a gas chamber to celebrate the festival of light./<a href=""mailto:shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com"">shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Breathe Safe: Top 3 smart air purifiers you may consider buying this Diwali,"India, Oct. 17 -- Air pollution in the Indian cities is a well-known problem. In cities such as Delhi, the problem is so severe that the Supreme Court had to ban the sale of firecrackers ahead of Diwali. Last year, the Delhi government had to shut down schools due to heavy smog, triggered by higher levels of particulate matter (also known as PM) in the air after Diwali./While people may think staying at home may prevent exposure to the high pollution outside, the reality is that the indoor pollution is a real problem which many of us tend to overlook. The indoor pollution can emanate from a variety of sources such as indoor smoke, paint fumes, varnishes, and pet dander among others./Indoor air purifiers can be really helpful in metropolitan cities such as Delhi. Since Diwali is just a few days away, investing an indoor air purifier will be a good idea, especially if you have children in your house. We have prepared a list of air purifiers that are simple to use and come with smart features. Before we hold forth, here are a few key things you need to understand about the air purifiers./What does an air purifier do?/The mechanism of an air purifier is very much similar to a water purifier. Air purifiers come with multiple filters (three in some cases) to capture particulate matter that usually consists of allergens and pollutants. The purifiers filter out these pollutants to re-circulate the clean air. Most of the air purifiers come with an air pollution indicator to show you the air quality indoors./Do you actually need one?/Air in cities such as Delhi is quite toxic, which you can yourself check the indexing websites such as aqicn.org/city/delhi/ or airquality.hindustantimes.com/. The indoor pollutants, which usually go unnoticed, can lead to a number severe health hazards such as pneumonia and heart diseases./You can read more about the health impacts in this in-depth report from the World Health Organisation. Last month, a report indicated that the exposure to indoor air pollution from burning solid fuels could increase the chances of stunting among Indian children./Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier 2/Price: Rs 8,499/The Mi Air Purifier 2, which launched last year, is still one of the most affordable and smart air purifiers available in the market right now. The purifier covers 400 square feet and comes with a real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring. It features a triple layer filter to keep PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) at bay./The Mi Air Purifier 2 comes with Wi-Fi support and can remotely be controlled by a Mi Home app (available for both Android and iOS phones). The app also allows you to monitor the air quality, humidity and temperature sensors as well as fan speed. The Mi Home app also allows you to keep a tab on the degradation of filters and notifies users when they're up for an upgrade./Honeywell AirTouch S8/Price: Rs 33,824/Honeywell is one of the most popular names in the air purifiers industry. Its Honeywell Air Touch-S8 covers 450 square feet (and rooms up to 9 feet high) and comes with a number of smart features along with high-end air filtering mechanism./The device comes with a High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter that is claimed to remove ""any microscopic pollutant and allergens above 0.3 microns including PM2.5 and pollens."" The Honeywell AirTouch S8 is Wi-Fi enabled and allows you to control via the company's application. The app provides insights such as real-time filter health indication on air quality indoors./Blueair Sense+/Price: Rs 42,499/The Blueair Sense+ air purifier covers 194 square feet of area. It comes with two filters and is capable of capturing ""99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 microns in size."" It also comes with motion sensors and can be controlled via the company's Blueair friend app. The Wi-Fi enabled air purifier provides insights on the air quality and allows users to remotely control the device. With sound levels between 29-50 db (A), the air purifier works pretty silently./If you don't want a smart feature in your air purifier, you can consider the Honeywell Air Touch I8 and A5 air purifiers. There are a few Do it Yourself (DIY) air purifiers available online that start at as low as Rs 4,000, but we are not really sure about their effectiveness./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Revealed: Which area in Pune most polluted this Diwali,"India, Oct. 18 -- Air pollution in Pune this Diwali is expected to be lower as compared to last year according to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's (IITM) System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar). The highest pollution is likely to be registered in Katraj over the next three days, followed by Shivajinagar, Hadapsar and Lohegaon. Manjri on the city outskirts, will be the least polluted./Scientists have forecast higher levels of particulate matter during October 19 - 21 when bursting of firecrackers will be at its peak./The highest level of PM 10 (particles less than 10 microns) and PM 2.5 (particles less than 2.5 microns) are expected between 11 pm to 3 am on the nights of October 19 and October 20./Safar recently released air quality forecast for Diwali 2017 for the period October 19 - 22. According to meteorologists, the continuing presence of the monsoon in Pune region is expected to work in favour of the city's air quality as compared to the period during last year's Diwali./Scientists at Safar have pointed out that winds in Pune are generally in a south-westerly direction, but around Diwali the winds are mostly in a north-easterly direction./Safar has predicted a drop in minimum temperature by 2 degrees Celcius as compared to previous days and the weather will be partly cloudy during Diwali./A combination of several weather parameters play a role in controlling air pollution. Although air quality is expected to be better this Diwali, particulate matter in the air is likely to increase, Safar has noted./City-based heat specialist Dr Sanjay Gaikwad told Hindustan Times that even when the air quality is moderate, people with lung or heart disease, and children in general, are likely to have some breathing discomfort. If the air quality drops to 'poor' levels there would be a rise in respiratory symptoms in children and senior citizens./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Diesel genset banned, Badarpur thermal power plant shut as Delhi air turns 'very poor'","New Delhi, Oct. 18 -- The Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) on Tuesday implemented a series of measures, such as imposing a ban on diesel generator sets and temporarily shutting down the Badarpur thermal power plant, to curb pollution levels in the national capital region during the winter./The Supreme Court-mandated panel warned that further steps, including effecting a fourfold hike in parking fees and shutting down polluting industries, will be implemented if the air quality degrades from 'very poor' to 'severe' in the coming days. ""Hopefully, the city won't witness such severe pollution levels this time. Otherwise, we will have no alternative but to shut down everything from vehicles to schools - bringing the entire city to a standstill,"" said Sunita Narain, EPCA member and director of the Centre for Science and Environment./These measures are part of a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) that came into force from Tuesday to address air pollution concerns in the national capital and its surrounding areas.

"Gurgaon air quality worsens, respiratory illnesses on the rise","Gurgaon, Oct. 18 -- City-based hospitals have reported a spike in the number of patients complaining of respiratory diseases over the last week, coinciding with the dip in air quality./Experts said that the number of cases is expected to increase after Diwali./Doctors said that the increase in the suspended particulate matter (PM), especially PM 2.5, is causing difficulty for residents. PM 2.5 consists of sulphate, ammonia, nitrates, black carbon, mineral dust and sodium chloride, making it difficult for residents to breathe in oxygen./The PM 2.5 levels have also increased over the last week. The level of PM 2.5 on Wednesday was 123.98 microg/m3, an increase from 104.65 microg/m3 on Tuesday and 98.45 microg/m3 on Monday. The safe threshold for PM 2.5 is 60 microg/m3./The city's air quality index on Wednesday was 265, which worsened from the reading of 248 on Tuesday and 200 on Monday./According to studies conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), open burning of solid waste and bursting of crackers emits pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which can settle in the lungs and worsen asthma and other respiratory problems./""More than 60% of the patients visiting the hospital are suffering from respiratory diseases.

Ec(h)o-friendly Diwali | Anatomy of a cracker: A toxic affair,"Chandigarh, Oct. 18 -- The glitz and glitter of the festive season hide its dark underbelly, which is manifested in various ailments caused by the polluted air, noisy surroundings, and toxic waste./Every year, crackers burnt on Diwali release a massive amount of pollutants in a short time. A cracker is generally made by tightly packing potassium, carbon nitrate and sulfur in several layers of paper. In the beginning, the aim was to create a loud bang, but increasingly crackers also emit a large number of colours. While it is difficult not to admire the riot of colours in the sky, the toxins emitted in the air are harmful for the lungs./Prafulla Chandra, a senior research fellow at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, says Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), when inhaled in high concentration, damages the lung tissues and triggers respiratory ailments./In 2016, the ambient concentration of SO2 on Diwali night (a 12-hour average from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am) was 118 ug m-3 , which was 23 times higher than the concentrations observed on the pre Diwali night./Prafulla further warned that SO2 also causes irritation in the nose and mouth as it can form aggressive sulphur containing acids on reacting with moist surfaces inside the body leading to the destruction of the tissues./In 2016, the ambient concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) on Diwali night was as high as 1100 ugm-3 , which was five times higher than the concentrations observed on the pre -Diwali night. Particulate matter consists of tiny particles in the air that cause the air to appear hazy and reduce visibility./The smaller the particles, the deeper they can penetrate into the respiratory system and the more hazardous they are to breathe. Particulate matter was declared as Class 1 cancer-causing agent (carcinogen) in 2013 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). PM2.5 particles cause lung irritation, aggravate chronic lung diseases, and cause changes in blood chemistry resulting in clots and cardiovascular diseases./What doctors say/The annual light and sound festival can have quite an adverse impact on your health. Whether it manifests in the form of respiratory diseases, eye infections, or burns, doctors across hospitals in the tricity witness a sudden surge in the number of patients flocking to them./Dr A K Janmeja, head of pulmonary medicine, GMCH, Sector 32, told HT, ""The rise in air pollution during this period leads to a stark increase in respiratory problems among people, especially those suffering from asthma, bronchitis or other allergies.""/He added that the inflammation caused due to poor air quality makes it doubly difficult for people battling respiratory disorders./The hospitals also see an increase in the number of accidents caused due to unruly traffic and choked roads, which prompt commuters to throw rules to the winds./""Every year, we see a surge in the number of accident cases around Diwali,"" said Dr Janmeja, adding that doctors work round the clock on the D-day to treat patients suffering from the side-effects of this festival./Older people are more susceptible to flu or pneumonia during this period. Eye-related injuries and burns are commonplace among patients across all government and private hospitals during Diwali./But while the Diwali air may not be healthy, the festive cheer does wonders for patients. Dr B S Chavan, head of psychiatry department, GMCH 32, said he had noticed a decline in mental health ailments and stress-related issues during this period./""People are usually happy during such festivals as they get to spend time with their loved ones. Even if there are minor concerns, they overlook them to join in the festivities""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Beware of inviting acid rains to our courtyards on Diwali night,"Patna, Oct. 19 -- Do you know how the Pharaoh's serpent- the firework in the form of a tablet- after being lit swells to produce snake like substance that could make you sick./Once you inhale such fumes, it may cause disturbing symptoms forcing you to an early appointment with your doctor./'Indeed, it is so', say experts. They warn the festival is better enjoyed without use of fireworks made of chemicals./If the noted chemistry scholar and former pro vice chancellor of Patna University RK Verma is to be believed, Pharaoh's serpent contains mercury thiocyanate, that is more hazardous than gun powder that has become a global concern today./Another more hazardous firework is those producing green lights contain barium, while those of other colours have sulphur, potassium nitrate and charcoal. Verma said, the emissions from fireworks dispersed in humid atmosphere causes acid rains./As the entire state capital becomes illuminated with Diwali lights symbolising the festival, the increasing and unmindful use of fireworks are causing great concern to environmentalists and medical experts./Referring to the findings of an ongoing research work under her supervision, Preety Sinha, head of environmental science at AN College, Patna, said the modern practice of lighting paraffin wax candles at Diwali was least known cause of air pollution as it releases toxic benzene. Coming in contact with other obnoxious gases from bursting crackers, benzene leads to sharp chemical changes, resulting in toxicity of the air./She said an hour long burning of paraffin, that too inside the house,especially corridors and less ventilated spaces, prove more toxic. ""It is like unwillingly and unmindfully inviting acid rains into our courtyards"", she said./Preety also mentioned a recent research by 48 scientists of different countries, which is published in the medical journal ' Lancet,' which recorded Patna among the most polluted cities in the world./' Even the state pollution control board recorded 685.97microgram / cubic metre of respiratory suspended particulate (RSPM) matters in Patna last Diwali against the standard 100 RSPM' she said./Air and noise pollution during this festival brings more people to medical clinics and hospitals./Dr Vikas Singh, consultant intervention cardiologist at Daksh Heart Care said, "" On Diwali nights and the following days,we get frantic calls from people with heart diseases complaining of aggravation of their ailment.

Flop or not? Twitter debates SC ban on sale of firecrackers as Delhi pollution soars,"India, Oct. 20 -- Delhi-NCR woke up to the annual sight of smog a day after Diwali. And it set off a Twitter debate about the efficacy of Supreme Court's ban on sale of firecrackers in the region./While there were reports of a quieter Diwali, many users said the top court's ban on sale of firecrackers proved futile because it didn't stop people from bursting crackers. ""It's totally flop now..continuously people r bursting more crackers than previous year... (sic),"" wrote Bharatendu Prakash on Thursday./Allegations of SC 'targeting' Hindu festivals resurfaced on social media, claiming the judiciary had lost ""respect"" with its ruling. Others tweeted that they burst crackers just to protest against the ban./The debate was countered with the hashtag #breathe, with people lamenting that Delhi residents didn't realise the impact of air pollution. Journalist Sagarika Ghost tweeted: ""Disappointed to report crackers are back with a vengeance. There goes my peaceful neighbourhood. Clearly we prefer to choke than #breathe.""/The Supreme Court had earlier this month reinstated its ban on the sale of firecrackers to prevent the toxic haze that engulfs Delhi and neighbouring areas annually during the onset of winter. Air quality too worsens around Diwali and the dense smog is often attributed to pollution from firecrackers, burning of crops in Punjab and Haryana and vehicular emissions./Did people actually burst more crackers?/Despite the ban, online indicators of the pollution monitoring stations in Delhi recorded 'very poor' air quality as the level of pollutants rose sharply from around 7pm on Thursday./However, this year's pollution level of 319 was also the lowest since 2015, with the Air Quality Index recorded as 431 or 'severe' on the day of Diwali in 2016. AQI was 343 during the Hindu festival a year before./Although it is difficult to quantify the immediate effect of the ban on firecrackers, residents across the national capital reported less noise pollution smoke till about 6pm, compared to the previous years./Check real-time air quality in your city:?/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Of these, Clock Tower and Nehru Colony witnessed a significant decline in levels of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) - fine pollutant particles suspended in the air that are considered hazardous for respiration - as compared to last year's Diwali./While RSPM levels at Clock Tower fell from 240 microgram per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 166.17 ug/m3 from last Diwali, at Nehru Colony, the figures saw a dip from 369.9 to 273.44 ug/m3 as compared to the last year's festival--celebrated on October 30, 2016. Of the three places, the RSPM levels exhibited a slight jump only at Raipur Road from 253.12 to 267.78 ug/m3./""As per our data analysis, the air quality showed an overall improvement as compared to last Diwali. Last year, people of Doon woke up to a lot of smog (caused by air pollution) a day after Diwali, but this time, the atmosphere was quite clear (on Friday),"" said SS Rana, regional officer at UEPPCB./What is still a matter of concern is that the pollution level was still above the standard limit of RSPM, which is 100 ug/m3 for 24 hours./Officials, however, said the RSPM levels ""even otherwise remained higher round the year"", with the daily average fluctuating above the standard levels./The air quality data for the other two parameters--sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen- also recorded a decline from last Diwali's figures and remained ""well within control"" vis-a-vis the standard limit for both, which is 80 ug/m3 for 24 hours./Noise pollution levels recorded by the UEPPCB at 12 locations across the city also witnessed a decline in at least seven of those places./Environment campaigners, who ran a series of campaigns appealing residents to celebrate a cracker-free Diwali, welcomed the development with ""cautious optimism""./""This (improvement from last Diwali) is indeed a positive sign, though we believe that we (residents) can still do a lot better to further bring down the pollution levels of the city,"" said Abhijay Negi, founding president of Making A Difference-by Being the Difference, a city-based green activist group./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution a giant killer, and not just in the air. Watch out for toxins in water, soil too","India, Oct. 21 -- Air, water, chemical and soil pollution cause 9 million deaths a year globally - making it a bigger killer than obesity (4 million), alcohol (2.3 million) and road accidents (1.4 million) combined, reported The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, on Friday./In India alone, pollution kills 2.5 million people each year, air toxins in indoor and outdoor air causing 1.81 million of the deaths, the Commission reported./While rising air pollution levels in rapidly growing cities like Delhi and Beijing routinely grab headlines, what's less discussed is that 98% of urban areas with a population of more than 100,000 in developing countries do not meet the World Health Organisation's limit for particulate matter (PM) pollution of 10 ug/m3 of ambient air. That puts the health of almost everyone in urban India at risk from poor air quality./Slow poison/How exactly does pollution kill you? Pollution has seeped into the environment at all levels, contaminating air, water and soil from toxins produced by industry, mining, electricity generation, mechanised agriculture, vehicular emissions and pesticide use, among others./In 2015, more than one in seven deaths worldwide were caused by pollution, which caused 21% of all deaths from heart disease, 23% of deaths from stroke, 51% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 43% of lung cancer deaths./Cities are the worst affected as they are home to 55% of the world's population and account for 85% of its economic activity, which pushes up population density, energy use, construction, traffic and garbage generated, all of which add to exposure./This means you/Half of India's population lives in critically polluted areas that have noxious levels of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and lung-clogging PM smaller than 2.5 if/m3. Apart from triggering asthma, wheezing and allergies, air pollution causes lung diseases, heart disease, stroke and cancers./Air pollution also raises infections risk. Inhaled sulfuric acid paralyses the lungs' mucociliary clearance system that, in a healthy person, traps particulates and pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi) and moves them towards the mouth, where they are coughed out or swallowed to lower infection./Since children breathe faster than adults per unit of body weight and are more physically active, they inhale contaminants in higher amounts. Children are also more likely to breathe through their mouths, which raises the amount of pollutants they inhale because particulates bypass preliminary filtration in the nasal passages./Chemical assault/Chemical pollution is a rapidly growing problem, with its effect on human health both poorly defined and underestimated./In India, the deaths of 32 farmers from pesticide poisoning in Yavatmal and adjoining districts of Maharashtra have made headlines over the past few months./More than 140,000 new chemicals and pesticides have been synthesised since 1950, of which the 5,000 produced the most are widely dispersed in the environment. Less than half of them have been tested for safety and toxicity, which leads to environment degradation, disease and deaths./While the world struggles to lower use of chemicals and pesticides like lead, asbestos, DDT, PCBs and ozone-destroying CFCs, newer synthetic chemicals such as synthetic herbicides, pharmaceutical waste and nano particles, among others, are entering the market with little pre-market evaluation, contaminating air, soil and groundwater with heavy metals and chemicals./One of the chemical contaminants extensively studied is lead, which is found in batteries, some paint, leaded fuel, solder, waste incinerators and smelters. Lead toxicity causes hypertension, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke and neuro-development problems and cognitive impairment in children./Workplace hazards/Toxins such as lead and other heavy metals, chemicals and electronic waste contaminate soil, air and groundwater, with risk rising in developing countries that have become dumping grounds for electronic and chemical waste./Some of the better known occupational diseases from sustained exposure to toxins are bladder cancer among dye workers, coal-workers pneumoconiosis, silicosis in stone cutters and construction workers, leukaemia and lymphomas in people exposed to benzene, and asbestosis, lung cancer and other malignancies in workers exposed to asbestos./Regulation has helped prevent occupational exposure in developed countries, and India needs to do the same to lower work-related risks to health, especially in small-scale businesses in the informal sector that offer no protective gear or health insurance cover to the millions who might literally be working themselves to death./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Monday Musings: When tradition becomes a noose around your neck,"India, Oct. 22 -- Bursting firecrackers during Diwali is a part of Indian tradition, and this tradition has now become a noose around our neck. It's time to discard unsustainable traditions and find healthier ways of celebrating Diwali./The situation is already quite grim. Despite the Supreme Court's ban on the sale of firecrackers in the national capital region, there was no stopping people from buying and bursting firecrackers with gay abandon. The Supreme Court banned the sale of firecrackers in the national capital during Diwali but that did not come in the way one bit: Whatever you wanted was easily available and once again, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) dropped alarmingly to ""severe"" levels./In Pune, the AQI was marginally better than the 2016 figures, but the noise pollution levels were clearly higher than last year. Chennai, Mumbai and Hyderabad also saw high pollution levels./Because Diwali is the nation's biggest festival and bursting firecrackers a part of the tradition, neither parents nor the government participated in campaigns to discourage children from bursting firecrackers. This was evident from two observations: All the fireworks purchases were done by adults themselves- not by children. Second, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was completely silent on the high degree of pollution caused by fireworks. The only special initiative that this Abhiyan announced was the sweeping of the streets and a cleanliness drive after Diwali ""to make the market area, establishment, shops and housing colonies litter free""./What is one to do in such a situation?/The Indian firecracker industry is the second largest in the world, after, of course, the Chinese, and an estimated Rs.6,000 crore worth of firecrackers are sold every Diwali. Nearly 90% of these are manufactured in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu. Cheaper Chinese imports have been eating into the Indian market and an estimated Rs.1,500 crore of firecrackers that are sold, are of Chinese-make./With rising purchasing power, the sale of firecrackers will also rise, which means more air pollution, noise pollution, and nuisance in the Diwalis up ahead./Sooner than later, the government will have to swallow the bitter pill and take appropriate action. If you don't want plastic carry bags of less than 50 microns from polluting the environment, you need to focus your energies on banning their manufacture, and not waste time in banning their sale. If the manufacturing of these bags is stopped, the question of their sales wont arise in the first place./Likewise with firecrackers. Unless systematic steps are taken to ban an entire range of firecrackers that cause air and noise pollution, the problem will only worsen year after year./Other strategies would also be needed, such as a high-pitched campaign to discourage purchase of firecrackers and encourage children to stay away from them would be in order. Two - three hours of community display of fireworks as is done in the United States and other countries on special occasions, should be organised to replace individual bursting of crackers./Instead of spending time at home suffering the noise and air pollution caused by fireworks, people can spend time in malls, watching movies in an air-conditioned environment./A still smarter thing to do is to go on a short vacation in the hills and the countryside- far away from the unhealthy smoke and smog enveloped cities that we call our home./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

We are inhaling a cocktail of toxins,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 23 -- The residents of Delhi and the national capital region are used to bursting crackers from Dhanteras onwards. But it didn't happen this year. Did the ban on the sale of crackers diminish their fervour? Have the people become conscientious? Rather than wrestle with these questions, I chose to be relieved. But the peace and tranquillity didn't last for long. The noise fest that began at 9 pm on Diwali continued well after midnight. All kinds of crackers were burst - those which could be heard from a distance and those that spread the maximum pollution. A few people had turned the ban into a question of religious identity./I don't understand it how can the people of a country of nature worshippers praise anything that harms the environment? Apart from the damage crackers inflict on environment, why are people blind to the distress they cause to infants, the elderly and the ailing?/The agony caused on the night of Diwali was alleviated to an extent by the numbers which arrived the next afternoon. The air quality index of the next morning, which had touched 445 last year stopped at 340 this year. The Supreme Court's decision has provided temporary relief. But a lot still needs to be done. Delhi and the areas around it are getting choked. Why do those advocating this forget that the Capital's lungs are already running out of breath?/To gauge how alarming the conditions have become, consider this. Studies by Delhi's Patel Chest Institute, AIIMS and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital indicates that lung cancer is spreading fast among the Capital's youth. Earlier, 90% of those who suffered from the disease were addicted to smoking and the remaining 10% got it because of other reasons. Compared to the past many more people between 30 years and 45 years are getting affected. One of the biggest reasons for this is the increase in the number of noxious chemicals in the air. The real problem isn't limited to air pollution alone. We are twisting the laws of nature in many ways. This is having an adverse effect on the planet and its inhabitants./Let me share a personal experience . On Dussehra I was in Haridwar with my family. In this period the cleaning of the Ganga canal is suspended so that the festival of Diwali can flow without hindrances. We were surprised to see dozens of diyas immersed in a stream that is becoming extinct. A few people were doing acrobatics in the depleted stream under the garb of having a holy bath. Those throwing diyas and garlands were unaware that a few metres downstream, the objects of their faith will be deposited on the dried bottom of the canal and would have to be disposed of by a municipality truck generally used to carry garbage./From Gangotri to Ganga Sagar, this is the unfortunate manner in which lakhs of people abuse 'Mother Ganga.' Plastic bags, articles of clothing, garlands and other assorted objects are flung into the river to pollute this cradle of civilisation. The length of the canal around Har Ki Pauri is just six kilometres. So, it is possible to clean it. But it is impossible to clean the 2,525-km expanse from Gangotri to Ganga Sagar. Therefore it is becoming shallower, say researchers with a tinge of sadness. If you really want to witness the decline of this great river, visit Allahabad. Here you can see two distinct faces of the Ganga: One before the Sangam and the other after it. In the areas of the city the Ganga passes through before meeting the Yamuna, it resembles a narrow stream. Having left the great ghats behind, this river regains power by encompassing the Yamuna within it. Such a miraculous fact! The Yamuna lends life to the Chambal and the Ganga infuses life into the Yamuna. I'd like to ask those who engage in intellectual debates why they don't pick up a shovel and volunteer to clean up these rivers that are turning shallow every passing day? These are the rivers responsible for north India's greenery. Do any of us like the idea of staying in a desert?/Bhajans derived from film songs were blaring at Haridwar's ashrams. A fast-drying river and on top of it this noise was something we couldn't tolerate. So, we returned just in a day. Haridwar isn't the only city experiencing such apathy. In Bhimtal you wake up not to the chirping of birds but the sound of the azaan. Whether it is crackers, cleaning up rivers or sound pollution, our intellectuals have chosen to pursue the path of misleading people rather than enlightening them./Deepawali is the festival which celebrates the triumph of truth over falsehoods./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pune's Brown Leaf initiative saves 5,000 gunny bags of dry leaves from getting burnt, uses them as compost","India, Oct. 23 -- Burning dry leaves is banned in many countries as it leads to air pollution. It is a health hazard as the smoke contains number of toxic particles and gases, according to environmentalists. However, it is a common site in Pune./Post Diwali, the roads are strewn with dried leaves and fire cracker wrappers. Also, between November and March, trees shed leaves and a large quantity is found burnt on the roadside as it seems like the easiest option for Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) staff refusing to pick up the garden waste./According to experts, burning of dry leaves generate large amount of particulates that can reach lung tissues and cause coughing, wheezing, chest pain, shortness of breath and long-term respiratory problems. For people suffering from asthma or other breathing disorders, leaf burning is extremely hazardous./To prevent this burning of leaves, Aditi Deodhar, a software consultant, came up with an idea - the Brown Leaf initiative in 2016. ""The idea is to prevent burning and dumping of dry leaves and provide ecologically-friendly alternatives and this is where Brown Leaf comes in as a platform for nature-friendly solutions to manage dry leaves,"" said Deodhar./The group started in a small way, with a single vision - not a single dry leaf should be burnt. It has now expanded through social media and personal messaging that recently an app was launched./""We collect a lot of brown leaves in a tempo per pit and when ever it is full, usually I keep it for composting and offer it to whoever wants it. The Brown Leaf is a good initiative, connecting both - user and giver - thus excess leaves can be utilised,"" said Mangesh Dighe, environment officer (Enivronment Cell), PMC./The Brown Leaf WhatsApp group was created for exchange of dry leaves, a facility for donors and takers to communicate with each other. But, rapidly the group grew into an active, idea sharing, vibrant community. Expert gardeners from the group started sharing advice and pictures from their gardens. Many members started composting and gardening, said members part of the group./These budding gardeners (including Aditi) began seeking guidance from experts. ""This idea exchange was new to me, something I had not expected when I started the group. But, I realised this exchange was necessary since dry leaves in themselves cannot be the topic, until it leads to composting, mulching and eventually gardening. Also, these discussions helped change the mind set that perceives dry leaves as waste. This was something amazing happening on the group,"" said Deodhar./Members tried it out and provided feedback. In October-end, the final version will be out on Google Playstore for all to download. The current version, too, is available on the playstore, but it is in test mode only. From November, the app will take over the exchange of dry leaves and groups will continue as a discussion forum, a thinktank./Dr Sejal Sheth, dentist by profession and an ardent gardener living Shaniwar Peth, said she has a terrace garden where she uses Brown Leaf initiative and has transformed her garden. ""I heard about Aditi and her initiative when I visited Suchitra Diwan's terrace garden and was amazed at what just using dry leaves could do. It is the most natural way of gardening and her garden was in full bloom. I love gardening and use to plant saplings in flowerpots, but after learning about organic, natural way of using dry leaves, I shifted to planting my shrubs, plants in beds created with bricks and using only dry leaves; I saw my trees grow healthy.""/Hemal Vachhani, a teacher, said, ""I will be delighted to use the app, as I am a regular user of brown leaves. I have a big campus and a garden in Millennium School.""/Even societies are trying their hand at using the dry leaf initiative. Manmohan society in Karvenagar, makes compost using only dry leaves. They do not burn a single leaf or throw it out, instead are supplying much-needed nutrients to soil. According to the resident, last year they harvested 20 tonnes of compost and earned profit of Rs.25,000 on that harvest and they are doing it successfully for the last seven years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How weather conditions are helping Delhi breathe easier this year,"India, Oct. 24 -- The national capital could breathe easier this year as a post-Diwali toxic haze cleared up much faster than it did in 2015 and 2016 because of favourable weather conditions and preemptive steps to reduce air pollution, experts said./The city of more than 20 million people suffered its worst smog in nearly two decades after Diwali last year and it took at least 26 days for the air quality to improve from ""severe"" to ""poor""./This transition from ""severe"" to ""poor"" had taken five days in 2015 but the relief was short-lived because the air quality turned ""very poor"" 24 hours later, and stayed in that zone for nearly 18 days./This year, the Delhi air improved to ""poor"" in three days after Diwali, going from 403 on Friday to 300 on Monday. Experts predict that the conditions might only get better this week./A key factor that has worked for Delhi is a favourable wind that blew away the filth in the air./The wind direction changed from southeasterly to northwesterly on Sunday, reducing maximum relative humidity from around 99% to around 90%, bringing down the moisture that sticks to pollutants. The speed picked up pace, too - from around 1kpmh on Friday to around 8kmph on Sunday./In 2016, the wind speed had dropped to 1kmph a day after Diwali and an anti-cyclonic circulation kept pollutants trapped./""The air quality in October hardly remains in 'moderate' or 'satisfactory' zones. This means, if we have returned to the 'poor' zone we are breathing somewhat clean air,"" said a Delhi Pollution Control Committee official./The Capital normally struggles with air pollution from October as it gets shrouded in a haze from burning of paddy stalks in neighbouring states, vehicle exhaust, construction dust, and smoke from millions of fireworks lit during the festival of lights./What helped the city this year, in addition to the weather, were a court ban on the sale of firecrackers, implementation of a graded response action plan, and a crackdown on burning of crop residue in neighbouring states helped cut pollution, experts said./The Punjab government has already imposed fines of Rs.15.99 lakhs for stubble burning in 2017. Last year, fines of only around Rs.6 lakh were collected in the entire season. ""The laxity was mainly because of the assembly elections in the state. With barely months to go for the polls, the government didn't want to antagonise farmers,"" alleged an environment official./The ban on firecrackers, too, made a huge difference, according to experts./""As the supply of firecrackers was cut off, the bursting was restricted to just one day, and that too for a few hours. It could have been worse had the ban not been enforced,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution control board sets up teams to check open waste burning,"Gurgaon, Oct. 24 -- The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Monday formed two teams to check waste burning in the city. Burning of waste in the open has often been blamed for rising air pollution levels in Gurgaon and the move is aimed at curbing the practice./The move is of significance at a time when the city's air quality index (AQI) has registered a sudden upward shift. The air quality index shot up to 315 on Tuesday, a significant increase from Monday's reading of 243./Following up on its pledge to crack down on the practice, officials of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) have been conducting searches to curb burning of waste in the open. However, owing to the increase in the number of complaints, the pollution department, too, has stepped in. The department said it received as many as 10 such complaints over the last three days./The step was initiated after the pollution department received a number of complaints regarding waste burning in the city. The team has been authorised to impose a fine of up to Rs.5,000 on anyone found burning garbage in the open./""We have received complaints on waste burning from sectors 31, 22, 23, Golf Course Extension Road and other areas of the city. It is one of the major contributing factors to the deteriorating air quality of the city,"" JB Sharma, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB)./The two teams will be monitoring the city's green spaces which are often found littered with horticulture waste. In their complaint to the pollution department, the residents claimed that the horticulture waste is set on fire after being dumped./According to data released by the HSPCB, open burning of solid waste releases pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) and dioxins or furans, which amps up air pollution levels./Residents claimed they have trouble breathing due to the rise in the level of pollutants in the air./""We have even stopped going out for morning and evening walks. It is difficult to breathe clean air these days,"" Komal Narang, a resident of Sector 50, said./Vandana Kalra, a resident of South City 1, said, ""We are inhaling smoke. While the city's air is turning more toxic by the day, some people continue to set fire to horticulture waste in green spaces. Despite awareness campaigns, the practice continues unabated. This is a major concern.""/The air quality index is an indicator of air pollution from three major pollutants - NO2, PM 10 and PM 2.5. The index rates the air quality as 'good' if the reading is in the range of 0-100, 'moderate' if in the range of 101-200 and poor for '201-300'./The index for individual pollutants at a monitoring location is calculated as per its 24-hour average concentration value (8-hour cycle in case of CO and Ozone) and health breakpoint concentration range./All pollutants cannot be monitored at all locations. Overall AQI is calculated only if data of a minimum of three pollutants is available./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"As air quality dips, pvt institutes set up gear to track pollutants","Gurgaon, Oct. 25 -- Owing to the growing air pollution in the city, some private entities have volunteered to track air pollutants in the city with a view to provide support to the pollution board. They have already installed their apparatus to assess pollution levels./DLF has installed four air quality monitors in Gurgaon, while Amity University has also set up a laboratory on its campus./Air pollution has been a major concern, as residents suffer from respiratory illness. The four stations have been installed between DLF phase 1 to DLF 5 to monitor the pollutants in the air and identify trends that lead to higher pollution in certain areas. It will also help in understanding localised impact and the cause of pollution. These stations can measure PM 2.5 along with temperature, humidity and transmit real-time data through the cloud, claimed the DLF officials./""Equipped with highly advanced technology, these monitors will assess the air quality throughout the day,"" said Col. Prakash Tewari, executive director, DLF Foundation./Air pollution has become a big concern in the city, as residents have been afflicted with diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and even lung cancer because of the presence of pollutants in the city air./As per a World Health Organisation (WHO) report, outdoor air pollution is considered the fifth largest killer in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking and poor nutrition./It was stated that around 6,20,000 deaths take place in India every year from air pollution-related diseases./The city has only one air quality monitoring centre, which isn't enough to monitor and assess the pollution level. There has been a demand from residents to install more air monitoring systems across the city. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, ""There is an urgent need for more air quality monitoring stations in Gurgaon.""/Despite the Supreme Court's ban on the sale of crackers this Diwali, air quality in Gurgaon deteriorated by five times on the festive night./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Residents from several societies, including Vatika City, Ireo Grand Arch, Nirvana Country, Bestech Park View, Palm View Apartments and Sector 57, will take part in the protest./The participants said that this would not be a one-off protest, but will spark off a campaign that will continue till such time the government announces measures to reduce air pollution. This aim is to highlight the harmful effects of dust and smoke from rampant construction in violation of laws and guidelines and widespread burning of waste in the open, said a group of parents./Residents said that steps should be taken to keep all construction materials covered in a bid to avoid dust pollution. They accused suppliers of selling sand and other construction materials in the open, near residential areas./""The social media is full of posts by mothers extremely concerned about their children's health. It is even more distressing to see the increase in the number of kids and adults with breathing difficulties. Studies reveal that kids in Delhi-NCR have weaker lung capacity. The authorities have to wake up and take drastic measures to address the situation. We, as citizens, also have certain responsibilities and contributions to make in this regard. The government, citizens and corporates have to come together and work out a sustainable solution to this problem. We only seem to wake up to this problem when it hits us hard,"" Neela Kaushik, founder of Gurgaon Moms, a social media group, said./Residents said they doubt if the authorities would ever come up with sustainable solutions to such issues, as they even lack the intent to provide basic infrastructure and implement policies./""We seek to draw the attention of the chief minister to our plight. Due to lack of infrastructure support and policy enforcement, the city is not only sinking into civic mess but the air quality is also taking a turn for the worse due to the high levels of dust and smoke from the burning of solid waste in the open. We need a commitment from the CM to make Gurgaon a sustainable city and treat public health as his government's top priority,"" Ruchika Sethi Takkar, a social activist, said./""I am a mother of two children aged 7 and 3 and am aware of the kind of damage being wrought on them by the city's toxic air. Their lungs have black spots and will turn into those of a smoker by the time they are teens. Their lungs capacity is 25-30% less than what it should be. Their cognitive function and arteries are being damaged. It fills me with helpless rage to see them suffer this way. Fixing the city's air is beyond me,"" Sherebanu Frosh, a resident of Summit Apartments, DLF 5, said./Concerned parents who have been making regular visits to paediatricians said that the doctors have advised them to leave areas having high levels of dust pollution. ""If we see the data over the last ten years, it (pollution) has increased from 3-4% to 30-40%. Toddlers and infants are on nebulisers.

City grapples with toxic air,"Lucknow, Nov. 6 -- Toxic air continues to trouble Lucknowites, particularly those living or regularly moving through Indira Nagar and Charbagh, says the ambient air quality report released by CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research on Sunday./Vehicular traffic is the main source of particulate air pollution, says the IITR report./Against the standard permissible limit of 60 microgrammes per cubic metre of air prescribed by national ambient air quality standard, Indira Nagar recorded the average value of 97.7 during the post monsoon air quality survey conducted by IITR while Charbagh recorded 127.6. If the World Health Organisation's standards are to be considered, the permissible limit is just 25./PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter which has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres that is about 3% the diameter of a human hair. ""Such particles can enter the human body with breath and settle to cause damage to vital organs,"" said Prof AA Mahdi, vice chancellor of Era University and an expert in lead poisoning./This is the situation when the sale of new vehicles has recorded a fall of 3% . In 2015-16, the rise in number of new vehicles was 9% . This year it has been 6%. Presently, there are 19,78,345 registered vehicles in Lucknow./This study was carried out during September-October, 2017 (Diwali period not considered) to investigate the status of air quality by monitoring and assessment of some selected air pollutants, namely respirable particulate matter (RSPM or PM10), Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and noise level at nine locations./""Air pollution can lead to several direct problems such as respiratory disorders and indirectly it can cause cardiovascular diseases and can increase trigger rate for asthma and skin and eye allergies,"" said Prof Rajiv Garg, senior faculty, department of pulmonary diseases, at the KGMU./The sources of air pollutants in urban areas include tail pipe emission from vehicles, industrial operation, burning of solid waste, urban kitchen waste and re-suspension of soil . Due to change of technologies as well as fuel consumption patterns, the composition ratio of each pollutant is also changing over time. Vehicular traffic was the main source of particulate air pollution in Lucknow city, said the report./""There is an urgent need to look in to the issue of pollution as more and more people are coming from other cities and Lucknow is expanding gradually. Presently Lucknow is 310 sq kms,"" said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Healthcity hospital./RESPIRABLE SUSPENDED PARTICULATE MATTER/In residential areas, (Aliganj, Vikas Nagar, Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar), the 24-hours average concentration of PM10 was in the range of 169.3 to 212.3 microgrammes per cubic metre of air with an average of 192. In commercial areas (Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk), the average concentration of PM10 was in the range of 187.6 to 211.4 microgrammes per cubic metre of air with an average of 199.6 respectively./In industrial area (Amausi), the average concentration of PM10 was 203.1./Maximum 24 hours mean concentration of PM10 was observed in Indira Nagar (212.3 microgrammes per cubic metre of air) in residential area and Charbagh (211.4) in commercial area. Overall, at all the locations, mean values of PM10 were above the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 100 for industrial, residential, rural and other areas./In all the locations in residential areas, higher values were found as compared to the previous year, except Indira Nagar. Among the commercial areas, PM10 values were also found to be higher than the previous year except Chowk and an industrial area, which showed lower value over the last year./SULPHUR DIOXIDE (SO2)/In residential areas (Aliganj, Vikas Nagar, Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar), the mean levels of SO2 were in the range of 12.8 to 14.6 with an average of 13.0. In commercial areas (Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk), the average concentrations of SO2 were in the range of 11.5 to 18.6 with an average of 14.2. In industrial area (Amausi) the average concentration of SO2 was 14.7. All the values of SO2 were well below the prescribed NAAQS of 80 for all the locations./NITROGEN DIOXIDES (NO2)/In residential areas (Aliganj, Vikas Nagar, Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar) the 24-hour average concentration of NO2 was found in the range of 38.2 to 58.9 with an average of 46.7. In commercial areas (Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk) the average concentration of NO2 was found in the range of 40.9 to 71.1 with an average of 56.6. In industrial areas (Amausi) the average concentration was 41.3./All the values of NO2 were within the prescribed NAAQS of 80 for all the monitoring locations except one commercial location (Charbagh)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Most-polluted city: Gzb to shut 8 factories, spray water on dusty roads","Ghaziabad, Nov. 6 -- The pollution level in Ghaziabad has yet again surged to alarming heights, making the city the most polluted city in the country./The air quality index (AQI) of the Central Pollution Control Board puts Ghaziabad's air quality at 441 on Monday, putting it in the 'severe' category. The AQI was 439 on Sunday./Taking into account the severity of the situation, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari on Monday said her administration has identified 20 major roads where dust pollution is high, thereby shooting up the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM 10 levels./""Multiple departments have been directed to carry out water sprinkling on such roads. The measures will be implemented at the earliest and will be in force for a week. We have also identified nearly eight units which are causing pollution and these will be shut,"" she said./Officials said water sprinkling will be done by different departments and also by agencies taking up works on any of the 20 identified roads. The district magistrate will hold a review meeting on Wednesday./When the air quality drops to the 'severe' category, it means the pollutants are so high that it will 'affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases'. With winter almost here, smoggy conditions have started persisting t in open areas./On October 30 and 31 too, the city's AQI had breached the 400 mark, making Ghaziabad the most polluted among 40 and 42 cities, respectively, across the country./Recently, divisional commissioner Dr Prabhat Kumar had told Hindustan Times that the 'graded action response plan' (GRAP) should be implemented at the local level./However, the authorities are yet to decide upon a full scale plan and have directed certain measures to be taken up on an urgent basis./""We held a meeting of different departments on Monday and another is scheduled for Wednesday. Various agencies such as the Ghaziabad development authority, the municipal corporation and different municipal councils have been directed to immediately ensure that all under-construction areas are covered and to impose penalties on those not complying with the guidelines,"" said Maheshwari./The directions by the National Green Tribunal regarding the measures to be taken up on construction sites were issued in April 2015./The air pollution in Ghaziabad is compounded by several factors - pollutants from industrial areas, vehicles and construction sites./The officials are yet to act on the recent Supreme Court order banning the use of petroleum coke and furnace oil in industrial units. The regional pollution control board had identified 137 such units but have recommended the closure of only one unit./Ghaziabad has 15 industrial areas and houses nearly 2400 units registered under the Factories Act. The city also has a registered base of 8.9 lakh vehicles and this does not take into the thousands that use the major highways running through the city./Another major problem is garbage burning on which the municipal corporation has started levying penalties./The officials said the 300 metric tonne capacity waste to manure plant in Pratap Vihar has started operations but on 'low scale'. The plant had come up at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore but could not resume full scale operations until now./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi air pollution: Panel orders cut in Metro fare, 4-fold hike in parking fee","India, Nov. 7 -- The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution and Control Authority (Epca) on Tuesday ordered a four-time hike in parking fee and a cut in Metro fare in a series of emergency measures, as Delhi's air pollution spiked to severe level./The Epca also asked governments of Delhi and neighbouring states to prepare for road rationing, better known as odd-even scheme, if pollution levels touch the emergency threshold. The parking fee hike will apply to NCR towns as well./Under the graded response action plan mandated by the Supreme Court for tackling air pollution, emergency is declared when the Air Quality Index (AQI) shoots beyond 500. On Tuesday 4.30pm, AQI was at 436./""Delhi and all state governments in NCR to immediately intensify public transport service by ensuring there are more buses on roads. Metro should immediately increase its frequency, add more coaches and lower fares during off-peak hours,"" the Epca said./Announcing these measures, the Epca said the Capital was facing a ""crisis situation"", which was likely to persist for the next few days./""We are not expecting a dramatic change in the next two-three days. Shallow fog is preventing the dissipation of pollutants at the ground level,"" Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) member secretary A Sudhakhar said./Smoke-laden air from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana and moisture-heavy winds from the eastern region had combined with local pollutants to envelope the city in a toxic haze, he said./They expected paddy stubble burning to come down by November 10 but it was unlikely before November 15, the CPCB member said./Farmers burn paddy residue in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana to clear their fields for the wheat crop to be sown in coming weeks./Though the national green tribunal has banned the burning and governments have imposed fines, farmers say they have no alternative but to set fire to the waste./Epca chairman Bhure Lal and member Sunita Narain also said brick kilns, hot-mix plants and stone crushers would remain shut across the region till further notice./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Breathing uneasy: Delhi to Surat, air is toxic in many Indian cities","New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- Delhi is taking emergency measures to control the impact of ""severe"" air pollution on Tuesday, but India's major cities are not breathing easy either./Half of the world's 20 most polluted cities were in India, said the World Health Organization in a 2016 report. Indian government data and independent studies, too, say Indian cities are breathing bad air./A Greenpeace India report released in January this year said data from state pollution control boards showed ""there are virtually no places in India complying with WHO and National Ambient Air Quality (NAAQ standards, and most cities are critically polluted.""/""Except for a few places in southern India which complied with NAAQ standards, the entire country is experiencing a public health crisis due to high air pollution levels,"" it said./Pollution is routinely measured on the basis of particulate matter (PM), which is the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air many of which are hazardous. Two particle sizes are widely monitored: PM10 and PM2.5./Delhi topped the list of PM 10 level and it was followed closely by Ghaziabad, Allahabad, and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh; Faridabad in Haryana; Jharia in Jharkhand, Alwar in Rajasthan; Ranchi, Kusunda and Bastacola in Jharkhand; and Patna in Bihar. PM can cause lung cancer, strokes and heart disease over the long term, as well as triggering symptoms such as heart attacks./""Air pollution is a national public health crisis as almost none of the cities have bothered to keep air pollution in check, making them unlivable. We are facing an apocalypse right now due to unbreathable air,"" Greenpeace India quoted its campaigner, Sunil Dahiya, as saying./A Hindustan Times analysis of the Central Pollution Control Board's data since 2002 showed that all major cities in north and central India, including Gwalior, Kanpur, Ludhiana and Surat, recorded higher pollution rise in percentage terms between 2002 and 2014 compared to Delhi./These cities had lower baseline pollution load than Delhi and rise in air pollution had been a recent phenomenon unlike Delhi, where the first spurt was noticed in early 1990s./The 2016 WHO report put Delhi as the 11th most polluted city, but smaller towns had galloped past the national capital. Gwalior and Allahabad took the second and third spot, respectively. Zabol in Iran was the world's most polluted city in 2016./The report considered annual average concentration of the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in 3,000 cities from 103 countries. Delhi's data is from 2013 and that for most Indian cities are from 2012./The report - the Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database - showed India's upcoming towns and cities were grappling with toxic air, possibly because of limited government intervention and increasing vehicular congestion./India's pollution watchdog data for the past 15 years shows mounting air pollution in smaller cities such as Gwalior, Allahabad, Kanpur, Jodhpur, Ludhiana and Bhopal has outpaced that in big metro cities./Uttar Pradesh had four of the world's 20 most polluted cities. Other than Allahabad, the other UP cities in the top 20 were Kanpur (15), Firozabad (17) and Lucknow (18)./Bihar's capital Patna was sixth, Chhattisgarh's capital Raipur seventh, Punjab towns of Ludhiana and Khanna were 12th and 16th respectively. Uttar Pradesh had the largest number of polluted cities followed by Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi govt told to shut schools, discourage outdoor activities as air pollution turns 'severe'","New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has urged Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to declare a public health emergency in the national capital due to high pollution levels./IMA president Dr KK Aggarwal asked people to stay indoors and recommended the closure of schools. ""Schools should be shut, odd-even should start, and people should refrain from walking in parks because particulate matter 10 is around 1,000 today. Usually, a count of 400 is enough to make a healthy person feel breathless,"" he said./As children breathe faster than adults per unit of body weight, they end up inhaling a higher amount of contaminants and damage still-developing airways, lungs and immune system. They are also more likely to breathe through their mouths, which increases the amount of pollutants inhaled because it bypasses the preliminary filtration system in nasal passages./By midday on Tuesday, almost all stations across Delhi were showing air quality in the 'severe' range (Air Quality Index: 400-500), which is the most hazardous. Air quality this poor affects not just people with existing medical problems but also those who are healthy./Air pollutants trigger allergies, cough, viral fever, lung infections, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety, tiredness, diabetes, heart disease and irreversible lung damage. ""The health advisory for the air quality index prescribes minimal outdoor exposure at times of high pollution,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director at the Centre for Science and Environment. ""Curtailing outdoor sports in such bad conditions is standard practice across the world.""/Significantly, Delhi Half Marathon title sponsor Airtel has also hinted that it may stop associating with the event from next year if the ""authorities"" refrained from addressing the issue of air pollution in the Capital. ""Air pollution poses serious health risks, and it is important that these concerns are addressed urgently and appropriately by the authorities for Airtel to continue associating with the event next year and beyond,"" the telecom major said in a statement./Though the IMA has called for the cancellation of the November 19 race due to high air pollution levels, organisers Procam International termed the demand as ""shortsighted"" and said they have the support of international athletes./Meanwhile, clinics across the city registered an increase in people complaining of severe wheezing, breathing difficulties and chest constriction typically associated with acute asthma and chronic bronchitis since Monday. ""Apart from respiratory distress, sustained exposure to air pollutants such as sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter lowers immunity and raises the risk of viral and bacterial infections,"" said Dr RK Singhal, director, department of medicine, BLK Super Speciality Hospital./Dr Srikanth Sharma, senior consultant at Moolchand Hospital's department of medicine, advised Delhiites to roll up the windows when travelling in vehicles and use air masks when heading out in the morning. ""As pollution levels peak due to the cold, one must also avoid strenuous physical activity that may strain the lungs in the morning and evening,"" he added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Experts are divided over what to call Delhi's haze,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 -- The National Capital Region is going through the year's worst spell of air pollution - worse than the post-Diwali haze that engulfed the city. But most experts stopped short of terming the phenomenon as ""smog"" because they said smoke - the primary ingredient of smog - was still missing. However, a senior official of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) insisted this was smog./What is the difference between fog and mist?/Fog and mist are formed when water vapour in the air condenses. During condensation, molecules of water vapour combine to form tiny water droplets that hang in the air. ""The only difference between fog and mist is that during fog visibility is reduced to less than one kilometre, and during mist it is more than one kilometre,"" said a senior officer of the regional meteorological department./On Tuesday the visibility at IGI Airport had dropped to around 200m around 5.30am./Was it smog then?/Experts said that smog is combination of smoke and fog.

For smoke, presence of gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) in high doses in the air is a must,"" said D Saha head of the air quality laboratory at Central Pollution Control Board./The levels of SO2 have dropped over the past few months in Delhi for several reasons such as witching over to clean fuels, shutting down of power plants, banning of furnace oil and pet coke.

Delhi air pollution: Is it smog or fog? Opinions differ,"India, Nov. 8 -- The National Capital Region is going through this year's worst spell of air pollution - even worse than the post-Diwali haze that engulfed the city. Most experts stopped short of terming the phenomenon as ""smog"" because they said smoke - the primary ingredient of smog - was still missing. However, a senior official of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) differed, and said that this was indeed smog./What is the difference between fog and mist?/Fog and mist are formed when water vapour in the air condenses.

The main sources are burning of fossil fuels and industries,"" said SN Tripathi, coordinator of the Centre for Environmental Science & Engineering at IIT Kanpur./But experts said that as their primary sources such as polluting industrial units, diesel generators and power plants have been cut down recently, chances are less that SO2 would build up again./Opinions differ/A senior official from DPCC, however, insisted that it was smog and not a simple fog as other experts claim.

"Burning eyes, choking lungs: Here's what Delhi looks like as air pollution rises","India, Nov. 8 -- A thick blanket of haze hung low over Delhi for the second day on Tuesday, as air quality levels deteriorated further and visibility plunged./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) identified four reasons for the sudden onset of pollution. Temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and atmospheric boundary layer had worsened Delhi's air, CPCB experts said. Conditions are unlikely to improve over the next few days, they said./""Meteorological conditions were such that all the local pollutants got trapped and lingered in the air. These four parameters had a direct impact on the pollution,"" said D Saha, head of the air quality laboratory of CPCB./Wednesday became the coldest of the season so far with minimum temperature at 14 degree Celsius. Tuesday was the second-coldest day of the season with the temperature dropping to 16.1 degrees Celsius./On Monday afternoon, when temperature was around 30 degrees Celsius, PM2.5 level was just twice the permissible limit. But at 5am on Tuesday, when the temperature dropped to around 16.1 degrees, the PM2.5 level shot up by 9-10 times the permissible limit./Another key reason for the haze in the capital is poor wind speed. While Delhi needs a minimum wind speed of 5 m/s to disperse trapped pollutants, the wind speed dropped to less than 1 m/s between 4am and 5am on Tuesday. The levels of PM2.5 were at least 10-15 times the permissible limit during this hour at stations such as DTU, Mathura Road and Delhi University's North Campus./""The condition was aggravated by north-westerly winds, which are bringing in smoke from the stubble burning regions of Punjab and Haryana. The south-easterly winds are helping the moisture to build up. We apprehend that similar conditions would prevail over the next two to three days,"" said A Sudhakar, member secretary of CPCB./The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) also plays a key role in determining the level of pollution. ABL forms the ceiling within which air circulates and Air quality improves when the height of ABL is more and pollution rises when it is low./Pollution also increases as relative humidity builds up because high moisture helps to trap air and retain more pollutants. Over the past few days, easterly winds increased the moisture in Delhi's air. In morning hours, when humidity was at its peak, pollution shot up./CPCB data shows humidity level was at its peak between 3am and 8am on Tuesday. During these hours, PM2.5 levels shot up by more than 10 times in almost all stations across Delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) considers a reading of above 100 as unhealthy./In Haryana, schools will open an hour late at 9am from Wednesday, as pollution is typically high in early morning hours and pollutants disperse once the sun comes out./All schools, private and government, would follow a 9am-3.30pm schedule till November 30, the state government said./The decision came a few hours after the Haryana government and those of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh were pulled up by the national green tribunal (NGT)./""The ambient air quality is so bad that children are not able to breathe properly. Why did you not spray water using helicopters as per our direction?"" NGT chairperson justice Swantaner Kumar said, asking the states to come back on Thursday with a plan./Four people were killed when a Punjab Roadways bus collided with a truck on the FerozepurFazilka road while another 11 were hurt after the driver of their bus failed to see a truck parked on a highway and crashed into it./Four people were injured in a pile-up on the Rohtak-Bhiwani road./Visibility was poor the night before as well./Dense fog also was reported from Agra, Meerut and Aligarh in western Uttar Pradesh delaying trains./Delays were also reported from Punjab and Haryana./The fog also hit flight operations on the busy ChandigarhDelhi route, already hobbled due to the shutdown of one of the runways at the Capital's international airport./Of the 12 flights, seven will remain cancelled for three days. Normal operations will resume on Friday./In Amritsar, six flights failed to land due to poor visibility./Experts blamed high moisture content and toxic smoke from the burning of paddy stubble ahead of the new planting season for the spike in air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution in the National Capital Region hit 70 times the World Health Organisation's safe level on Wednesday, prompting doctors to issue a public health emergency./Though the Haryana government had directed all schools across the state to change their timings to 9am-3.30pm till November 30, it hasn't passed an order telling schools to temporarily close operations./On Wednesday, denizens woke up to thicker smog as the air quality index (AQI), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), jumped to 459 for Gurgaon, against Monday's 368.

The health impacts of breathing this air may be experienced even during light physical activity./The independent decision comes in the backdrop of the Delhi government directing all schools to stay closed till Sunday./""We will comply with the changed timing from Thursday (November 9).
