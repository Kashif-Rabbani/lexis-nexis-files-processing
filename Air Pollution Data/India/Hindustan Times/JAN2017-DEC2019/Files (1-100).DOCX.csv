Gzb highrise society surrounded by stink,"GHAZIABAD, Jan. 1 -- Divyansh Pratham society in Ahinsa Khand 2, Indirapuram, is situated on the CISF Link Road in the vicinity of garbage dumps, a liquors hopandan open defecation area. According to residents, despite complaining to the district administration and other authorities, no action has been taken to solve the many problems arising out of its location. The society was established in 2013 by a private builder and has a total of 219 flats. It is located near Kanavani police post and is nearly 100 metres away from Delhi Public School, Indirapuram. Parents dropping of their children to school every morning have also complained of the poor sanitation condition around the CISF Link Road near the high rise society. Daily commuters also have to bear the smoke emanating from garbage burning that takes place in the area often and the stink from open defecation in vacant plots near the link road./OPEN DEFECATION/Residents complained that due to lackofpublictoiletsinthecity, the vacant plot adjacent to their society is used for open defecation during morning and evening by people without access to toilets. ""Our society's boundary wall is used by people for defecation, which gives rise to a nauseating smell. We are unable to take a walk across the society or even open our windows because of this,"" said Sneh Kumar Tyagi, president, Divyansh Pratham Apartment Owner's Association (AOA). Residents also met the district magistrate on November 8 to discuss the issue. However, according to them, no step has been taken in this regard so far. ""We will soon plan a proposal to get temporary toilets in the city, which will hopefully resolve the issue,"" said Nidhi Kesarwani, district magistrate, Ghaziabad./LIQUOR SHOP/A liquor shop located adjacent to the society has been another major cause of concern for the residents. ""We are afraid to step out of the society after sunset as cars line up outside with people drinking inside their vehicles. Drunken brawls are common. Such activities are illegal, but still continue brazenly even though the Kanavani police post is barely a few hundred metres away,"" said Vandana Sinha, secretary, Divyansh Pratham AOA. According to the police, however, regular drives are conducted to curb such activities in the area. ""We keep patrolling the area to keep an eye on people who drink in open spaces. We have taken action against such people many times in the past one month itself,"" said BR Zaidi, station house officer (SHO), Indirapuram police station./OPEN GARBAGE DUMPS/Residents complained of open garbage dumps and garbage burning adjacent to their society, which causes air pollution. ""Garbage is scattered around our society. Garbage burning is also rampant, which not only leads to a very bad smell, but is also becoming a health hazard due to pollution,"" said Mehboob Mehar, vice president, Divyansh Pratham AOA. Many commuters passing through the CISF Link Road have also complained of the smoke from garbage burning stinking and causing chest congestion. ""Every day, when I cross the CISF Link Road to drop my daughter to school, smoke from the burning garbage forces me to slow down my vehicle. It makes my eyes watery and the visibility also drops due to thick smoke. It is a regular affair during early morning,""Ritwik Mishra, a commuter and resident of Sector 5, Vasundhara. YN Choudhary, enforcement in-charge, Ghaziabad development authority (GDA), said, ""We will identify the spots and immediately take action against garbage burning. If we find anyone burning garbage, they will be penalised.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Noida & Ghaziabad.

Delhi needs strong steps to free its traffic and air,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 2 -- Has the sea of idling vehicles on Delhi's roads started to look like an ocean lately? Has the waiting time at every intersection stretched to two or more signal cycles? As we spent more and more time trapped behind the wheel last year, statisticians have revealed some scary facts about Delhi's traffic./The government data released last week showed that the number of vehicles registered in Delhi increased from 8.8 million in 2014-15 to 9.7 million in 2015-16 - a spike of 9.93% and the highest in eight years./On December 15, HT wrote about a study by six road design experts stating that the time spent by Delhi commuters on city roads has doubled in the last six years and the speed of traffic during peak hours has been cut by half. Today, a person travelling 40km by a private vehicle during peak hours spends an average of 3.43 hours on the road, up from 1.36 hours in 2011, the researchers found./This ocean of vehicles hasn't just choked the roads. It is asphyxiating the national capital. In 2015, as many as 6,502 persons died of respiratory diseases, the second biggest cause of death after the unspecified ""others"" category in government records./Didn't we see it coming? Yes, we did. And we looked away./Fighting congestion is not about convenience. ""It is a fight to ensure the city can fulfil its most basic function of bringing people together,"" wrote Harvard economist Edward Glaeser in his book ""Triumph of the City"". But for Delhi, getting an efficient public transport has always been low on priority./Mumbai's suburban rail that dates to 1853 is as old as the Railways in India. Kolkata got the metro in 1984. Delhi had to wait till 2002. The autos were never reliable and the city never had a system of flagging down taxis. Understandably, people found alternatives in private vehicles. And once they acquired them, not many were willing to switch back to public transport./The result is that even with the country's most extensive road network, Delhi has run out of space for its ever-growing fleet. It points to the disaster that is transport planning./It is not that the authorities don't know what is to do be done. The ideas are there. Some have even been implemented in fits and starts, but only to be given up just too soon./The odd-even car restrictions were enforced to fight pollution for two weeks last January. But now, even as the Supreme Court has approved the graded response system to city's air pollution problem, asking for road rationing to be enforced every time it hits the ""severe"" level, the government is dragging its feet./The government also introduced its car-free-day programme in October 2015. Promised to be a regular feature, the move fizzled out too soon. As in the case of oddeven road rationing, the authorities couldn't sustain the drive for the want of effective public transport./With just 4,121 buses, the bus fleet size today is at a sixyear low. The Delhi government says it tried thrice to buy buses in the past two years but could not find suppliers. The June 2016 audit by the CAG blamed it on ""frequent changes in the proposals, cancellation of tenders and retendering""./To popularise bus travel, the government is planning to slash fares by 75% in the coming months. But discounts cannot get enough private vehicle owners to switch to DTC buses if the service does not ensure better coverage, frequency and punctuality. The DTC also needs to install display boards showing routes and timetables, something promised when the city hosted Commonwealth Games in 2010./Similarly, the Metro needs to fix last-mile connectivity to ensure optimal utilisation of its network that will expand considerably by end of 2017. Besides, road pricing and congestion taxes have been on the agenda for a long time now. But before enforcing punitive measures, authorities must provide practical options./Bolstering public transport as a realistic alternative demands substantial investment. Restraining movement of Delhi's nearly ten million private vehicles requires political courage. With both its air and arteries almost at choking points, Delhi and its leadership can't afford to dither./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Mumbai fares better than Thane, Panvel and Navi Mumbai in air pollution survey","Mumbai, Jan. 12 -- Suspended particulate matter in air in most parts of the state were almost two times the safe limits in 2015, revealed an assessment of air pollution in Indian cities by not-for-profit Greenpeace India on Wednesday./Within Maharashtra, Nanded topped the list for poor air quality with annual concentration of PM10 (particulate matter of size less than 10 microns) at 162 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) as against the permissible limit of 60ug/m3 under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Safe limit for PM10 emissions annually by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is 20ug/m3./Exposure to high levels of PM10 - they are solid and liquid particles, including dust and chemicals, floating in the air - leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and premature death./Locations such as Panvel, Taloja, Navi Mumbai and Thane recorded higher annual PM10 levels than Mumbai that ranked number 10 at 107ug/m3. A study by the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay last year attributed high particulate matter in Mumbai to power plant (37%), open burning (24%), commercial food sector (18%) and road transport (10%)./In addition, all locations in 25 cities of Maharashtra were highly polluted between the months of October and January with PM10 levels exceeding 150ug/m3 - that's nearly three times the safe limits./""Pollution levels in Maharahtra are relatively less than other parts of the country, but still at very dangerous levels going by NAAQS and WHO standards. Hence it's not safe to breathe in many parts of Maharashtra,"" said Sunil Dahiya, campaigner, Greenpeace India, adding that fossil fuel burning is one of the main culprits for the deteriorating air quality in India./Dahiya added that difference in pollution levels is also because some parts of Maharashtra such as Mumbai is near to coast.

Air pollution: Piecemeal solutions won't end a problem that's hurting India's economy,"India, Jan. 12 -- When a toxic haze descended on Delhi even before the sparkle of Diwali's fireworks faded last November, it sparked off a flurry of long-delayed government activity. Daily meetings were convened, power stations shut down and road sweeping ordered. The smog lifted after a week, and with it, the semblance of official concern vanished about a chronic problem that is not only killing thousands but also shaving crores off India's economy./A recent Greenpeace study reported that air pollution killed 1.2 million Indians annually and none of the 168 cities surveyed complied with global air quality norms. About 3% of the country's GDP is lost because of air pollution, the study added. This might be an understatement. An OECD report last year said the macroeconomic effects of pollution - loss in labour productivity, slowing agriculture, mounting health costs, and welfare costs of illness and morbidity - tend to multiply over time and hurt the economy. Additionally, people don't want to move to places with toxic air and businesses suffer because the poor quality of life deters investors./The World Bank said in September that about 8.5% of the country's GDP in 2013 was lost to air pollution - indicating bad air was enough to offset the growth rate. An Economist article said lower air pollution in Los Angeles, for example, would have seen a service sector productivity boost by an astonishing $374 million. Imagine, then, the impact of cleaner air on a national economy. Warning signs of this magnitude should have triggered a nationwide alarm, the kind that saw the UK Clean Air Act passed in 1956 after the great London smog killed 12,000 people./But the response has either been nationalist - remember the outrage when New York Times' Gardiner Harris left Delhi blaming the air quality - or disdainful, as evidenced by the government's frequent dismissal of reports./Whenever there has been any action, it has been sporadic and focused on big cities. But such an approach neglects the fact that air cannot be cleaned piecemeal and needs deep policy intervention. In Delhi, the odd-even scheme failed to make an impact because the city's transport system remained inadequate, the bus network broken and last-mile connectivity missing. This encouraged people to purchase more vehicles, driving up emissions. Industrial pollution cannot be tackled without national standards, strict implementation and monitoring agencies with teeth. Garbage burning cannot stop without a radical overhaul of how cities generate and segregate waste and pollution from mines will continue in the absence of a new policy./A problem such as multi-state stubble burning - which causes pollution in Delhi - can be stopped with concerted policy efforts by the national and state governments, not by ""emergency meetings"" on a few days every winter./The focus also needs to shift away from Delhi and big metros to smaller cities, where near-absent monitoring, lax oversight and poor awareness propel pollution. Nine of the 10 most-polluted cities on the Greenpeace list aren't metros and will probably not get any attention. The time for quick fixes is over./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurgaon air quality slips to 'very poor',"Gurgaon, Jan. 12 -- The air quality in Gurgaon slipped from moderate to very poor on Thursday. Experts said a dip in temperature and low wind speed caused the sudden rise in pollutants in the atmosphere./The particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was six times higher than the prescribed standard. It was 376 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m(3)) on Thursday and 259 (ug/m(3)) on Wednesday. The permissible limit of PM 2.5 is 60 ug/m(3)./Carbon Monoxide was 24.20 mg/m(3) on Thursday compared to a permissible limit of 4.00 mg/m(3)./According to the data from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), the pollution level has remained above permissible limits since Diwali./""As the wind speed has reduced from 18 km/hour on Wednesday to 6.3 km/hour on Thursday, the pollutants are trapped in the atmosphere,"" Bhupender Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said./As the temperature dips, wood burning also increase in the region and it is one of the reasons for the rise in the level of PM 2.5, Singh said./PM2.5 is suspended particulate matter 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter and a major component of air pollution. As it is very fine, it can settle in the lungs and worsen asthma and other respiratory problems./Doctors have advised residents, especially children, elderly and asthma patients to stay indoors as the pollutants in the air have rose to levels dangerous to them. The condition has led to a significant rise in respiratory illnesses among residents./""We have seen a significant increase in people reporting respiratory problems this week. In fact, our figures suggest a 50% rise in people reporting breathing related illnesses since the first week of January. Common complaints include cough, runny nose, wheezing and breathlessness. While common cold and flu are frequent in winter, vulnerable people -- children, the elderly and those with existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and bronchitis -- are reporting major problems,"" Dr Piyush Goel, MD, consultant pulmonology, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon, said./It has been noticed that people living in areas near congested traffic zones and highways are the most badly affected, doctors said./""Apart from respiratory illnesses, a few cases of stroke, angina and heart attack that we believe were triggered by exposure to extreme cold and polluted air have been reported,"" Goel said./Dr. Neeraj Gupta, senior consultant, Pulmonology, Paras hospitals Gurgaon, said, ""Long term exposure to fine particulate matter may be associated with increased rate of chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease. People with breathing difficulty and heart problem, and children and the elderly may be particularly sensitive to the rise in PM2.5 level that damages pulmonary macrophage which are helpful in both innate and adoptive immunity.""/BOX--- Preventive measures/--- Remain indoors, close all windows and doors and if going outside, wear a qualified mask and minimize the duration or intensity of outdoor activities./---- Sensitive populations (the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiopulmonary problems) should be more cautious of PM2.5 pollution and minimize outdoor PM2.5 exposure./---- Patients with chronic cardiopulmonary problems should increase their medication dosage and pay close attention to their health to prevent severity of their symptoms during an increase in smog./---- As oxidative stress is one of the main pathogenic mechanisms of PM2.5, taking antioxidant supplements or nutritious food (for example, w-3 fatty acids in fish oil)./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Our wellness depends on how we reinvent and run Delhi,"India, Jan. 16 -- What is killing our citizens? Not so long ago, epidemics such as cholera and plague could depopulate cities. Now, heart diseases are the biggest killers./Ischemic heart disease, a condition where the arteries contract and prevent blood and oxygen from reaching the heart causing a cardiac attack, will cause the maximum number of deaths in 2017, predicted an analysis in UN Dispatch last week. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that even in 2030, it will remain the world's deadliest disease./Its risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, smoking, excessive alcohol intake and depression. Many of these conditions are triggered not only by how we live but also where we live./Badly planned cities also expose its people to severe health risks. Urban living and its increased pressures of mass marketing, availability of unhealthy food choices and accessibility to automation and transport - all have an effect on lifestyle and health, says WHO./Delhi is an example. The municipal records show that heart diseases, diabetes and digestive problems are responsible for more than 20% deaths in the national capital./These diseases are assuming a rather democratic pattern. While infectious and parasitic diseases due to bad sanitation and no access to clean water still kill 15% residents, mostly in city's slums, a survey by the Directorate of Health Services in 2011 found that at least 20% of the 100,000 slum dwellers screened were suffering from hypertension and 10% from diabetes./For a city to be considered healthy, its citizens must enjoy equal access to clean water and air, sanitation, and good healthcare. But haphazard urbanisation denies citizens these basic rights. Large urban sprawls contribute to a city's ill-health, says the 2016 Global report on Urban Health by WHO and UN Habitat. In the absence of density, access to public transport, hospitals, schools, businesses, parks and planned public spaces for certain communities can be infrequent or non-existent./In Delhi, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities are not equally distributed. The Delhi government is trying to address the primary health care needs through mohalla clinics. But most emergency services and specialised hospitals are concentrated in certain districts. The NCR towns are pretty much in private hands./The global report also points out that in compact cities, intra-urban distances tend to be shorter - the things people require and the places people need to access are close by. This reduces time spent in a vehicle and lowers travel costs. The lower cost of transport can substantially help low- and middle-income households. Decreased transit time often reduces exposure to pollution and also boosts mental health./The Marchetti's constant, developed by Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti, states that anything beyond a 60-minute commute stresses one out. Delhi drivers have long surpassed this limit. According to IBM's 2011 Commuter Pain Index, 70% respondents in Delhi said traffic increased their stress levels, upped their anger, and negatively affected their performance at work or school./The rising levels of air pollution, mainly from vehicular fumes and construction dust, are suppressing our immunity, making us vulnerable to lung infections, heart attacks and cancer. In 2015, 8% deaths in Delhi were caused by respiratory ailments and 6% by cancer. A study by CSE says half of Delhi's population lives within 500 metres from arterial roads and is directly affected by vehicular pollution./Noise disturbance in Delhi is as severe as air pollution. But it remains the most underestimated threat. We absorb the din without realising that prolonged exposure to noise can boost stress hormones and contribute to cardiovascular maladies and hearing damage. At least 70% of these damaging sounds emanate from Delhi's nearly 10 million vehicles./On the other hand, unregulated compactness can constrain the housing stock and inflate real estate prices, and at the extreme, can lead to unhealthy crowding, warns the Global Health report. This is exactly what has happened in Delhi's Walled City and numerous unauthorised colonies, which are so tightly packed that they have little open space or access to fresh air./Our health or wellness often depends on how we live. Our lifestyle choices, in turn, are dictated by where we live and the options it offers. Wellness, therefore, is also an urban planning issue that demands a lot more than providing access to healthcare. It is a reflection of how we plan, reinvent and run our cities. As always, prevention is better than cure./<a href=""mailto:shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com"">shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurgaon authorities unprepared for implementing odd-even scheme,"Gurgaon, Jan. 17 -- The district administration is still in a fix over implementation of the odd-even road rationing scheme in Gurgaon to reduce pollution in the absence of adequate public transportation in the city./Even as the Centre has directed states with poor air quality to take adequate action against agents contributing to air pollution, the district administration says it is not fully prepared for it./The Centre issued a notification on Monday for enforcing a graded response plan to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR through Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) under the Environment (Protection) Act./According to the notification, in cities where the level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is above 300 micrograms per cubic metre ( micro g/m3) and PM10 levels above 500 (micro g/m3) for two consecutive days, emergency measures are to be implemented. These measures include odd-even rationing scheme and a ban on construction activities./The air quality of Gurgaon has been marked as 'poor' since November and the PM2.5 in the city has remained above 300 micro g/m3 limit . Hence, the city will have to implement corrective measures to curb pollution./""The public transport system in Gurgaon is not adequate and implementing the odd-even scheme might create problem for commuters. However, if we get directives from the Centre, we will prepare a plan. To support the plan, we do not have adequate buses and autorickshaws,"" said Vivek Kalia, joint commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG)./Although smoke from vehicles contributes to air pollution, with no proper public transportation, implementation of the odd-even scheme will be a premature step, Kalia said./The Haryana transport department current has as many as 115 low floor buses of which 55 are air conditioned. According to the officials it is falling short to meet the growing demands by 10%./The city has 20,000 registered autos and 5,000 taxis to cater to the need of the commuters./However, the transport experts are of opinion that the city requires 50% more buses to provide adequate public transportation./Dr Sewa Ram, associate professor of transport planning in School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi said, ""Gurgaon is expanding and at present, it needs 50% more buses. The newly developing sectors are demanding public transportation. Also, there is a need for more metro stations in other parts of the city.""/Experts at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said there cannot be much improvement in air quality through road rationing unless all NCR cities implement it at the same time./""Public transport needs to be upgraded in all NCR cities and we can only see any changes if the road rationing exercise is practised on a regular basis in the region,"" Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of CSE, said./According to Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), the impact on air quality even after imposing odd-even scheme cannot be more than 2% in Gurgaon as vehicular pollution is mostly from diesel autorickshaws that are plying in the city.

Air pollution causes 95% premature deaths in Mumbai and Delhi: Study,"Mumbai, Jan. 19 -- Deaths due to air pollution in Mumbai and Delhi have doubled over the last 25 years, and together with chronic bronchitis, it accounts for 95% of premature deaths in two of India's biggest cities, found a study by the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay (IITB)./The study estimated that if exposure to fine suspended particulate matter of size less than 10 microns (PM10) prematurely killed 19, 291 people in Mumbai in 1991, the number jumped to 32,014 in 2015. In Delhi, premature mortality increased to 48,651 in 2015 from 19,716 in 1995./In Mumbai, the annual average PM10 decreased from 142 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) in 1995 to 137 ?g/m3 in 2015. In Delhi, however, it increased from 204ug/m3 in 1995 to 263 ?g/m3 in 2015. The permissible level for PM10 is 20 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3), as per the World Health Organisation./Exposure to high levels of PM10 - harmful solid and liquid particles floating in the air - leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and premature death./The cost of treating diseases caused by air pollution also doubled for people from Mumbai and Delhi in the same period - from Rs24,816 crores to Rs49, 0559 crores - that's 1.01% of India's gross domestic product./""Globally, Mumbai and Delhi are among the 20 most polluted cities, a combined result of vast urbanisation, old automobiles, outdated industrial plants, and lack of government regulation,"" said Kamal Jyoti Maji, lead investigator, Centre for Environmental Science Engineering, IIT-B./The team used epidemiology-based exposure-response function - a mathematical equation - to calculate premature mortality and morbidity rates. Estimates of mortality and morbidity cases are based on the level of exposure to concentration of particulate matter in Delhi and Mumbai./The increase in the premature mortality rates also coincides with the rise in cost of treatment for 18 diseases that are caused with exposure to elevated PM10 levels. If the annual spend is converted into Indian currency, after taking the US-India currency exchange rate as Rs 46 for a dollar in 2005, Mumbaiittes spent 70% more on medicines, doctors and hospitalisation between 1991 and 2015 - from US$ 2680.87million (Rs12,323 crores) to US$ 4269.60 million (Rs19,640 crores). In Delhi, the cost went up to more than double during the same period - US$ 2714.10 million (Rs12,484 crores) to US$ 6394.74 million (Rs29, 415 crores)./""Determining a quantitative value of air pollution-related health impacts is becoming a vital element in evaluating the economic cost. This will help pollution control authorities in Mumbai and Delhi to take decisions on cost-benefit analysis to pollution control measures,"" said Maji./READ MORE/Delhi's air pollution 'very serious' problem, find solution at the earliest, says SC/Mumbai fares better than Thane, Panvel and Navi Mumbai in air pollution survey/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurgaon residents face dust pollution as dumping of rubble goes on unchecked,"Gurgaon, Jan. 22 -- At a time when the level of air pollution continues to remain dangerously high in the city, the dumping of waste from construction and demolition sites is going unchecked across Gurgaon. The building and demolition sites throw up dust every day that contributes to rampant air pollution and the thick smog hanging over the city. With the authorities slow to act, the residents are left with little choice but to breathe the noxious air./The smog is created by a deadly cocktail of dust and chemicals in the air throwing a blanket of haze around the city and choking residents. Though the haze is a perennial problem and doesn't go away even during the summer months, it takes particularly alarming proportions in winter./Smog, say experts, is caused by a fusion of dust particles and chemical pollutants that include NOx, SO2, CO2, CO and Benzene. All these make for a toxic blend that drives the city's air quality beyond 'permissible' limits./Not just the old residents, even a large number of people who moved to Gurgaon in search of a better life have been condemned to bear the brunt of the city's worsening air quality./On a visit to most of the prominent areas of the city, HT found all the construction and demolition waste dumped on vacant plots and on the sides of roads./The areas in and around Gurgaon that continue to witness an unchecked pile-up of construction and demolition waste include Golf Course Road, Southern Peripheral Road and the Northern Peripheral Road (Dwarka Expressway), which is yet to be thrown open to the public. With the waste pile-up on the rise, a thick layer of dust has settled on most of these stretches. The arterial roads between sectors 58 and 115 are in an even more pitiable state owing to the dumping of construction waste. Even in sectors 29, 30, 44, 46 and 40, which have lately witnessed a realty boom, the air quality continues to remain a major cause for concern for residents./Residents across the city spoke in one voice on the issue of rising air pollution and laid the blame squarely on the dumping of construction and demolition waste./""This is one city in which the residents can literally feel the colossal levels of dust and debris in the air. Hence, health is a major concern for most of us,"" Rohin Dhar, of Ansal Escencia in Sector 65, said./Puneet Lamba, another Gurgaon resident, said, ""We live very close to an area where large-scale construction activities are taking place.

The plan outlines measures based on air quality - moderate to poor, very poor, severe, and severe-plus or emergency. A separate set of action plan has been suggested for each category./The top court in December last year had asked authorities to install real-time and manual pollution monitoring stations in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to check air quality for the graded response./According to the SC-approved graded action plan, the entire national capital region (NCR) will be treated as one. Authorities and experts have warned that the landlocked city's air quality cannot improve unless adequate measures are taken in the whole of NCR, which involves territories governed by neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan./A Delhi government official said the process to have 20 more fixed monitoring stations in place has started, and the tendering procedure is expected to start in February./""A bid manager has already been appointed for the tendering process. These monitoring stations will help us get a comprehensive picture of air pollution in Delhi, especially during winter, when the city's air quality worsens. We want to ensure that each Delhi district has at least three stations,"" the official told Hindustan Times./The city of about 20 million people has been struggling to clean up its air that contains a toxic cocktail of dust, smoke and gases from vehicle and factory exhausts. The condition worsens every autumn and winter as the city, buffeted by farmers burning crop stalks in neighbouring states and atmospheric changes, records higher levels of air pollution./""In a big city like Delhi, the air quality is not the same at various points. For example, Anand Vihar with high volume of vehicular traffic is one of the most polluted corners of the city while at Jor Bagh in the heart of the city the pollution levels are well under control,"" an environment department official told Hindustan Times, underlining the need for an area-wise micro monitoring of the air quality./""More monitoring stations will help us in a thorough understanding of the nature of pollution in various parts of the city,"" he said./In a meeting called by Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) on Friday, it was stated that Haryana will get 34 stations, Uttar Pradesh 16, while Rajasthan is eyeing 11 monitoring spots in the next nine months./A fixed-automatic station where air pollutants like Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), PM2.5 and PM10 are being monitored regularly, costs Rs 1.2 crore with 10% yearly operation and maintenance cost, a CPCB official said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi govt asks Centre to set up green crematoriums,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 23 -- Taking cognisance of increasing air pollution and depleting green cover in the city, the Delhi government has suggested to the Centre to promote the concept of eco-friendly crematoriums in city./In the letter written to Anil Madhav Dave, minister of state, environment, forest and climate, Delhi's environment minister, Imran Hussain has requested for constituting a technical committee for drafting a model policy for green crematoriums./Hussain said that the burning of wood, leaves and manure fouls up the air in Delhi. And crematoriums alone add considerably to air pollution./""But banning the use of wood in crematorium and switching to electric or CNG mode does not appear to be a tenable solution given that our traditions are associated to use of wood for pyres in cremations,"" Hussain wrote in the letter, adding that the only solution is to convert existing wood-based crematorium into green ones./The Delhi government has adopted measures to modify the design of traditional crematorium by putting smoke tappers. It has also assigned the task to CSIR-National Environment Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) to create designs for such non-polluting crematorium, Hussain said./He has asked the Central government to direct the Central Pollution Control Board/ various other states to implement/ adopt these measures./Reacting to the Hussain's letter, Delhi BJP's media in-charge Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the letter has been written callously without understanding the work being done by three MCDs and NGOs in the city./""The issue has been raised just to make academic record before National Green Tribunal which is seized of the matter of pollution in city. The civic bodies have already set up a Mokshdham at Nigambodh Ghat in central Delhi which brought down the need of wood for burning a dead body from 450 kg to 150 kg,"" said Kapoor./He said at traditional cremation pyres too, tin sheds with chimneys have been installed to prevent pollution. ""Rather than writing letter to centre, the Delhi Government should tell what cooperation it has extended to the Municipal Corporations or the NGOs running the cremation grounds in Delhi,"" he said further./According to an MCD official, there are 60 crematoriums which are managed by civic bodies in the city. ""Of them, the CNG facility is available at Nigambodh, Punjabi Bagh, Sarai Kale Khan and electric crematorium at Bela Road,"" said a civic agency official.

Eye in the sky: Satellite to map farm fires in Haryana and Punjab,"India, Jan. 29 -- Next generation satellite INSAT-3DR has opened new frontiers in India's weather forecasting and is set to equip the country with the ability to detect farm fires -- which intensify air pollution in the northern region seasonally, leaving Delhi gasping for breath./A team of the satellite meteorology division of India Meteorological Department (IMD), housed in New Delhi's Mausam Bhawan, has amassed a huge tranche of data relayed by it over the past few months, at an average rate of 142GB per day./Launched in September last year, INSAT-3DR works in tandem with INSAT-3D, operational since 2014, in sending raw data and high-resolution images, zoomed up to 1 kilometre near the earth's surface, every 15 minutes./Dr Sunil Peshin, who heads the division, said while storing and archiving data was itself a challenge, the IMD shares information relayed by these satellites with international agencies like the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)./Peshin said with the operationalising of INSAT-3DR, night-time monitoring of atmospheric phenomenon like cloud cover, fog, haze and snow among others had become possible./""Within the next few months, we hope to equip ourselves with the ability to detect farm fires as well which the NASA does currently. It is just a matter of developing the right tools and algorithm which will take a little time,"" he said./This assumes importance against the backdrop of the Delhi government blaming seasonal agro-residue burning in the fields of Haryana and Punjab and the subsequent emission of smoke for the city's foul air, especially during October, November./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

BUILD BARRIERS AGAINST TOP CANCER TRIGGERS,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 5 -- Cancers can be managed with treatment. Even better, many can be prevented. People who believe cancer is caused by genetic mutations and other factors beyond our control have got it wrong. Mutations in certain genes do have a strong causative role, such as harmful mutations in BCRA1 and 2, with the first raising a woman's risk of breast, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers, and BCRA2 raising ovarian cancer risk. In men, BCRA2 mutations, and to a lesser extent BCRA1 mutations, raise risk of breast and prostate cancers./Such clear causative linkages to cancer are rare. Behaviour and environmental causes well within your control have a larger role to play, and you can take protective steps against certain cancers, which together are the top five causes of all deaths in India./About 30 lakh people have cancer in India, with 11 lakh new cases and 5 lakh deaths each year. Most such deaths in India are from lung, breast, liver, cervical and lung cancers. Here is how you can protect yourself from the most common cancer triggers in India./STOP TOBACCO USE/No amount of tobacco is safe. Various forms of tobacco - smoking, chewing, snuff and secondhand smoke, areca nut or supari and betel quid or pan masala - have together made oral cancer the most common cancer in India. Between them, tobacco in its many chewing, smoking and sniffing forms accounts for 30% of all cancers in India. More men are smoking in India than ever before, with the number rising by more than a third, from 79 million in 1998 to 108 million in 2015, report researchers in BMJ Global Health./Smoking rates haven't gone up in women in India, the study found, which partly explains why lung cancer is the eighth-highest cause of cancer deaths in India, while it is the most fatal cancer for Indian men and for men and women around the world. This is remarkable given that millions of women in rural India still cook over wood and charcoal fires in poorly ventilated homes, which also increases cancer risk./GET VACCINATED/Most people don't link virus infections with cancer, but viruses such as human papillomavirus (HPV) have been proven tocause cervical cancer, while Hepatitis B and C can lead to liver cancer. There are affordable and effective vaccines that protect against HPV and Hepatitis B, but there is no vaccine against Hepatitis C./Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths among women in India, but has dropped to sixth-highest globally because several countries have started vaccinating girls against HPV. Getting vaccinated against both viruses - the Hepatitis B vaccine is part of routine immunisations in India, and HPV vaccines have been introduced in some states - can protect against cervical cancer in women and liver cancers in both genders./AVOID AIR POLLUTION/We breathe in about 10,000 litres of air each day, depending on how active we are. With each breath, we draw in life-saving oxygen, along with carcinogenic contaminants that damage the body, particularly the lungs, even when present in trace amounts./Air contaminants come mostly from the combustion of fuels for heating, cooking, power generation, industrial processes and vehicular traffic. Air is unsafe in most parts of India. In rural areas, it's burning of dung and wood in open fires that wrecks lungs, while urban hubs battle pollutants from power-generation plants and combustion engines, particularly in motor vehicles./Indoors carcinogens include tobacco smoking, building materials, and furnishings, as well as the naturally occurring carcinogen radon./Many individual components of air pollution - such as particulate matter (dust), soot, diesel exhaust, secondhand smoke, solvents, metals (titanium dioxide) and asphalt (bitumen used for road surfacing) - also make it to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs list of 481 agents and environmental factors that are carcinogenic to humans. Protect yourself by not lighting open fires, keeping cooking areas ventilated, and wearing protective masks in dusty and heavily polluted areas./WATCH WHAT YOU DRINK/Everyone who drinks doesn't develop cancer, but studies show that cancers are more common in people who drink than in those who don't./Drinking alcohol raises the risk of seven types of cancers - liver, mouth, upper throat (pharyngeal), food pipe (oesophageal), voice box (laryngeal), breast and bowel. In the body, alcohol (ethanol) gets converted into acetaldehyde, which is a toxin that damages DNA by preventing cells from repairing it and is classified as a possible carcinogen by the IARC./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pink City ranks 9th on toxicity chart,"Jaipur, Feb. 7 -- Jaipur with a population of more than one million stands at the ninth position in the list of the most polluted cities, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data revealed, raising concerns among experts. The data, tabled in parliament on Tuesday, shows a consistent increase in air pollution level in the Pink City over the last three years -- 224 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) in 2016; 171 in 2015, and 150 in 2014. ""There is a need for drastic action because some of the pollution-mapping stations in Jaipur actually have readings higher than that of even some of their counterparts in Delhi. /Air pollution adversely affects health, especially of children, elderly people and those with lung diseases,"" said Virendra Singh, former medical superintendent of SMS Hospital and director of Asthma Bhawan. ""There is an immediate need to introduce eco-friendly vehicles running on renewable energy sources,"" he added. ""A large number of vehicles in countries, such as Norway, are run by electricity. We have to incorporate such measures in Jaipur as well. At present the situation is so bad that a person has no choice but to breathe in polluted air in the city choked by frequent traffic congestions,"" Singh said. According to the CPCB data, other cities having alarming levels of air pollution include Delhi, Agra, Ranchi, and Ghaziabad. The data reveals that Allahabad having more than one million population has the highest level of air pollution -- 276 micrograms per cubic metre. Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) officials said they are working on an action plan to improve the accountability of stakeholders. ""Air pollution happens because of many factors such as burning of municipal waste, the dust rising from sweeping and also the fact that there is more presence of dust particles in the air of Jaipur because Rajasthan is a desert state. We have formulated an action plan to ensure better coordination with all these departments,"" said Vijay Singhal, chief environmental engineer, RSPCB.

Gurgaon: Pollution watchdog will frame plan to improve air quality,"Gurgaon, Feb. 7 -- The district administration on Monday asked the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to prepare a plan by this week to curb pollution in the city. The move came after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Saturday listed Gurgaon as the most polluted city among 28 cities and towns it surveyed for air quality index. /The air quality index is an indicator of the air pollution from the levels of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM 2.5. HSPCB officials are preparing the blue print of a plan to curb pollution in the city. They will discuss the plan with other city agencies such as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to reach a consensus on the measures required. ""We will prepare a list of remedial steps that can be taken immediately by the MCG, police, district administration, RTA and residents of the city,"" Bhupender Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said. He said the city needs to control vehicular pollution, dust from construction sites and waste burning. The HSPCB official said Gurgaon's poor air quality is mostly because of large-scale burning of waste in several locations, releasing toxic elements in the atmosphere. According to the CPCB, air quality worsens primarily because of burning of waste. ""......apart from PM 2.5 (fine, respirable particles) emissions, burning waste leads to release of dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, hexachlorobenzene, some of which can be carcinogenic..,"" a CBCB report said. Environmentalists also pointed out that civic agencies are not making efforts to control waste burning -- a major cause of respiratory issues. ""Open burning happens at ground level.

"By denying the link that exists between air pollution and deaths, the Centre is being myopic","India, Feb. 8 -- The winter is over and the outrage that erupted over pollution after last year's Diwali has also been overtaken by other news events. But the problem of polluted air stubbornly persists, affecting the health of the citizens. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD), a comprehensive regional and global research programme including 500 researchers representing over 300 institutions and 50 countries, has estimated that 3,283 Indians died per day due to outdoor air pollution in India in 2015, making the potential number of deaths due to outdoor air pollution in India in 2015 to 11.98 lakh. But the Union minister of environment, forests and climate change Anil Dave seems to be either unaware of the data or doesn't want to believe it. In a written reply to Rajya Sabha earlier this week, he said that there is no conclusive data to link deaths exclusively with air pollution. He added that Greenpeace India's report 'Airpocalypse,'which was released in January, is based on secondary information on air quality collected through RTI, annual reports of state pollution control boards and literature review in which it claimed that 12 lakh deaths take place due to air pollution./The Greenpeace India report had said Delhi tops the list of 20 most polluted cities in the country where 12 lakh deaths take place every year due to air pollution. It also claimed that none of the 168 cities it assessed complies with air quality standards prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). According to the report, the deaths every year in India due to air pollution are only a ""fraction less"" than that caused by tobacco usage. Three per cent of the GDP is lost due to air pollution, it added./In response to the minister, and correctly so, Greenpeace India has said that country is way past the stage of discussing what may have caused this nation-wide epidemic of poor health and compromised childhoods - instead of picking at the data, and the sources for it, government agencies need to come up with a clear, national action plan. In fact, the health evidence necessary to take policy action has already been well documented by the ministry of health and family welfare's steering committee. What is necessary, experts say, at this stage is to chart the road ahead to address what is a national issue that threatens to deflate India's demographic dividend. Instead of trashing the links between citizens' health and air pollution, the minister must invest in more comprehensive scientific studies into the phenomenon and come up with concrete and effective solutions to tackle pollution./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Anil Dave can no longer pretend that pollution doesn't kill,"India, Feb. 15 -- The bad news on the pollution front continues: India's air now rivals China's as the world's deadliest, according to a new study published on Tuesday amid warnings that efforts to curb pollution from coal won't yield results any time soon. India's poor air quality causes nearly 1.1 million premature deaths every year, almost on par with China, concluded a joint report by two US-based health research institutes. /More crucially, where deaths linked to air pollution in China have steadied in recent years, the rate has soared in India where smog readings in major cities routinely eclipse safe exposure levels. India has recorded a nearly 50% increase in premature deaths linked to PM2.5 -- fine particles that lodge deep in the lungs -- between 1990 and 2015, the report added. Pollution in New Delhi in November reached crisis levels, with crop burning, car exhaust, dust and coal plants blamed for the record smog. The government shuttered schools and temporarily closed a coal-fired power plant as a stop gap, but experts say the energy-hungry nation will need to do more if it's to clean the air for India's 1.25 billion people. India's problem is that it is --- and will remain for years to come --- a coal-based economy. This is because coal is cheap and also that renewables are not going to be expanding fast enough for the country to reverse the problem. India, however, should have expected this kind of a report, since, for a couple of years, satellite data has been showing that the average particulate matter exposure was going up in the country. As pollution travels hundreds of kilometers, experts have called for national, regional and city-level action plans with measurable targets to lower pollution levels. But for any countrywide plan, the first thing that would be needed is to acknowledge the link that exists between air pollution and health of citizens. However, that is somehow missing. In December, environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told Rajya Sabha that there is no ""credible"" study to quantify the number of deaths caused directly as a result of air pollution. ""Lung and allied diseases are affected by a number of factors such as smoking, hereditary factors, lifestyle, occupation, socio-economic status, immunity levels, medical history etc. besides air pollution,"" he added. The new report is fresh evidence for the minister to finally accept that pollution is a giant killer and we are losing the battle with every passing day./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

India's air rivals China's as deadliest in the world: Study,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 15 -- India is catching up fast with China in terms of deaths linked to foul air; and could go past its northern neighbour if pollution counter-measures stay as it is./Almost 1.1 million people died in India two years ago because of air pollution, according to the 2017 State of Global Air report by the Health Effects Institute (HEI) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at University of Washington and University of British Columbia./The alarming number is a few thousand shy of China's air-related deaths in 2015./The report - drawing from the IHME's Global Burden of Disease data and released on Tuesday - says the two Asian giants account for more than half the air pollution-related deaths globally. The primary killer is PM2.5 - micro dust particles that stick to people's lungs and air passage, causing serious health problems and even death./""Until 2010, India and China were on the same plain. But China has a comprehensive plan now that looks at both local and regional causes of pollution. In India, there is no significant policy to reduce pollution at the source level or clean up the air,"" said Sunil Dahiya, a Greenpeace India campaigner./In 2015, more than a quarter of global air-related deaths happened in India. That was slightly below China's record but could surpass the neighbour. The report suggests PM2.5 levels are rising in India, but it appears to have stabilised in China./The data show the global average annual population-weighted PM2.5 was 44 microgrammes for each cubic metre in 2015. The level in India was 74 - much higher than the threshold of 60./Experts blamed lack of proactive policies for the rising air pollution. ""Air quality is not mainstream in India. Even in our Swacch Bharat schemes...do not see air mentioned,"" said Prarthana Borah, the country director of Clean Air Asia./New Delhi, which is on a WHO list of cities with the foulest air, has been grappling with crippling air pollution, prompting the government to initiate emergency measures such as an odd-even road rationing formula for cars. On Tuesday, the PM2.5 level was recorded ""poor"" at 208 by the government monitoring agency SAFAR. Other than kneejerk reactions, long-term measures were hardly taken, experts alleged. The air pollution data call for a ""national emergency"", according to the Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mathura Road and Dhirpur becoming Delhi's new pollution hotspots,"India, Feb. 19 -- Busy bus depots, heavy traffic, unpaved roads, landfill sites and industries are a common sight at the Capital's pollution nodes. Air quality data now reveal that with such factors remaining unchecked, a number of areas could be turning into new pollution hotspots./Anand Vihar along with RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh leads the polluting list and the government is struggling to find a solution to the plight of these areas./Even as the Delhi High Court directed all agencies concerned to chalk out a traffic plan for Anand Vihar, air quality data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) show that Mathura Road and Dhirpur now require similar attention./""Residential areas are being used for commercial purposes and commercial areas are used for industrial purposes. Garbage is dumped haphazardly and burnt indiscriminately. Public roads are used for parking, causing congestion,"" said Dr Dipankar Saha, additional director and head of the Air Laboratory at the CPCB, adding that these factors are now leading to increasing number of areas in metros turning into critical pollution nodes./According to SAFAR data, Mathura Road did not have even a single ""good"" air quality day between December 1, 2016 and January 31, 2017. There was just one ""moderate"" day while the rest saw ""severe"", ""poor"" or ""very poor"" air quality. In this period of 62 days, 8% days were severe, 79% were very poor, 11% poor and 2% had moderate AQI. At Dhirpur, in the same period, 16% days were severe, 53% very poor, 10% poor, 11% moderate and 10% satisfactory in terms of air quality./In this 62-day period, across 10 monitoring stations in Delhi, 3% days were severe, 66% very poor, 24% poor, 5% moderate and 2% were satisfactory./HT visited Mathura Road and Dhirpur to find out the reason behind these extreme pollution levels./Mathura Road/Traffic congestion is the most visible issue. The monitoring station is almost 5 km away from points like Ashram Chowk and Kalindi Kunj but pollution levels here are in the red./Shubham Kumar, a 30-year-old slum dweller, says winter brings bouts of cough and cold in his family. ""Things have got bad in recent years. Either my two daughters are sick or my parents are. We can fight the cold weather with warm clothes but what about this haze?"" he asks./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, says Mathura Road has become a pollution hotspot and it is primarily because of the traffic volume. ""A large number of commercial vehicles, including trucks, pass through this area as it on the route between Faridabad and Noida,"" she said./A 2015 CSE study revealed that on an average 85,799 light and heavy goods vehicles enter and exit Delhi from the nine busiest points daily. ""Delhi's own vehicles are responsible for 62% of the particulate load from the transport sector and 68% of the NOx load. The total number of light and heavy trucks that enter Delhi spew close to 30% of the total particulate load and 22% of the total NOx load from the transport sector,"" the report said./Another factor is the Badarpur Power Plant, located near Mathura Road. Though closed now, it still has a huge ash pond spread over hundreds of hectares of land. In the summers, high wind speed easily suspends the fly ash. Okhla Industrial Area and Okha landfill site also add to the foul air quality here./Dhirpur/Located between Kingsway Camp, Mukherjee Nagar and Burari - a few kilometres away from Majnu Ka Tilla - this area is a dust bowl. KB Hegdeshwar Marg runs through with unpaved sides causing vast dust pollution. With PWD construction in the middle of the road, waste dumped on the sides add to the dust cloud./""Vehicular congestion is also a daily problem here. Patches at the nearby Bhalaswa landfill keep burning all night. Small industrial units have also spread in nearby villages,"" said Ashok Bhasin, president of the North Delhi Resident Welfare Association Federation./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

BEHIND THE MASK,"New Delhi, Feb. 24 -- When designer Gaurav Gupta announced his Anti-Pollution Riot Campaign, it was left to see how the first event would pan out. So on Wednesday, we headed to the party, where guests righteously posed for pictures, some more dedicated to the cause of the mask than others. 'Facts' read a big board, which charted out the alarming levels of particulate matter in Delhi's poisonous air. And Gaurav went around, speaking about the cause in the most heart felt way. Designer Mandira Wirk said, ""I have a five-year-old and she has problems with breathing. It's so sad that we live in a time where nebulisers have become the norm."" FDCI president Sunil Sethi, one of the early attendees' put it simply, ""Why do I need to escape to the hills or go anywhere at all just to breathe clean? Pollution to me is purity and zen. And that is, what we need in Delhi."" And, party said the invite, and a party this was: with rose being passed around and a dance floor for the adventurous. An observation: it's a pity that at the event meant to denounce air pollution, many were seen smoking away.

"Soon, Ghaziabad residents will know the quality of air they breathe","Ghaziabad, March 3 -- Soon, the residents will be able to regularly monitor air pollution levels in Ghaziabad. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) is in the final stages of putting in place a 'continuous ambient air quality monitoring system' at Vasundahra. The system is likely to be up and running in a week. /The district has a mix of industrial, residential and commercial areas. It is severely affected by air pollution caused by heavy vehicular traffic, smoke emitted by factories and dust pollution in and around construction sites. The system is being installed at Vasundhara office of UPPCB at a cost of over Rs 1.5 crore. It is capable of monitoring nine air quality parameters including PM10, PM2.5, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, benzene, ammonia and toluene etc. ""This is the first such online system to be installed in the city. One more system is proposed in nearby Hapur district. We are currently in the process of working out the modalities of the project at our headquarters. The system in Ghaziabad will also have a display unit which will show 24 hours of average data on the parameters. The system will monitor industrial as well as residential air quality data at Vasundhara,"" Paras Nath, regional manager (RM), UPPCB, said. The engineers from UPPCB said that apart from air quality, the system will also assess basic meteorological parameters related to wind velocity, humidity etc. The PM10 and finer PM2.5 pollutants will be measured on an average of one hour while the other gaseous components will be monitored and updated every 15 minutes. ""The system is in testing phase and likely to get operational within a week. The data from the system will be transmitted to the website of the Central Pollution Control Board and can be accessed by residents. Apart from this, data readings will also be available on certain mobile applications,"" the RM said. At present, Ghaizabad has only three manual air quality measuring units which are installed at Vasundhara, Bulandshahr Road Industrial area and Sahibabad Site-IV Industrial Area. The Vasudhara manual system will give way to the online system in a week. ""The system was much needed as other cities already have such systems in place. Once this system becomes operational, the pollution board officials will be forced to take measures to control rising air pollution. In fact, several such systems should be made operational in other areas of the district which have varied topography. One system is not sufficient,"" Sushil Raghav, an environment activist, said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Killer in the air: WHO says polluted environments kill 1.7 mn children a year,"India, March 6 -- A quarter of all global deaths of children under five are due to unhealthy or polluted environments including dirty water and air, second-hand smoke and a lack or adequate hygiene, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday. Such unsanitary and polluted environments can lead to fatal cases of diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia, the WHO said in a report, and kill 1.7 million children a year. What WHO said in its report Dirty water and air, second-hand smoke and lack of adequate hygiene can result in global death of children. /Polluted environments can lead to fatal cases of diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia and kill 1.7 million children a year. Harmful exposure can start in the womb . Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them. Children in households without safe water and sanitation or those using unclean fuels such as coal or dung are at higher risk of diarrhoea and pneumonia. ""A polluted environment is a deadly one -- particularly for young children,"" WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in a statement. ""Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water."" In the report -- ""Inheriting a sustainable world: Atlas on children's health and the environment"" -- the WHO said harmful exposure can start in the womb, and then continue if infants and toddlers are exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution and second-hand smoke. This increases their childhood risk of pneumonia as well as their lifelong risk of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. Air pollution also increases the lifelong risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer, the report said. The report also noted that in households without access to safe water and sanitation, or that are polluted with smoke from unclean fuels such as coal or dung for cooking and heating, children are at higher risk of diarrhoea and pneumonia. Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them, it said. Maria Neira, a WHO expert on public health, said this was a heavy toll, both in terms of deaths and long-term illness and disease rates. She urged governments to do more to make all places safe for children. ""Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits,"" she said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Mumbai beats Delhi's toxic air levels post winter, claims study","Mumbai, March 14 -- Post winter, the city has been breathing air that is more toxic than Delhi's - ranked one of the most polluted cities in the world, according to a World Health Organisation. While Delhi and Pune did not have a single high pollution day between February and March, pollution levels for particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) - microscopic pollutants in the air that can easily enter our lungs and cause health ailments - were much above permissible limits in Mumbai, found a study by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). SAFAR compared air quality levels of three cities from February to March 13 and found Mumbai to have 20% 'very poor' air days, while Delhi and Pune had none. What's worse, while Delhi and Pune had 40% and 47% 'satisfactory' air quality days, Mumbai only had 13%. ""Between February and March, Mumbai had more 'poor' and 'very poor' days and less 'satisfactory' air days. /Delhi and Pune did not have any 'very poor' days with cleaner air than Mumbai,"" read the conclusion of the study. Researchers from SAFAR said there was an improvement in Delhi's air pollution during the two months; high air pollution in Mumbai was a matter of concern. ""A city like Delhi is landlocked and is more prone to pollutants getting trapped closer to the surface because weather conditions are not favourable, but high speed winds and intermittent rain helped clean the city's air. However, Mumbai has the advantage of sea breeze, but that did not play a crucial role in dispersing pollutants as wind speed was less during most days between February and March,"" said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR. ""Factors such as rise in vehicles and increasing construction work are further adding to Mumbai's pollution woes."" He said Pune, on the other hand, does not have high vehicular population and weather conditions lead to 'satisfactory' air quality. HT reported on Tuesday that between Sunday night and Monday morning, Mumbai recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 315 (very poor) due to low temperatures, wind speed with an additional source of thick black smoke emanating from the Holika Dahan or bonfires. On Tuesday however, AQI levels dropped to 202 (poor) and is expected to 214 (poor) on Wednesday. Doctors said that particulate matter is one of the major issues that reduce the defence mechanism of the lungs to protect it from microorganisms. ""Cilia [hair-like projections] move the microorganisms and harmful particles up and out of the airways to protect the lungs. However, they are killed owing to particulate matter. Once this defence mechanism collapses, the particles enter the lungs and result in multiple pulmonary issues. Chronic bronchitis being the most common disorder, respiratory tract disorders, tuberculosis, cardiac issues and other chronic diseases,' said Dr Rajendra Nanaware, senior pulmonologist and medical superintendent, Sewri TB Hospital./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Mumbai lights Holi fires to keep evil at bay, can't keep pollution away","Mumbai, March 14 -- The city woke up to both colours and thick black smoke emanating from the Holika Dahan or bonfires lit on Sunday evening. Air pollution saw a significant increase between Friday to Monday as the pollutant measuring indicator - air quality index (AQI) - moved from 75, falling under the 'good' category, which also happened to be the cleanest air day in 2017 so far, to 315 on Monday, falling under the 'very poor' category. AQI levels fell to 313, still under the 'very poor' levels by Monday evening. AQI levels between 0-100, falls under the 'good' category, 101-200 is 'moderate', 201-300 is 'poor' and 301-above is 'very poor'. When wood and other organic material is burnt, more than one gas is released. /Other than carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), chemicals are produced, including one of the most potent greenhouse gases, nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Eight of 10 locations in Mumbai recorded 'very poor' AQI levels with Mazgaon, Bhandup, Chembur and Malad recording the city's worst air quality. The two locations that recorded marginally cleaner air, but still fell under 'poor' levels were - Navi Mumbai and Borivli. The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) research records AQI levels across 10 locations in Mumbai. Mumbai also recorded a sharp drop in night temperatures between Sunday night and Monday morning. The weather station at Santacruz recorded the night temperature at 15.2 degrees Celsius, almost 6 degrees Celsius below normal while Colaba recorded 21 degrees Celsius, 1.5 degree Celsius below normal. Officials from SAFAR attributed the rise in pollution to open burning cases as an additional factor to already existing meteorological conditions. ""Along with weather factors such as low wind speed and low temperatures, the additional factor of open burning led to the sudden rise in air pollution. This is a temporary condition and pollution levels will fall to the 'moderate' category by Wednesday,"" said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR. '750 Holika fires this year in Mumbai' Holika Dahan are lit on the eve of Holi, symbolising 'truth prevailing over evil'.Environmentalists said there were fewer Holika fires this year. ""We observed around 750 Holika Dahan bonfires across the eastern and western suburbs, but hardly any were seen in south Mumbai this time,"" said Godfrey Pimenta, trustee, Watchdog Foundation. Environmentalists suggested that bonfires should not be lit in every building and there should be community celebrations. ""In the city it makes no sense to have large fires as it will further deplete the already poor air quality. The smaller the fires the better through the idea of one symbolic community bonfire to reduce pollution,"" said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti. South Mumbai residents said that the spike could have also been due to trash burning with the Holika. ""We saw one large community bonfire in Malabar Hill but the SAFAR data indicates that additional refuse might have been burnt that further deteriorated the city's air quality,"" said Indrani Malkani, managing trustee, V Citizens Action Network. Meanwhile, different departments from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Mumbai police were unware about the number of bonfires as permissions are not given by either authority during the festival. ""We will conduct a check in terms of tree hacking across the city, which we do after Holi every year. We will take strict action against anybody found cutting trees,"" said a senior official from BMC./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air pollution kills but Anil Dave loves living in denial, jeopardising our lives","India, March 16 -- Union environment minister Anil Dave is a brave man. At a time when people are becoming increasingly cautious about air pollution and the harmful effect it has on our health, and several studies are warning of the same, Mr Dave told the Lok Sabha this week that there is not enough ""evidence"" in India to establish a direct correlation between diseases and air pollution. ""Air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases,"" he said in a statement. In the past, the minister had stirred controversy by expressing reservations about the findings of foreign studies that are widely cited in the media to highlight the air pollution problem in India. Recent studies have claimed that India's poor air quality causes nearly 1.1 million premature deaths every year, almost on a par with China. More crucially, where deaths linked to air pollution in China have reached a plateau in recent years, the rate has soared in India where smog readings in major cities routinely eclipse safe exposure levels. India has recorded a nearly 50% increase in premature deaths linked to PM2.5 -- fine particles that lodge deep in the lungs -- between 1990 and 2015, one of the reports said./Expanding on the argument that deaths cannot be directly linked to air pollution, Mr Dave described health impacts as ""generally synergistic manifestation of the individual's food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc."" In response to his assertions, Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""There is more than enough evidence across the world that air pollution kills...if the Indian minister is in denial it is extremely unfortunate.""/If one rereads Mr Dave's statement in Parliament, the minister used his words cleverly. He said that air pollution ""could be"" one of the triggering factors but there is not enough evidence in India. In other words, there is no government-generated study to establish the link. This is true: The environment ministry is working with the ministry of health and family welfare to ""assess the trends and impact [of air pollution]"". So the plan to tackle air pollution, according to Mr Dave, is this: People must suffer till as long as a study by the Indian government does not establish the link between air pollution and diseases. This is a strange stand to take since on many other issues, the Indian government agrees with studies/rankings from by foreign agencies./How can we come out of this situation? Mr Dave should tell at least apprise us of the shortcomings of the existing studies, many of which have come from credible institutions./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Climate change is making people sick, say American doctors","India, March 16 -- From rising levels of air pollution to increased water contamination and a widening range for disease-carrying mosquitoes, climate change is making people sick, a coalition of 11 US medical groups said Wednesday./Known as the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, the group represents more than half of US doctors, and aims to help policy makers understand the health dangers of global warming, and what must be done to guard against it in the coming years./""Doctors in every part of our country see that climate change is making Americans sicker,"" said Mona Sarfaty, a physician and director of the new consortium./""Physicians are on the frontlines and see the impacts in exam rooms. What's worse is that the harms are felt most by children, the elderly, Americans with low-income or chronic illnesses, and people in communities of colour.""/The group is releasing a report that highlights the ways climate change affects health, and calls for a speedy transition to clean renewable energy. The report, called ""Medical Alert! Climate Change is Harming Our Health,"" will be circulated to members of the Republican-dominated Congress./Some of its key warnings relate to heart and breathing problems associated with increasing wildfires and air pollution, as well as injury from extreme heat events./Infectious diseases can spread more widely as ticks carrying Lyme disease and mosquitoes with West Nile virus expand their range. Extreme weather, such as hurricanes and droughts, may become more common, destroying not only homes and livelihoods but also wreaking havoc on people's mental health, it warned./Most Americans are not aware that increases in asthma attacks and allergies are linked to climate change, according to the report. A poll from 2014 suggested that only one in four Americans could name even one way in which climate change is harming our health./People are not powerless, the group urged. They can push for a quicker transition to renewable solar and wind energy, and also do what they can to walk and bike more instead of driving./""Here's the message from America's doctors on climate change: it's not only happening in the Arctic Circle, it's happening here,"" said Sarfaty.

Badarpur power plant pumping toxins into Delhi's air,"India, March 17 -- New Delhi Meena Devi (53) compulsively sweeps her house and terrace once every two hours. It's a habit she has developed over 25 years, living in the DDA flats that share boundary with the Badarpur Thermal Power Station (BTPS). ""Flyash is a big problem here. You'll see a layer of grey dust on everything even if you have swept and dusted just a few hours back,"" she said. The story has been the same for thousands of residents in Janta apartments, Molarband and Madanpur Khadar that surround the coal-based power plant. A number of people whom HT interviewed said this had been the best winter for them as the plant was shut in November and opened only this week. /Living with noise ""We can't talk face-to-face as the noise from the boilers or steam generators overpowers everything. The sound is so loud that one cannot even hear the band playing at weddings in our colony,"" said HS Bhati, president of Badarpur Janta Houses Welfare Association. At any given time when the plant is in operation, the noise (Leq value) from BTPS fluctuates from 71 to 87 decibel, whereas, the permissible standard is 55 decibel during the day time and 45 decibel during the night. ""Sleeping becomes difficult because of the ear splitting noise. This happens whenever they run the turbines. Sometimes it would go on for 3-4 hours. Much has been talked about air pollution that the plant causes, but nobody seems to discuss the issue of noise pollution here,"" said DC Dey, a resident of the area. A living hell for plant workers Recalling the days he worked at the plant, AS Bisht (73) said, ""We would get coupons of Rs 200 or so at the end of each month to buy jaggery from Kendriya Bhandar located within the plant premises."" As per Ayurveda, jaggery helps to cleanse the respiratory tracts, lungs, food pipe, stomach and intestines. But, doctors say the sweet made out of sugarcane can hardly improve the condition of workers who are directly exposed to over a hundred tonne of flyash and dust on a daily basis. Flyash are particles that are either smaller or equal to 2.5 micrometers in their aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). The smaller the particle suspended in the air, the greater the health risks. ""Tuberculosis (TB) was common among workers at Badarpur plant. We treated asthma and bronchitis like one would treat common cold. Many had developed complications in kidneys,"" Bisht added. Fly ash contains significant amounts of silica that can lodge in the lungs and cause silicosis, or scarring of the lung tissue, which can result in a disabling and sometimes fatal lung disease. Chronic exposure can result in fever, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and cyanosis (blue skin). In addition, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that silica causes lung cancer in humans. Over the years, the plant has become an under performer with three of its five units permanently shut. ""Since power generation from this plant has come down, NTPC is keeping only contractual workers for its basic operations. Hundreds of staff quarters inside the plant premises are lying vacant as very few are required to work when it is operational,"" said Sohan Singh, a contractor at BTPS. Problem of flyash When operational, the 705 MW plant produces a mammoth 3,500 metric tonnes of flyash every month, reports from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) indicate. This means about 117 metric tonnes of flyash, a key component of the hazardous PM 2.5 or fine particulate matter causing air pollution, is released from BTPS on a daily basis. The plant is spread across 2,160 acres of land within the national capital out of which 1,680 acres is used only to dump flyash which is a by-product of thermal electricity generation. DPCC reports accessed by HT revealed that as of 2016, the pond near the plant had a staggering 25.7 million metric tonnes of flyash dumped at any given point of time. This is equivalent to having as many as 81 Taj Mahals made out of fly ash. Murari Lal, a loco pilot with the Indian Railways who has been living near BTPS for 15 years, complained that clothes couldn't be dried outside as a thin layer of grey dust covers all of it. ""Not just that, most of us suffer bouts of coughing in the morning and black sputum comes out. I feel guilty for letting my children grow up in such an environment. Even relatives stopped visiting us. We just own one house and have no option but to live here,"" he said. According to a report by IIT Kanpur, coal-based power plants operating in Delhi, which as of now is only the Badarpur one, are major contributors to the pollution load in Delhi. Coal-based plants alone have contributed 11% of the capital's PM 2.5 load. During summer months, coal and flyash contribute 26% of PM 2.5 and during winter months, secondary particles, including vehicular emissions and power plants, contribute 30% of PM 2.5. Fly ash also contains toxic metals such as arsenic, mercury, chromium including the highly carcinogenic chromium IV, lead, uranium and so on. It increases health risks from inhalation, can trigger immunological reactions, heart diseases and inflammation. Gaseous pollutants What's worse is that gaseous pollutants like nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur dioxde (SO2) that are also emitted from the plant were never accounted for in all these years. ""The national norms just did not have any prescribed limit stated for NOx and SO2 emissions whereas, studies as recent as the one by IIT Kanpur have stated that 52% of the Nitrogen Oxide (Nox) load of Delhi is being contributed by the power plants,"" Sunita Narain, director, Centre for Science and Environment and member of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA). It was only in December, 2015 that the Centre notified prescribed norms for the two dangerous pollutants. Emission reports compiled by the state pollution control body reflect that while the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) which runs the plant has been able to keep particulate emissions within the permissible limit, it has not been able to curb its gaseous emissions. For example, SO2 emissions which cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest has frequently been more than double of the permissible standard. NTPC's stand The NTPC, however, said that it is following all the norms prescribed by the government and denied its emissions have crossed the standards. ""As directed, we had shut operations of the entire plant owing to pollution. Besides, we have also installed pollution control devices at two units because of which particulate matter emissions have come down,"" said Deepna Mehta, NTPC spokesperson. On the issue of fly ash she said that in the last few years, the total ash utilisation of the plant has been 100%. ""The ash is being used in building the Delhi-Agra Highway and for ash-brick manufacturing,"" Mehta added./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi air pollution: Secondary pollutants bigger threat, warns EPCA","India, March 20 -- New Delhi The Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) has warned in its draft comprehensive action plan that secondary particulate matter, particles that are born out of the primary source air pollutants, pose as an additional threat to Delhi's air. ""A study by IIT Kanpur has revealed that primary pollutants like NO2 and SO2 undergo complex reactions in the atmosphere and form secondary particulate matter such as sulphates, nitrates and organic aerosols which are equally deadly,"" said an EPCA. Less than 1 micron in size (PM 1) these particles can go deep inside our lungs and trigger lung and heart problems. /Secondary particulates form nearly 25% of Delhi's PM 2.5 load. The Global Burden of Diseases estimates for 2017 have shown that early deaths related to PM 2.5 in India are the second highest in the world. ""These particles could delay the rains or even disperse the rains depriving the city of showers,"" said Abhijit Chatterjee, atmospheric scientist of Bose Institute in Kolkata. While primary particles such as SO2 and NO2 are directly released into the air from vehicles and industries, secondary particles such as sulphates, nitrates and organic aerosols form in the air from these primary particles. They are equally harmful. ""Triggers such as high solar radiation and high relative humidity help primary particles to graduate into secondary ones,"" said Sachchida Nand Tripathi, coordinator of the Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering in IIT Kanpur. EPCA's draft action plan has suggested stronger control over primary sources such as traffic, industry and open burning to arrest these particulates. ""Till date we were speaking about primary pollutants. EPCA's action plan has highlighted this additional problem. We need stronger actions to arrest both,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Truth or fiction? Eight myths and facts about allergies you need to know,"India, March 26 -- The World Health Organization estimates that 50% of the population will suffer from at least one allergy by 2050. We spoke with Christine Rolland, director of the French association Asthme & Allergies, to help sort fact from fiction when it comes to allergies./More people suffer from allergies in spring than in winter./False. People suffer from allergies all year long. You can be allergic to dust mites, animal hair, mold, foods or drugs, or have allergic asthma or skin reactions./More people have allergies in the countryside than in urban areas./False. Allergies are more common in urban settings, notably due to a convergence of factors. One of those factors is air pollution, which also aggravates pollen allergies./Allergies are increasingly common due to environmental factors./True. One theory suggests that reduced biodiversity in our environment could cause changes to the body's intestinal and respiratory flora. This could, in turn, reduce tolerance, which ultimately defines an allergy. But there are other factors at play in the development of allergies, such as cigarette smoke (active and passive smoking), other types of indoor and outdoor atmospheric pollution, and changing dietary factors./A skin-prick test can identify what you're allergic to./True. Together with detailed questions about when allergic symptoms arise, skin-prick tests and, if necessary, an ""allergen-specific IgE"" blood test can help identify the allergen or allergens responsible. These tests can be carried out from an early age./Indoor air is less polluted than outdoor air./False. The indoor environment is five to 10 times more polluted than outdoors. In enclosed spaces, several allergens can provoke allergic reactions (dust mites, animal hair, mold, etc.). These are accompanied by the ""domestic pollutants"" used every day in indoor spaces (smoking, cleaning products, air fresheners etc.). These pollutants can make the occupants of the space more vulnerable and increase the risk of developing allergy symptoms./Older people can't develop allergies./False. Contrary to popular belief, allergies can also develop in older people, at age 60 or even older. Unfortunately, their symptoms are often attributed to causes other than allergies, delaying treatment and the effective management of symptoms./Allergies don't have serious consequences if left untreated./False. What can seem like ""regular"" allergic rhinitis, for example (sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose, itchy or stinging eyes), can develop into potentially serious bronchial breathing problems. In 30% of cases, untreated allergic rhinitis develops into asthma./Antihistamine treatments allow allergy sufferers to lead normal lives./True and false. Treatment with antihistamines can bring effective relief from allergy symptoms, but this isn't always sufficient. Depending on the type and severity of the allergy, allergen immunotherapy (desensitization) may be necessary./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

CAG: Air pollution rocketing in Bihar but check mechanism lacking,"India, March 29 -- The comptroller and auditor general (CAG) of India has asked the Bihar government and its transport department to maintain a database of pollution testing stations./It has also asked them to ensure that the tests they conduct were authentic and due procedure was followed while issuing pollution under control (PUC) certificates./This would enable the department to control vehicular pollution in Patna and other places in Bihar, read the CAG report for the year ending March 2016, which was tabled in the state legislature on Monday./The report said a scrutiny of records revealed that the office of the state transport commissioner (STC) was not maintaining the database of pollution testing stations in Bihar./The absence of any control by STC over functioning of pollution testing stations could be the reason for increased vehicular pollution level, it added./The CAG report said more than 80% people living in urban areas of the state were ""exposed to air quality levels that exceeded the limits specified by World Health Organization (WHO).""/It quoted the Guidelines for Ambient Air Quality Monitoring, issued by Central Pollution Control Board, as saying that vehicular emission was a major source of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) at 280 against permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre in Patna./The report observed that Patna witnessed a steep increase in number of vehicles from 2.34 lakh on April 1, 2011 to 6.74 lakh on March 31, 2016./""This made it clear the exponential increase in number of vehicles in Patna played an important role in the rise in pollution level in Patna,"" it said./Scrutiny of records also revealed that gas analysers/smoke metres supplied by the centre, were issued to eight district transport officers (DTOs) and 22 MVIs to check if motor vehicles met emission and pollution control norms and to issue PUC certificates after charging a prescribed fee./However, they were not utilised and kept idle./""On being pointed out, the department stated (October 2016) that information was being sought from the officials concerned,"" the report added./The report also said licences of 106 pollution testing stations were not renewed as the STC did not maintain database of pollution testing stations./""Consequently, renewal fee of Rs 11.30 lakh was not realised,"" the report said, adding that the returns regarding the number of vehicles tested and revenue collected were not submitted by pollution testing stations./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

'77% vehicles are plying without pollution check',"NEW DELHI, May 1 -- At least 77% of the 70 lakh registered vehicles in Delhi are running without the mandatory pollution under control certificate and the city's emission testing centres are grossly understaffed, says a report by the Supreme Court-appointed Environmental Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPCA)./Vehicles are a major contributors to pollution in Delhi, which is among the most polluted cities in the world. The report puts under scanner the 970 PUC centres in the city, which are certified to check the emission levels of vehicles in the city./The report, a copy of which is with HT, was submitted to the Supreme Court on Friday./According to the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, every BS-III emission-compliant motor vehicle needs to get a pollution test every three months while BS-IV vehicles need to take the test annually./Older cars are more harmful for the environment as they have primitive pollution control systems and emit more harmful gases than newer variants./According to estimates of EPCA, every quarter there should be around 59 lakh PUC tests in Delhi, but ""the period of November 2016 to January 2017 (three months) shows tests of only 13.7 lakh vehicles"". Thereby the compliance rate comes to 23.2%./""A large number of vehicles in Delhi remain outside the PUC testing network,"" the report says, adding that even among the vehicles turning up for tests, the failure rate is extremely low and that the existing norms cannot even identify at least 15-20% grossly polluting vehicles in the on-road fleet./""Nearly all vehicles pass the tests. Due to poor recording of failed tests and due to very lax norms the overall failure rate in Delhi is 4.69 per cent. For the diesel vehicles tested, the failure rate stands at 1.68 per cent, compared to 5.18 per cent for petrol vehicles,"" it says./A serious flaw is that failed tests are not recorded as vehicle owners refuse to pay the fee if their vehicles fail.

India gasps as asthma cases see a sharp rise,"/ articles/PMC3868058/)./""About half the children who have wheezing and asthmatic episodes outgrow it,"" Dr Jain says./Asthma is a chronic condition that is triggered by allergens that inflame and constrict sensitive (hyperallergic) airways and make breathing difficult. What makes airways sensitive is your immune system's threat perception./An asthma attack occurs when an allergen or a stress factor causes an immune reaction that leads to inflammation (swelling) in the airways, narrowing the air passage and reducing air flow in the lungs. This causes wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and coughing, which can last for a few minutes or up to days, depending on the severity and length of exposure. If not treated, asthma attacks lead to frequent hospitalisation and death./ASTHMA TRIGGERS/Experts are struggling to understand why asthma rates worldwide, on average, are rising by 50% every decade. ""Some blame it on hygiene hypothesis, which holds that children with lower exposure to bacteria and viruses in early childhood do not develop a robust immunity,"" says Dr Mehal Shah, consultant pulmonologist at Mumbai's Saifee, Bhatia and Wockhardt hospital./Other triggers include sudden overuse and misuse of antibiotics, indoor and outdoor air pollution, pollen, food colour and additives, obesity, smoking, second-hand smoke, poorly ventilated homes and workplaces (10% of adult asthma is work-related), cold weather, exercise and stressors such as domestic violence and even relationships breaking down./""The fact is that airway sensitivity is going up among people in urban and rural areas because of sustained exposure to a combination of these triggers, which are increasingly unmasking asthma cases that would otherwise have remained under control,"" says Dr Shah./Asthma can be controlled with medicines, but without the appropriate treatment, it can lead to frequent asthma attacks. In 2016, there was a 15% rise in anti-asthma prescriptions over 2015, as per IMS Health estimates. What's alarming is that in 2016, the prescription growth rate escalated from 9% in 2014, indicating a spike in cases. Among the different forms of treatment, inhalants accounted for a 56% share of the prescriptions in 2016./OUT OF CONTROL/Since asthma is a chronic disease, it requires continuous medical care. Patients with moderate to severe asthma have to take long-term medicines such as anti-inflammatory drugs every day to prevent symptoms and attacks. If symptoms occur, short-term medicines such as inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are used to relieve them./Though prescriptions have been steadily rising over the past four years, two in three people with asthma (67%) in India have frequent attacks because of the use of bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids and preventive vaccination against infections such as influenza. ""The goal of asthma therapy is to control asthma so that patients can live active, full lives while minimising their risk of asthma exacerbations and other problems,"" says Dr Jain./""Medication is not the only way to control asthma, but it's as important to avoid asthma triggers-stimuli that irritate and inflame the airways such as fine dust, mouldy areas, second-hand smoke, sudden change in temperature and acid reflex. If you have asthma, avoid oily, spicy and fermented food, and do not lie down two hours after dinner,"" says Dr Jain./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Diesel trucks to blame for smog on Manali-Leh highway,"NEW DELHI, May 4 -- There's no getting away from air pollution, with new research finding high levels of smog from vehicular emissions along India's high mountain highways./Researchers from the University of Cincinnati (UC) in the US found sulphur pollution along the Manali-Leh highway, which winds 490km through Tanglang La, one of the highest motorable mountain passes in the world at 17,480 feet. ""We measured incredibly high amounts of sulphur close to the highway. Some of those values are the highest ever reported in the literature and were likely connected to truck traffic,"" said Brooke Crowley, assistant professor of geology and anthropology, who did the study with UC graduate Rajarshi Dasgupta./For the study, soil samples collected along the highway from a depth of 3, 9 and 15cm were tested for hydrocarbons from wood and cow-dung emissions from cooking and heating, along with sulphur, total organic compound and 10 types of heavy metal. It found low levels of heavy metals but high concentrations of sulphur, a major pollutant in the exhaust of dieselpowered engines. More than 50,000 vehicles use the highway each year, mostly during summer when passes are free of snow. The highest sulphur content was found at the base of narrow ridges that are most prone to rockslides, where trucks wait as the road is cleared of rubble./Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is a major constituent of smog. Short-term exposure inflames the respiratory system to make breathing difficult and trigger asthma attacks. So2, along with other sulphur oxides (SOx), react with other pollutants to form suspended particles that penetrate deep into the airways and lungs to cause asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, heart attacks and strokes./""At first glance, it's easy to consider the region to be a pretty pristine place. But there are environmental impacts from humans,"" said Crowley, who published the findings in Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology. ""There is no pristine environment left. You see black snow deposited on glaciers and snowfields in Tibet,"" said professor Lewis Owen, head of geology department, UC./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

We are planning to give out alerts in newspaper, TV and radio when air quality worsens during the onset of winter,"" a CPCB official said./The city of about 20 million people, which ranks among the world's top cities with foul air on a World Health Organisation list, has been struggling to clean up its air that contains a toxic cocktail of dust from construction sites, and smoke and gases from vehicle and factory exhausts. The condition worsens every autumn and winter as the city, buffeted by farmers burning crop stalks in neighbouring states and atmospheric changes, records higher levels of air pollution./To combat this foul air and its worsening every winter, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) in January enforced the graded response action plan. The plan includes top emergency measures such as odd-even car rationing scheme and ban on construction activities, which will be automatically enforced in the city if level of PM 2.5 breaches 300 micrograms per cubic metre and PM 10 levels stay above 500 micrograms per cubic metre for two consecutive days./During ""very poor"" air quality, diesel generators must be banned and parking free increased by 3-4 times. Other measures include closing brick kilns, hot mix plants, stone crushers, and intensifying public transport services besides increase in frequency of mechanised cleaning of road and sprinkling of water on roads./According to Anumita Roychowdhury from the Centre for Science and Environment, actions falling under the 'moderate' and 'poor' levels, the government is already enforcing as these are not dependant on the day-to-day pollution readings./""As part of the graded response action plan, a task force with experts from Central Pollution Control Board, India Meteorological Department and NCR state governments will be formed to track the daily levels of pollution. There is a need to develop a system of wider dissemination. Through social media, TV, billboards and even bulk messages, a wider strategy needs to be in place to inform people,"" Roychowdhury said./A grim example when such forecast can warn people of bad days was the smog episode in the first week of November, 2016. Compared by many with London's Great Smog of 1952, which had caused at least 4,000 deaths, this was when Delhi's air quality had plunged, as the toxic smoke of the Diwali fireworks and the hostile weather conditions, trapped the pollutants, which in turn shrouded the city, severely affecting even visibility./This was the first time in history of the city, schools had to be shut, coal-based power plants were closed, as part of a slew of emergency measures declared by the Delhi government./Ashok Pandey, principal, Ahlcon International School, said proper information on pollution forecasts can help people and necessary precautions can be taken./""If we have an advance system where we are warned about such bad air days beforehand, we will not take any risks. We won't hesitate in taking actions like closing down the school, if necessary, since children are the most vulnerable,"" Pandey said./Doctors, too, feel warning regarding bad air quality a day or two in advance can help./""If we get this information, it will help asthmatic patients. They will avoid going outside. They will take regular medication, extra care in those highly polluted days not to miss a dosage. We, too, will be able to tell patients what to do and what not to,"" Dr Vikas Maurya, lung specialist at Fortis, said./A number of cities in the world have a system for displaying air quality levels along with warnings. Delhi, too, had similar plans which failed to take off./A senior government official said the plan to put up LED displays announced earlier may not be implemented at all./""We will widen our air quality monitoring network with 20 new stations. All of these will all have screens to display real-time pollution readings,"" the official said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Black carbon emission poses health risks,"Patna, June 6 -- On the 44th World Environment Day, the message was loud and clear to protect the nature, but the recent data for the state revealed that particulate matter and black carbon emission in the environment were still a big concern./The data released by the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) suggested that women and children have been at higher risk of contracting respiratory disease, visual impairment and muscle fatigue, caused by indoor pollution. Burning of solid fuels like charcoal, wood, crop residue, dung cake for cooking, triggers indoor pollution./Around 90% population of the state depends on solid fuels, out of which, Patna is on the top of the chart, followed by Begusarai, Gopalganj and Madhubani./These solid fuels when burnt, emit copious amount of particulate matter PM 2.5 and black carbon, which are the main cause of serious health issues due to air pollution./In a survey conducted by the CEED, it was found that around 1.38 lakh households in Patna used solid fuels as main source of cooking. As 80% of the Bihar population lives in villages, the total percentage of the solid fuel usage in the state stood at 90%./No doubt, the consumption of solid fuel was on higher side in the state. the data further revealed that 831.54 tonnes of particulate matter and 232 tonnes of black carbon were emitted in Patna itself, last year./According to experts, the figure could go up to 1321.43 tonnes of PM 2.5 and 3395 tonnes of black carbon emission by the end of 2051, if the use of solid fuel was not stopped./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Alarmed over poor air quality, Gurgaon schools install purifiers","Gurgaon, June 11 -- City residents are alarmed over the air quality of the city, as it has continued to be marked poor over the last five months. With the city's PM 2.5 reading found to be over and above the permissible limit of 60 microg/m3, several schools in the city have resorted to installing air purifiers in classrooms with a view to ensuring clean air for the students to breathe./In a similar move in Beijing, some schools had installed air purifiers to escape the harmful effects of the city's toxic air and smog./The Haryana government had earlier claimed to be toying with the idea of installing a giant air purifier to curb pollution in the city./The latest to join the string of schools installing air purifiers is Suncity School at Golf Course Road. It installed 100 air purifiers in all classrooms earlier this month./Earlier this month, the Delhi government had also directed schools there to install air purifiers to save students from health hazards./In Gurgaon, schools are shut during winters when air pollution levels reach alarming levels. In May 2017, Gurgaon saw a sudden downturn in air pollution level for two consecutive days. The pollution figures recorded over those two days even surpassed Delhi's most polluted areas./PM2.5, suspended particulate matter which is 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter, is considered the most deadly of all air pollutants as it can settle in the lungs and cause respiratory problems./""We have always been cautious about the health of our students. Air pollution, as we all know, could pose serious health risks. Since pollution levels in the city have been touching alarming levels, the move (to install air purifiers) will ensure better physical and mental health of students. It will also help reduce respiratory diseases among children,"" Rupa Chakravarty, principal, Suncity School, said./Air pollution causes could lead to diseases such as cancer and asthma. Several health surveys found that as compared to outdoor pollution, indoor pollution is more toxic due to concentration of pollutants in a closed environment./Sudha Goyal, principal, Scottish High International School, Sector 57, said, ""We are trying to provide a pollution-free environment in school. Hence, we have installed air purifiers in classrooms to remove the harmful pollutants in the air.""/However, environmentalists and parents opined that the air purifiers at schools are not enough to mitigate air pollution. ""The quality of air in the city has to be improved for the residents to lead better lives. Air purifiers can only provide momentary relief,"" Jitender Bhadana, an environment activist, said./Jitesh Sahgal, father of a student at Shiv Nadar School, said, ""I am not sure how beneficial air purifiers in classrooms are going to be.

Health dept to give fumigation a miss this year,"Gurgaon, June 14 -- The measures to prevent mosquito-borne diseases in the city this year will focus more on controlling larvae breeding and less on fumigation, according to the health department./The chemical that is used in fumigation contains ingredients such as diesel and malathion gas that are harmful to health, officials said./Last year in January, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) too had ordered a ban on the use of diesel in fumigation as it has a negative impact on health and causes air pollution./""Our plan this year is to fill up all marshy areas where mosquitoes breed. Fumigation is not a solution and can only be used in emergencies.

Indira Gandhi: A Life in Nature by Jairam Ramesh | Excerpt,"India, June 17 -- From the Chapter 1:?A First Word/.This is an unconventional biography of Indira Gandhi-for it deals with only one aspect of her personality and her record in office./Why focus on Indira Gandhi's life as a naturalist when she was quintessentially a politician?/The answer is simple./A naturalist is who Indira Gandhi really was, who she thought she was. She got sucked into the whirlpool of politics but the real Indira Gandhi was the person who loved the mountains, cared deeply for wildlife, was passionate about birds, stones, trees and forests, and was worried deeply about the environmental consequences of urbanization and industrialization./She was the only head of government, other than the host prime minister, to speak at the first-ever United Nations (UN) Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in June 1972. Her speech there has reverberated down the decades./She was singularly responsible not just for India's best-known wildlife conservation programme-namely, Project Tiger-but also for less highprofile initiatives for the protection of crocodiles, lions, hanguls, cranes, bustards, flamingos, deer and other endangered species./She almost single-handedly pushed through two laws-one for the protection of wildlife and another for the conservation of forests, which continue to hold sway. Today's laws for dealing with water and air pollution were enacted during her tenure./Indira Gandhi used her political authority to save ecologically sensitive areas from destruction like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the entire northeast and the rainforests in the Western Ghats./She repeatedly drew the attention of chief ministers and other political colleagues to issues concerning wildlife, forests, pollution, resettlement, and for the need to always maintain what she called 'ecological balance'./She highlighted, time and again, the inextricable link between India's natural and built heritage. Indeed, she was one of the very few-perhaps, the only one-to see nature and culture as two sides of the same coin./It is because of these accomplishments, among several others, that Indira Gandhi deserves to be looked at with a fresh 'green' lens. While her politics and economics changed over the years, all through she remained steadfast to conservation. This passion survived the vicissitudes in her life././On matters related to the environment, she was open-minded and deeply engaged all the time. She listened, consulted and reached out. She responded to what she was being told. She was both active and proactive. She gave political space to different points of view; she offered time, often at short notice, to those who would not normally have been able to reach individuals at the helm of decision-making. She took courageous positions that had no immediate electoral payoffs./The environmentalist in her has never got the acknowledgement it warrants from her biographers. A cohesive ecological narrative extending right through her life based on written records has been missing./That is the unabashed reason for this book. It is an exploration of a relatively under-appreciated dimension of Indira Gandhi's personality and of her achievements in public life as an ecologist./.Whatever the judgement regarding her politics or economics, Indira Gandhi is still relevant as far as India's search for ecological security in its pursuit of high economic growth is concerned./On more than one occasion Indira Gandhi had said that she was no feminist. By the same token, she was no narrow, one-dimensional environmentalist either. She was always acutely aware and deeply conscious that she was the prime minister of a country burdened by deprivation and poverty, a country where malnutrition and disease were widely prevalent, a country where the main challenge was to educate a growing population and provide it with expanding employment opportunities./Her entire effort, therefore, was to arrive at a balance between ecology and economic growth. This meant that, at times, she would align herself with the ecology and on other occasions, with the forces of growth and industrialization, while insisting on ecological safeguards./From Chapter 3: The Companionship Years (1950-1964)/By Indira's own admission, her entire life revolved around India's first prime minister. . for the purposes of this book-it's best to describe the time between 1950 and 1964 as 'the companionship years'./.For fourteen years, Indira Gandhi lived in Teen Murti House, the prime minister's official residence in a lush green 65-acre complex with peacocks and various other birds. This sprawling colonial-era bungalow was originally built for the British commander-in-chief who started living there in 1930. When Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948, there was concern that Nehru might be the next target. A reluctant Nehru was persuaded by his cabinet to move into the bungalow, which he did on 2 August 1948. Indira Gandhi shuttled back and forth between Lucknow and New Delhi, before moving in full-time with her father in early 1950./The prime minister's residence was a mini-zoo of sorts-as graphically described by Indira Gandhi herself seven years into her stay there:/We always had dogs, the good kind with long pedigrees and others rescued off the streets that were just as devoted-also parrots, pigeons, squirrels and practically every small creature common to the Indian scene. And we thought life was pretty full, looking after them on top of all the older [sic] chores. Then in Assam, we were presented with a baby cat-bear (or red Himalayan panda), although we did not know what it was until we reached Agartala and were able to study the book of Indian animals in the Commissioner's library [.] Much later we got him a mate [.] and now they have the most adorable little cubs-the first, I believe, to be bred in captivity. My father calls on the panda family morning and evening. They miss him when he is out of station [.]/Two years ago, we received our first tiger cubs-there were three named Bhim, Bhairav and Hidamba. A man came from Lucknow Zoo to teach us how to look after them [.After a while] we sent them off to the Lucknow Zoo where you can still meet Bhim and Hidimba; magnificent beasts, their muscles rippling with power and grace. [Marshal Tito] asked for one of them and Bhairav now resides in Belgrade./*/.Of all the jungle's magnificent creatures, Indira was unarguably most committed to the tiger. She had read Jim Corbett, of course, but perhaps the first time she actually saw the beast in the wild was on 19 October 1955 on the way to Jog Falls in Karnataka. That day, she wrote to her father:/Here I am after all. And truly it's a sight worth seeing. The scenery all along the road was very lovely too, although the road itself was deplorable./Just as I was being told that there is no likelihood of seeing any wild animal at that time of the forenoon and in this season when water is plentiful throughout the forest, a tiger, magnificent creature, sauntered across the road just in front of our car./The sight was permanently etched in her mind-and twenty-seven years later she recalled it vividly in a foreword to a book of wildlife photographs by one of her senior colleagues from Karnataka./Consequently, if there's one environmental cause Indira is forever associated with, it is tiger conservation. Intriguingly, throughout the 1950s, the Indian Board for Wild Life (IBWL), set up in April 1952, never recommended a ban on shooting tigers. In fact, in its very first meeting in Mysore in November-December 1952, it identified fourteen animals that required urgent protection, but failed to mention the grand beast! A ban on hunting tigers came to be initiated only in 1970, four years after Indira became prime minister./But that Indira thoroughly disapproved of the practice is revealed by a letter dated 7 September 1956 that she wrote to her son Rajiv:/We have received a huge tiger's skin. The tiger was shot by the Maharaja of Rewa only two months ago. The skin is lying in the ballroom. Every time I pass it I feel very sad that instead of lying here he might have been roaming and roaring in the jungle. Our tigers are such beautiful creatures, so graceful. You can see their muscles rippling under their skins. Such a short time ago he must have been King of the Jungle-striking terror in the hearts of other animals./I am so glad that nowadays more and more people prefer to go into the jungles with their cameras instead of guns. It seems such a shame to deprive anything of the joy of living just for our pleasure./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Green board tells Gurgaon brick kiln owners to change structure by Sept 30,"Gurgaon, July 5 -- The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Monday issued a notice to brick kiln operators in the area to change the pattern from straight trench to zigzag by September 30./A trench is where raw bricks are kept on fire for baking./The notice was issued with a view to reduce emission of suspended particulate matter in the air. As per data released by the HSPCB, pollution level in the city has remained above permissible limits since November last year./PM2.5, in other words suspended partuculate matter, is 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter and is deemed a major component of air pollution. As it is very fine, it can settle in the lungs and lead to asthma and other respiratory problems./As directed by the green board, the brick kilns will soon adapt to the zigzag pattern. The city has more than half a dozen brick kilns in Sohna and Mewat areas./They are one of the major contributors to air pollution, said experts from the pollution watchdog./""The zigzag system will increase air flow inside the chimneys, thereby ensuring 100% burning of coal, which, it turn, will result in a reduction in carbon emission,"" JB Sharma, regional officer, HSPCB, said./The units have to reconstruct their trenches with a view to converting them into environmentfriendly and energy-efficient systems./The waste, in this process, is burnt completely resulting in a significant reduction i n the smoke emission from brick kilns./Brick kilns modelled on the zigzag pattern enables pollutants to settle inside the chimney and the trench as opposed to being released into the air. The HSPCB will also be able to monitor these units after October 1./""This is the best time for these units to re-structure their trenches as the brick kilns will not be operational for the next three months because of the monsoon,"" said Ravinder Yadav, environmental engineer, HSPCB./The pollution control board has vowed to take strong steps to improve air quality in the region. ""As the city's air quality has remained poor for the most part of this year, we are taking the required steps much in advance to deal with the problem,"" Yadav said./The pollution watchdog aims to change the structure before the temperature dips in the region, as it is the time when the level of PM 2.5 in the atmosphere rises./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Long term exposure even to such low doses of pollution could trigger several diseases,"" said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at Centre for Atmospheric Sciences in IIT Delhi./In the NCR region, air pollution levels in Noida too was equally bad in June 2017 as the city failed to register a single day in which air quality was in the good category. Gurgaon, however, experienced at least five days during June when air quality was in the good category./""This means we are adding more pollution that what rains can wash away,"" said Dey./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"After 9 months of pollution, Delhi has a 'good' air day on Thursday","New Delhi, July 13 -- After a nine-month gap, Delhi breathed 'good' air on Thursday. The air on Friday may also remain good, as per the forecast by Ministry of Earth Science's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) app./According to the SAFAR app, Delhi's overall Air Quality Index on Thursday was 77. When AQI is below 100, the air quality is considered good and air pollution poses little or no risk. On Friday, too, the AQI is expected to be 85 and it is likely to remain in the same range for the next one week./According to experts, the decrease in pollution levels in the is due to the rainy season in North India./""Even though it is not raining in Delhi at the moment, in surrounding areas it is pouring down. Because of this, long range transport of pollutants from outside Delhi is minimal. Around 20%-30% pollution gets reduced because of this,"" SAFAR chief Gufran Beig told HT./""Because of the monsoon, there is lot of moisture in the air. This is also another reason for this decreasing pollution levels over the past 2-3 weeks,"" Beig said./However, as per the Central Pollution Control Board AQI standards the air quality on Thursday was under the 'satisfactory' range. As per the CPCB?data, Delhi did not have even a single day of good AQI for the past 26 months. As per the CPCB barometer, air quality falls in the good range if it is 50 or less. The satisfactory range falls between 50-100./""We were expecting the result to be 'good' but three monitoring stations, Anand Vihar, ITO and Delhi College of Engineering in Bawana, which are heavy traffic zone, ruined the results. The air quality was good in the city on Thursday as mixing height was higher compared to other days,"" Dr Dipankar Saha, additional director and head of the Air Laboratory at the CPCB told HT./According to him, the weather conditions, which is not too hot and on the cooler side, also aided in the good air quality./The 24-hour rolling average of PM10 and PM2.5 were recorded at 77 and 44?g/m3 respectively on Thursday, according to SAFAR. PM2.5 and PM10 are ultra-fine particles that are the dominant pollutants in Delhi. The acceptable levels of PM 2.5 and PM10 are 60 and 100 microgram per cubic metre, respectively./Locality wise, Ayanagar had the best air quality with 64 AQI and a forecast of 68 on Friday. At Pitampura, Airport, Dhirpur and Delhi University, the AQI recorded were 80, 82, 83 and 90. On Friday, these areas may record an AQI of 87, 88, 78 and 82./At Pusa, Lodhi Road and Mathura Road, however, the AQI was moderate with 115, 108 and 115./On Friday, however, these are expected to be good with predictions of 98 for all three stations./Delhi, a city of 20 million people, is among the world's most polluted cities according to the World Health Organisation. It has been struggling to clean up a toxic cocktail of dust, smoke and gases from its air./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Chicken, eggs may make you resistant to antibiotics","Mumbai, July 21 -- The chicken and eggs you consume could be making you resistant to antibiotics, says a new study done in India by US-based Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP). The study - the largest of its kind in India - published today in Environmental Health Perspectives, found high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs on farms in Punjab./Drug-resistant pathogens, if they find their way into the human body, can be difficult to treat. The Poultry Federation of India (PFI) refuted the claims and said they were careful about the use of growth promoters in India after adverse reports on their use in US and Europe./The CDDEP study assumes significance as there has been an increasing demand and consumption for animal products, which has led to the rise in use of antibiotics as growth promoters. Previous CDDEP studies have projected that globally, antibiotic consumption in food animal production will rise by 67% by 2030 with India tripling its consumption. But indiscriminate prescription and use of antibiotics and other medicines has also led to concerns about drug resistance in pathogens that cause infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, urinary tract infection and even HIV./""Overuse of antibiotics in animal farms endangers all of us. We must remove antibiotics from the human food chain, except to treat sick animals, or face the increasingly real prospect of a post-antibiotic world,"" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, lead investigator and director, CDDEP. ""This study has serious implications, not only for India but globally.""/Researchers collected samples from 530 birds on 18 poultry farms to test them for resistance to a range of antibiotic medications that are important to human medicine./The study found that samples from two-third of farms that used antibiotics as growth promoters in birds were three times more likely to be multidrug-resistant than samples without antibiotics./Researchers found 39% resistance for ciprofloxacin that is used to treat endocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles and valves), gastroenteritis, cellulitis (bacterial skin infection) and respiratory tract infections, among other infection. The study also found 86% resistance to nalidixic acid which is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections./In addition to higher rates of multidrug resistance, antimicrobial resistance from meat farms was also found to be twice more than egg-producing farms./""Additional testing revealed the presence of certain enzymes that confer drug resistance to medications used, for example, to treat E. coli, bacterial pneumonia, and other infections. Almost 60 per cent of E. coli isolates analysed contained these enzymes,"" the study stated./Some of the antibiotic drugs used as growth promoters are similar to those used in poultry farms in the US and other parts of the world. In January, the US Food and Drug Administration directed a voluntary ban on using antibiotics as growth promoters in animals./A member of the Poultry Federation of India (PFI) refuted the claims on the implications of antibiotic use as growth promoters for poultry. ""We work with government laboratories and research centres, as well as international laboratories to ensure there are no impacts of humans. We are not careless about human lives as it supports every other life around. In fact some growth promoters do not affect humans, and we are working on probiotic growth promoters too,"" said a PFI member. ""These antibiotic growth promoters have been extensively used in the US and Europe which had boomeranged on them. But in India we are careful and there is consensus on their use with various government bodies.""/The concern about indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led the Maharashtra government to propose mandatory protocols and guidelines. Complying with the new global strategy, adopted by member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO), the government may ask doctors and chemists to follow certain mandatory protocols and guidelines while prescribing antibiotics. ""Consumption of poultry products which are of sub standard could lead to antimicrobial resistance in humans. In India, maintenance of standards food products is not strict, which is a reason for worry as more and more people could be acquiring resistance,"" said Dr Madhu Goel, general physician, Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central/Using life-saving drugs to fatten chicken/Resistant genes can be generated in hospitals and on farms and can spread everywhere. ""The kind of resistance we see in the study is worrying, rather alarming because it shows extremely high levels of multidrug resistance in organisms that we see in hospitals as well. This is what is killing babies in India. This is also what is being picked up on farms,"" Laxminarayan told HT./Drawing parallels with air pollution, he said bacteria is present in air water and soil, and a vast majority has become drug resistant which means humans are constantly ingesting bacteria that is drug resistant. ""We are wasting these very valuable drugs to make sure the chicken gets fatter in 30 days as opposed to 32 days. These are valuable drugs that can get someone back to life from the verge of dying,"" he said. ""As a society we need to ask whether we want to use the same drugs as an agriculture input to make chickens fatter. Consumers in Europe and US have made the decision that they don't want to.""/""That awareness is not there in India. Here someone eating butter chicken doesn't know that the entire chicken has lived its life on antibiotics. And if the person's child dies of a resistant bug or his mother of a multi organ failure in the hospital, they don't mentally make the connection between their own action, and the cause and effect in their own minds,"" said Laxminarayan, adding, ""Chicken with good nutrition and hygiene, and clean water don't need antibiotics. If they are not treated properly and denied basic nutrition, then using antibiotics is a substitute. It may be a cheap substitute but it doesn't mean it's the right one.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Rampant construction, rise in vehicles push Delhi's dust pollution back to Commonwealth Games days","New Delhi, July 31 -- Bad old days are back in Delhi. Dust pollution, the cause of many pulmonary diseases, hit the peak again in 2016, after a lull of five years, in the capital./According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), dust pollution, which includes various particulate matter like PM 10, PM 2.5 and PM 1.0, shot up to 261 micrograms per metre cube again last year./Such levels were last found in 2010, during the Commonwealth Games. ""Thereafter, over the next five years (till 2015), it (dust pollution) remained almost in the same range,"" said D Saha, head of the air quality laboratory of CPCB./The alarm bell was set off last year when the World Health Organisation placed the city on the top of a list of the dustiest megacities in the world./While Cairo and Dhaka notched the second and third positions, Kolkata and Mumbai were placed fourth and fifth./Now, the latest CPCB data also suggests that the rate of increase in dust pollution is higher compared to that of other pollutants such as SO2 and NO2./Experts said the level of particulate matter in the air rises primarily because of construction activities, road dust and waste burning./Saha noted that in 2010, the levels had hit 261 micrograms per metre cube from 153 micrograms per metre cube in 2006./Vivek Chattopadhyay, senior program manager (air pollution control wing) of Centre for Science and Environment, attributed this rise to the construction activities during the Commonwealth Games./He rued the lack of a regular study to ascertain why this dust pollution is shooting up or plummeting every year./Jump in construction & vehicles/Scientists have attributed several reasons behind the jump, including unbridled construction activities, increase in number of vehicles and poor soil management, besides factors such as burning of waste./""In 2005, around 600 building plans were sanctioned,"" said a senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official, requesting anonymity./""In 2016, the three civic bodies together sanctioned around 3,600 plans,"" he said, asking, ""Now add to this the illegal constructions.""/Other construction activities such as roads, their widening, flyovers, Metro, have also increased over the years, along with the number of vehicles, aggravating the dust pollution in the city./The Economic Survey of Delhi 2015-16 reveals that number of vehicles per 1,000 people has shot up from 317 in 2005-06 to around 530 in 2015-16./The road network has increased from 32,131 km in 2007-08 to 33,868 km in 2015-16. Nearly 62 km of flyovers have been added between 2014 and 2016./Thin on green/Experts claimed that even though the green cover of Delhi has increased from 20.08% in 2013 to 20.22% in 2015, the rise has been specific in south Delhi and Lutyens' Delhi area. Most parts of Delhi don't have even an iota of green cover. This barren soil bereft of any grass cover becomes a major source of dust pollution./""Soil texture is governed by small and micro organisms that live in the soil. But due to poor soil management and unbridled human activities, we are losing these organisms. As a result the texture is changing. We now have more lose dust, and every time wind blows, we have dust pollution,"" said eminent ecologist Prof CR Babu, who heads the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem./An IIT Kanpur study submitted to the Delhi government in January 2016 suggests that PM10 particles mostly (40%) comprise particles such as Silicon, Aluminium, Iron and Calcium during the summer./""This suggests that soil, road dust and airborne fly ash are the major sources of PM10 pollution in summer. In winter, however, it is the secondary particles which comprise most of the PM10 pollution,"" said Prof Mukesh Sharma of IIT Kanpur who conducted the study./Another reason attributed behind this drastic rise in PM10 levels is that a significant portion of gases such as SO2 also converts into secondary particles which adds to the PM10 pollution./Experts claimed that while the reduction of SO2 has been possible because of a gradual shift to cleaner fuels and shutting down of thermal power plants, the NO2 level is constantly on the rise with the rise in number of vehicles and 'dieselisation'./Health affected/With rise in particulate matter in the air, the risk of lung diseases and cardiac ailments are also rising in the city./""Over the years, the number of patients with lung and respiratory diseases are on the rise. Cases of COPD, asthma and lung fibrosis have increased. Also on the rise are patients with cardiac problems because increase in particulate matter can affect our cardiac system both directly and indirectly,"" said Dr Vikas Maurya, senior consultant and head of pulmonology division at Fortis Hospital in Shalimar Bagh./Interestingly, the PM10 level plummeted between 2000 and 2006. Experts claimed that the Supreme Court directive of July 28, 1998 catalysed first-generation reforms in Delhi./This helped improve emission standards for vehicles, implement the largest-ever public transport strategy on CNG, cap the age of commercial vehicles, improve the vehicle inspection programme and divert substantial truck traffic./""But after 2007, only a few steps were taken - the Metro network was expanded, the number of buses was moderately increased, Euro IV emission standards were imposed and a small network of cycle tracks and footpaths were built around Commonwealth Games venues. This is too little too late. The air quality gains from the first-generation action have been reversed,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury executive director (research and advocacy) of Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Adopt zero-pollution tech or no licence: PPCB to brick-kilns,"Patiala, Aug. 1 -- To check pollution from the 3,000-odd brick-kilns that continue to use archaic technology in operations, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has issued a guideline to owners to adopt zero air-pollution technology. Now, the primary fuel for making bricks is burning raw coal./The kilns in the state function from October to June and the black smoke these emit is a common, distressing scene in the state./The Punjab State Council for Science & Technology (PSCST) has developed the new technology that around 100 of the brick kilns have committed to install over the next three months./Under this system - the Induced Draft Technology - there will be a major change in the sitting of raw bricks in the well of the kiln./PPCB sources said a preliminary meeting had been held with brick kiln associations, where scientists from PSCST had explained the technology. The brick kiln owners were by and large satisfied with the new technology but sought more time./PPCB chairman KS Pannu said, ""The new technique is cost effective. The brick kiln owner has to spend 15-20 lakh. This is recovered very quickly due to lower consumption of coal and production of better quality bricks. All new brick kilns will be given permission to operate only if they install this technology.

New monitoring stations to provide the big picture of pollution in Delhi,"NEW DELHI, Aug. 7 -- Every time we talk about air quality in the city, the perennially polluted Anand Vihar or the air monitoring stations at RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh pop up. But what about all the other neighbourhoods in the city and the air quality there? Are these few spots giving us the true picture of pollution of the Capital?/Soon there will be 20 more. And one of them might be near your home or workplace./Hindustan Times has the final list of these new air quality monitoring stations being set up by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and they are expected to be in place before Diwali this year./Air pollution data in the capital is currently taken from 28 monitoring stations - six run by the DPCC, eight by the Met department and the rest by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). These new 20 air monitoring stations, which will give real time data of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), Sulphur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Ozone, Ammonia, Benzene and weather parameters, will take the number of stations to 48./""They are being installed in different areas - residential, industrial, hospitals, schools, colleges and stadiums - in order to give a true representative character of air pollution,"" a Delhi government official said./The new stations, setting up of which has been tendered to an Australian company, will be at IIT Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Dhyanchand Stadium, Shooting Range in Asola, Football Federation in Dwarka, IGNOU in Maidan Garhi, Saket, Mundka metro yard, Ambedkar Bhawan in Rohini, Okhla Industrial Estate, PUSA Institutional Area, Delhi Cantonment General Hospital, ITI Narela, Chhatrasal Stadium, Sonia Vihar Water Treatment Plant, Mother Dairy Plant in Patparganj, Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Disease Hospital in Kingsway Camp, DAV College in Sriniwaspuri, Satyawati College in GT Karnal Road, Bramprakash Ayurvedic Hospital in Najafgarh, and Maharshi Valmiki Hospital, Pooth Khurd./""As per international guidelines, the correct way to know one index for a city air quality is to consider different micro-environments...

City hopes for ride to a cleaner tomorrow,"Lucknow, Sept. 1 -- The start of the Lucknow metro rail service is expected to help reduce air pollution in the state capital in the long run./Once people depend more and more on the Lucknow Metro service, it is expected that the air quality of the city will improve as there will be less use of cars and buses./Since Metro operation will not locally generate air emission, air quality will be better in future./It could have another spinoff too. Once the air becomes cleaner, the quality of life of those suffering from respiratory distress will also improve./In fact, the situation could be like a breath of fresh air for children like eight-year-old Rishabh who is not able to play cricket with his friends as he suffers from asthma attacks due to pollutants in the air./When his friends call him to play in Lucknow's Indira Nagar area every day, he has to turn them away and watch the action from his balcony./Besides, he has to limit himself to indoor games and the occasional visit to a mall. He is not the only one in this situation. Assuming alarming proportions each year, air pollution is forcing many youngsters to stay indoors./It is for these children, who are afraid of venturing out of their homes because of pollution, that arrival of the ecofriendly Lucknow metro will improve the quality of life. ""Air pollution is a killjoy. It is troubling not only Rishabh. but up to 11% children below the age of 12 in Lucknow. Many of them have been diagnosed with asthma,"" says Dr Surya Kant, head of the pulmonary medicine department at King George's Medical University (KGMU) in the state capital./He says, ""The pollution levels have been on an upward trend in the past five years. So, if Lucknow metro reduces the use of four wheelers and two-wheelers, it will be a welcome change for Lucknowites.""/Dr Mudit Goyal, a private practitioner, says, ""Two or three children come to my clinic every month with chronic respiratory problems. A majority of the parents complain that their children start coughing the moment they reach the roadside.""/Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation (LMRC) managing director Kumar Keshav says, ""The metro corridor will yield benefits from non-tangible parameters such as saving due to equivalent reduction in road construction and maintenance, vehicle operating costs, less atmospheric air pollution and socio-economic benefits of travel time, better accessibility, better comfort and quality of life./However, all benefits cannot be evaluated in financial terms due to nonavailability of universally accepted norms./Parameters such as economic growth, improvement in quality of life, reduction in public health problems due to less pollution etc have not been quantified.""/Though things will improve, LMRC officials cannot guarantee reduction in vehicular pollution from day one. But they are optimistic that with traffic congestion and fuel consumption coming down, air pollution may reduce too./GROWTH OF PERSONAL VEHICLES MAY BE CHECKED/Without metro, it is estimated that the number of buses will have to increase by 4% by 2026 to meet the transport demand forecast./During this period personalised vehicles may also grow by 4%. Together, they will compound the existing problems of congestion and delay. But the development of Lucknow metro will reduce journey time and hence congestion and delay. Thus, 4% growth in personalised vehicles could come down to 1% as a result./After the start of Lucknow Metro, it is estimated that both petrol and diesel consumption will be reduced. The saving will be due to reduction in vehicles and decongestion on roads./Reduction in road accidents will be positive impact of Lucknow Metro rail project implementation, says Kumar Keshav, the LMRC managing director./Reduction in road accidents was also noticed after introduction of metro rail services in other cities like Delhi./The major pollutants that define the ambient air quality are: particulate matter, Sulphur dioxide, Nitrogen oxides, and Carbon monoxide. The sources of these pollutants vary from domestic fuel burning to industrial and vehicular emissions./In addition to the above pollutants, un-burnt products like aldehydes, formaldehydes, acrolein, acetaldehyde and smoke are by products of vehicular emissions./A report by Indian Institute of Toxicology Research highlights that vehicular traffic (emission) is the main source of particulate air pollution in Lucknow. Continuous emission of pollutants from vehicular traffic adversely affects the ambient air quality, as well as the health of human beings./As per the report released on June 5, 2017, vehicular traffic is the main source of particulate air pollution in Lucknow city./The number of different categories of vehicles registered with RTO (Regional Transport Office) Lucknow is 19, 78,345 as on March 31, 2017, which is 6.10% higher over 2016./As per the oil marketing company (IOC, BPC and HPCL), the consumption/sale of petrol and diesel was 1,93,345 and 2,30,626 KL as on March 31, 2017./The sale of petroleum has increased by 11.36% whereas sale of diesel has increased by 26.38%./The city has more than 18 lakh vehicles, which are increasing at an average annual growth rate of about 9%, says the recent IITR report./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Ghazipur landfill collapse: We buried our heads in trash until it buried us,"India, Sept. 2 -- Millions of years from now, wrote professor Jay Quade of the University of Arizona, field geologists would chiefly recognise us for our trash, and the Cenozoic (Age of Mammals) would be succeeded by the Garbocene (Age of Garbage). That is, if we, future geologists included, survive that global wasteland./Given our callousness, that is a big IF. No one who ever took NH-24 on the way to Uttar Pradesh could have missed the build-up, so to say, to the disaster that killed two at the Ghazipur dumpsite on Friday. Even if one was not looking, the stench from the looming monstrosity on the Delhi border was simply inescapable. It smelled like death./The 70-acre mountain, which could tower over a 15-storey building, is just plain garbage piled up to a height where it was already experiencing routine minor landslides. And yet, nobody moved a finger till a massive chunk of it slid down and killed people on Friday./In operation since 1984, the Ghazipur landfill has collected 14 million tonnes of household trash and animal waste, plus thousands of tonnes of plastic and construction rubble. By 2002, it had filled up to capacity. Fifteen years later, it continues to receive trash from east Delhi. In fact, three out of Delhi's four landfills ran out of space nearly a decade ago. Today, Delhi is drowning in its own trash./PUSHING THE LIMITS/Building new dumpsites is not easy. There is no shortage of land. But who would want a giant dumpsite in their backyard? Except for rag pickers who collect every bit of recyclable material from the simmering piles of trash. The Waste Atlas 2014, a compilation of data on the 50 biggest dumpsites of the world, listed asthma, tuberculosis, skin diseases as some common health conditions among the rag pickers working at Ghazipur./But rag pickers are not the only ones affected. At least three million people live within the 10km radius of Ghazipur and the nearest residential settlement is just 200 metres away. This landfill is not just fouling the local air and groundwater, says the Waste Atlas, but possibly also the Sanjay Lake and the Yamuna within its 7km radius./Last year, a fire at Deonar -- Mumbai's largest and oldest dump yard -- raged with flames so high and smoke so thick that it was visible from space. The air pollution levels forced schools to shut down for a week. Deonar has 17 million tonnes of garbage dumped over 132 hectares. At least 5.87 million people live in the 10km radius of the dumpsite./In 2012, Bengaluru, the city of gardens, was reduced to a city of trash when villagers living on the outskirts refused to allow the city's garbage to be dumped in their backyard./Till Friday, when a portion of the rain-soaked Ghazipur dumpsite came down, Delhi's garbage crisis has remained restricted to stray municipal strikes and political blame-games. The methane-laden dumpsites were conveniently tucked away in voiceless working-class neighbourhoods on the city borders. Out of sight and earshot, not many cared how and where they tossed their trash./But sliding mounds of garbage killing people are no freak accidents. In the past decades, hundreds of people have died in landfill collapses in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Manilla (The Philippines), Shenzhen (China), Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Bandung (Indonesia) - all because of civic neglect and apathy./FACE UP TO THE REALITY/Our waste pile was already killing us daily, poisoning the air we breathe and the water we drink. Now that it has caused more visible deaths in one fell swoop, Delhi better face up to its waste management crisis. Landfills, in fact, are the last option and recycling and composting is the only way to reduce the load sent to dumpsites./In government circles, waste-to-energy plant is seen as a one-stop solution. But waste combustors release a number of harmful pollutants, which only get worse if unsorted trash - plastic, electronic waste, glass and all kinds of discards - make it to the incinerators. For any successful reform to roll out, segregation of waste and composting have to be the starting point./After decades of waiting, the laws on mandatory garbage segregation have finally been formulated. The rules propose that people pay for garbage management services, and suitable fines and penalties are imposed on those who litter the city's street, drains and water bodies. But Delhi's municipalities are already several months late in firming up these bylaws./At a more fundamental level, to be able to discard judiciously, we must also bring ourselves to consume less. Next time you throw a plastic bottle out of the car window or even in the bin, think. There will be no one to remember you for ushering in 'the Garbocene'./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Combating air pollution: Delhi-NCR may get common air quality index,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 3 -- The National Capital Region, often claimed to be the one of the worst polluted zones in the world, would soon get a common Air Quality Index (AQI), which would give a more accurate picture of the air quality./At present the ministry of earth sciences through its System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) displays separate AQI. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has its own real-time data./In a review meeting held last week, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) urged the CPCB to integrate the daily data on air quality from SAFAR, DPCC and other state pollution control boards in NCR and come up with a single air quality index./""Discussions with officials from ministry of earth sciences have already been held and the DPCC data is already connected to our system. We can come up with a single AQI by month-end,"" said a senior official of CPCB./At present Delhi has around 18 monitoring stations while 20 would be added more by October this year taking the total to 38. Sources said that the NCR will have around 50 air quality monitoring stations by December 2017./""With the winter season approaching when pollution levels are expected to shoot up, the new system would be of much help to the authorities and EPCA to implement the graded response action plan in Delhi-NCR,"" said an EPCA member./The air quality index or AQI is basically a figure and a series of colour codings shared by agencies on the level of pollution. For example, the one CPCB shares, ranges between 0 and 500./An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'Good', 51-100 'Satisfactory', 101-200 'Moderate', 201-300 'Poor', 301-400 'Very Poor', and 401-500 'Severe'./Each category comes with its own advisory. In case of 'Moderate', it warns of breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases while 'Severe' means the air quality is so bad that it may affect even healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases./The CPCB has also formed around 40 teams for round-the-clock inspections at the ground level to check violations such as burning of waste in the open, dust from construction projects and visibly polluting vehicles on roads through the winter months when pollution levels in Delhi spike./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Vardhan urges Delhi's neighbours to help tackle air pollution,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 6 -- Environment minister, Harsh Vardhan, met senior officials from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi to receive a briefing on the actions taken to tackle air pollution on Tuesday./On top of the agenda was the stubble burning, where farmers burn the residual crop to clear their fields, releasing vast plumes of smoke that are carried by winds to neighbouring Delhi. Delhi has historically had two severe episodes of air pollution, that coincide with stubble burning episodes in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi./Taking note of their contribution to poor air quality the National Green tribunal banned crop residue burning in the five states in November 2015. However, there have been multiple challenges to implementing this ban. Farmers have resisted such a move because they do not have other viable ways of getting their fields ready for the next cropping season. The governments are required to provide incentives to farmers to stop the practice./The NGT also put in place fines for those found to be burning their residual crops depending on the size of their landholding the penalty ranges from Rs 2500 to Rs 15 000./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) the country's apex regulatory body for pollution, said that they had formed 40 teams to monitor compliance./Delhi NCR grapples with acute smog in winter months when air is relatively still, especially during Diwali time, which is falling on October 19 this year.The environment ministry has launched a sustained campaign to spread awareness among school children,about burning crackers which aggravates Delhi's air pollution problem. The part played by children in banning of cracker use has been a bright spot in the battle against air pollution./The National Green Tribunal has taken a dim view of state government's failure to check crop burning. The NGT warned that officials in August that they would not receive their salaries if they did not come up with action plans to tackle stubble burning./The environment minister, however, said he expects the Delhi's air to be much cleaner this winter season, and over a period of five years the government expects air pollution levels to drop by 30-35 %./Delhi's graded action plan, which was formulated on the direction of the Supreme Court, will come into force on October 15th this year. The plan includes provisions like closing down the highly polluting Badarpur power plant. Power plants are the other major contributor to Delhi's air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution in Delhi: Breathing capital's deadly air is robbing you of 6 years of life,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 12 -- It is well documented that poor air quality impacts health, for the first time the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPI) has developed an Air Quality-Life Index (AQLI) to measure by how much. If India met its own air quality standard for only PM 2.5 (40 ug/m cube)?every Indian would live an average 1 year more. If India met the more stringent WHO standards for PM 2.5 (10 ug/m cube) Indians would live on average 4 years longer./National Capital Region residents are losing out on almost 6 years of life because of the dangerous air pollution levels. If WHO standards were met in NCR, people would live 9 years longer. In Kolkata and Mumbai better air quality would translate into almost 3.5 year longer life spans./""The AQLI is the first tool of its kind to allow people to learn how much longer they could live in the areas where they live if air pollution is reduced to meet global or national standards,""?Michael Greenstone, the director at EPI and one of the authors of the study, said. ""It suggests that particulates are the greatest current environmental risk to human health, with the impact on life expectancy in many parts of the world similar to the effects of every man, woman and child smoking cigarettes for several decades.""/India's last environment minister stirred controversy by suggesting that the link between air pollution and health impacts is yet to be established, and data about air pollution deaths is particularly problematic. A government effort to study the health impacts of air pollution has not taken off./However, Indian scientists have argued that the link between air pollution and health impacts like respiratory disorders and cardiovascular morbidity. Elderly people and children are particularly susceptible./""Epidemiological studies have shown that the smallest forms of particulate pollution (PM10 and PM2.5) are the most damaging to human health,"" Greenstone said. ""The study itself utilizes a PM10 monitoring network throughout China from 2004 - 2012, while the AQLI utilizes grid-level global estimates of PM2.5.""/The estimated average PM 2.5 concentration for population-weighted exposure increased from 59 in 1990 to 73 ug/m3 in 2015 in India. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 report estimated that PM 2.5 contribute to 4.2 million deaths globally, a majority of which occur in India and China. The new report presents a different but no less distressing aspect of the problem./""These findings are consistent with what has been found across the world,"" Anumita Roychowdhury, at the Centre for Science and Environment, said./The national capital has historically experienced severe pollution episodes during the winter season around the time of Diwali, because of crop burning in Delhi's neighbouring states and also the stagnant air that prevents the pollutants from being dispersed./""It is fine to do research, the bottom line is no level of population is not safe. The first strategy should be to bring down the pollution as low as possible,"" T. K.

Stunted children: Blame it on indoor air pollution,"Mumbai, Sept. 13 -- Ventilation can considerably mitigate the negative impact of solid fuel smoke exposure on children/DESPITE HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE LAST FEW DECADES, INDIA STILL HAS THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE OF STUNTING AMONG ALL SOUTH ASIAN ECONOMIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AFGHANISTAN./Worldwide, as many as 4.3 million people die each year due to indoor air pollution. The conversation on air quality, however, has been focused largely on outdoor air pollution. As researchers at Evidence for Policy Design, we conducted an analysis of 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) data and found strong evidence that the exposure to indoor air pollution from burning solid fuels increases the probability of stunting among Indian children./A child is regarded as stunted if her height-for-age is below certain thresholds set as per the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards./Stunted children tend to have both physical and cognitive developmental delays, including delayed walking, impeded speech development, and diminished school performance. They also experience higher rates of mortality and morbidity, including diabetes and hypertension./According to NFHS-3 data, as many as 43% of Indian children under the age of five were stunted, as of 2006. Despite high economic growth during the last few decades, India still has the highest prevalence of stunting among all South Asian economies with the exception of war-stricken Afghanistan. The sheer magnitude of the problem is apparent in the fact that India has 61 million stunted children, more than any other country./While stunting is most commonly associated with poor nutrition, there is an emerging body of research that links exposure to poor air quality to stunting. In many households in India, solid fuels   such as coal, wood, crop residue and dung   are used for cooking. These fuels release particulate matter, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and other toxins, at a much higher rate than non-solid fuels such as kerosene and LPG. Children s lungs are still developing and are therefore particularly susceptible to irritation and contamination from the fumes of solid cooking fuels; when children s bodies must repeatedly fight off the respiratory infections these fumes provoke, their growth suffers./We analysed NFHS-3 data to identify the main drivers of stunting among Indian children. Controlling for nutrition, recent illnesses, and other socio-economic factors, living in a household that burns solid fuels is associated with 6.5% of stunting cases in Indian children below three years old. In fact, in our analysis, fuel type comes out to be almost half as influential as malnutrition in terms of impact on stunting./In May 2016, the Indian government began providing below-poverty-line households with LPG connections. At the same time, many NGOs and local institutions are working to replace traditional cooking stoves with more efficient ones, which would reduce the total quantity of fuel consumed and emissions produced per hour of usage./Although a transition to cleaner fuels and technology is perhaps the only longterm solution that addresses the indoor air pollution problem at its roots, there is a second option that has the potential to tackle stunting. Having appropriate ventilation mechanisms can considerably mitigate the negative impact of solid fuel smoke exposure on child stunting. The simple presence of a window in households burning solid fuels is associated with a 3.4% lower prevalence of stunting. Having separate kitchen and living areas reduces the chance of stunting by 4%. As the data capture only whether households possess the different ventilation options and not their actual usage, so the benefits of using ventilation consistently and strategically are probably greater./In order to be free of the health risks associated with air pollution, citizens need clean air both at home and in their communities. A permanent transition to cleaner fuels is perhaps the only solution that will improve India s air quality   both indoors and outdoors. In the meantime, low-cost ventilation solutions have the potential to mitigate the impact of solid fuel burning on stunting, and should be integrated into health promotion campaigns./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

BMC finds 73% of Mumbai's garbage is food waste two years in a row,"Mumbai, Sept. 15 -- Of the 9,400 tonnes of trash that Mumbai sends daily to its dumping grounds , 73% comprises food, vegetable and fruit waste, says the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)'s latest Environment Status Report (ESR)./Waste management experts said if Mumbai recycles this waste, it can reduce the amount of garbage transported to its overburdened landfills by 93%. ""Not more than 7% of non-recyclable and inert waste requires to be dumped at landfills in Mumbai because they can be treated at source,"" said Satish Sinha, waste management expert, who was part of the committee that drafted the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016./The ESR 2016-17 found that construction debris - sand, stone and earth - comprised 17% of the waste, 3% is plastic and 3% is organic dry waste such as wood and cloth. Paper and other recyclables, including metals, are 4% of the garbage./Despite the high proportion of recyclable components in its garbage. Mumbai segregates only 8% for recycling and only 5% is composted by private agencies such as housing societies, restaurants and produce markets. ""The dumping of garbage poses health hazards because it is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, flies, and rodents, which are carriers for disease-causing pathogens. It also aggravates air pollution, ground water pollution and soil pollution affecting the fragile ecosystem,"" read the report./Data from the BMC's solid waste management (SWM) department shows the proportion of food in the city's waste was similar in 2015-16 as well./The Deonar dumping ground, the largest in Mumbai, gets approximately 34% of the trash, while Kanjurmarg and Mulund receives 32% and 34% of the garbage. ""Mulund and Deonar dumping ground have nearly exhausted their capacity to receive the garbage,"" read the report./Currently, municipal workers collect 95% of waste from households, educational institutes, hospitals, hotels, office complexes etc. as against a target of 100%. The waste is taken to 32 segregation centres where it is separated into dry, organic, plastic and biomedical waste. Only 53%?of the collected garbage is segregated against a target of 100%. At the dumping grounds, 35% of the waste is treated by composting by vermiculture./Municipal officials said 23,000 housing societies were sent notices for not segregating waste and another 5,000 were issued notices for not treating organic waste. ""We are taking action to make citizens aware about mandatory segregation and composting under the Municipal Solid Waste Management rules, 2016. There is better awareness among the masses. Our target is to reduce the waste going to landfills by 36% (6000MT) by 2019,"" said an official./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
