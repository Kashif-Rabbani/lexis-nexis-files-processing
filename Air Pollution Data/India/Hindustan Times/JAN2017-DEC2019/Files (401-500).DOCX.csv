Premature deaths in Bihar due to worsening air quality: Report,"Patna, May 30 -- A report prepared by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi and supported by Patna based Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), has revealed an estimated 300 deaths per one lakh population annually in Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya due to pulmonary diseases, heart diseases, stroke, lung cancer and acute lower respiratory infections./The finding titled 'Know What You Breathe' which was released here on Monday, conducted study in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand to examine ambient air pollution, particulate matter (PM) 2.5 level in the air, premature mortality burden and atmospheric aerosol composition in these states./The report studied the annual PM 2.5 concentration in eleven cities of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, using the satellite data of the past 17 years./Abhishek Pratap, program director, CEED, said, ""The report is a grim reminder of the fact that air pollution is a public health crisis, impacting the present as well as the future generations. Preventing air pollution from causing more premature mortality, the government needs to put it high on its priority list. The announcement of an Air Action Plan for Patna is a welcome step.""/""If a clean air action plan gets implemented with utmost stringency, the premature deaths due to air pollution will reduce by 18% in Patna,"" he further added./It has been found in the report that the PM 2.5 level in Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur is 175% to 200% higher than that of national limit and it is disproportionately increasing over the years. In the last 17 years the particulate matter (PM) pollution has increased to an average 23 g/m3, 13 g/ m3 and 6 g/m3 in Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur, respectively./Ankita Jyoti, senior programme officer, CEED said, ""On an average, 30% of the total deaths related to chronic exposure to air pollution were because of pulmonary diseases while 27.4% of the total annual premature deaths occurred in children because of acute respiratory infection.""/To achieve the National Air Quality Guideline, the PM2.5 concentration should be reduced by over 54.2% in Muzaffarpur; 53.4% in Patna and 41.8% in Gaya,"" said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Iit-delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Maintaining social harmony is our govt's responsibility,"Gurugram, June 1 -- Gurugram has been known to be a place without religious tensions. Over the last one month, this has got spoilt over the namaz issue. What are your thoughts on that?/Maintaining social harmony is our responsibility. There is an influx of people from outside the state, outside the district. People say many Bangladeshi Muslims have also come, though there is no survey on it./The central government has to do a survey on it. With numbers increasing, places of worship have to be increased. Such things will happen if the places of worship are not increased. So we said that everyone should offer namaz in mosques and idgahs. Others can offer it at private places. It should not be offered in public places. It's alright till no one objects. But if someone does, we will have to check it. Because law and order situation has to be maintained./Offering namaz on roads is not appropriate. I have given this statement and also received a good response. People in the society have said that is right. We have stopped it at some places where it used to happen and people have found it convenient. Administration has earmarked 37 places after speaking with all groups. Right now, no one has a problem with namaz being offered at these 37 public places./If tomorrow there is a problem at any place, including these 37, we will again see what needs to be done./We have said, build mosques and idgahs. Otherwise, namaz can be done at home./The growth in Gurugram has been dramatic over the last two decades. But has the city suffered from a lack of planning?/Planning is more effective when it is done at the concept stage. I think there may have been some shortcomings in planning at that time. But despite those shortcomings, the city expanded and it expanded in a way that the planners might not have expected. But today, because of its proximity to Delhi and the international airport and with increase in the scope of development in India, people have started coming to Gurugram./Offices of more than 200 of the Fortune 500 companies are located in Gurugram. I don't think any other city in India can boast of this./When so much development happened, shortcomings started becoming visible. We have started working on it at full speed. For instance, underpasses at National Highway 8 were proposed, planned and started. Consequently, the traffic situation at Rajiv Gandhi Chowk and Signature Tower has improved./I have recently inaugurated the Hero Honda flyover and the flyover at Manesar. The work at IFFCO Chowk is almost complete./But there's still work to be done. We want to expand the Metro further, especially to Old Gurugram. The planning is on and mapping is being done. We want to connect Dwarka Sector 21 with the Metro so that west Delhi gets integrated with Gurugram./Air pollution is a big problem in Gurugram. The effect of stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab is seen till Delhi. What is being done to prevent it?/It's a wrong perception that stubble burning causes pollution in Delhi to rise. Stubble burning should not happen. Even NGT (National Green Tribunal) has said that this is not the case.

"Exclusive: Gurugram will be super smart, says Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar","India, June 1 -- Mission for millennium city Expressways and underpasses, CNG buses, more Metro routes, and a new metropolitan authority - Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar shares his government's plans for one of India's fastest-growning urban sprawls that has its share of problems but the promise of an even brighter tomorrow./Excerpts:/The growth in Gurugram has been dramatic over the last two decades.

Consequently, the traffic situation at Rajiv Gandhi Chowk and Signature Tower has improved./I have recently inaugurated the Hero Honda flyover and the flyover at Manesar. The work at IFFCO Chowk is almost complete. Some of it is held up because a petrol pump located there can't be removed due to a stay from the court. That's why one of its carriageways is not complete. I have also recently laid the foundation stone at Atul Kataria Chowk. So all the traffic bottlenecks have been taken care of./But there's still work to be done. We want to expand the Metro further, especially to Old Gurugram. The planning is on and mapping is being done. We want to connect Dwarka Sector 21 with the Metro so that west Delhi gets integrated with Gurugram./Similarly, Dwarka Expressway is a big project costing Rs.7,000 crore. The land near a colony in Palam Vihar had to be acquired. There were 60-65 flats and 35-40 of them are left to be acquired. The rest have got a stay from the court. But I hope the stay will be lifted and we will give them alternative plots. When Dwarka Expressway is ready and Metro is connected, Gurugram's traffic problems will be solved./RERA (Real Estate Regulation Authority) has started functioning for real estate problems. It has two units. One is for Gurugram and another for Haryana, which is based in Panchkula./A new development will be a global city project spread over 1,200 acres. The KMP (Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway) should start in two months, paving the way for an economic corridor. Many of our plans have been successful and the rest are being taken gradually./The biggest achievement was starting Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). Earlier, Gurugram was managed from Chandigarh. Now, all problems of Gurugram will be solved in the city itself./What has been the experience of GMDA since it started work five months ago?/It has been good. It's said that Gurugram has not been able to become a Smart City. I say that Gurugram will become a Super Smart City. Currently, Faridabad and Karnal are our Smart Cities but corresponding work as per the given parameters has not even started there. But many things have started in Gurugram because of GMDA. The tender for an Integrated Control System has been floated in the city. The report on the CCTV system will also be ready by June 15. Gurugram is progressing faster than all those Smart Cities./Will the concentration of people and offices in sectors near Delhi further spread out when the global city is ready?/It will go up to Manesar. And after the KMP and Dwarka Expressway is ready, traffic from there won't have to pass through Gurugram./When will the Dwarka and KMP expressways be ready for use?/We have requested the Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone for the Dwarka Expressway. It can be done even remotely. If that happens soon, the road can be ready in six to eight months./KMP will not take more than three months. I recently did an aerial survey of KMP starting from Kundli. There are six or seven patches or cross-sections which have to be completed. There is no problem of acquisition there./What was your first experience of Gurugram? Did you ever think it would become a developed city like it has?/Gurugram was witnessing a hotchpotch type of development. It used to bother me. So I took up one issue after another. We spoke to DLF about their problems. We also spoke to the Metro corporation. We convened a meeting of the power sector. Many problems of the power sector still exist, especially those related to the builders. They have installed gensets but they don't pay the charges to the power department. So we are roping in Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) to put pressure on the builders. Similarly, we are seeking the help of RWAs to sort out power-related problems in colonies./For how long have you been coming to Gurugram?/Since long before forming the government in the state. We used to be surprised to see NH8 coming up because the city used to be very small at that time. We wondered why the government was spending so much money on building such a big road and for what? This was as early as 1980. During that time, people used only the Old Delhi road. But we realised its need when we found out more about the expansion plan./While Gurugram became the source of revenue for the government and an attraction for people, the political authorities also found scope to bungle, which is why many people are embroiled in inquiries and court cases today. Many wrongdoings had happened here. But we said we won't let them happen anymore./We have heard the problems of real estate companies too. Within the parameters of law, we have helped them make things right. Some were allowed to pay in instalments, policy was framed to ensure their work is not stalled. Others were given an extension of two years beyond the licence period of five years, otherwise they would have been ruined. We have also increased the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) from 150 to 300. It's even higher in Noida. We have transit-oriented development (TOD) policy, which allows higher FAR along the metro track to facilitate higher concentration of people. Traffic problems can be avoided then./Some people say that the best and the worst thing about Gurugram is real estate. Do you agree that there are a lot of problems in this sector?/It's right. The thing is that some real estate companies found ways to expand more than their capacity. But it was wrong and many even failed. The government has nothing to do with what happens with a private company. Whatever is going on between them and the company should be fair. That is our only concern. For that, we have created RERA. If the companies still fail, we will act according to the legal system in place./Noida started developing much before Gurugram. How did Gurugram manage to win the race?/Gurugram has an advantage of location over Noida. It's nearer to the airport than to Delhi. That is a reason why Gurugram could figure on the international scene. People had once started moving away from Gurugram but their confidence was restored./We took a number of steps to sort out their problems such as creating a one-roof system for all clearances./Do you mean the labour problems that had escalated in Gurugram?/There was a problem with Maruti, then Hero. That problem is not there. There is an understanding between the two sides. Court was involved, companies pulled away, labour also realised that they were at a loss. But we will not allow exploitation of labour. We have brought changes in labour laws. We brought four amendments in labour laws due to which companies expressed their protest./We explained to them it was not right to let unrest persist among the labour. They are also human beings. They should get the facilities on humanitarian ground./If we have to compete in the world, we should not do it by exploiting labour./The monsoon is on its way. People still remember the 'Gurujam'./It won't happen again. Now the Hero Honda Chowk has an underpass. The 10-metre road has been widened to acquire 10 metres more. There were about 70 three-storey houses that were pulled down. People were given alternative plots and money for construction. We did it on priority./Zoning is a problem in Gurugram. Initially, real estate development happened quite randomly. Is sector-wise planning happening now?/The development plan has to be followed and it's beneficial to not tweak it unless an unforeseen problem arises. Zoning is done with public consultation and projections are made. In Gurugram, sectors 1 to 55 are old sectors and 55 to 115 are new. The new ones were opened without infrastructure development. So we have made four zones there. Problems in the first zone, be it companies, home-dwellers, utilities, will be fixed first. Then, move on to the next zone./Developers will have to construct according to our zones and not randomly by developing in a vacant zone. Roads, sewage lines, power infrastructure have to be constructed for an entire sector even if there are just 10 houses there./That proves to be very costly. So, we are doing it as per zones. That way, revenue is collected from a zone, development is done and people face no problems./Gurugram has been known to be a place without religious tensions. Over the last one month, this has got spoilt over the namaz issue. What are your thoughts on that?/Maintaining social harmony is our responsibility. There is an influx of people from outside the state, outside the district.

Otherwise, namaz can be done at home. Praying is not a matter of collective exhibition. People pray in a temple and at home also. This is a personal matter of faith - a show of strength is not necessary. This goes for everyone, be it Hindus or Muslims./If a casual programme has to be organised, it should be done with after taking permission. They say, why do jagrans happen. They happen with permission. Or they should happen after taking permission. Processions happen. They will happen in society. There is Ram Navami procession, Muharram procession. They shouldn't be stopped but carried out after taking permission. Everyone will have to fulfill this social responsibility./Air pollution is a big problem in Gurugram. The effect of stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab is seen till Delhi. What is being done to prevent it?/It's a wrong perception that stubble burning causes pollution in Delhi to rise. Stubble burning should not happen. Even NGT (National Green Tribunal) has said that this is not the case. There are so many other reasons such as building construction work, industrial smoke, vehicular emissions. At the inauguration of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway by the Prime Minister, (Union minister) Mr (Nitin) Gadkari said in his speech that pollution in Delhi will be reduced by 27% due to that road. Traffic from north India crosses Delhi to go to west or south India./Its impact is felt more at night. Trucks go blaring horns with no norms in place. The permanent solution to it is the eastern and western peripheral highway, which is also called KMP. Once ready, major traffic will be diverted./Can the government reassure people of Gurugram that enough is being done in terms of monitoring and interstate coordination to fight air pollution?/KMP and KGP (Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal) road will benefit Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi. Our CNG-based city bus service will start soon. That will cut vehicular pollution./There will be 500 buses, and 200 of them will be rolled out in the first phase. Later, they will be air-conditioned. When the full fleet of buses are on Gurugram roads, local traffic will come down. Today most people drive their own cars and scooters. Vehicles will become fewer once the Metro is expanded./Commuters from west Delhi, who come via Dhaula Kuan, will be able to come from Dwarka Sector 21.

The work at IFFCO Chowk is almost complete. Some of it is held up because a petrol pump located there can't be removed due to a stay from the court. That's why one of its carriageways is not complete. I have also recently laid the foundation stone at Atul Kataria Chowk. So all the traffic bottlenecks have been taken care of./But there's still work to be done. We want to expand the Metro further, especially to Old Gurugram. The planning is on and mapping is being done. We want to connect Dwarka Sector 21 with the Metro so that west Delhi gets integrated with Gurugram./Similarly, Dwarka Expressway is a big project costing Rs.7,000 crore. The land near a colony in Palam Vihar had to be acquired. There were 60-65 flats and 35-40 of them are left to be acquired. The rest have got a stay from the court. But I hope the stay will be lifted and we will give them alternative plots. When Dwarka Expressway is ready and Metro is connected, Gurugram's traffic problems will be solved./RERA (Real Estate Regulation Authority) has started functioning for real estate problems. It has two units. One is for Gurugram and another for Haryana, which is based in Panchkula./A new development will be a global city project spread over 1,200 acres. The KMP (Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway) should start in two months, paving the way for an economic corridor. Many of our plans have been successful and the rest are being taken gradually./The biggest achievement was starting Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). Earlier, Gurugram was managed from Chandigarh. Now, all problems of Gurugram will be solved in the city itself./What has been the experience of GMDA since it started work five months ago?/It has been good. It's said that Gurugram has not been able to become a Smart City. I say that Gurugram will become a Super Smart City. Currently, Faridabad and Karnal are our Smart Cities but corresponding work as per the given parameters has not even started there. But many things have started in Gurugram because of GMDA. The tender for an Integrated Control System has been floated in the city. The report on the CCTV system will also be ready by June 15. Gurugram is progressing faster than all those Smart Cities./Will the concentration of people and offices in sectors near Delhi further spread out when the global city is ready?/It will go up to Manesar. And after the KMP and Dwarka Expressway is ready, traffic from there won't have to pass through Gurugram./When will the Dwarka and KMP expressways be ready for use?/We have requested the Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone for the Dwarka Expressway. It can be done even remotely. If that happens soon, the road can be ready in six to eight months./KMP will not take more than three months. I recently did an aerial survey of KMP starting from Kundli. There are six or seven patches or cross-sections which have to be completed. There is no problem of acquisition there./What was your first experience of Gurugram? Did you ever think it would become a developed city like it has?/Gurugram was witnessing a hotchpotch type of development. It used to bother me. So I took up one issue after another. We spoke to DLF about their problems. We also spoke to the Metro corporation. We convened a meeting of the power sector. Many problems of the power sector still exist, especially those related to the builders. They have installed gensets but they don't pay the charges to the power department. So we are roping in Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) to put pressure on the builders. Similarly, we are seeking the help of RWAs to sort out power-related problems in colonies./For how long have you been coming to Gurugram?/Since long before forming the government in the state. We used to be surprised to see NH8 coming up because the city used to be very small at that time. We wondered why the government was spending so much money on building such a big road and for what? This was as early as 1980. During that time, people used only the Old Delhi road. But we realised its need when we found out more about the expansion plan./While Gurugram became the source of revenue for the government and an attraction for people, the political authorities also found scope to bungle, which is why many people are embroiled in inquiries and court cases today. Many wrongdoings had happened here. But we said we won't let them happen anymore./We have heard the problems of real estate companies too. Within the parameters of law, we have helped them make things right. Some were allowed to pay in instalments, policy was framed to ensure their work is not stalled. Others were given an extension of two years beyond the licence period of five years, otherwise they would have been ruined. We have also increased the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) from 150 to 300. It's even higher in Noida. We have transit-oriented development (TOD) policy, which allows higher FAR along the metro track to facilitate higher concentration of people. Traffic problems can be avoided then./Some people say that the best and the worst thing about Gurugram is real estate. Do you agree that there are a lot of problems in this sector?/It's right. The thing is that some real estate companies found ways to expand more than their capacity. But it was wrong and many even failed. The government has nothing to do with what happens with a private company. Whatever is going on between them and the company should be fair. That is our only concern. For that, we have created RERA. If the companies still fail, we will act according to the legal system in place./Noida started developing much before Gurugram. How did Gurugram manage to win the race?/Gurugram has an advantage of location over Noida. It's nearer to the airport than to Delhi. That is a reason why Gurugram could figure on the international scene. People had once started moving away from Gurugram but their confidence was restored./We took a number of steps to sort out their problems such as creating a one-roof system for all clearances./Do you mean the labour problems that had escalated in Gurugram?/There was a problem with Maruti, then Hero. That problem is not there. There is an understanding between the two sides. Court was involved, companies pulled away, labour also realised that they were at a loss. But we will not allow exploitation of labour. We have brought changes in labour laws. We brought four amendments in labour laws due to which companies expressed their protest./We explained to them it was not right to let unrest persist among the labour. They are also human beings. They should get the facilities on humanitarian ground./If we have to compete in the world, we should not do it by exploiting labour./The monsoon is on its way. People still remember the 'Gurujam'./It won't happen again. Now the Hero Honda Chowk has an underpass. The 10-metre road has been widened to acquire 10 metres more. There were about 70 three-storey houses that were pulled down. People were given alternative plots and money for construction. We did it on priority./Zoning is a problem in Gurugram. Initially, real estate development happened quite randomly. Is sector-wise planning happening now?/The development plan has to be followed and it's beneficial to not tweak it unless an unforeseen problem arises. Zoning is done with public consultation and projections are made. In Gurugram, sectors 1 to 55 are old sectors and 55 to 115 are new. The new ones were opened without infrastructure development. So we have made four zones there. Problems in the first zone, be it companies, home-dwellers, utilities, will be fixed first. Then, move on to the next zone./Developers will have to construct according to our zones and not randomly by developing in a vacant zone. Roads, sewage lines, power infrastructure have to be constructed for an entire sector even if there are just 10 houses there./That proves to be very costly. So, we are doing it as per zones. That way, revenue is collected from a zone, development is done and people face no problems./Gurugram has been known to be a place without religious tensions. Over the last one month, this has got spoilt over the namaz issue. What are your thoughts on that?/Maintaining social harmony is our responsibility. There is an influx of people from outside the state, outside the district. People say many Bangladeshi Muslims have also come, though there is no survey on it./The central government has to do a survey on it. With numbers increasing, places of worship have to be increased. Such things will happen if the places of worship are not increased. So we said that everyone should offer namaz in mosques and idgahs. Others can offer it at private places. It should not be offered in public places. It's alright till no one objects. But if someone does, we will have to check it. Because law and order situation has to be maintained./Offering namaz on roads is not appropriate. I have given this statement and also received a good response. People in the society have said that is right. We have stopped it at some places where it used to happen and people have found it convenient. Administration has earmarked 37 places after speaking with all groups. Right now, no one has a problem with namaz being offered at these 37 public places./If tomorrow there is a problem at any place, including these 37, we will again see what needs to be done./We have said, build mosques and idgahs. Otherwise, namaz can be done at home. Praying is not a matter of collective exhibition. People pray in a temple and at home also. This is a personal matter of faith - a show of strength is not necessary. This goes for everyone, be it Hindus or Muslims./If a casual programme has to be organised, it should be done with after taking permission. They say, why do jagrans happen. They happen with permission. Or they should happen after taking permission. Processions happen. They will happen in society. There is Ram Navami procession, Muharram procession. They shouldn't be stopped but carried out after taking permission. Everyone will have to fulfill this social responsibility./Air pollution is a big problem in Gurugram. The effect of stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab is seen till Delhi. What is being done to prevent it?/It's a wrong perception that stubble burning causes pollution in Delhi to rise. Stubble burning should not happen. Even NGT (National Green Tribunal) has said that this is not the case. There are so many other reasons such as building construction work, industrial smoke, vehicular emissions. At the inauguration of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway by the Prime Minister, (Union minister) Mr (Nitin) Gadkari said in his speech that pollution in Delhi will be reduced by 27% due to that road. Traffic from north India crosses Delhi to go to west or south India./Its impact is felt more at night. Trucks go blaring horns with no norms in place. The permanent solution to it is the eastern and western peripheral highway, which is also called KMP. Once ready, major traffic will be diverted./Can the government reassure people of Gurugram that enough is being done in terms of monitoring and interstate coordination to fight air pollution?/KMP and KGP (Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal) road will benefit Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi. Our CNG-based city bus service will start soon. That will cut vehicular pollution./There will be 500 buses, and 200 of them will be rolled out in the first phase. Later, they will be air-conditioned. When the full fleet of buses are on Gurugram roads, local traffic will come down. Today most people drive their own cars and scooters. Vehicles will become fewer once the Metro is expanded./Commuters from west Delhi, who come via Dhaula Kuan, will be able to come from Dwarka Sector 21. Once the Dwarka Expressway is in use, concentration of vehicles will spread out. Pollution happens when the vehicles are not moving./Is there a time frame for procuring 500 buses and expansion of metro?/Like I said, 200 buses will start from August 15. The rest will come in phases. Planning on Metro is on. Once it is done, construction takes up to two years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

World Environment Day: Choked...and gasping!,"India, June 5 -- CRUSADERS.?On World Environment Day, HT profiles some green enthusiasts working to save the planet from being stifled by pollution./'PARKS, NATURAL RESERVOIRS ARE MODERN-DAY TEMPLES'/The 79-year-old spunky environmentalist Prabha Chaturvedi doesn't belive in planting trees on World Environment Day./""We (she and her associates) don't work towards the cause of a better environment just for the sake of it. That is why we don't believe in ceremoniously planting trees on one particular day. We plant them just before the monsoon season,"" said the president of Exnora Lucknow, a group that works for conserving the environment./Along with members of the Paper Mill Colony Ladies' Association and Exnora Lucknow, Prabha works at various levels to help protect the nature. She is especially credited for the renovation and maintenance of the parks in Paper Mill Colony./""We started 25 years ago, in 1994. The Paper Mill Colony was constructed in 1960 by the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA), and as part of it, five to six parks were also created. However, 30 years later, the parks were in a terrible condition,"" recalled Prabha, while narrating the beginnings of her journey as a committed environmentalist./""They weren't parks at all. There was rubble all over the place, a lot of filth and garbage. People used to climb the walls of the parks and some also used them for marriages."" Prabha said, adding that unable to accept the mismanagement, she decided to form a group of the colony's women to work on the problem./""Through public cooperation, we were able to bring about an appreciable change in the condition of the Akshay Barman Park here. Following that success, more women of the colony joined us and all the parks in this area started improving slowly,"" she said./Prabha also holds environment awareness sessions in schools. "" We have covered almost all schools in the city. It is important to educate the coming generations about conserving the environment, as it is the children who will have to take care of the resources in future. I leave no opportunity to talk to children about environment,"" said Prabha./Her dedication to the cause is evident by how she compares parks to temples. ""These parks and natural reservoirs are modern-day temples. Saving them is the biggest prayer one can offer, the biggest religion one can follow,"" she said./GREEN WOMAN WARRIOR HOPES TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE/Varanasi: Be it engaging with budding artists to paint or teaching over 500 school children the importance of conservation of trees, this activist has been striving to spread a message to save the environment./Meet Ekta Shekhar, the activist, who led several awareness marches in Varanasi and adjoining areas to make people aware about the environment to motivate people to plant more saplings. She also organised a solar energy based auto rickshaw rally between Varanasi and Lucknow, covering Allahabad and other cities on the way. In May, she also organised a unique protest in which activists marched with coffins and demanded the Pollution Control Board officials to take measures for controlling pollutions. They also staged a sit-in protest with coffins./""Mother nature is very kind. She gives everything free. Nature provides free air to breathe and free water to drink. Forests thrive and rivers flow freely in Mother Nature's lap. But man's greed led to indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources which has further resulted in global warming,"" Shekhar says./Global warming is serious threat to environment. Extreme weather conditions-chilling winters, scorching summers and devastating floods- are outcome of global warming. As trees were hacked haphazardly, the pollution level increased and there has been alarming rise in air pollution. Because of air pollution, many people are contracting respiratory diseases./She, however, is confident of bringing a change with the support of people by motivating them to plant more saplings. Ekta's creative campaigns drew attention towards growing air pollution./She actively campaigned and urged political parties to include their planning for environment conservation in their respective poll manifestoes./She has been working for the environment for the last six years. At present, she motivates people to turn to solar energy based vehicles and other equipment that can be operated through solar energy to reduce the dependency on electricity./""I am making a serious effort. Because of our efforts, now a large number of people know what is good and bad for the environment. Many of them strictly follow the dos and dont's,"" Ekta says./Efforts to motivate people in order to encourage them to start using environment-friendly vehicles, stop wasting water and exploiting natural resources will continue. Planting more and more trees is a way to purify air which has become polluted because of the gases emitted by diesel and petrol operated vehicles./Her husband Ravi Shekhar says, ""She is also going to become a mother next week as she is nine months pregnant. Even in this condition, she organised a demonstration and walks for the cause of environment. She is also attending awareness rallies for the cause.""/Ravi goes on to say a would-be mother is serving Mother Nature and he supports her as much as he can. But she is the lead campaigner who works tirelessly and has motivated several fine art students who draw painting on walls to create awareness about the environment./Surabhi recently completed her MFA from MGKV. She works as a volunteer with Ekta for the environment cause. Surabhi, along with other volunteers, has drawn a number of paintings on walls in various areas of Varanasi, appealing to people to contribute to the efforts. ""I want to be a professor. Even after joining the varsity in future, I will continue working for the environment,"" she says./NATURE WARRIOR WHO SHOOTS WITH A CAMERA/Lucknow: Nature, for the residents of Alinagar, a small village in Lakhimpur Kheri, goes beyond their farms, cattle and wild animals they have seen. It stretches from mountains till the ocean, to which they were introduced through pictures taken by a fellow villager./""I try to make the people of my village understand how vivid, rich and beautiful our planet is. This makes it easy to understand the issues related to environment,"" explained Satpal Singh ,28, an acclaimed photographer./Despite having received several photography awards, Satpal decided to continue to work from the village. His aversion to city life and concern for depleting environment are the reasons . ""I want to begin the process of change from my home and my village,"" Singh said./Born in a farmers' household, Satpal took up photography as a hobby exactly a decade ago. He bought his first camera-a DSLR- with money borrowed from his mother and didn't reveal it to his father or other villagers till late. ""I thought people would make fun of me for moving around with a camera,"" Satpal said . He came over this inhibition slowly after his pictures started getting appreciation./Satpal was awarded in several photography competitions in the country. He also received an award from the chief minister of Uttarakhand. The biggest recognition came when he won the Nature's Best Photography Asia Award in 2015 and was called to Washington DC, USA for the award ceremony. The award not only put Satpal on the world stage but also changed his perception towards nature. ""I met some very motivated people, dedicated to protecting the environment they live in. Interaction with them introduced me to a facet of environment conservation I was unaware of,"" Satpal said./The stimulus he got in the US made Satpal relocate to his village and begin work for environment conservation. ""I want everyone in my village and nearby towns to understand the importance of clean environment. Once it is done, people will start taking steps to protect it themselves,"" he said ./Apart from pictures, Satpal opened a public library in the nearby town of Mohammadi where locals can read about nature. He also organise free photography classes for villagers. Those who cannot afford a camera are taught using a camera phone. Plan for an interactive online sessions is also in the pipeline. His lessons start with the phrase,""A picture is worth a thousand words"" and those who truly understand it are better photographers, according to him./Married, with two children, Satpal divides his time in taking picture of the nature around him, reading, completing assignments and farming. ""I come from a family of farmers and working in field is an inseparable part of me. It helps me to stay grounded and relate more closely to the environment I wish to protect,"" Satpal said, quoting Mahatma Gandhi. ""To forget how to dig the earth and to tend the soil is to forget ourselves.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Dust collectors in grain markets soon to curb air pollution: PPCB,"Chandigarh, June 12 -- Dust pollution in grain markets that poses a huge risk to the health of thousands of farmers and workers will be a thing of the past. The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has decided to install mechanical grain clears to curb air pollution./Announcing this, PPCB chairman Kahan Singh Pannu said the dust not only increases pollution but is the main cause of respiratory and lung diseases among labourers, farmers and those residing near the grain markets. ""We took air samples from 10 main grain markets of the state and found that RPMs (Respirable Particulate Matter) was five to eight times more than the prescribed limit of 100 microgram per cubic metre, he said on Monday./Pannu said the board has developed a dust collector to check air pollution during the cleaning process of crops. ""These dust collectors can preserve 80 to 90% of the dust particles,"" he added./There are 50,000 mechanical grain cleaners in the grain markets in the state which produce a lot of dust and an estimated six workers works on single machine. Nearly three lakh workers are affected by dust pollution./""With dust mounting machines fitted on mechanical grain cleaners, 90% dust will accumulate in them, thereby helping to keep the environment clean,"" said the PPCB chairman./This machine was successfully tested in Asia's largest grain market Khanna./The board is taking steps to make the machine mandatory on mechanical grain cleaners in all the grain markets./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Haze descends on hot, dusty Delhi-NCR as air pollution shoots up to Winter levels","India, June 13 -- A sudden haze descended upon Delhi and its neighbouring areas on Tuesday as the air quality plummeted into the severely polluted category, bringing back memories of November when the city's air reached dangerous levels of pollution./Tuesday's pollution was driven by dust particles classified as PM10, which are roughly a fifth of the width of a human hair. From 138 at 6pm on Sunday evening, the PM10 concentration index shot up to 433 at 8pm on Tuesday, a trend that experts attributed to a switch of wind direction./In November 2017, the air quality index (AQI) remained over 400 for around a fortnight, due to pollution from farm fires. At that time, the main pollutant was PM2.5, which is linked to more fatal health conditions than PM10./The safe limit for PM10 is 100ug/m3, and readings above 430ug/m3 are considered severe./""Strong westerly winds are blowing across Delhi with a speed of 35-40 km per hour since Monday. An anti-cyclonic flow over northwest India is channelising these winds towards Delhi, which is why a lot of dust is coming in from across Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, a senior scientist with the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) in New Delhi./Another expert said the strong winds are also kicking up local dust pollution./""Unlike in winter, it was only PM10 which shot up on Tuesday. The level of PM2.5 didn't rise. This denotes that it was mainly atmospheric dust pollution which shot up. This can happen when there are strong surface winds blowing over a long time,"" said Mohan P George, who heads the Delhi Pollution Control Committee's air quality division./Air pollutants such as particulate matter trigger allergies, cough, lung infections, heart disease and even irreversible lung damage./Dust pollution has been uncharacteristically high this summer, which has recorded several storms./""There was nearly 30 - 40% increase in the number of patients with asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) coming to the clinics the day after the dust storms. The proportion seems high because anyway we get very few respiratory cases in the summers,"" said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology and sleep disorders at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh./At the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, visibility dropped from 3.5km in the morning to around 1.5km by Tuesday evening. ""This is the worst visibility we have encountered at the airport in recent times on a normal day when there are no dust storms,"" said RK Jenamani, head of the aviation meteorology services of Delhi region and IGI Airport./Delhi is not the only city to be affected.

"Spike in respiratory ailments after dust storms, say doctors","NEW DELHI, June 13 -- A series of dust storms across the NCR in the past few weeks has sent Delhiites rushing to doctors with respiratory ailments. Such a high proportion of respiratory issues are only seen during high levels of air pollution in winters, doctors said./Some doctors noticed a significant spike in cases of patients with respiratory ailments. ""There was a nearly 30-40% increase in number of patients with asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) coming to the clinics on the day after the dust storms. The proportion seems high because anyway we get few respiratory cases in summer,"" said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of department of pulmonology and sleep disorders at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh./Dr Rajesh Chawla, consulting pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, on the other hand, said he did not get as many patients in his clinic as he usually advises his patients to increase their medications during adverse weather conditions. ""But, there was a noticeable increase in the number of people who called me to check increases in the dose of their medicines and even inhalers,"" he said./""The symptoms of respiratory illnesses are not so bad during the warmer months, so patients tend to cut their regular medicines on their own and even miss followups. This increases the chances of attacks and aggravation of symptoms whenever there is a potent allergen like dust in the air,"" said Dr Maurya./The best thing is to avoid the dust as much as possible, doctors said. ""Asthmatics and people with known respiratory conditions should always keep an eye out for weather forecasts and try to stay indoors if there is a prediction of dust storm. If they have to step out, they must use a mask and travel in cars with windows rolled up,"" said Dr Maurya./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"15 killed in UP dust storms, flights cancelled in Delhi and Chandigarh as haze engulfs north India","India, June 14 -- A cloud of dust hung over vast swathes of north Indian plains for the third day in a row on Thursday, spiking air pollution levels and prompting authorities to suspend civil construction works in Delhi and Haryana. It also affected flight services at Chandigarh airport./In Uttar Pradesh, dust and thunder storms hit various parts, leaving 15 people dead and 28 injured since Wednesday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the air quality deteriorated because of dust storms in western India, particularly Rajasthan./A spokesman of the Uttar Pradesh government said, ""Fifteen people were killed in dust storm (since Wednesday). Six died in Sitapur, three each in Gonda and Kaushambi, and one each in Faizabad, Hardoi and Chitrakoot."" Besides, 17 people were injured in Sitapur and 11 in Faizabad, he said./Authorities in UP said dusty conditions are likely to prevail for another 3-4 days and advised people to avoid staying outdoors for long hours./Low visibility led to cancellation of all flights to and from Chandigarh International Airport. ""No flight landed or took off from Chandigarh until Thursday afternoon due to bad weather,"" an airport official said./In Delhi, airport officials said bad weather forced at least 27 flights to remain grounded on Thursday. Fourteen flight departures from Delhi and 13 incoming flights to the national capital remained cancelled, an official said./The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has issued an advisory that no construction activities, hot mix plants and stone crushers be operated for the next two days./""Delhi and NCR areas and other parts of Haryana have been experiencing severe air pollution due to dust storm with the PM 2.5 value crossing even 500g/m3 and considerably higher PM10 values,"" stated the HSPCB advisory./""A veil of dust spread over the plains of Uttarakhand for the second consecutive day today (Thursday), reducing the harshness of the sun but adding to humidity levels.

She is waging a war on pollution,"Gurugram, June 14 -- Ruchika Sethi, a resident of Nirvana Country in Sector 50, shifted to Gurugram from Noida in 2008 with her husband and her 16-year-old daughter in search of a cleaner environment. The former general manager of a textile company and an advocate for child safety and inclusion, Sethi left her job in 2002 to look after her daughter, Manavi, who was diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder. ""That is when I started paying attention to the external environment and how it has a direct effect on our health,"" she said./Ironically, in 2012, Sethi came to know that an empty plot next to the boundary of her society was a common site for waste burning. Out of curiosity, she visited the spot to find that it was the society's horticultural waste that was being dumped and burnt there. ""When I questioned the workers who were dumping the waste, they told me that if they don't dump the waste there, they'll eventually dump it somewhere else,"" 46-year-old Sethi recalled. ""According to doctors, the main causes of upper respiratory disorders in Gurugram are the smoke from the rampant waste burning and the dust from construction and demolition waste,"" she said./Concerned over the rising air pollution, Sethi, in 2016, started a citizens' movement which was named Citizens for Clean Air (CFCA). ""Nearly 400 people including RUCHIKA SETHI, founder, Citizens for Clean Air, and resident of Nirvana Country, Sector 50 health professionals and mothers joined us in our first protest against waste burning in November 2016, at Leisure Valley in Sector 29. Soon, the community started growing; people started asking what they can do to help. We listed out ways like composting, recycling, segregation, etc, "" Sethi said. The CFCA group has a strong social media presence, with around 250 members a part of its Whatsapp group who actively help each other embrace sustainable ways of living./The group sent a petition, signed by 25,000 residents, to the municipal corporation in October last year, identifying problems of open garbage dumping and burning and provided possible solutions. ""People could identify with the local triggers,"" she said. ""A few children went door to door and collected thousands of signatures. But when I, representing the signatories, approached the MCG, the officials were dismissive and didn't want to recognise the problem. That's when you realise you don't have a voice in the city. We were not only putting out problems but had also presented a roadmap. We wanted them to build the infrastructure for waste management.""/Sethi said her movement's aim is to address both civic and civil apathy, and make the residents a part of the solution. ""I wish that each person feels empowered enough that he at his home and community can provide solutions, and question the government,"" she said. However, her fight hasn't been an easy one. ""I have even trailed tractor trolleys carrying garbage to the point that my husband says I'll get into trouble one day,"" she said./""After spotting multiple instances of mass burning of waste, I soon realised that you can only report a civic deficiency but the authorities don't have a ready solution, which is why, starting 2014, I started researching on how we can curb the garbage menace,"" she said. ""I found that all the laws for waste management were already in place in the city. The real problem was the city's poor infrastructure and the lack of initiative on part of the civic bodies.""/In 2015, Sethi came up with a campaign titled 'Why waste your waste' in which she encouraged residents to treat waste at their homes. Sethi, who herself practices waste segregation and composting at home, showed residents how they can reduce and manage their waste by segregating, composting and managing both dry and wet waste./Sethi then actively started meeting and providing solutions to the district administration to curb pollution. However, their lack of enthusiasm to fix the problem shows a collective civic apathy, she said./On the brighter side, Sethi said, residents of the city are ready to replace conveniences with a growing eco-consciousness. ""There is an opportunity to cull out a beautiful identity for the city, which is healthy, sustainable and liveable. But these voices are of people who are already invested here. The question is how can we make these people matter.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

"Practical tips to protect yourself from air pollution, dust, smog","India, June 15 -- A thick haze has currently enveloped Delhi and nearby areas, with levels of PM10, a measure of pollution, being eight times the permissible limit. The air quality is 'severely bad' and it could spell disaster for your respiratory health./Dr Arvind Kumar, director, Institute of Robotic surgery and chairman, center for chest surgery &#38; lung transplantation at Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, says, ""Exposure to pollution over longer period of time is also one of the reasons for developing lung cancer. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer, in India effecting around 63,000 people every year. The particles present in the air that we are breathing will definitely go inside and harm us.""/Ways to shield yourself from air pollution:/* One of the easiest precautions we can take to reduce the impact is to wear a N95 grade mask, which fits snugly around the mouth and nose, so that all air passes through the mask. A basic surgical mask actually offers no protection against air-pollutants and microbes./* To avoid indoor air pollution, say yes to potted plants. Surround your home with areca palm, rubber plant and peace lilies./* Also quit indoor smoking, which is a big cause of indoor air pollution./* If you feel any irritation in your throat, boil half a teaspoon of turmeric in water. Add a teaspoon of honey and drink the concoction in the morning./* Adopt a Mediterranean diet. It's low in meat and dairy but rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts and 'healthy' fats. A study by the New York University School of Medicine in the US earlier this year shows that following a Mediterranean diet may protect people from some of the harms of air pollution, and reduce their risk of dying from heart attacks and stroke./If you have asthma, follow these precautions:/""Asthma patients should take regular doses of inhaled steroids. It has completely changed the lives of people with asthma. If you have persistent wheezing, don't forget to take your steroid inhaler with you and keep it on in the regular dose. There are a small percentage of patients who don't need a regular inhaler. Keep your inhaler handy, so that if you feel uncomfortable, you can immediately take a dose,"" says Dr Sujeet Rajan, chest physician, Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai./If you're hesitant about taking inhaled steroids, like a lot of people are, rest easy. Dr Rajan assures that it's completely safe. In fact, he adds, they are safe for pregnant women, young children and are also taken by Olympic athletes./""If you suffer a sever attack because of a dust storm, you can take an emergency dose of prednisolone - an oral steroid. New guidelines suggest that every asthmatic patient should keep it nearby, even if you have mild asthma,"" he adds./If you have severe asthma, it's advisable to not step out at all./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Changes show air pollution is not just a winter problem,"NEWDELHI, June 15 -- The unusually high concentration of particulate matter in the last few days in North India clearly shows that air pollution is not a seasonal problem anymore. As the climate gets warmer and frequency of rains reduces, such spurts in coarse particles making breathing difficult will become a new normal, unless governments wake up to the alarm./The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest assessment says that planet can bear only up to a 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature from the pre-industrial era levels. The world had already wa- rmed by 0.9 degrees Celsius till 2015 and at the present pace of emissions, climate scientists say, the IPCC mark will get breached latest by 2050./The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has said that both the periodicity and duration of dry spells in the country were rising as the total rainfall events in a year had fallen even though the average rainfall in a year has not changed much, a direct consequence of climate change. The annual average rainfall has remained the same because the frequency of heavy downpours (for example, the June 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand) has increased in the past two decades./During dry spells, the earth gets heated up and moisture in the atmosphere dips, creating depressions that pull winds from the oceans. As there is less rain and the green barriers in and around cities have been destroyed, the winds lift dust and local emissions, causing a spurt in air pollution. Such events have been higher in 2018 -- a year of freaky weather that witnessed three killer thunderstorms in May before this dust-laden westerly -- because the average rainfall since November 2017 has been about 60% below normal./The impact could have been substantially reduced had governments - the states and the Centre - made air pollution mitigation a round-the-clock exercise, and not restricted it to winter months, when the pollution is high. As a result, most of North India is covered under a veil of dust haze with air pollution worse than that in the winter months./Blaming only weather conditions would be a colossal mistake./It is a man-made catastrophe that impacts health of one and all, as half of the air pollution spurt is caused by local dust in the absence of proper roadside landscaping and emissions from industry and vehicles. In the coming years, we can prevent such events by ensuring that every city implements the Centre's dust-management plan, there are restrictions on registration of new fuel-guzzling vehicles, and green dust barriers are developed around cities./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

""I initially dismissed a heaving cough but it got worse. Even when I open my mouth to eat, I can feel a ball of dust in my mouth,"" he said./Dr Arunesh, senior consultant, pulmonology, Paras Hospital, said that he was visited by two patients who complained of respiratory issues on Thursday./""Subjects with chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, are especially vulnerable to the detrimental effects of air pollutants. Air pollution can induce the acute exacerbation of COPD and onset of asthma, and increase the respiratory morbidity and mortality,"" he said./Patients with such issues are being treated with steam inhalations, systemic steroids, nebuliser machines and antibiotics./""Many of the worst health effects of consistent bad air quality will not be seen for years to come. The fine pollutant particles travel deep inside the lungs and increases the chances of a person developing chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart diseases,"" he said./Doctors recommended the use of N95 respirators when stepping outside. ""I have asked my patients to stay indoors as much as possible. Patients with severe breathing problems have been asked to take their medication on time,"" said Dr Goel./Dr Arunesh advised residents to visit a doctor if their symptoms worsen. ""Don't wait till it gets too bad,"" he said./Officials of the Indian Meteorological Department said that it might rain on June 17 and 18, which would weaken the strong winds and bring down the pollution level./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

'Breathing PM 2.5 polluted air akin to smoking cigarette',"Patna, July 8 -- If you think your lungs are healthy because you do not smoke cigarettes, you are wrong. On an average, you smoke around six cigarettes daily in a year, according to a report of Berkeley Earth Science Research group. It was attended by doctors, cancer specialists, journalists and environment specialists, who discussed the issues, causes and remedies./Dr Arvind Kumar, chest specialist, Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, speaking at a conference organised by Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) here on Saturday, said that 22 micrograms per cubic metre of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was equivalent to smoking one cigarette./""India is at an alarming stage when it comes to air pollution. Our country stands first on the list of total deaths due to lung diseases. No one in the country is unaffected with air pollution. The most affected groups are children, senior citizens, and the unborn children. This is the reason why asthma is detected in the children and newborn babies because they are exposed to polluted air even before being born,"" he added./The issue of Patna's air quality, which had been far worse than India's most polluted city, New Delhi, was also discussed. Pollution was hazardous in Patna during the last four winter months as the ambient air quality went from 'poor' to 'very poor', with particulate matter (PM) in the air rising nine times than the national standard, according to an earlier report of the CEED. It said the monthly mean concentration of PM in Patna was recorded to be highest in the month of December, which rose to 263 g/m3 followed by November, when it was 253 g/m3./Discussing the findings of Lancet Commission Report on air quality crisis and its health impacts, Gagandeep K Walia of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), said, ""Pollution is not a problem of rich, but it directly or indirectly also affects the poor,"" he said./He said that nearly 92% of the pollution related deaths occurred in the low and middle-income country./""Up to seven per cent of health spending in heavily polluted, rapidly developing middle-income countries goes to care for people made sick by pollution. High-income countries have achieved this progress while growing GDP by nearly 250%,"" he added./In 2015, diseases caused by air, water and soil pollution were responsible for 9 million premature deaths, that is 16% of all global deaths. Exposures to contaminated air, water and soil kill more people than hunger, natural disasters, war, AIDS and malaria./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Plans underway to prevent rise in air pollution in Pune: Bapat,"India, July 11 -- Girish Bapat, Pune district guardian minister, said that an action plan by experts would soon be implemented in the city to address the issue of rising air pollution. The minister said that as an immediate measure, sulphur content in diesel would be reduced and electric and CNG vehicles would be encouraged./Speaking to media in Nagpur on the sidelines of the assembly session on Tuesday, Bapat said, ""The air quality index (AQI) of Pune shows that city's air quality is deteriorating. Authorities have been directed to immediately reduce sulphur content in diesel.""/Sulphur content in diesel is one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution./""With this Pune will now be supplied with petrol and diesel of Bharat Stage IV standard,"" said Bapat, adding that apart from this, electric vehicles and vehicles driven on CNG would be encouraged while urban street design and roads are being considered to ensure less air pollution in the city./According to the minister, the issue of air pollution was discussed in detail in the assembly. ""With rising job opportunities the influx of people in Pune is rising. With rising population, the number of vehicles has also gone up. With this, in the past eight years, there has been substantial rise in particulate matter in the city. Pune is amongst the most polluted cities of the country.""/Bapat said that an action plan was prepared collectively by the traffic department, road department, construction department and pollution control board./""As per the action plan, vehicles which are more than 12 years old were banned in the city. Subsidy of close to Rs.12,000 was given to autorickshaws for switching to CNG. The urban street design was implemented which has cycle track, storm water drains among other things,"" he said./The minister said that a special road maintenance van was procured to check for potholes in the roads. He said that in the last five years the usage of CNG in Pune has increased from 20,000 metric tonnes to 80,000 metric tonnes./""To address the issue of garbage, 18 projects of bio methanization have been started in Pune and efforts are being made to substitute diesel generators with solar generators,"" Bapat said./Mangesh Dighe, environment officer, PMC said, ""The rise in air pollutants is mainly because of the rise in the number of vehicles in the city. Pollutants like nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and sulphur are a result of the smoke emitted from the vehicle's exhaust.

Air pollution is depriving Delhi of vitamin D: Study,"Mumbai, July 28 -- Increasing air pollution levels in Delhi over the last 15 years is depriving its citizens of Vitamin D - the essential sunshine vitamin, finds a new study./New research by Delhi-based CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (NPL) found that an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD), which indicates the amount of direct sunlight that is prevented from reaching the earth's surface by aerosols particles, has reduced solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation over the country's capital. Aerosols are solid and liquid particles in the atmosphere originating from burning of agriculture waste and fossil fuels, and natural sources like windblown dust storms, volcanic ash and sea salts./""The ever increasing aerosol pollution over Delhi (due to industrialisation and urbanisation) during last one and a half decade might be one of the main reasons for decreasing trend of UVA and UVB. Such a significant decrease in UVB surface radiation over Delhi is alarming and may be related to Vitamin D deficiency in human population over the region,"" stated the study whose principal investigator Sachchidanand Singh is affiliated to the environmental sciences and biomedical metrology division, CSIR-NPL./The study was published in Atmospheric Environment, an international peer reviewed journal, last month./Solar ultraviolet radiation in the range of 100 nanometres (nm) to 400 nm is divided into three bands, UVC (100-280 nm), UVB (280-315 nm) and UVA (315-400 nm). Using monthly data retrieved from Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES) developed for NASA's Earth Observing Satellite, between March 2000 and February 2016, the six-member team found an average 10% decrease in UVA and 20% decrease in UVB with an increase in AOD. More than 90% of UV reaching the earth's surface is UVA; excess exposure is linked to health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UVB -most of which is absorbed by the earth's atmosphere - is a major source of vitamin D in humans./Various international and national studies have linked air pollution to cardiovascular diseases, respiratory ailments, and premature mortality./Results of NPL-led study assumes significance in the backdrop of an April report by ASSOCHAM Healthcare Committee which pegged that about 8 out of 10 people or 80% of Delhi's population suffers from Vitamin D deficiency with the highest concentration among those in the age group of 21-35 years./Low Vitamin D levels can lead to bone mineralisation resulting in bone softening diseases such as rickets among children, and osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults./Experts said rising levels of air pollution in Delhi has restricted its citizens to indoors resulting in lower than required level of exposure to the sun, which leads to Vitamin D deficiency. ""Vitamin D is a very important fat soluble nutrient which helps ensure that the body absorbs and retains calcium and phosphorus. Both calcium and phosphorous are critical for bone formation and maintenance. Muscle strength is also affected by Vit D levels in our body,"" said Shweta Khandelwal, senior research scientist and associate professor, Public Health Foundation of India, Delhi./""Exposure to outside air pollution, especially PM2.5 (aerosols), is already linked to increasing number of health impacts. Linking AOD to the decrease in UV over the past 17 years is an important finding, further emphasizing the urgency to address air pollution problem at source,"" said Sarath Guttikunda, founder-director, Delhi-based UrbanEmissions.info, who was not involved in the study./Satellite and ground-based observations show a decrease in UVA and UVB in October and November due to high AOD levels, which research attribute to fossil fuel and biomass burning in north India. Maximum UVA and UVB radiation was during summer with highest in May and minimum in January. The CERES UVA and UVB data were compared with the measurements at NPL Delhi during October 2012 to September 2015 and were found to be in good agreement./Results showed that the daily average AOD (at 550 nanometres) ranged between 0.12 and 2.5 over Delhi during the study period. AOD levels in October and November was more than 1 that led to a decrease in UVA and UVB from reaching the earth's surface./The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organisation (NOAA), US, categorises AOD of 0.01 as extremely clean atmosphere, and 0.4 and above implies hazy conditions./During 2000-2016, an increase of 0.09 AOD resulted in a decrease of about 1.20 watt per square metre (W/m2) in UVA and 0.05 W/m2 in UVB reaching the earth's surface. Watts per square metre is the amount of power (or energy per second) that flows across a square metre surface./Trend analysis of monthly average for 17 years showed that UVA and UVB is decreasing at the rate of 0.07 W/m2 and 0.003 W/m2 every year with a 0.005 increase in AOD every year over Delhi./Along with AOD data, the team also retrieved cloud optical depth (COD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, which is payload aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, to analyse the effect of atmospheric opacity on UV radiation. COD measures the scale at which clouds prevent light from passing and reaching the earth's surface./The daily average COD (at 550 nanometres) ranged between 0.07 and 30. NOAA defines COD as higher the optical depth, thicker the clouds./AOD peaks in May and June due to dust storms, and as a result of local fossil fuel and biomass burning in October and November. As for COD, high value of more than 10 is seen during cloudy months of July-August and in December-January owing to foggy skies. AOD and COD values are low in February and September when skies are clear./""Our study indicates that the CERES-derived UVA and UVB surface fluxes compare well with ground-based measurements over Delhi. Therefore, these satellite products could be used for long term trend analysis over the entire region and for connecting UVB and reported Vitamin-D deficiency over the tropical region,"" stated the study./Guttikunda said there can be no short-term solutions to the problem of air pollution. Long-term solutions include promoting public transport, walking, and cycling; immediate implementation of environmental standards for heavy and light industries; greening of roads; waste management and alternatives to firing fields. ""One must note that firing fields takes place two-three weeks in a year, while rest of the sources emit all 52 weeks,"" he said./""Policy interventions for air pollution in general need to have a joint public health nutrition and environment lens. It is imperative to have policy makers from various ministries or departments like health, nutrition, agriculture and environment to sit in the same room and think of sustainable strategies to address these issues,"" said Shweta Khandelwal, senior research scientist and associate professor, Public Health Foundation of India, Delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurugram's air improves to 'poor' from 'very poor' after light rain on Monday,"Gurugram, Aug. 7 -- THE concentration of deadly particles (PM2.5) in Gurugram's air on Monday dipped to 83.4 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter of air) from 151.56ug/m3 on Sunday, following light rain. However, it still remained above the prescribed daily average safe limit of 60ug/m3, according to the CPCB'S National Ambient Air Quality standards./A Global Burden of Disease report published last year estimated that 1.1 million deaths in India were linked to PM 2.5 air pollution in 2015. Air pollutionlinked deaths in India could increase to 3.6 million by 2050 if no further actions are taken, according to a report published by the Health Effects Institute and Indian Institute of TechnologyBombay this year./The improvement in the PM2.5 levels was also reflected in the CPCB'S Air Quality Index bulletin. Gurugram's score was 215, putting city air in the 'poor' category, down from Sunday's 321, which classifies air quality as 'very poor'. Gurugram was the only city (of the 62 included in the AQI list) to be slotted in this category on Sunday, whereas New Delhi, Faridabad and Noida all had 'poor' air./The dip in level of PM2.5 pollutants can be attributed to light showers which precipitated over the city on Monday morning and evening, according to Dipankar Saha, former head of the CPCB'S Air Quality Lab in Delhi. ""With lowered wind speeds and temperatures prevailing at the moment, pollutants will remain trapped in the air unless there is rainfall to wash them out of the atmosphere,"" Saha said./With the city likely to receive light to moderate rainfall throughout the week, as predicted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the concentration of pollutants will likely reduce further in the next few days. ""Tuesday will see a generally cloudy sky with one or two spells of showers. The situation is likely to continue till at least Friday,"" said an IMD spokesperson./The maximum temperature on Tuesday is expected to be 30 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature is expected to be 26 degrees Celsius, as per the IMD. The maximum temperature will stay around 31 degrees Celsius the rest of the week./Monday saw very light spells of rain in the evening, however, the maximum temperature could not be recorded by the IMD due to a system failure./PM2.5 is linked to heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, lung cancer among adults and upper respiratory tract illnesses in children./Close to 15,000 people died prematurely in Delhi in 2016 from illnesses linked to fine particulate matter pollution, according to a study by researchers from India, Singapore and Thailand that assessed pollution-related deaths in 13 megacities in south Asia and China./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

'Air quality to be better this winter than 2017',"NEW DELHI, Aug. 27 -- Union minister Harsh Vardhan has weathered a storm for insisting that India cannot rely on international estimates for air pollution-related disease and deaths, pushing through a controversial DNA Technology Bill that critics say threatens privacy, getting the country's top labs to develop ""pollution-free"" firecrackers, and participating in his neighbourhood Ramlila./He spoke to HT's Health &#38; Science Editor Sanchita/Sharma about the controversies and the successes in his ministries' efforts to make India clean and green. Edited excerpts:/Should we expect cleaner air across north India this winter?/Absolutely, 100%. A lot of action has been taken to address all related aspects over the past couple of years./There was reasonable improvement in air quality in 2017 compared to 2016, and we will ensure 2018 is better than 2017. The 'good' and 'better' days (in terms of Air Quality Index) are more in number as compared to last year, and the 'bad' and 'worse' days are decreasing. The dissemination of information through the national Air Quality Index (AQI) has led to higher awareness and the demand for action./The Centre has allocated ~1,151 crore for agricultural mechanisation in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and DelhiNCR from 2018-20 to reduce the burning of crop residue./Apart from establishing farm machinery banks for custom hiring, financial assistance at 80% of the project cost to farmer co-ops, self-help groups... and 50% of the cost to individual farmers will be provided by the Centre./We'll also regularly review the graded action plan (to control of air pollution) implementation. Another example of our seriousness was the government's decision to leapfrog from BS-IV to BS-VI fuels, a step that no other country has taken./Was there pressure from vehicle-manufacturers on the fuel change?/No, there's no pressure from the industry on banning vehicles not conforming to BS-VI emission norms by April 1, 2020. About three to six months will be provided to automobile manufacturers for the registration of the vehicles manufactured before April 1, 2020, to exhaust the inventory./No new BS-IV vehicles manufactured before April 1, 2020, will be registered after June 30 (2020)./How is the work progressing on pollution-free crackers?/I have requested CSIR (Council for Scientific &#38; Industrial Research) to get all related labs to produce pollution-free crackers. I'm told they have made a significant headway, and they are constantly in touch with the cracker industry./Can any firecracker be pollution-free?/You can say minimum polluting -certainly a lot less than what we have today. Once the results are out, only then we can say how successful the project has been./With cleaning the air high on the agenda, why have thermal power plants been granted extension till 2022?/The new norms for thermal power plants have been discussed for close to a decade, but it was this government that notified it. We have not amended our notification. What we have done is only to draw a clear roadmap for compliance by 2022./Why were specific targets to reduce air pollution by 35% over three years and 50% over five years in 100 non-attainment cities removed from the national clean air programme (NCAP)? Do you plan to set a new timeline?/A blanket pan-India target of 35% reduction in three years and 50% reduction in five years may be difficult to evaluate and implement. A percentage reduction target and timeline can only be with respect to a specific city after reviewing its action plan and capacity./But a general minimum indicative target for five years for the top 10 most polluted cities to begin with can be indicated in the NCAP based on general international experiences./Has a budget been set for NCAP?/~300 crore has been allocated to NCAP for a 'pollution abatement' scheme for 2018-19 and 2019-20. The draft memorandum for expenditure has been sent to ministries concerned, including finance, for comments. The approval is yet to come and is subject to appraisal by a competent authority./You and the NCAP say there are no conclusive data available to establish direct correlation of death/disease exclusively due to air pollution./Do you expect air pollution to damage the health of Indians differently than other pollutants such as tobacco smoke and pesticide, chemical and heavy metal/contamination?/We do acknowledge that air pollution has significant health impacts that have increasingly been becoming a major environmental challenge. But it is erroneous to refer to it as a major health crisis on modelling-based statistical estimation that has used no direct experimental data. Though various respiratory and other aliments can be attributed to air pollution, there is no concrete field-based experimental study to correlate death with air pollution in the country. The ministry is getting a comprehensive study done on the health impacts of outdoor air pollution on community health. It will be done simultaneously at 20 leading medical centres with the technical support from AIIMS (AllIndia Institute of Medical Sciences), ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), PGIChandigarh, AMCHSS-Thiruvananthapuram etc./There are fears that the DNA Technology (Use and Application) bill may lead to breach of privacy./I'd say these fears have been over-addressed. Over the last three years, the bill has been subjected to all sorts of technical scrutiny by stakeholders outside government as well as by the law ministry, home ministry and the high-powered committee headed by the home minister. There is no need to be worried about privacy issues. The bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha and I sincerely wish it becomes law in the next session./Why is Taj Mahal turning yellow? What's being done to protect it?/There is as yet no scientific method to assess whether the Taj Mahal is turning yellow or not. Reports indicate that areas of the Taj that have undertaken cleaning using mud packs have regained colour, so it's incorrect to say the Taj is turning yellow without adequate scientific evidence. Our ministry had requested ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) to institute a scientific method./The main concern is air polluting industries. Since particulate matter deposits may make it look somewhat discoloured, there's a moratorium on orange, red and green (grades of pollution, white industries being the cleanest) industries. The Compensatory Afforestation Rules 2018 to utilise ~660 billion for tree plantation are being criticised for giving gram sabhas no role in how the money is spent. Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh has called it a ""blatant breach of assurances"" given by your government. What's your response? Till now, the criticism was why hasn't it been notified. Now after all sorts of scrutiny- it was put in the public domain, sent to state governments and related stakeholders and all concerned, and their views and comments were incorporated- it's in the stage where it is being implemented and states are going to be helped. Raising superfluous objections now carries no meaning./They may be for political reasons. And whenever there is a need, we will address all concerns to everyone's satisfaction./Which environment ministry successes are you especially proud of?/All of them, but I was particularly happy with the response to the campaign against plastic pollution. With increased awareness, state governments were able to push through new restrictions on single-use plastic./We've streamlined clearance processes, and environmental, CRZ (coastal regulation zone) and forest clearance processes have been moved online. The process is now transparent, speedy and efficient, which in the earlier days was a major hurdle for developmental projects, including strategic projects for national security. District, state authorities and regional offices of the ministry have been empowered to grant clearances to ensure speed and accountability. The average time taken is now around 160 days, down from over 600. The amendment of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, to take bamboo out of the definition of ""trees"" to encourage farmers to grow bamboo outside forests will enhance their income and give impetus to about 20 million people involved in bamboo-related activities. One tonne of bamboo provides 350 man-days of employment. Do you support sex education in school? It is necessary to educate everyone appropriately at a very young age. It is better that young children are informed about various body parts and their functions by their parents and teachers because it will help children discuss questions related to sex and gender with their parents and teachers and get correct answers. It would be disastrous if children get half-baked information from peers or other sources./Tell us about your Ramlila experience./(Laughs) I regularly visited Ramlilas in Geeta Colony, which was my constituency for 20 years, and once they practically forced me to participate. They assigned me to the role of Janak. Lav Kush (Ramlila committee) heard about it and requested me to play Janak. Since it's in my parliamentary constituency, I agreed. I've gone on stage thousands of time, but only once before to act. Who will be BJP's face in Delhi elections in 2020? Is the party going to field you again? I was approached by the party and RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) to join politics in 1993. Since then, till today, I have never, either directly or indirectly, decided what I want to do./I have always been guided by the decision and the wishes of the party./Have you got any feelers from the party?/No, I haven't. Not yet? (Laughs) No not yet about it./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air pollution lowers brain function, can lead to lower verbal and maths scores","New Delhi, Aug. 28 -- Long-term exposure to air pollution lowers brain function, which reflects in decreased verbal and mathematics scores, apart from causing heart disease and breathing problems, a new study from China has said./""... a narrow focus on the negative effect on health may underestimate the total cost of air pollution. Our findings imply that the indirect effect of pollution on social welfare could be much larger than previously thought,"" Xiaobo Zhang, one of the authors of the paper, said./The study retrospectively analysed data of nearly 32,000 people from two waves (2010 and 2014) of the China Family Panel Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey that looks at topics like economic activities, education outcome, family dynamics, relationships, and health./The cognitive ability module of the test has standardised mathematics and word-recognition questions and was sorted in ascending order of difficulty. The score given was the highest rank of a question that a person was able to answer. This dataset was then compared to the local pollution data./The researchers were able to show that the scores of the cognitive module of the test fell with increased long-term and transient exposure to air pollution. The decline was more pronounced in the verbal tests than in mathematics./When the results were plotted based on gender and educational qualification, the researchers saw that men 44 years or older with primary school education were the most impacted. For subsample with more education, men 65 years and above were impacted./""We speculate that the pollutant damage is most likely accumulating in the white matter of the brain which is mainly associated with the language functioning. The negative impact of three-year accumulative exposure to air pollution for men's verbal test scores is 49% higher than that for women,"" Zhang, who is also a senior research fellow with the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), said./""This could be because men have a much smaller amount of white matter activated during intelligence tests so their cognitive performance is more affected. Of course, more research is needed to test this out,"" Zhang added./The research estimated that reducing fine particulate matter concentrations to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard (50 ?g/m3) would increase verbal and math scores by 2.41 and 0.39 points./Though the research was conducted in China, the researchers suggest that the implications would be true for all developing countries, including India./The world's top 20 most polluted cities, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) database, are in developing countries. Almost all the cities in low- and middle-income countries with more than 1,00,000 residents fail to meet WHO air quality guidelines./""The findings should be applicable to India. In fact, the impact probably is greater given that the air pollution is more severe in Delhi than in Beijing and other Chinese cities,"" said Zhang./Doctors from India said the study was a good start but added that more research is required to show that the impact of air pollution on the human brain is definitive./""The study points a way. However, the researchers have retrospectively analysed the data and tried to fit it into a mathematical model. This can just show a correlation between high pollution levels and lower scores,"" Dr Vinay Goyal, professor of neurology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said./""Also, what about the socio-economic parameters? Most likely than not the people living in the most polluted areas are the poorest, they might not fare well on the test, not because of pollution but also because of the missing opportunities,"" Dr Goyal, who is also the editor of the journal Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology, added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Action plan to curb pollution in Noida, Ghaziabad by September 15","India, Aug. 31 -- The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has directed the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) to implement its air pollution abatement action plan in Noida and Ghaziabad by September 15. The direction was issued during a meeting conducted to discuss the winter preparedness to tackle pollution in NCR cities on Thursday./Similar directions have also been issued to NCR cities of Haryana and Rajasthan - where authorities have been asked to keep a check on stubble burning. For Noida and Ghaziabad, CPCB said the major sources of pollution were construction activities and vehicular emission./Ashok Tiwary, regional officer of UPPCB, said, ""We have submitted that we regularly penalise construction sites not following National Green Tribunal directions and other environmental norms. We are fully prepared to implement the plan by September. Additionally, the board has asked us to penalise vehicles emitting black smoke.""/Since June this year, the UPPCB has imposed penalties worth over Rs.70 lakh on construction projects violating environmental laws in Gautam Budh Nagar. During winters, the UPPCB will work with the transport department and the traffic police to actively fine polluting vehicles during winters./According to the air pollution abatement action plan proposed earlier this year, a budget of Rs.433 crore was allotted for monitoring, control, operation and maintenance of air quality. The funds will be used for strengthening of air quality monitoring network, increasing existing network/length of roads covered by mechanised sweepers, the network of water sprinklers for dust suppression, developing vertical gardens and covering unpaved areas with green belt to suppress roadside dust and covering roadside stretches with interlocking/paver bricks/tiles./According to the plan, Gautam Budh Nagar is set to get three continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) at a cost of Rs.6 crore to strengthen air quality monitoring during the winter. The district currently has three active monitoring stations while three more are likely to be installed soon. In addition to these, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board officials are now proposing three more monitoring stations./""The idea is to have nine active air quality monitoring stations before the beginning of the winter season. All of them will be set up by early October. Mechanised sweeping machines will also arrive soon,"" Tiwary said. He added that the these new stations would help monitor and mitigate air pollution in the district/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Bracing for stubble trouble: How Punjab plans to stop the fire,"Chandigarh, Sept. 12 -- In a month, the lush paddy fields of Punjab will be ready for harvest. With a brief window to clear the field for sowing wheat before winter sets in, farmers tend to burn the crop residue, causing smog to engulf the region. This happened till the last paddy season despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ban on stubble burning three years ago. But this year could be a different story with the central and state governments educating and providing farmers subsidised machinery to tackle the stubble in environment-friendly ways./Paddy has been cultivated in 74 lakh acres of Punjab this year and 22 million metric tonnes of rice residue is expected to be generated. Punjab alone contributes 65% of the total residue produced by the northwestern states./Biomass-based power generating units in Punjab can consume only five million tonnes of the stubble./After the Supreme Court ruling, the Centre sanctioned Rs 665 crore from 2018-20 to generate awareness and boost the use of subsidised machinery for processing the crop residue instead of burning it in Punjab. A sum of Rs 269 crore is being spent this year, while Rs 396 crore will be spent in 2019./Why the worry/The shorter cropping window of 20 days between paddy and wheat does not allow the paddy straw to decompose in the soil through the natural process, leading the farmer to burn and prepare the field for the next crop. Farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal says, ""Paddy transplanting was delayed and started on June 20. This means the maturing of the crop will be delayed by a fortnight, leaving a shorter window for wheat sowing. Farmers will be desperate to get rid of their stubble,"" he says./Secondly, migrant labour availability challenges from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have led to large-scale mechanization or increased use of combine harvesters. The combines operate 50-60 cm above the ground and leave behind standing stubble. This was not the case with manual labour that uprooted the entire stalk. Low availability of options such as Happy Seeder and Super SMS have the farmers worried./""Managing the stubble is costly and time consuming. Machines on subsidy also come at a price. I can't buy any this year. Let's see what the other farmers do,"" says Sukhjit Singh, a farmer from Karma village in Ferozepur district./Punjab faces the uphill task of motivating farmers to buy hi-tech machines.

"Air pollution, diet, weight: Lancet report lists what ails India","India, Sept. 13 -- Establishing a definitive link between death from chronic respiratory diseases and air pollution in north India, a new study in The Lancet Global Health said high exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution in northern states is the leading cause of the high burden of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) in these states, where the death rate from COPD is twice as high as states with cleaner air./Apart from COPD, polluted air also raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancers, said the first-evermulti-centric public-private study of five non-communicable diseases (NCD) across all states./Chronic respiratory diseases, which includes COPD (55 million) and asthma (37.9 million cases in 2016), were responsible for 10.9% of all deaths in 2016. COPD cases have almost doubled over the past 25 years./It went from 28 million in 1990 to 55 million from 1990 to 2016. The study highlights the challenge before policy planners, although it can also be used to inform their decisions and focus. NCDs and injuries together led to 57-86% of healthy life years lost (disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs, which is a composite metric of premature deaths and disability for monitoring disease burden) across all states in 2016, which is far more than the total loss to health and life from communicable diseases, infections, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases./There were regional variations. ""One striking finding is that the rate of increase in the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and diabetes is the highest in less developed states where the COPD and communicable diseases burden is already high and where health infrastructure is less than optimal,"" said Professor Lalit Dandona, director, India State-level Disease Burden Initiative, which reported overall trends for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and suicide in India from 1990 to 2016 for every state in India./Deaths from heart diseases and stroke almost doubled, going up from 15.2% of all deaths in 1990 to 28.1% in 2016. Diabetes accounted for 3.1% of all deaths, leading to more deaths among women (3.4%) than men (2.9%). The number of people with diabetes went up from 26 million in 1990 to 65 million in 2016, said the study, with the estimates being slightly lower than the International Diabetes Federation's estimates of 73 million for 2017./Diabetes prevalence in adults who are 20 years and older increased from 5.5% to 7.7%, with every state registering an increase. Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Delhi showed the highest prevalence, but the highest rates of increase were in less developed states./The proportional contribution of cancers to the total health loss in India has doubled from 1990 to 2016, but the incidence and types of cancers vary widely between the states. ""Data guides public policy and will help in evidence-based planning in collaboration with the states for prevention, disease management and other services being provided under Health and Wellness Centres to strengthen comprehensive primary healthcare in each state,"" said Union health and family welfare minister JP Nadda./Undiagnosed mental health disorders emerged as a growing concern, with suicides among women in India being 2.1 times than the global average. Suicides in women went up from 25.3% in 1990 to 36.6% in 2016, and among men, from 18.7% to 24.3%.

With only a month left before the lush paddy fields of Punjab are ready for harvest, the central and state governments are hoping the narrative will change this year; they have made efforts to educate farmers about the dangers of stubble burning and provided them machines to get rid of the straw residue./The Centre sanctioned Rs 665 crore for Punjab for the period between 2018 and 2020 to generate awareness and boost the use of subsidised machinery for processing the crop residue instead of burning it. A sum of Rs 269 crore is being spent this year and Rs 396 crore will be spent in 2019./Even so, the government can only hope that the measures pay off./Farmers take recourse to burning the post-harvest residue because it's a quick, cheap way of disposing of the paddy stubble. The window of opportunity for clearing the fields between harvesting the paddy crop and sowing wheat before the winter sets in is extremely narrow./This year, the window has become narrower.

A city choked,"Chandigarh, Sept. 13 -- The air quality in Chandigarh is going from bad to worse largely due to its vehicular population. At 878 vehicles per 1000 people, it has the highest density of vehicles in the country. Last year, the average Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) in the city stood at 118 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm), which is almost double the safe limit of 60 mpcm as per the ambient air quality standards of India, and five times the threshold of 20 mpcm set by the World Health Organisation./RSPM is more harmful than suspended particulate matter because these particles are much smaller and penetrate deeper into the lungs making you more vulnerable to heart disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and lung cancer. A study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has concluded that high levels of RSPM can shorten a person's lifespan./Dr SK Jindal, former head of pulmonary department, PGIMER, says he has seen a 10% increase in the number of people suffering from asthma as compared to last year. ""The number of people suffering from respiratory disorders has increased manifold, and the main reason remains air pollution due to the uncontrolled increase in the number of vehicles. The vehicular emissions are very harmful and chronic exposure to them causes respiratory disorders.""/WORSE THAN DELHI, MUMBAI In the last five decades, Chandigarh has seen its population increase nine-fold from 1051 persons per square metre in 1961 to 9,252 in 2011. This was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of vehicles, which contribute the most to the RSPM levels. Add to it vehicles from the neighbouring states and those of the floating population and you have a city bursting with vehicles./'The Urban Commute', a report by Center for Science and Environment (CSE), New Delhi, on 14 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kochi, Bhopal, Vijayawada, and Chandigarh, recently concluded that the city has the second highest per travel emissions./On average, every car in the city releases over 40 g of particulate matter per trip, much worse than Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Jaipur. In contrast, public transport releases less than 10 grams./Vivek Pandey, a scientist with the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee, says, ""The emission levels are rising every year as the number of vehicles on the roads are increasing with no change in the length of the roads. This has a very harmful impact on the quality of air.""/With the number of vehicles increasing every year and traffic jams becoming the new normal, the RSPM levels will rise further. The average wait time at the traffic lights has more than doubled from 30 seconds four years ago to around 65 seconds at busy junctions during the peak hours. Experts say frequent braking and idling at light points results in higher emission of pollutants. Autos and buses run on diesel compound the problem./PUBLIC TRANSPORT ONLY FOR SHORT TRIPS/The study, which was released on August 24, found that at five kilometres, Chandigarh has the lowest average trip length on public transport of all the cities. Kolkata also roughly has the same figure, but its average trip length by car is also the same, while for Chandigarh it is over 10 kms. This means that people/take public transport only for short trips in Chandigarh; for longer trips they still prefer cars or two-wheelers./Chandigarh also has the second lowest share of public transport (around 15%) amongst all transport mediums, second only to Lucknow./People in Chandigarh like personal vehicles more. Surprisingly, even though Chandigarh's fixation with four-wheelers is well-known, about 50% of vehicles in the city are twowheelers./Chandigarh has the worst ratio/between privately owned vehicles and public transport./Almost 80% of all vehicles are privately owned. Cities like Mumbai have few privately owned vehicles and most people travel by community-owned means of transport like trains. HIGHEST VEHICLE GROWTH The average annual growth rate of vehicles in Chandigarh is 9.8% . In 2016, at over 42,000, Chandigarh had the highest numb,er of both cars and two-wheelers registered by the RLA./The second highest on the list was Lucknow where this number stood at 5,000./Chandigarh also has the highest per trip energy consumption. This means each time a Chandigarh citizen makes a trip on his or her vehicle, more energy is expelled than in any of the 14 cities./The study warns that though Chandigarh ranks third on total emissions and guzzling due to low volumes of travel and lesser distances covered, it is almost at the bottom in the ranking for per trip emissions./This is due to very high use and dependence on personal vehicles for all trips. Even the ownership of cars per 1,000 people is among the highest in the country./Navdeep Asija, Punjab traffic adviser, says the administration must stop encouraging car owners by making new parking spaces for them. ""Promote autos that run on CNG. They occupy little space, and transport 80-100 people in a day besides taking care of the last mile connectivity.""/After Union home minister Rajnath Singh put brakes on the much-touted metro rail project for Chandigarh in July last year, The UT administration is planning to introduce monorail as an alternative model of mass transport in the city. This project must be expedited to decongest the city roads and clean up the air. As the study concluded, ""A sustainable public transport is the only way out for Chandigarh.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

80% of target to fight stubble burning met: Haryana to EPCA,"NEW DELHI/GURUGRAM, Sept. 14 -- The Haryana government on Thursday told a Supreme Court-appointed environmental panel that it has been able to meet nearly 80% of the target the state had set to provide agricultural implements to farmers to control the practice of stubble burning./The information is welcome news for Delhi residents as only a few weeks remain before farmers in Haryana and Punjab start burning stubble. Recent studies have shown that agriculture residue burning contributes to nearly 17% of the PM10 pollution and 19% of the PM2.5 pollution in Delhi and NCR towns. Around 64% of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution in winter originates outside the city, experts have found./On Thursday, the Haryana government submitted a report to the Supreme Court-mandated body Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on the progress of crop residue management scheme in the state./The report, placed before EPCA chairman Bhure Lal on Thursday, says the Haryana government had set a target of providing 5,563 agriculture implements such as super straw management system, happy seeder, mulcher, rotary slasher and rotavators among others to farmers this year. These machines would help farmers cut down crop residues without having to resort to burning them./Till date, while 1,052 farmers have already received the subsidy, orders have been placed for another 3,310 implements, EPCA was informed./A senior official of the Haryana agriculture department said, ""We are ahead of other states. The chief secretary is pursing the matter vigorously. Even the Union environment secretary has appreciated the pace of work in a review meeting held on Wednesday. We have received a large number of applications. More farmers would receive the subsidy by the end of this month.""/The Haryana government has also identified around 30 villages from each district where teams would be deployed. These districts would be closely monitored through satellites too, EPCA was told./The maximum number of farmers who received the subsidy are from Kurukshetra (136), followed by Kaithal (120) and Rohtak (82)./Millions of tonnes of agricultural stubble is burnt by farmers in north India every October, before the onset of winter. An estimated 35 million tonnes are set afire in Punjab and Haryana alone. The smoke from these fires triggers heavy smog in Delhi and other NCR towns, such as Noida and Gurugram, which are located in the downwind path./EPCA chairman Bhure Lal has directed the deputy commissioners of Karnal, Sonepat, Panipat, Kaithal and Kurukshetra among others districts to ensure that there is no stubble burning this time./""Several farmers are coming forward. The Haryana government is selecting them after scrutinising the applications. The results are encouraging,"" said Bhure Lal./Such is the magnitude of the problem that the Union government had approved Rs 1,151 crore to promote crop residue management in the four NCR states./Delhi environment minister Imran Hussain has also written letters to his counterparts in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab to take preventive measures so that incidents of stubble burning could be reduced./On Wednesday EPCA members held a meeting with senior officials from Rajasthan to review what measures are being taken to reduce air pollution. In the meeting Rajasthan officials were advised to explore ways on how more industrial units could be shifted from coal to CNG./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Farewell to tandoori snacks, pollution in Noida, Ghaziabad","India, Sept. 16 -- Your favourite smoked flavours of chicken tandoori and soya chap may be a thing of the past, at least in Noida and Ghaziabad if not in the whole of Delhi-NCR, thanks to severe pollution levels throughout winter./To control air pollution and implement the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) ahead of winter, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has prepared a report with steps that will be taken before October 10. This includes a survey to prepare an inventory of all eateries using wood and coal as fuel and take action against them. All tandoori cuisine, including tandoori rotis, is prepared using coal, making almost every eating joint, big and small, a part of the hit list./""Construction projects will be dealt with zero tolerance as dust from these sites is a predominant pollutant. Coal fuel at eateries, brick kilns and other recommendations of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) are also being surveyed and relevant steps will be taken strictly and very soon,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, said, after chairing a meeting with all departments on Friday evening regarding pollution preparedness./Officials said that while these recommendations were given last year as well, they could not be implemented. Meanwhile, restaurant owners said that they would readily take steps to curb pollution, as long as there were alternatives, and orders were fairly implemented./""We do have alternatives like the electric tandoor now, but the food tastes different and not as good. It would be better if we could control the fumes and use filters, than not use coal at all. Besides, if this is implemented, it should be uniform for all eateries and action should not taken against just a handful of restaurants,"" Ashish Sakhuja, a restaurant owner in Sector 18 market, said./Major construction projects not following National Green Tribunal's (NGT) orders, illegal hot mix plants, diesel generator sets, stone crushers and road repair projects are also on the administration's radar. Additionally, the GRAP has recommended an increase in public transport, preparation of alternate routes for traffic diversion and a three or four times increase in parking fee. A survey of all these recommendations will be conducted by October 10 and they are expected to be implemented by October 15./Most of these recommendations could not be implemented in the NCR cities of Uttar Pradesh last year. However, meetings have taken place this year to ensure implementation, following a dressing down of all state officials from the EPCA chief Bhure Lal during a workshop last week./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution haze over 12 Odisha industries,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 18 -- Twelve of the 20 large industries in Odisha currently being evaluated for particulate matter (PM) emissions by the Odisha Pollution Control Board are either far from meeting air pollution standards or aren't releasing their pollution data in real time on a regular basis./Odisha has about 135 large industries and 4,000 small and medium industries, which include power plants, sponge iron and steel plants. These are being rated using continuous emissions data by Odisha, which on Monday became the first state to rank polluting industries on the basis of real-time compliance to pollution norms./Santosh Harish, associate director of EPIC India said some states like Odisha and Tamil Nadu had started implementing Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) much before Central Pollution Control Board mandated it last year which is why 136 of Odisha industries are putting out pollution data in real time. ""Chhattisgarh also puts out CEMS data in public domain. But its difficult to say how many states totally have made CEMS data public,"" Harish said./The star rating programme implemented in association with Energy Policy Institute University of Chicago (EPIC) India categorises industries across a range of 1 to 5 stars./In the first phase of the programme, there are 20 large industries including power plants, cement, paper and pulp, steel, sponge iron and others. The current ratings on the Odisha Pollution Control Board website /<a href=""http://www.ospcb.info"">www.ospcb.info</a>/ shows 12 out of 20 industries including four captive power plants in Sambalpur, Angul and Jharsuguda have got one star while only one industry-a sponge iron unit in Sundargarh has got 5 stars./Industries that aren't releasing pollution data in real-time are also being given 1 star to make them fall in line. In case of the 12 industries that have got 1 star, some aren't meeting pollution standards while some aren't releasing pollution data regularly. ""We need to do further assessments to show which ones are worst polluters by looking at the dataset,"" said Akhila Swar, chief environmental engineer, Odisha./""The Star Rating program will help the public to find out whether industries in their vicinity are fair in their environmental compliance and empower them to strengthen regulations through public participation,"" said Odisha chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, a statement by EPIC India said. A CPCB official said it has already directed all red category or polluting industries to install real time emissions monitoring systems on their stacks. ""Already more than 3,000 industries have installed CEMS on their chimneys and we are receiving data through our server. But exact compliance status needs to be checked.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"World Alzheimer's day: City's first 'elderly' store to help track patients, opens on October 17","Pune, Sept. 21 -- Pune Pune's Chaitanya mental healthcare centre and Alzheimer's and related disorders society of India (ARDSI), Pune chapter, will launch the city's first 'elderly' store on October 17./""To help track missing patients, we plan to start a store which will be located in Aundh and will also be online. To help find patients who often go missing, that leads to a panic attack among family members, we will make a tracking system available in our store. It will be a wearable tracker which will help the family find its lost or missing member suffering from this disease. The tracker can be worn around the neck, or as a band on the hand or can be installed in a cane,"" said Rony George, founder and director, of the Chaitanya centre. Other than trackers, we will also have special wheelchairs, adult diapers, walkers, etc,"" he added./""There are many such stores in western countries, but with the growing figures of this disease, we feel it is the need of the hour to start such an initiative in our city where elderly population is only on the rise due to increase in longevity,"" he said./George further added that the store will be launched on October 17 because that is the day when the Chaitanya centre was established./On today being observed as World Alzheimer's day, George said, ""Training and sensitising caregivers, especially nurses, is extremely important. Most of them often get confused and scared of how one can handle a person who is diagnosed of Alzheimer's. Hence, proper training is needed and handling patients with this disease becomes important. Besides that, nobody in Pune city has conducted a study to find out an estimated figure of people or population suffering from this disease and hence, it also becomes important for all of us to create more awareness related to Alzheimer's as it can affect anybody.""/Agreeing to the same, Dr Nasli Ichchaporia, chief of neurology, Jehangir hospital, added, ""We lack figures of number of people suffering from Alzheimer's in Pune, but awareness remains the key; besides this, changes in genes or genetic predisposition too is one of the causes behind Alzheimer's which leads to degeneration of brain functions. It leads to loss of memory, judgement and ability to function and leads to dementia gradually. Around 10 to 15 per cent of the cases are because of genetic predisposition as well which people and caregivers need to be aware of.""/Dementia cases rising, experts rue lack of patient data/According to the World health organisation (WHO), globally, 50 million people have dementia, with nearly 60 per cent of those living in low- and middle-income countries. Every year, there are nearly 10 million new cases and the estimated proportion of the general population aged 60 and over with dementia at a given time is between five and eight per 100 people. The total number of people with dementia is projected to reach 82 million in 2030 and 152 in 2050, estimated WHO./This was seconded by senior neurology experts working in the city, who also stressed that the number of dementia cases have gone up over the last few years and one of the commonest type, that is Alzheimer's, is getting reported largely. Dr Nasli Ichchaporia, former president of Maharashtra association of neurologists and chief of neurology at Jehangir Hospital, said, ""Cases of Alzheimer's are on the rise. It is mainly seen after a person hits 65 years of age or so.""/He added, ""In fact, there are certain cases who came to us as early as in their 40s and 50s. However, such cases are rare, but the shift in age can be seen and is worrisome.""/He further stressed that Alzheimer's which is a common type of dementia is not reversible and, ""This is the scariest part, but the onset can be delayed. People need to be active, brain functioning is extremely important and people after retirement should continue keeping their brains active. One must maintain good health, good diet, exercise regularly, keep a social bond, keep meeting people and maintain family time.""/Not only this, there are various causes too that leads to Alzheimer's and one major risk factor is air pollution which not many talk about. ""People think air pollution only causes lung diseases and hits the lungs directly, but not many know that it also leads to degeneration of the brain cells as blood circulation to the brain too gets affected due to the polluted air we breathe. There are many chemicals in air pollution that affects the brain and leads to damage. Accumulation of chemicals leads to strokes, loss of blood flow, etc; and gradually leads to the hampered brain functioning,"" he said./Talking about the symptoms of the disease Ichchaporia said, ""Forgetfulness, not finding things, not able to calculate, not being as sharp as one was. Expert advice, however, is sought only after the symptoms are worsened hence, it is suggested that people not only seek advice early, but be aware of their deteriorating health once they hit 60 or above.""/Similarly, Dr Hemant Sant, past president of Indian neurology society of Pune said, ""Incidence of Alzheimer's is on the rise in India and another important risk factor is increase in life expectancy. People who do not use their brains for doing new things are more prone to develop Alzheimer's and hence, we need to have a motto 'use it or lose it' this world Alzheimer's day.""/Besides this, when asked about the approximate rise or cases in OPD, both experts cited that there is a dearth of study or survey due to poor awareness levels, hence, exact figures of number of cases India or in Pune cannot be quoted./Other than air pollution, increase in longevity and lack of brain activity, another major risk factor cited by an expert is hypertension. ""The increasing cases of this lifestyle disorder may lead to Alzheimer's,"" said Dr Bhushan Nilkanth Joshi, neurologist, from Columbia Asia Hospital adding further, ""Hypertension or prolonged blood pressure can cause damage to the brain and hence lead to a progressive Alzheimer's disease that affects the cognitive functioning impacting quality of life.""/He said, ""According to estimates one in every three Indians has high blood pressure and this number is only going to rise by 2020. Around 14 per cent of men between the age group of 15 and 49 and eight per cent of women in Pune are suffering from hypertension and hence, are on the risk of developing Alzheimer's in their life time as a progressive disease.""/""Also as per the national health profile of 2018, as many as 60 per cent of those who have hypertension are unaware of their condition while 42 per cent suffer from uncontrolled hypertension. To prevent the disease, lifestyle modifications remain important like maintaining healthy weight and body mass index (BMI), healthy diet, quitting smoking, and reducing stress,"" Dr Joshi said./Day's events/World Alzheimer's day events/Workshop for nurses and caregivers by/Where: Chaitanya mental health care centre, Khadi machine chowk, Kondhwa/When: 10.30 am/International Longevity Centre will host talk by Sailesh Mishra, on 'dementia and understanding it'/Where: Maharashtra technical education society's auditorium, off Karve road/When: 5 pm./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Stubble burning can't be a shield for inaction on Delhi's air pollution,"India, Sept. 24 -- The season's first cases of stubble burning - regarded by experts as one of the principal reasons behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the National Capital Region every winter - have been reported from Punjab and Haryana. In the 2017 winter, Haryana detected around 12,657 stubble-burning cases, and Punjab recorded 43,814 cases. ""Chief ministers of the three states have been squabbling for the last two years over the impact of stubble burning on pollution levels in the Capital. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has insisted that it is one of the biggest reasons why the city becomes a 'gas chamber' in the winter,"" says a report in Hindustan Times ./Environmentalists, however, say, that by blaming stubble burning, both the central and state governments are shifting focus from other factors --- some of them much bigger than stubble burning --- which are responsible for air pollution./In an interview with Hindustan Times, Vimlendu Jha, an environmentalist, and the founder of Swechha, talks about other mega air pollution-related challenges that Delhi faces, and what the city's authorities need to do to clean up the air./KD: Over the past week, at least 61 cases of stubble burning have been detected in Haryana and Punjab. Should Delhi be worried?/VJ: No doubt it's a cause of concern. Despite several strictures from courts, including the National Green Tribunal, farmers continue the practice. The state and central governments have not been able to either incentivise alternative practices or adequately enforce the court orders. Stubble burning is a big cause of air pollution in North India, but it primarily spikes the air quality index (air pollution). But it is not the sole reason for poor or severe ambient air quality./KD: Are we avoiding other causes of pollution, and blaming farmers, knowing well that they have no other option?/VJ: Absolutely! It's become a convenient excuse for respective governments to blame the visible and the vulnerable, the smoke coming out of the stubble burning. They conveniently ignore the fact that several studies have established, including many commissioned by their own dispensations that the real cause of air quality crisis in Delhi or in other states is due to dust, vehicular pollution, thermal power plants, open waste burning and other infrastructure and industrial activities./Farmers have not been provided with any alternative or incentive, through technology, subsidy or policy intervention. Given the agrarian distress in the times of climate change, putting the responsibility of environmental stewardship and virtue on to the poorest of the poor is misgovernance and escapism. Government/s need to put their house in order first./KD: Is it too expensive to end stubble burning? Why are the states not doing anything?/VJ: It's not just expensive, it's also inconvenient primarily because of the way our agrarian economy is distressed. In between the harvest and sowing of the next crop, most farmers don't have enough time to be wise or virtuous and also have financial compulsions which make them opt for stubble burning rather than other practices. Although certain amount of resources, perhaps in crores, were allocated to address the issue. But despite that no concrete action has been seen at the state level./KD: The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) has still not been notified./VJ: The NCAP was one ambitious and timely response to the growing public health concerns due to poor air quality in most of India. Despite several grandstanding by government authorities, the NCAP has not been notified and still remains in the draft stage. Even the draft plan has been watered down and no concrete timelines have been stated in the document. The document mentions reduction of pollution levels by 35%to 50% in three to five years but there is no direction in terms of how, when and who is going to work on these reductions. Some extremely low-hanging targets have also not been explored such as forest burning (one of the primary reasons of poor ambient air quality in Indo-Gangetic plain), thermal power plants and rampant use of diesel generators in urban hubs./KD: Has the Delhi/central government doing enough to control air pollution? What needs to be done to ensure that the coming months are better than what we had last year?/VJ: Neither the Delhi government nor the central government has the political will to address the issue. They depend on the generosity of our monsoons, winds and overall climate to mitigate air pollution. If anything, their respective policies on urbanisation have only made the situation worse. The Delhi government granted permission to chop down over 17,000 trees in last four years, with no concrete evidence of any new tree being added to the city. Similarly the central government has chopped thousands of trees in an already 'breathless' Delhi so as to build more malls and commercial complexes./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi braces for foul air as stubble burning begins in neighbouring states,"India, Sept. 24 -- The season's first cases of stubble burning - regarded by experts as one of the principal reasons behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the National Capital Region every winter - have been reported from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, according to two officials familiar with the developments./Over the past week, at least 61 cases of stubble burning have been detected in Haryana, and two in Punjab, confirmed members of the state pollution control boards of the two states. They both said that satellite monitoring of burning stubble - a post-monsoon phenomenon in which farmers set fire to their paddy fields in order to get them ready for wheat sowing in November - will start from this week./""In Haryana, all the 61 cases have been reported from Karnal district (140km from Delhi). We have lodged FIRs (first information report) in 26 cases so far. As much as Rs 90,000 has been collected from 35 farmers as fines,"" said S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board./""These are the first cases of crop-residue burning in Punjab this season. Two cases of stubble burning have been reported so far. While one was reported from Amritsar, the second one was detected in Patiala,"" said Karunesh Garg, member secretary of the Punjab Pollution Control Board./Garg said that a penalty of Rs 5,000 has been imposed on the Patiala farmer for burning crop residue, but the Amritsar case is still being verified. In 2015, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had imposed fines ranging between Rs 2,500 and Rs 15,000 on farmers to prevent them from burning crop residue, smoke from which was being carried towards Delhi by northwesterly winds./""With the retreat of monsoon, the northwesterly winds start blowing in.

According to CPCB, clean air is defined by an AQI of less than 50./Since last year, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority has been empowered with a graded response action plan (Grap) to take emergency measures in the national capital to combat and counter pollution spikes./Different reports by government and private researchers say that biomass burning, which includes stubble burning, causes 16% to 30% of Delhi's pollution.

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has insisted that it is one of the biggest reasons why the city becomes a ""gas chamber"" in the winter./While Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Punjab CM Amrinder Singh say the Delhi government is exaggerating the problem, they have acknowledged that it is a matter of concern and last year demanded central assistance./PCB's Air Quality Index (AQI) shows that in 2017, the air quality in Delhi started dropping from the first week of October. On October 8, it fell to 247, which is considered 'poor' according to the grading yardstick. It then continued to deteriorate, clocking 306 ('very poor') on October 17, and hitting 486 ('severe') on November 9, a period when Delhi encountered thick smog for over a week, leading to the government declaring a public health emergency./Delhi's AQI has ranged between 50 and 150 this September, which is in the 'satisfactory' to 'moderate' range. According to CPCB, clean air is defined by an AQI of less than 50./Since last year, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority has been empowered with a graded response action plan (Grap) to take emergency measures in the national capital to combat and counter pollution spikes./Different reports by government and private researchers say that biomass burning, which includes stubble burning, causes 16% to 30% of Delhi's pollution. Another report in August 2018 by the Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) and Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India, however, said that only 4% of Delhi's pollution during winter comes from agriculture waste burning./Experts say that toxic fumes from fields on which crop residue has been burnt engulf the Capital, resulting in thick smog. A study published by peer-reviewed journal Springer in 2015 suggested that each ton of crop residue releases around 3kg of particulate matter, 60 kg of carbon monoxide, 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, 199kg of ash and 2kg of sulphur dioxide./On September 13, Delhi's environment minister Imran Hussain wrote to his counterparts in Haryana and Punjab government requesting them to take preventive steps to stop stubble burning./""In 2017, crop residue burning incidents had dropped by nearly 46% compared to 2016. This time, we are expecting the figures to drop further as several measures are being taken from increasing vigil to subsidising machines. The super straw management system has been made mandatory with combined harvesters, which would help in managing the straw left behind in the field after harvest,"" said Garg./Haryana has identified at least 30 villages in which there would be increased vigil./Earlier this year, the Union government approved Rs 1,151 crore to manage crop residue. The fund will primarily be used to subsidise machinery required for in-situ management of the residue./""The harvesting has just started. There is still a lot of moisture in the soil because of the rains. Incidents of crop residue have started and will pick up from the first week of October,"" said an official of the Punjab pollution control board. ""That will be our test.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Stubble burning: Will it be different this time?,"Mumbai, Sept. 25 -- As the paddy harvest begins in the north Indian plains around this time of the year, the entire region dreads its consequences. The harvest marks the return of stubble burning, which releases clouds of toxic smoke, heightening air pollution levels, particularly over the national capital, Punjab and Haryana. Pollution regulators have already spotted the season's first 61 cases of fire from Haryana and Punjab. It could well be seen as the precursor of what lies ahead. After all, 40,150 cases of stubble fires were reported from Punjab alone in 2017, between September 27 and November 9. Will things be different this time around? Already unfolding on the ground are strategies seeking to address the root of the problem that stems from the lack of economical alternatives with farmers to tackle the stubble, forcing them to take an easy, but ecologically disastrous, option of setting them alight./A key driver is the Centre's Crop Residue Management Scheme, which hopes to educate farmers and equip them with affordable mechanised substitutes to deal with stubble in eco-beneficial ways. It entails 50% subsidy to individual farmers and 80% to cooperatives or groups for buying machines for in-situ management of stubble in the troubled spots of Punjab and Haryana. This approach, in the government's reckoning, and rightly so, is a sustainable alternative to offering the bonus over and above the minimum support price that farmers' bodies in Punjab are demanding as an incentive for not burning paddy./A better-than-expected response to the scheme, bolstered by an awareness campaign, has led to optimism among the authorities that the scale of paddy fires this season will be smaller than last year. A significant containment of the stubble smokestacks will help the region breathe easy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Potholed roads versus health of commuters,"LUDHIANA, Sept. 26 -- After struggling with waterlogged roads due to heavy downpour on Monday, the commuters are now grappling with broken and dusty roads across the city./A major problem was witnessed in the city after the torrential rain damaged several roads making it difficult for the commuters to drive smoothly on such roads./Human health experts say that bad condition of roads can have an adverse effect on the health of commuters and other people./Dr Rupesh Chaudhary, psychiatrist, said, ""Commuting has significant psychological effect on one's mind as it can be a major cause of stress due to its unpredictability and a sense of loss of control."" He said a motorist can also experience boredom, social isolation, anger and frustration while commuting on dilapidated roads./It also has direct impact on the physical health and other issues related to hypertension, obesity and joint problems, he added./Dr Shekhar Singal, an orthopedist, said, ""Mostly the problem is witnessed among the twowheeler drivers when they commute through damaged roads. The sudden pressure can pose problem of slip disc among twowheeler riders.""/He said the body of a person, who suffered slip disc can also develop chronic back ache./In case of elderly people, their bones get weaker if they travel through these roads; however, it is a curable problem, but one should always avoid commuting on broken roads, he added./As per experts, air pollution is a major symptom behind this disease. Most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be prevented by only reducing exposure to risk factors./Meanwhile, motorists also complained of respiratory problems, which are being caused while commuting on grubby roads. They said that the dust entering their bodies is causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)./In case of COPD, a person suffers from lung disease characterised by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow./24-year-old Karan Kochhar said, ""I faced a lot of inconvenience when I was commuting towards Dugri via Atam Nagar on my Activa on Tuesday. When I was crossing a dusty unsurfaced road parallel to the Atam Nagar police station, dust entered my eyes. I stopped my vehicle and sprinkled some water on my eyes. But, after a few minutes, I had my left eye swollen""./She said the municipal corporation (MC) should wake up and get the roads repaired for the safety of commuters ./61-year-old Paramnath Singh, who works as a superviser with a city-based private firm, said, ""I have some problem in my spinal cord and can't travel through the bumpy routes on my twowheeler."" ""Moreover, every day when I leave for work, fear of an accident always haunts me,"" he said./""We suspect that roads are being resurfaced with poor quality material and this might be the reason behind the roads getting damaged frequently. Authorities should inspect the material before giving contracts to the private firms so that we have good roads for a long time."", said Parmod Pal, a resident of Pakhowal Road./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Indians becoming prone to heart diseases at a younger age',"LUCKNOW, Sept. 29 -- The primary risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in India included high systolic blood pressure, air pollution, elevated total cholesterol, tobacco use, high fasting plasma glucose, high body mass index and unhealthy diet, said heart specialist Dr Sajid Ansari at a press conference here on Friday./""If you want to save your loved ones from cardiovascular diseases, it is important to bring in healthy lifestyle changes,"" he said./The doctor said that people worsened their risk for getting heart diseases with poor physical activity, high-fat diet and steadily shunning fruits and vegetables. ""It is crucial that each one of us takes some constructive steps towards improving our heart health and that of our loved ones before it is too late,"" said Dr Ansari./He said that the prevalence of high systolic blood pressure, high total cholesterol and high fasting plasma glucose had increased across India from 1990 to 2016.He also said that India needed to implement health policies while strengthening and integrating its local, regional and national health systems to reduce premature death and disability from CVDs./Eminent cardiologist Dr Nakul Sinha said in a press statement, ""Indians are increasingly becoming prone to heart attacks at a younger age due to drastic change in lifestyle. About 25% of all heart attacks occur in people below the age of 40 years, according to recent statistics. Many people are unaware of the signs of this condition.""/He said understanding the warning signs of a heart attack was imperative for timely diagnosis and treatment, which could increase the chances of survival and reduce complications./""Indians, by ethnicity and genetic composition, are prone to heart diseases. Thus, following a healthy lifestyle is all the more important in the young and the old alike. A heart-healthy diet can go a long way in preventing heart diseases and other complications. Regular physical activity, stress management and quitting habits such as smoking and drinking are some other measures one can take. Make sure that you undertake preventive health check-ups to understand whether you are at risk and keep your vitals such as blood pressure in control,"" said Dr Sinha./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"As rain goes away, Delhi pollution starts rising ahead of Diwali season","NEW DELHI, Sept. 29 -- The air quality has started to worsen in the national capital region with levels of particulate matter surpassing safe limits on Friday - barely three days after the last of the monsoon rains- heralding the beginning of a period of pollution that stretches well into winters and is regarded a public health hazard./The spike mainly was in the levels of PM10 - dust particles roughly a fifth of the diameter of an average human hair. On Tuesday, at around 1pm, the concentration of PM10 in air was recorded at 35ug/m3. By 8pm on Friday, it had crossed 222ug/m3, exceeding the safe limit of 100ug/m3 ./The air quality in Delhi is generally the best during the monsoons when rains help settle local dust and strong winds prevent accumulation./In the past 48 hours, weather experts have said, the wind patterns have changed./""This happens during this time of the year when the weather transitions from monsoon to winter. The wind becomes calmer and moisture declines. Loose soil on the surface is getting suspended in the air but is not getting dispersed. As a result local pollution is building up,"" said D Saha, former head of the CPCB's air quality laboratory./The wind speed at 5.30pm on Friday in Delhi had dropped to almost 0kmph, which meteorologists term as 'calm wind'. The minimum relative humidity dropped from 71% on Monday to 53% on Friday. On Friday, the overall air quality index (AQI) of 198 was on the cusp of 'poor' category that begins from 201. ""While the overall AQI value on Wednesday was 88, on Friday it was recorded to be 198. The AQI value on Monday, the day Delhi received its last monsoon rain, was 52,"" said a senior official of the Central Pollution Control Board's air quality laboratory./The AQI is a measure of PM10 and smaller PM2.5 particles, as well as concentration of gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides. 'Poor' is the third lowest of six grades classifying air pollution./In November last year, the air remained in the worst 'severe' category for nearly a fortnight, enveloping the region in a thick haze and forcing authorities to order the closure of schools as young children and elderly were advised to avoid going outdoors./""The AQI at present is still better than what it was in 2016 and 2017 during this time of the year. Last year the air quality had turned poor by this time as the AQI had crossed the 200 mark,"" said a scientist of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The withdrawal of monsoon is expected to be announced in less than a week. The announcement is done after several meteorological conditions are fulfilled - one among which is a dry spell lasting at least five days./""We are expecting monsoon would start its withdrawal within the next 48 hours from west Rajasthan. It is expected to withdraw from Delhi in less than a week's time,"" said BP Yadav, deputy director general of the Met department./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Open waste dumps pose public health crisis to Gurugram,"Gurugram, Oct. 2 -- A 15-year-old resident of Chakkarpur village in Sector 28, has been suffering from sepsis or blood poisoning for the past many days. This happens when bacteria enter the blood stream. He and his family live near a perpetual garbage dump and doctors have said his disease is a result of ""unhygienic conditions"". Since Chakkarpur is an area of informal housing, it is also a site of open defecation, which leads to spread of diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera and typhoid. ""People here have told the authorities about garbage dumping multiple times, but they haven't paid any heed,"" said Raju Kumar, the ailing boy's father./Residents of other parts of Gurugram, too, said that garbage dumped across large open, residential spaces and on pavements is not only damaging the environment, but also causing a public health problem./""The garbage that has piled-up outside my house over past many months is perfect for breeding of flies and mosquitoes. The situation became worse after weeks of rain during the monsoon,"" Sushant Lok 2 resident Joginder Singh said, adding that locals have repeatedly requested the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to clean the area and spray pesticides but, so far, nothing has happened./According the MCG data, in September, 23 complaints of garbage accumulation were received from across the city./MCG commissioner, however, Yashpal Yadav maintained, ""Pesticides have been sprayed in almost all 35 wards of the MCG. Fumigation is also going on across the city.""/Doctors confirmed that waste dumps are the ideal breeding grounds for bacteria, vermin and insects that carry infection. ""Such areas are hotbeds of diseases, including typhoid, food poisoning and gastroenteritis. Due to uncollected waste and improper disposal techniques, drains get clogged helping mosquitoes breed, resulting in spread of diseases such as malaria, dengue and viral fever,"" Dr Rajiv Dang, director of internal medicine at Max Hospital said, pointing out several areas in the city, such as Sector 29 and New Colony in Sector 7, where uncollected waste raises quite a stench./Doctors said such stench causes respiratory diseases and is a local factor for air pollution./Residents of Sector 23A and Sector 50 complained of noxious fumes in the area. They said they tend to stay indoors most evenings due to the foul smell./Dr Swapnil Mehta, pulmonology consultant at Narayana Hospital, said accumulated garbage is also a problem as contaminants are absorbed through the lungs, and affect other parts of the body. ""Decomposing waste releases toxic gases such as hydrogen sulphide and methane which increase upper respiratory problems and causes cough and breathlessness,"" he said./The accumulated waste, residents said, is also leading to the death of cattle and stray dogs as they rummage through piles of garbage for food. ""Many cows have died, especially because of plastic pollution, in Sector 23A. The area has been serving as a dumping site for plastic and C&#38;D waste for two years. There is a constant foul smell here,"" said a resident of the area./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

A clean environment will empower us,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 4 -- Yesterday, the United Nations honoured me with the 'Champions of the Earth Award. ' While I was extremely humbled at receiving this honour, I do feel that this award is not for an individual.

Mother Nature has nurtured and nourished us. The first civilisations were established on the banks of rivers. Societies that live in harmony with nature flourish and prosper./Today, human society stands at an important crossroads. The path that we take hereon will not only determine our wellbeing but also that of the generations who will inhabit our planet after us./The imbalances between our greed and necessities have led to grave ecological imbalances. We can either accept this, go ahead with things as if it is business as usual, or we can take corrective actions./Three things will determine how we as a society can bring a positive change. The first is internal consciousness. For that, there is no better place to look than our glorious past. Respect for nature is at the core of India's traditions./The Atharvaveda contains the Prithvi Sukta, which contains unparalleled knowledge about nature and the environment. It is beautifully written in Atharvaveda, - ""Yasyaam Samudra Uta SindhurAapo Yasyaam-Annam Krssttayah Sambabhuuvuh,/Yasyaam-Idam Jinvati Praannad-Ejat-Saa No Bhuumih PuurvaPeye Dadhaatu""./It means -Salutations to Mother Earth. In Her is woven together Ocean and River Waters; in Her is contained Food which She manifests when ploughed; In Her indeed is alive all Lives; May She bestow us with that Life./The ancients write about the Panch Tatvas -Prithvi (Earth), Vayu (Air), Jal (Water), Agni (Fire), Akash (Sky) - and how our life systems are based on the harmonious functioning of these elements. The elements of nature are manifestations of divinity./Mahatma Gandhi wrote extensively on the environment and even practiced a lifestyle where compassion towards the environment was essential. He propounded the Doctrine of Trusteeship, which places the onus on us, the present generation, to ensure that our coming generations inherit a clean planet. He called for sustainable consumption so that the world does not face a resource crunch./Leading lifestyles that are harmonious and sustainable are a part of our ethos. Once we realise how we are flag bearers of a rich tradition, it will automatically have a positive impact on our actions./The second aspect is public awareness. We need to talk, write, debate, discuss and deliberate as much as possible on questions relating to the environment. At the same time, it is vital to encourage research and innovation on subjects relating to the environment. This is when more people will know about the pressing challenges of our times and ways to mitigate them./When we as a society are aware of our strong links with environmental conservation and talk about it regularly, we will automatically be proactive in working towards a sustainable environment. That is why, I will put proactiveness as the third facet of bringing about a positive change. In this context, I am delighted to state that the 1.3 billion people of India are proactive and at the forefront of working towards a cleaner and greener environment./We see this proactiveness in the Swachh Bharat Mission, which is directly linked to a sustainable future. With the blessings of the people of India, over 85 million households now have access to toilets for the first time./Over 400 million Indians no longer have to defecate in the open. Sanitation coverage is up from 39% to 95%. These are landmark efforts in the quest of reducing the strain on our natural surroundings./We see this proactiveness in the success of the Ujjwala Yojana, which has significantly reduced indoor air pollution due to unhealthy cooking practices that were causing respiratory diseases. Till date, over 50 million Ujjwala connections have been distributed, thus ensuring a better and cleaner life for the women and their families. India is moving at a quick pace in cleaning its rivers./The Ganga, which is India's lifeline, had become polluted in several parts. The Namami Gange Mission is changing this historical wrong. Emphasis is being given to proper treatment of sewage./At the core of our urban development initiatives such as AMRUT and the Smart Cities Mission is the need to balance urban growth with environmental care./The over 130 million soil health cards distributed to farmers are helping them make informed decisions that will boost their productivity and improve the health of our land, which helps the coming generations. We have integrated objectives of Skill India in the environment sector and launched schemes including Green Skill Development Program for skilling about 7 million youth in environment, forestry, wildlife and climate change sectors by 2021. This will go a long way in creating numerous opportunities for skilled jobs and entrepreneurship in the environment sector./Our country is devoting unparalleled attention to new and renewable sources of energy./Over the last four years, this sector has become more accessible and affordable. The Ujala Yojana has led to the distribution of nearly 310 million LED bulbs./The cost of LED bulbs has declined and so have the electricity bills and the CO_2 emissions. India's proactiveness is seen internationally. It makes me proud that India remained at the forefront of the COP-21 negotiations in Paris in 2015. In March 2018, world leaders of several countries converged in New Delhi to mark the start of the International Solar Alliance, an endeavour to harness the rich potential of solar energy and bring together all nations that are blessed with solar power. While the world is talking about climate change, the call for climate justice has also reverberated from India./Climate justice is about safeguarding the rights and interests of the poor and marginalised sections of society, who are often the biggest sufferers from the menace of climate change./As I have written earlier, our actions today will have an impact on human civilisation much beyond our time. It is up to us to take on the mantle of global responsibility towards a sustainable future./The world needs to shift to a paradigm of environmental philosophy that is anchored in environmental consciousness rather than merely government regulations./I would like to compliment all those individuals and organisations who are working assiduously in this direction./They have become the harbingers of a monumental change in our society. I assure them all possible support from the Government in their pursuits.

Once we realise how we are flag bearers of a rich tradition, it will automatically have a positive impact on our actions./The second aspect is public awareness. We need to talk, write, debate, discuss and deliberate as much as possible on questions relating to the environment. At the same time, it is vital to encourage research and innovation on subjects relating to the environment. This is when more people will know about the pressing challenges of our times and ways to mitigate them./When we as a society are aware of our strong links with environmental conservation and talk about it regularly, we will automatically be proactive in working towards a sustainable environment. That is why, I will put proactiveness as the third facet of bringing about a positive change. In this context, I am delighted to state that the 1.3 billion people of India are proactive and at the forefront of working towards a cleaner and greener environment./We see this proactiveness in the Swachh Bharat Mission, which is directly linked to a sustainable future. With the blessings of the people of India, over 85 million households now have access to toilets for the first time./Over 400 million Indians no longer have to defecate in the open. Sanitation coverage is up from 39% to 95%. These are landmark efforts in the quest of reducing the strain on our natural surroundings./We see this proactiveness in the success of the Ujjwala Yojana, which has significantly reduced indoor air pollution due to unhealthy cooking practices that were causing respiratory diseases. Till date, over 50 million Ujjwala connections have been distributed, thus ensuring a better and cleaner life for the women and their families. India is moving at a quick pace in cleaning its rivers./The Ganga, which is India's lifeline, had become polluted in several parts. The Namami Gange Mission is changing this historical wrong. Emphasis is being given to proper treatment of sewage./At the core of our urban development initiatives such as AMRUT and the Smart Cities Mission is the need to balance urban growth with environmental care./The over 130 million soil health cards distributed to farmers are helping them make informed decisions that will boost their productivity and improve the health of our land, which helps the coming generations. We have integrated objectives of Skill India in the environment sector and launched schemes including Green Skill Development Program for skilling about 7 million youth in environment, forestry, wildlife and climate change sectors by 2021. This will go a long way in creating numerous opportunities for skilled jobs and entrepreneurship in the environment sector./Our country is devoting unparalleled attention to new and renewable sources of energy./Over the last four years, this sector has become more accessible and affordable. The Ujala Yojana has led to the distribution of nearly 310 million LED bulbs./The cost of LED bulbs has declined and so have the electricity bills and the CO_2 emissions. India's proactiveness is seen internationally. It makes me proud that India remained at the forefront of the COP-21 negotiations in Paris in 2015. In March 2018, world leaders of several countries converged in New Delhi to mark the start of the International Solar Alliance, an endeavour to harness the rich potential of solar energy and bring together all nations that are blessed with solar power. While the world is talking about climate change, the call for climate justice has also reverberated from India./Climate justice is about safeguarding the rights and interests of the poor and marginalised sections of society, who are often the biggest sufferers from the menace of climate change./As I have written earlier, our actions today will have an impact on human civilisation much beyond our time. It is up to us to take on the mantle of global responsibility towards a sustainable future./The world needs to shift to a paradigm of environmental philosophy that is anchored in environmental consciousness rather than merely government regulations./I would like to compliment all those individuals and organisations who are working assiduously in this direction./They have become the harbingers of a monumental change in our society. I assure them all possible support from the Government in their pursuits. Together, we will create a clean environment that will be the cornerstone of human empowerment!/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

75K respiratory cases reported this year,"Gurugram, Oct. 10 -- Chest and throat ailments are rising in Gurugram, indicates data from the district's two government hospitals that have registered a 23% increase in respiratory diseases over the last year. More than 75,000 cases of respiratory diseases were reported from January to October this year, compared to 61,000 cases in 2017 and 54,000 in 2016./Doctors blamed the increase on worsening air quality in Gurugram, which is the 11th most polluted city in the world, according to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report released in May./The air quality index (AQI) touched the 'very poor' mark 10 times this year in Februarymarch, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). While February and March saw more than 12,000 cases, August and September recorded close to 10,000 respiratory infection cases./Apart from this, private hospitals said the number of patients coming in with cough and breathlessness has increased by at least 40-50% over the past few years. ""Most of these patients are young adults in the age group of 20 to 35. Many of them are non-residents working in corporate houses, who have never suffered from any respiratory disorder before they moved to Gurugram,"" Dr Richa Tomar, consultant, pulmonology at Max Hospital, said. She added that the patients usually complain of breathlessness, runny nose and allergies. ""This has been the case since the past one year or so,""dr Tomar said./According to a 2015 survey (done by Dr Himanshu Garg, a pulmonologist) of around 500 people from 12 corporate houses in the city, around 68% office-goers suffer from respiratory problems. ""The number of cases has also risen because there is more awareness of the adverse effects of air pollution,"" Dr Tomar said./Dr Garg said the rise in the number of cases could be directly attributed to the rise in PM2.5 levels. A study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-D), published in June, found that the average annual PM2.5 level in Gurugram has increased by 21ug/m3 since 1998./Dr Garg blamed exhaust fumes, open burning of waste and dust from construction sites among other reasons for the high concentration of PM2.5 in the city. Experts have warned residents of worsening air quality in the next few days due to stubbleburning in neighbouring states, lower atmospheric temperature and wind speeds. ""The number of cases of respiratory ailments shoots up in winters, especially after Diwali,"" Dr Tomar said./Dr Naveen Kumar, senior physician at Civil Hospital said, ""The hospital is expecting October and November to be the months when a large number of people will turn up with respiratory ailments due to rising air pollution.""/Dr Tomar recommended that older adults, pregnant women and people with compromised immunity get vaccinated to reduce the risk of influenza-related respiratory illnesses.

Healthy Lung Month: 5 habits that will help you breathe better,"India, Oct. 11 -- October is celebrated as Healthy Lung Month. By following certain simple healthy habits, you can ensure that your lungs are performing well, and keeps oxygen flowing through the body. Here are 5 habits that will help you improve your lung health:/* Exercise: Your lungs are often working at half capacity because there is no reason for them to work at their full potential. But if you exercise, it ensures your heart beats faster and lungs are working better. Do exercises that will make you breath fast to ensure healthy lungs./* Stop/Avoid smoking: This single habit wreaks so much havoc on your lungs. It reduces lung function and is also linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Cigarettes also contain numerous chemicals that inflame and damage the lungs, and may even lead to lung cancer./* Eat right: Some of the best foods for your lungs include water which hydrates the organ, fatty fish which is rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, apples, walnuts and berries./* Avoid exposure to pollution: Air pollution damages the lungs and can make it prone to infections and diseases. To stay safe, avoid inhaling exhaust fumes as much as possible, or secondhand smoke. Also ensure you dust the furniture frequently, and make your home a smoke-free zone./* Benefits of spices: Spices can also help you combat respiratory problems. Curcumin, a yellow pigment found in turmeric has been shown to be beneficial in inhibiting tumour growth in lung cancer, and has anti-inflammatory properties./Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Gurugram AQI not available since early Sept, thanks to CPCB'S 'faulty server'","Gurugram, Oct. 12 -- Air quality in the city visibly deteriorated on Thursday, with high levels of atmospheric dust and increased wind speeds leaving a perpetual haze hanging over the city. However, there is no official data to ascertain the extent of air pollution as Gurugram did not feature in the daily Air Quality Index (AQI) released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Data regarding PM2.5 concentrations was also unavailable on the CPCB website./In fact, since the beginning of September, the city has been excluded from the AQI on 12 separate days-sept 1-4, Sept 15-17, Sept 21, Sept 25, Oct 8 and Oct 10-11./The PM2.5 data has also been only sporadically available for at least two weeks now. Moreover, it has not been possible to obtain the metric for daily average PM2.5 concentrations in Gurugram for over a month./Regional officer (Gurugram) of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) Jai Bhagwan Sharma said that this data loss was a result of ""technical difficulties"". ""I have brought the issue to the notice of the Central Pollution Control Board. It is most likely something to do with our servers and will be resolved at the earliest,"" Sharma said on Thursday./The Hindustan Times had, last week, raised the same issue with a sub-divisional officer of the HSPCB, who had then assured that the issue would be fixed within a day's time. However, the ""technical issue"" persists./On Thursday, a CPCB spokesperson also assured that the matter would be fixed soon./""This shows that the government does not have a robust system to capture air quality data in the city,"" said Sachin Panwar, an air quality consultant who independently tracks atmospheric pollution. He added that this inability of the government would lead to gaps in the official data, which, when analysed, will reveal a partial or false picture of air quality in Gurugram./""For a truly accurate image, you need to monitor the situation every day without fail. When this doesn't happen, the government is likely to take readings for gap days as 'zero',"" SACHIN PANWAR, independent air quality consultant Panwar said, explaining that this is amounts to statistical malpractice./According to Panwar's privately owned air quality monitor, the average daily reading of PM2.5 in the city on Thursday was about 130ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air), more than double the daily safe limit./""It can be attributed to a cyclonic movement from the Middle East, which is carrying with it a lot of dust. We expect the situation to become severe starting October 14,"" Panwar said, warning that the worst is yet to come./Gurugram's air quality has dipped drastically over the last two weeks./The city's last AQI reading, on October 9, was 328, slotting it in the 'Very Poor' category./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Worsening quality of air leads to spike in respiratory diseases,"Gurugram, Oct. 20 -- On Friday, residents of Gurugram woke up to a 'very poor' quality of air for the second day in a row, with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 323, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./The deteriorating air quality, doctors said, is once again triggering respiratory and allergic diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia and tuberculosis. ""People of all ages are coming in with breathlessness, runny nose and headaches due to the rising pollution, although this is not even the peak air pollution season,"" said Dr Manoj Goel, pulmonologist, Fortis Hospital, adding that he fears a huge spike in the number of patients as the AQI rises in the coming few weeks./Residents complained of headaches and difficulty in breathing due to the rising level of air pollution. ""I was only outside for a few minutes on Thursday evening but developed a bad headache not long after I stepped out. Since the past couple of years, poor air quality in the city has been giving me migraines,"" said Payal Gupta, a resident of Sector 50. Another resident said that her asthma has gotten worse over the past two days, and that she has been facing difficulty in breathing./At the same time, residents have started fighting back the dangers of air pollution by buying air-filtration masks and becoming involved in awareness campaigns at the grassroots level. ""I have started a small campaign in my society before Diwali to encourage people to avoid bursting crackers,"" said Gupta./There are other simple and easy steps one can take to breathe easy in the city./To start with, doctors recommended staying indoors. ""Avoid morning walks or outdoor exercises - doing so in a polluted environment can harm the body if tiny hazardous particles enter the lungs. Instead, try working out from home,"" said Dr Goel. He said if one needs to step out, they should wear an N95 mask./Doctors also said while the air inside is much cleaner than the air outside, one should use air purifiers at home and ventilate their house between 3 to 5 pm on sunny days in order to allow the air to circulate./Ruchika Dewan, a diet consultant, said eating jaggery and food with antioxidants can help flush out pollutants from the lungs.

Pollution cloud hanging over Delhi as Diwali nears,"India, Oct. 20 -- Air pollution across north India has started to peak, either nearing or breaching 'very poor' levels in benchmark cities such as Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow, and is likely to rise over the next three weeks leading up to Diwali, according to experts from multiple government and private organisations that monitor the region's annual meteorological and public health nightmare in the winter months./Though untimely rain in September delayed the spike in pollution by two weeks as compared to the last few years, falling temperature, slower wind speeds, stubble fires in Haryana and Punjab as farmers get ready to sow winter crops, and a possible single-day firecracker spurt on Diwali is expected to lead to prolonged 'severe' conditions, particularly in the National Capital Region (NCR), the experts added./The first signs of the spike were visible in Nasa satellite images on Friday that showed high aerosol optical depth over the northern states and the Himalayan foothills in the past couple of days./The images, tweeted by Ashim K Mitra, a scientist from the satellite meteorology division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are particularly telling (see box) because AOD is an indirect proxy for air quality since solid and liquid particles in polluted air block sunlight and lead to smog./""Northern India and the foothills are affected by high aerosol levels. Unless there are strong winds to drive these aerosols away, they will remain accumulated. During Diwali, the situation will obviously deteriorate further unless strict restrictions are placed on firecrackers,"" said an IMD scientist who asked not to be named./Officials in the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said on Friday that they have not restricted the use of firecrackers this year because they are awaiting a Supreme Court verdict on a petition calling for a nationwide ban on the sale and use of firecrackers during Diwali./""We haven't planned anything on firecrackers yet because we are waiting for Supreme Court order on a nationwide firecracker ban. We are anyway not responsible for the sale of firecrackers - it's the respective state governments. Once the SC delivers its judgment, we will monitor the improvement in air quality during Diwali. We can also issue advisories based on SC judgement,"" said a senior CPCB official on condition of anonymity./The Delhi-based petitioners - Arjun Gopal, 3, Aarav Bhandari, 3, and Zoya Rao Bhasin, 5, and their parents -- expect the judgment any day now. ""Many judges have heard our petition and have been extremely concerned about pollution from fire crackers. While the SC judgment is awaited, I think every citizen has the responsibility to not contribute further to air pollution and expose our kids to dirty air,"" said Aarav's father Amit Bhandari./Last October, the Supreme Court suspended the sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR till November 1 to tide over Diwali, which was celebrated on October 19 in 2017. But the use of firecrackers in the city was still rampant on Diwali day, according to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) of CPCB data. The average PM2.5 concentration during Diwali and the morning after (12pm-12am, October 19-20) was 397 microgramme per cubic metre -- 6.6 times higher than the safe limit and is in the 'emergency' zone. The day before Diwali (October 18), the 24-hour average was 184 microgramme per cubic metres./""There should have been a longer term strategy of sensitising people and implementing a ban on firecrackers. Agencies cannot wake up when Diwali is just round the corner. Firecrackers cannot be dealt with only command and control. You need to prepare people for it. Last year also there was a ban but there was no implementation strategy so we didn't see good results,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, CSE./Last year, the pollution levels in Delhi remained in the 'severe' zone (over 401 on the air quality index) for nine days, leading to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal describing the city as a ""gas chamber"" and declaring a public health emergency. It also led to extreme measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) for pollution, from ban on pollution industries, to the entry of trucks, to a threefold hike in parking fees in government lots, at different times during the winter. But the battle against one important factor behind pollution levels in the city - the burning of stubble in neighbouring states - is far from over./Nasa images on stubble burning in north India collated by the University of California, Davis scientists show there were 2,056 fires in Punjab and 1,985 in Haryana between September 18 and October 19 this year. During the same period last year, there were 7,040 fires in Punjab and 2,698 fires in Haryana, but that was partly because the paddy harvest occurred a fortnight earlier in 2017 due to a shorter monsoon./""There is no significant improvement in stubble burning this year because AQI in the Indo-Gangetic plains region is quite bad already, unlike what Haryana and Punjab governments have claimed. There are a large number of fires across the border too,"" said Sadanand Wachche, researcher at the UC, Davis Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and Economy./Over half (54%) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) cases in India are attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution, according to a recent Lancet Global Health research paper. This makes the air we breathe as bad as smoking, depending on our proximity and exposure to pollution sources. In developed countries more than 80% of COPD cases are attributable to smoking.

"Air quality in Delhi dips, may worsen over weekend","India, Oct. 20 -- Air quality in the national capital dipped Saturday morning with PM 10 level at 267 and PM 2.5 level at 226, both in 'Poor' category on Air Quality Index (AQI), at Lodhi Road./A senior official of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said air quality may worsen over the next couple of days due to the combined effects of burning of effigies on Dussehra, stubble burning and low wind speed in Delhi./Air pollution across north India has started to peak, either nearing or breaching 'very poor' levels in benchmark cities such as Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow, according to experts from multiple government and private organisations that monitor the region's annual meteorological and public health nightmare in the winter months./The trend is likely to rise over the next three weeks leading up to Diwali, they said./Though untimely rain in September delayed the spike in pollution by two weeks as compared to the last few years, falling temperature, slower wind speeds, stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab as farmers get ready to sow winter crops, and a possible single-day firecracker spurt on Diwali is expected to lead to prolonged 'severe' conditions, particularly in the National Capital Region (NCR), the experts added./The first signs of the spike were visible in Nasa satellite images on Friday that showed high aerosol optical depth over the northern states and the Himalayan foothills in the past couple of days./The images, tweeted by Ashim K Mitra, a scientist from the satellite meteorology division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are particularly telling because AOD is an indirect proxy for air quality since solid and liquid particles in polluted air block sunlight and lead to smog./""Northern India and the foothills are affected by high aerosol levels. Unless there are strong winds to drive these aerosols away, they will remain accumulated. During Diwali, the situation will obviously deteriorate further unless strict restrictions are placed on firecrackers,"" said an IMD scientist who asked not to be named./Officials in the CPCB said on Friday that they have not restricted the use of firecrackers this year because they are awaiting a Supreme Court verdict on a petition calling for a nationwide ban on the sale and use of firecrackers during Diwali./""We haven't planned anything on firecrackers yet because we are waiting for Supreme Court order on a nationwide firecracker ban. We are anyway not responsible for the sale of firecrackers - it's the respective state governments. Once the SC delivers its judgment, we will monitor the improvement in air quality during Diwali. We can also issue advisories based on SC judgement,"" said a senior CPCB official on condition of anonymity./The Delhi-based petitioners - Arjun Gopal, 3, Aarav Bhandari, 3, and Zoya Rao Bhasin, 5, and their parents -- expect the judgment any day now. ""Many judges have heard our petition and have been extremely concerned about pollution from fire crackers. While the SC judgment is awaited, I think every citizen has the responsibility to not contribute further to air pollution and expose our kids to dirty air,"" said Aarav's father Amit Bhandari./Last October, the Supreme Court suspended the sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR till November 1 to in the run up to Diwali which was celebrated on October 19 in 2017. But the use of firecrackers in the city was still rampant on Diwali day, according to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) of CPCB data. The average PM2.5 concentration during Diwali and the morning after (12pm-12am, October 19-20) was 397 microgramme per cubic metre -- 6.6 times higher than the safe limit and is in the 'emergency' zone. The day before Diwali (October 18), the 24-hour average was 184 microgramme per cubic metres./""There should have been a longer term strategy of sensitising people and implementing a ban on firecrackers. Agencies cannot wake up when Diwali is just round the corner. Firecrackers cannot be dealt with only command and control. You need to prepare people for it. Last year also there was a ban but there was no implementation strategy so we didn't see good results,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, CSE./Last year, the pollution levels in Delhi remained in the 'severe' zone (over 401 on the air quality index) for nine days, leading to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal describing the city as a ""gas chamber"" and declaring a public health emergency. It also led to extreme measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) for pollution, from ban on pollution industries, to the entry of trucks, to a threefold hike in parking fees in government lots, at different times during the winter. But the battle against one important factor behind pollution levels in the city - the burning of stubble in neighbouring states - is far from over./Nasa images on stubble burning in north India collated by scientists at the University of California, Davis Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and Economy show there were 2,056 fires in Punjab and 1,985 in Haryana between September 18 and October 19 this year. During the same period last year, there were 7,040 fires in Punjab and 2,698 fires in Haryana, but that was partly because the paddy harvest occurred a fortnight earlier in 2017 due to a shorter monsoon./""There is no significant improvement in stubble burning this year because AQI in the Indo-Gangetic plains region is quite bad already, unlike what Haryana and Punjab governments have claimed. There are a large number of fires across the border too,"" said Sadanand Wachche, researcher at the UC, Davis Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and Economy./Over half (54%) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) cases in India are attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution, according to a recent Lancet Global Health research paper. This makes the air we breathe as bad as smoking, depending on our proximity and exposure to pollution sources./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Farm fires rob residents of the only clear-air day,"Gurugram, Oct. 22 -- Air quality in the city improved slightly on Sunday, dropping to 305 on the Air Quality Index (AQI), down from Saturday's 374. Experts said this was to be expected, as Sundays are usually 'good days' for air quality in Gurugram, thanks to the reduction in the number of vehicles plying on the city streets./JB Sharma, regional officer (Gurugram), Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said that a significant amount of the city's air pollution comes from large volumes of traffic on the National Highway 8, including commercial trucks with high emissions./Over and above this, the city also lacks a robust public transport system, leading people to rely mostly on private cars and motorbikes./However, the volume of commercial and private vehicles in Gurugram each Sunday drops considerably, providing, in turn, relief from air pollution./On October 14, too, Gurugram's AQI improved to 297, down from 325 the previous day. The same trend can be observed on October 7, when Gurugram scored 297 again, down from 330 on the previous day. On both these days, the air quality improved to 'poor' from 'very poor', compared to the previous Saturdays, while air quality deteriorated once again on the following Mondays./To take another example, on September 30, air quality had improved to 'moderate' (174 on the AQI), whereas on September 29 it stood at 'poor' (with 298 on the AQI). On October 1, the AQI shot up once again to 204, putting Gurugram back in the 'poor' category. Therefore, the Sunday trend of air pollution is well established./However, yesterday was the first time on a Sunday that the air quality remained in the 'very poor' category (despite improving slightly)./Experts said this was due to stubble burning in Haryana, which has led to the concentration of huge amounts of PM2.5 in the city's atmosphere./""About 70% of the pollutants we are seeing in Gurugram are not vehicular or local, but coming from the farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. The smoke is blowing slowly toward the National Capital Region (NCR),"" said the city-based air quality expert Sachin Panwar, adding that reduced vehicular pollution would not be enough to provide relief, even on Sundays./Additionally, if one observes the AQI scores on all Sundays since September, one sees the level of pollution steadily rising, leaving no doubt about the spike in air pollution. On September 9, Gurugram scored 42 on the AQI ('good' air quality). This worsened to 97 ('good') by September 23, 174 ('moderate') on September 30, 297 ('poor') on October 7 and October 14, and then 305 ('very poor') on October 21. PM2.5 continues to be the primary pollutant in the city. Sunday recorded PM2.5 levels as high as 821.31ug/m3 (micrograms per metre cube), more than 13 times the safe limit of 60ug/m3./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Sellers relieved but say very little time to obtain temporary licences,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 24 -- Relief and confusion were two emotions that dominated the wholesale firecracker markets of the national capital on Tuesday after the Supreme Court lifted its blanket ban on sale and purchase of crackers./The apex court asked for sale of 'green crackers' (without chemicals such as arsenic, barium and those which makes less sound), which most traders said are currently not available in the market. Since most shopkeepers said they would focus on clearing their old stock till the green crackers come in the market, the capital is set to witness more air pollution this festive season./Firecracker sellers said they were relieved that the complete ban has been lifted and that they will be able to reclaim their business. At the same time they said that the SC order has arrived too late for many of them to get temporary licences to sell crackers before the festival on November 7. Most traders said that because there is less time for them to get temporary license, they fear the markets will be full of illegal shops./After the Apex court order on Tuesday, huge crowds gathered around fireworks shops at the wholesale markets in the city - like the ones at Sadar Bazar and Jama Masjid./""Last year, there was a ban on both sale and purchase because of which traders suffered losses. The SC order has come as a huge relief but it is a bit too late for everyone to get temporary licenses at such a short notice,"" said Narender Gupta, president, fireworks and general traders association, Sadar Bazaar./There are only two shops in Sadar Bazaar that have permanent licences. Around 24 shopkeepers every year get temporary licences to sell crackers during the festive season./At Jama Masjid, there are 10 old-time shops that have permanent licences, while at least 40-50 acquire temporary permits./According to the SC judgment, fireworks such as sky shots, rockets and garlands with heavy sounds and those emitting black carbon smoke will not be sold once the green crackers start coming into the market./According to the CPCB guidelines, the noise of a firecracker cannot exceed 125 decibels at a four-metre distance from the place where it is burst./""The order has just come and it's difficult at the moment to bifurcate crackers based on the chemicals used in it. We need to clear the old stock so that we are able to recover some losses at least,"" said Ravinder Sahni, whose shop has a permanent license in Sadar Bazar and whose family has been in the business for over 50 years./S C Jain of Vishal Fireworks at Jama Masjid market said that last year he had to shut his shop after the court order./""My shop was shut the whole of last year. We have been dealing in fireworks for decades and suddenly the business went for a toss,"" said Jain, who owns a wholesale shop./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
