Schoolkids inhale killer morning smog,"New Delhi, Nov. 1 -- It is the young lungs, especially under five years of age, that suffer the maximum damage when air pollution levels peak, say doctors./For children, the risk really begins very early - right from the womb and continues through till early childhood./""Long-term, recurrent exposure to pollution is linked to underdeveloped lungs in children, low birth weight, heart diseases, stroke, and now, studies show associations of pollution with reduced cognitive abilities as well,"" Dr BK Tripathi, professor of medicine, Safdarjung hospital, said./Short-term impact/The exposure to air pollution leads to immediate breathing difficulties, respiratory symptoms, and irritation of the eye./""Children and the elderly are the most vulnerable - whatever symptoms people are experiencing, they are more pronounced in them. In my clinic, people who already have existing conditions such as asthma and COPD are coming with exacerbated symptoms,"" Dr Sandeep Nayyar, head of the department of respiratory medicine, allergy and sleep disorders, BL Kapur Super Speciality Hospital, said./""When pollution is at its peak, children who already have minor breathing issues get aggravated symptoms that don't allow them proper sleep at night. Lack of sleep over a period of time can lead to altered moods and memory issues,"" Dr Manvir Bhatia, sleep medicine expert, said./Doctors usually advise parents to ensure that their child stays indoors when pollution levels are high. ""Parents should ensure that the child remains occupied with fun indoor activities to prevent them from having mood issues and becoming irritable,"" Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor, psychiatry department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, said./The WHO report stated that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution - they breathe faster than adults inhaling more pollutants, they live closer to the ground where pollution levels are concentrated, and they spend more time outdoors./Long-term impact/Repeated exposure can lead to children developing asthma and other allergic respiratory symptoms later in life./""There are studies that show that in children, exposure to high pollution levels can lead to them developing chronic respiratory conditions,"" Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant, department of chest medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said. ""The allergic symptoms irritate the mucous membrane lining the airway and damage it. Recurrence of the symptoms leads to scarring and irreversible damage of the lining,"" Dr Tripathi said./An increase of 100 u g/m3 in the PM2.5 during birth month was associated with a decrease of .05cm in height-for-age of child. This means a 5-year-old girl will be 0.24 cm shorter than average./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Kejriwal distributes masks to school kids, asks them to write to Punjab, Haryana CM regarding smog","India, Nov. 1 -- The Delhi government on Friday started distributing anti-pollution masks to schoolchildren to protect them from the foul air that has enveloped the capital./The government had announced it would distribute five million N95 masks --- capable of blocking at least 95% of PM 2.5 particles -- to students of both government and private schools./Government officials said they had procured around 2.2 million masks for the distribution till Friday. Each such mask has cost the government Rs 19.75, officials said./During the event, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told students that smoke emanating from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana was causing air pollution in the city and urged them to write letters to the chief ministers of both the states./The CM encouraged the students to help stop garbage burning in Delhi. ""We have to stop garbage burning in Delhi. If you see anyone doing so, request them to not do it. If they do not listen, there is a WhatsApp number to report it,"" he said./The students were given a kit having two masks and a pamphlets explaining how to use them./On October 1, Hindustan Times had reported on the modalities of the proposed plan and how students of Class 6 to Class 12 of government and private schools would be entitled to get two such masks each. The scheme will cover around 2.45 million students./Many parents appreciated the government's initiative. Shanti Devi, mother of a class 7th student at government senior secondary school in Karol Bagh, said, ""Parents of government school students cannot afford these expensive masks. The government is giving us these masks for free.""/When asked why the event was organised outdoors on a day when pollution had touched alarming levels, Arvind Kejriwal said, ""Those who want to criticise us will keep doing it no matter what concrete steps we take and what we achieve in terms of reducing air pollution in Delhi. Opposition parties have been fanning such sentiments. They will do anything but not tell us what they have done to reduce stubble burning on their part.""/Some students complained about receiving large-sized masks. ""The mask does not fit me even after tightening the adjustable string,"" said a class 8 student at the Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Civil Lines./Sanjeev Khirwar, secretary, Delhi health and family welfare department, said, ""All masks are of standard size and should fit children of classes 6 and above. There is a nose pin to adjust the masks. It can be worn by the children whenever they step outdoors during the high-pollution period.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Not just organs, pollution can cause cellular damage too: Experts","India, Nov. 1 -- Breathing in high volumes of heavily polluted air for a prolonged period adversely affects not just the organs in your body but also causes damage at the cellular level, say experts./The journal Chest, the official publication of the American College of Chest Physicians, highlighted in its review earlier this year that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) 2.5 or less is the fifth leading risk factor for death in the world./In the recent Global Burden of Disease data analysis as well, more than one million premature deaths were attributable to ambient air pollution in 2015 in India. Your lungs, heart and the brain are worst sufferers when pollution levels peak as very fine PM particles can find their way into the circulatory system and damage the organs./Chokes the lungs/The respiratory system comprises nose, throat, respiratory tubes and the lungs. The PM 2.5 and 10 microns are considered dangerous as they are of respirable size and can travel down to the lowest part of the lungs where gas exchange takes place./""When we say PM 2.5 or 10, it is only the size of the particle we are talking about and the kind of damage afflicted depends on the source of these particles, such as firecrackers, fuel combustion, stubble burning, etc. PM formed due to diesel or kerosene burning can cause lung cancer,"" says Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./The damage starts with inflammation of the airway, and finer the particulate matter the deeper it penetrates. ""What nobody talks much about but who do the maximum damage are ultrafine particles of 0.1 micron or less. These penetrate the lungs and reach the blood stream. Once they are in your blood, these can go anywhere - the brain, the heart, kidneys, etc.,"" said Dr Khilnani,/Harms the heart/Breathing in heavily polluted air can cause irreversible damage to the arteries as well./""When these fine particles that lungs aren't able to filter reach the blood stream, these get attached to the blood vessel walls - the arteries. Over a period of time, there can be a clot formation inside the vessel that can lead to blockage. There can be a sudden narrowing of the blood vessels that can eventually lead to a heart attack,"" said Dr Upendra Kaul, senior cardiologist, Batra Hospital &#38; Medical Research Centre./It can lead to an unstable angina - not enough blood and oxygen flow to the heart causing a heart attack. In patients who already have blockages, exposure to pollutants tends to accelerate the process./Respiratory diseases can also cause damage to the heart./""Chronic bronchitis also leads to heart disease, though of a different kind. It's called cor pulmonale, or enlargement of the heart,"" adds Dr Kaul./Brain damage/The brain is also not spared from the adverse effects of pollution. ""When the heart malfunctions, it automatically affects the brain functioning as well, as blood or oxygen flow to the brain becomes restricted, which can lead to a stroke. Also, inhaling pollutants emits certain chemical responses within the body which can also cause a stroke over a period of time,"" says Dr Deepak Aggarwal, professor, neurosurgery, AIIMS./Since pollutants affect a person's immunity, it can also cause autoimmune disorders./""Exposure to pollutants can also lead to a condition called vasculitis, which is inflammation of blood vessels that leads to thickening, weakening, narrowing or scarring of the vessels. This could also lead to a stroke,"" he added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air toxic for young lungs but schools to remain open in the capital,"India, Nov. 1 -- The air in the national capital appeared set to enter the emergency zone on Friday but officials dithered on announcing a shutdown of schools citing a technicality, even as experts said young children should be kept indoors till pollution levels ease./The 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 ultra-fine particles reported by the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management-Delhi NCR's dashboard was at 296.7ug/m3 at 11pm on Thursday, close to the 300ug/m3 level that is regarded as the threshold beyond which the pollution is considered to be at emergency levels./The rise, which was consistent since the afternoon, coincides with a rapid rise in the number of farm fires reported in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana - a key source of the pollutant that is considered to be the deadliest of all particles in the air. Since Wednesday, there were at least 5,300 incidents of farm fires - the effects of which are expected to be felt in the national capital region (NCR) soon./""Morning time is worse for children to be outdoors since pollution is at its peak around that time. Their airways are developing, and are narrower, so they are prone to more injury when breathing in heavy pollutants,"" said Dr JS Bhasin, senior Paediatrician, BLK Hospital./""Apart from throat and lungs, pollution also affects their eyes and skin,"" he added./Authorities in Delhi and Noida have advised schools to cut down on outdoor activities, though no order has been given to shut schools for now. Pollution control authorities have cited a slight improvement that is expected in pollution levels by Sunday to resist from ordering more serious curbs such a ban on schools./But experts said this showed the inadequacy of the air pollution plan, and highlighted how it was reactive rather than proactive in nature./""It is time to have a re-look at the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). In most countries, actions are taken based on forecast.

Why ban on stubble burning has gone up in smoke in Punjab,"India, Nov. 1 -- On Friday, the sun didn't shine over Punjab for the second consecutive day, eclipsed as it was by a thick blanket of a toxic smog created by unabated paddy stubble fires across the state. Such was level of air pollution that even the satellite imageries could not record the fire incidents, particularly in the worst-affected southern districts./Post-Diwali, a sudden spike in stubble burning has raised questions on the efficacy of a raft of steps taken by the state government to curb the menace. As many as 17,672 farm fires - almost 80% of this season so far - have been recorded in last week./""Officers from deputy commissioner to peon are working to stop the farm fires, but there is no political support,"" says an exasperated senior IAS official, who requested anonymity. ""Not a single MLA of any party has opposed stubble burning. Everyone is trying to defend Punjab, saying the state is not responsible for Delhi smog, but what about the smog in Punjab? Do you think the Punjabis are not suffering?""/HT looks at five reasons why the ban on stubble burning has gone up in smoke:/Farmers Blame Late Harvesting/The farmers blame the delayed paddy harvesting as the reason behind paddy straw burning. That left them with a very little time window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat. ""We have to sow wheat before November 15. Since handling paddy straw is tedious process, burning it is an easier option to clear the fields for the next crop,"" says Mukhtiar Singh, a farmer in Patiala. However, the agricultural department doesn't buy into this argument, saying the wheat can be sown till end of November./Tardy Implementation of Central Scheme/Under an ambitious scheme, funded by the central government, Punjab had set a target of distributing 19,000 subsidised machines to farmers for in-situ management of stubble. But due to late tendering, it managed to provide only half of that before harvesting. Non-availability of machines to small farmers left them with little option but to resort to stubble burning./""I have 2.5 acres of land, and I can't afford a tractor or machine. If the government is serious, it should come with a bailer and clear my field, otherwise I will clear it by using fire,"" said Harjinder Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan)./In fact, farmers insist that the straw-handling machines are available at much cheaper price in the market as compared to the subsidised machinery. ""Why no direct subsidy to farmers if government is serious about controlling paddy?"" asks Gurmej Singh, a farmer leader./Soft Government, Defiant Farmers/Even as a sizable section of farmers have got access to subsidised stubble-management machines, some of peasants' unions have been openly exhorting farmers to defy the ban against stubble burning to pressure the government to meet their demand for a bonus of Rs 100 per quintal as an incentive for not burning stubble./Some farmer unions are even confronting the officials making surprise checks in the fields and imposing fines on farmers found burning stubble. Jagtar Singh, a leader of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), says, ""Farmers are already under financial stress. It is the duty of government to pay at least Rs100 per quintal as charges of handling paddy straw.""/What has complicated the matter is the government's soft approach on cracking the whip against farmers who form an influential vote bank. Farmers' unions know this too well./HC Directions on Not Recovering Fines/Even before harvesting season, a major blow to the campaign against stubble burning came last month when the Punjab and Haryana high court stayed the recovery of fines imposed on farmers penalised earlier. But, farmer unions misinterpreted the court directive as a restraint order on the state government for slapping any penalty on farmers for stubble burning. ""Prior to the HC order, there were minimal farm fires, but farmer union leaders spread misinformation which led to a large scale violation of the ban,"" said an official./Non-Operational Biomass Units/The Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA) had floated tenders for 150 MW biomass plants, which could have handled at least 50 lakh MT of paddy straw. However, despite getting bids, no one came forward as Punjab State Power Corporation Limited is not signing power purchase agreement on tariffs decided by the state power regulator.

"HealthWise: Not just lungs and heart, air pollution does deeper damage","India, Nov. 2 -- Air pollutants cause frequent lung infection, chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, heart attack and stroke, but lesser known is the long-term health damage from non-cardiopulmonary diseases and infections./One in eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution, which accounts for at least 11% of all premature deaths in people younger than 70 years, according to the most comprehensive state-wise estimate of air pollution-related disease and deaths published in The Lancet Planetary Health in 2018./While most people associate air toxins with lung disease, 38% of the disease burden from air pollution in India is from heart disease and diabetes, found the study, which estimated it accounted for 1.24 million or 12.5% of the annual deaths./The study found no state in India has an annual mean fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5 micrometres are particles one-400th of a millimetre) lower than the WHO recommended level of 10ug/m3, with 76.8% of India's population was exposed to mean PM2.5 more than 40ug/m3, which is the recommended limit set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of India./Universal risk/""Air pollution is now the most pervasive public health threat across all ages. From affecting the health of the unborn child through placental transfer and damaging the lungs of the young child to asthma, heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive lung disease, dementia and osteoporosis, the list of health disorders is growing in range of recognition by research and magnitude of documented damage. This calls for urgent and energetic multisectoral response,"" said Dr K.

Among the lesser known extrapulmonary diseases of air pollution contributes to and exacerbated are:/Diabetes/Air pollution damages a several biological pathways associated with glucose metabolism and leads diabetes. Long-term exposure to PM10 in India led to higher glycaemia and insulin resistance and exacerbated the progression and complications of diabetes, found the Wellcome Trust Genetic Study co-authored by researchers from four institutes in Pune. ""Atmospheric pollution, particularly PM2.5 and PM10, is directly related to inflammation, insulin resistance and diabetes, which has been shown in India and several countries. Of equal importance is increased progression to complications of diabetes, in particular, heart attacks in people with diabetes. It is the leading cause of death in people with diabetes,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis Centre of Excellence for diabetes, metabolic diseases and endocrinology./Exposure to PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from vehicular and power plant emissions raises diabetes prevalence and levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, which is a measure of glucose control over the past three months), according to International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. People with HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% have a higher chance of getting diabetes, 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes./Anaemia/Chronic exposure to pollution raised systemic inflammation and affect red blood cells production (erythropoiesis), leading to anaemia, reported a study in the journal, Environment International. Anaemia is defined as haemoglobin count of &#38;lt;13 g/dL for men and =30%), and kidney failure, according to a study in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. The risk of CKD and its progression was most pronounced at the highest levels of fine particulate matter concentrations, found the study./People living closer to a major road had lower eGFR than patients living farther away, found a study of living in the proximity to a busy road and kidney function in the Boston area in the US, reported a study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

Govt not too serious about tackling air pollution: Maya,"LUCKNOW, Nov. 2 -- Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief and former UP chief minister Mayawati has expressed concern at rising pollution and deteriorating air quality index (AQI) in Delhi and Lucknow. She claimed the government didn't appear ""too serious"" on the issue./""After demonetisation and an 'economic emergency' led to massive unemployment, now the threat of air pollution is being extensively discussed in the media, but the government doesn't seem to be too serious on such an important issue. This is very sad,"" the former chief minister said./Mayawati said dipping air quality and resultant pollution had led to closure of schools in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR)./""Now, along with political, social, economic and communal atmosphere, even the air isn't fit for peaceful breathing. It's imperative that the centre and state governments accord the priority the issue deserves,"" she said./Post Diwali, at least 10 UP cities had their AQI above 400 (severe) with Lucknow clocking an AQI of nearly 350 plus, which led to chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealing to farmers against stubble burning./Adityanath also convened a meeting of officials to discuss ways to ensure ways to combat rising air pollution, which experts say cause frequent lung infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, heart attack and stroke, besides long-term health damage./He directed the authorities to sprinkle water to contain dust-induced pollution, check garbage burning and asked officials to limit road construction activity for the time being so that air pollution could be minimised./The UP Power Corporation Limited has also been asked to come up with an alternative to generators that contribute to air pollution./The chief minister has directed the departments of transport, traffic, home, urban development, public works department, mining, fire safety, education, housing, UPPCL and NHAI, to suggest remedies./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Kejriwal politicising pollution: Javadekar,"New Delhi, Nov. 2 -- Union environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, on Friday slammed chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for politicising the issue of air pollution./Kejriwal had tweeted on Friday morning that ""Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states.""/Javadekar said it is the Modi government that has led the air pollution curbing policies. ""For 15 years, there was only discussion on eastern and western peripheral expressways. The Modi government managed to complete the construction of the expressways in five years. The construction of the eastern peripheral expressway has led to over 60,000 vehicles bypassing Delhi, reducing air pollution.""/""Delhi chief minister is politicising the pollution issue and engaging in blame game on air pollution. I will not stoop to that level. Blame game can get you kachchi chitthi (several fake encomiums) but not real relief from pollution. Curbing pollution is everyone's responsibility. We need support from industries, people and farmers,"" he said, at an event to flag off electric vehicles procured by the ministry of information and broadcasting./Kejriwal said, ""We admit there are local sources of pollution in Delhi. They include vehicles, construction and industrial activities. But we, as a government, have taken adequate measures to address pollution from local sources. Odd-even would be one such example. But, at this stage, stubble burning is the biggest threat. The Centre and states concerned have to do something about it. Why do they always evade talks on controlling stubble burning?""/Delhi's environment minister, Kailash Gahlot, said, ""So far, we have thrice received a notice from the Union environment minister for meetings, but on all three occasions, the meetings were cancelled.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How Delhi can get rid of its annual pollution mess,"New Delhi, Nov. 2 -- The national capital region (NCR) and much of the Indo-Gangetic plains were shrouded in a toxic haze since last week, a rerun of an annual pollution crisis that is turning into a headache for policy makers and administrations./While the average annual air quality index readings have shown a slight decline since 2017 - it was 165 that year, 154 in 2018 and 135 in the months till now -the improvement appears to be largely due to weather conditions in summer months while winter pollution has shown little change./Experts say that this is significant because it suggests the hectic efforts that were put in place in response to the pollution crisis in 2016 have failed to make any impact and that improvements have mostly been due to meteorological factors that are outside of human control./Insights from efforts that did not work, and some that did, in the past couple of years can largely be distilled into the following action plans, experts and scientists told HT./IMPROVE GRAP/The graded response action plan (Grap), the sets of curbs that are meant to be automatically implemented when pollution levels cross certain thresholds, has not been effective due to a combination of factors. Experts have said the plan is not pre-emptive and some additional measures, such as beefing up public transport infrastructure, should have been taken to make it successful./""Grap of the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) has not had impact since the government failed to increase parking fees, augment public transport, increase metro frequency and put a check on vehicle registration,"" said Ritwick Dutta, a Delhi-based environment lawyer./A former official of the CPCB said one of the problems is a lack of focus in seasons when pollution is not an apparent problem. ""This is primarily because the work on combating air pollution starts just when there is a spike instead of working going on around the year,"" said this former scientist, who asked not to be named./FIRE CRACKERS MUST GO/This year's air quality crisis in the capital began following Diwali celebrations on October 27, when people defied restrictions on how long and what kind of firecrackers they could burst, leading to an almost immediate build-up up of toxic air that lingered on for most of the week. By midnight on the night of Diwali, the concentration of PM2.5 pollutants - the most harmful of all aerosols -- shut up almost 16 times./""Our analysis clearly showed that bursting of crackers on Sunday night had spiralled the pollution curve to nearly the same severe levels that was observed during 2018 Diwali. This happened despite the fact that 2019 Diwali was warmer and windier than 2018. This temporarily undid the comparatively better air quality gains of this season due to favourable weather, on-going pollution control action, and preventive emergency measures,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury from the Centre of Science and Environment./A day after Diwali, there was an increase in patients coming to hospitals with breathing ailments. ""We are increasingly seeing healthy people who have no previous history of chronic respiratory diseases coming in with asthma-like symptoms. Many of these patients now have to use steroids inhalers for up to four weeks,"" said Dr Karan Madan, associate professor of pulmonology at All India Institute Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered that only so-called green firecrackers - which are made without certain chemicals and emit 30% lower pollutants - should be used in the Delhi-NCR region, and firecrackers can only be burst between 8pm and 10pm./According to Dutta and Roychoudhury, implementation of such curbs is difficult and the solution may lie only in a complete ban on sale of firecrackers in the NCR area for all of winter./COMPLETE STOP ON FARM FIRES/According to ministry of earth sciences' air pollution monitoring body System for air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), stubble burning contributes 8% to 50% to capital air pollution load between mid October and mid-November. A day after Diwali, its contribution was 35% to Delhi's air pollution, SAFAR website said./On average, around 70-80 million tonnes of paddy straw is burnt every year in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh every year to clear fields for winter crop, according to an IIT, Kanpur, study. ""Emissions from stubble burning can certainly impact air quality in Delhi and other cities in Gangetic plain,"" the study on sources of air pollution released in 2016, said./Despite the National Green Tribunal asking Punjab and Haryana governments to prevent burning of stubble, data recorded by NASA website on Thursday showed that number of fire incidents (mostly farm fires) till October 30, 2019, were higher than what was seen in 2018 and 2017./Over 52,352 incidents of fires have been recorded by NASA as compared to 45,736 in 2018 and 52,136 in 2017 during the same period, according to information analysed by HT./Since 2017, authorities have attempted to coax and punish farmers into quitting the practice, but the efforts fall short of ground realities, where it is still financially more viable for farmers to continue burning crop residue and paying the Rs.2,500 fine instead of spending more money on machinery that can prevent the need for it./Farmer unions have said government subsidies for the machinery have either been inadequate or have not reached farmers at all./MANAGING HOTSPOTS/The Environment Protection (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has identified 14 pollution hotspots in Delhi-NCR. These are areas where air pollution levels are highest and contribute heavily to the overall pollution levels of the city./Hotspot management is consistent with global regulatory trends and is based on the principle that if cities are safe for the most vulnerable, it will be safe or all, Roychoudhury said, explaining that it was crucial to focus on people who were affected in hotspot areas./In Delhi, effective hotspot management will need collaborative effort between the Delhi government and the three municipal corporations. CSE estimates that hotspot management can lead to a 65% cut in local emissions, which contributes about 70% to Delhi's base air pollution./FIGHTING DUST/The 2015 IIT study that identified sources of pollution said road dust was a prominent contributor pollution. ""The top four contributors to PM10 emissions are road dust (56%), concrete batching (10%), industrial point sources (10%) and vehicles (9%); these are based on annual emissions.The top four contributors to PM2.5 emissions are road dust (38 %), vehicles (20 %), domestic fuel burning (12 %) and industrial point sources (11%),"" the study said./Fighting sources of dust alone can cut Delhi's pollution by a third, said Mukesh Sharma of IIT, Kanpur, who anchored the study./The CPCB and the national green tribunal (NGT), through several orders in the last three years have focused on landscaping of all roads to reduce dust recirculation./In 2016, the CPCB issued comprehensive rules for dust management including construction and demolition sector to the state governments and asked them to put in place effective monitoring system in place in three years./The EPCA report of October 18, 2019, said the rules had no impact as developers continue to operate with disregard. Former CPCB member secretary AB Akolkar said the state governments have been slow in implementing the guidelines, which were voluntary in nature. ""Most pollution control boards don't have manpower to implement the rules and the municipal bodies enough funds to implement the regulations,"" he said./Dutta said Delhi and other state governments in the NCR need to provide specific funds for dust management. Roychoudhury added that Resident Welfare Associations should be made part of waste management and dust control measures for it to be effective./ACCOUNTABILITY/Senior Supreme Court lawyer, M C Mehta, in whose petition CNG was introduced in Delhi in 2000, said reducing air pollution in Delhi would be a difficult task unless authorities are held accountable for failing to implement directions of courts and pollution watchdogs./The Delhi government agreed to introduce environment friendly compressed natural gas for public transport only when the Supreme Court summoned chief secretary of Delhi and threatened to send him to jail for failing to implement its orders, Mehta said./""The SC had shown the path but there is no political will to follow that path,"" he added./""Leaders are blaming each other for Delhi's high air pollution as people suffer. Sadly, all gains from introduction of CNG have been lost and we are back to dark days of 1990s when Delhi used to fume with toxic air.""/Vijay Panjwani, who has been CPCB's counsel, said: ""There has been a lot of talk on how to control air pollution in recent years but very little real action has taken place. The reason is that real action will result in inconvenience to some people that political parties are not willing to risk. So, we need a law that stipulates time-bound implementation and punitive action against officials and persons for failing to implement the law,"" he said./(With inputs from Vijdhan Mohammad Kawoosa in New Delhi, HTCs in Chandigarh)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution causes cellular damage too: Experts,"New Delhi, Nov. 2 -- Breathing in high volumes of heavily polluted air for a prolonged period adversely affects not just the organs in your body but also causes damage at the cellular level, say experts./The Chest, the official publication of the American College of Chest Physicians, highlighted this year that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) 2.5 or less is the fifth leading risk factor for death globally. In recent Global Burden of Disease data analysis, over a million premature deaths were attributable to ambient air pollution in 2015 in India. Your lungs, heart and brain are worst sufferers when pollution spikes as very fine PM particles can find their way into the circulatory system and damage the organs./Chokes the lungs/The respiratory system comprises nose, throat, respiratory tubes and lungs. PM 2.5 and 10 microns are dangerous as they are of respirable size and can travel down to lowest part of lungs where gas exchange takes place. ""When we say PM 2.5 or 10, it is only the PM size we are talking about. Damage depends on source of PM, such as firecrackers, fuel combustion, stubble burning,"" says Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology dept, AIIMS./Damage starts with inflammation of airway, and finer the PM, deeper it penetrates. ""ultrafine particles of 0.1 micron or less are most dangerous as they penetrate the lungs and reach the blood stream, from where they can go anywhere - brain, heart, kidneys,"" said Dr Khilnani./Harms the heart/Breathing in pollution can cause irreversible damage to arteries. ""When these fine particles reach the blood, they get attached to the blood vessel walls - the arteries. Over time, there can be a clot formation inside the vessel leading to blockage. There can be a sudden narrowing of blood vessels eventually leading to a heart attack,"" said Dr Upendra Kaul, senior cardiologist, Batra Hospital &#38; Medical Research Centre./It can lead to an unstable angina. In patients who have blockages, pollutants can accelerate the process./Respiratory diseases can damage the heart. ""Chronic bronchitis leads to heart disease, though of a different kind,"" he adds./Brain damage/The brain is also not spared from pollution. ""When the heart malfunctions, it affects the brain as well, as blood or oxygen flow to the brain becomes restricted, which can lead to a stroke. Also, inhaling pollutants emits certain chemical responses within the body which can cause a stroke over time,"" says Dr Deepak Aggarwal, professor, neurosurgery, AIIMS./Pollutants can cause autoimmune disorders. ""It can lead to vasculitis - inflammation of blood vessels that leads to thickening, weakening, narrowing or scarring of the vessels. This could also lead to a stroke,"" he added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Kejriwal distributes free masks to schoolchildren,"New Delhi, Nov. 2 -- The Delhi government on Friday started distributing anti-pollution masks to schoolchildren to protect them from the foul air that has enveloped the capital./The government had announced it would distribute five million N95 masks --- capable of blocking at least 95% of PM 2.5 particles -- to students of both government and private schools./Government officials said they had procured around 2.2 million masks for the distribution till Friday. Each such mask has cost the government R19.75, officials said./During the event, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told students that smoke emanating from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana was causing air pollution in the city and urged them to write letters to the chief ministers of both the states./The CM encouraged the students to help stop garbage burning in Delhi. ""We have to stop garbage burning in Delhi. If you see anyone doing so, request them to not do it. If they do not listen, there is a WhatsApp number to report it,"" he said./The students were given a kit having two masks and a pamphlets explaining how to use them. On October 1, Hindustan Times had reported on the modalities of the proposed plan and how students of Class 6 to Class 12 of government and private schools would be entitled to get two such masks each. The scheme will cover around 2.45 million students./Many parents appreciated the government's initiative. Shanti Devi, mother of a class 7th student at government senior secondary school in Karol Bagh, said, ""Parents of government school students cannot afford these expensive masks. The government is giving us these masks for free.""/When asked why the event was organised outdoors on a day when pollution had touched alarming levels, Arvind Kejriwal said, ""Those who want to criticise us will keep doing it no matter what concrete steps we take and what we achieve in terms of reducing air pollution in Delhi. Opposition parties have been fanning such sentiments. They will do anything but not tell us what they have done to reduce stubble burning on their part.""/Some students complained about receiving large-sized masks./""The mask does not fit me even after tightening the adjustable string,"" said a class 8 student at the Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Civil Lines./Sanjeev Khirwar, secretary, Delhi health and family welfare department, said, ""All masks are of standard size and should fit children of classes 6 and above. There is a nose pin to adjust the masks.

In particular, minimise exposure of children, aged and vulnerable,"" said an advisory issued by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca)./The actions come nearly at the end of a week that began with a toxic haze caused by illegal use of firecrackers on Diwali on October 27, made worse still by weather conditions that trapped them in the atmosphere and by smoke that drifted in from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana./According to the Union government's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the share of pollutants from the farm fires - mostly ultra-fine PM2.5 particles - had shot up from 15% on Tuesday to 46% on Friday./""Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states. It is very [important] that we protect ourselves from this toxic air,"" chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet on Friday morning, while posting photographs of a government function to distribute breathing masks to children./Hours after the event, the CM announced that schools in Delhi will be shut till Tuesday following a recommendation from Epca./""We have to take this as a public health emergency as air pollution is now hazardous and will have adverse health impacts on all, but particularly our children,"" Epca chairperson Bhure Lal said in a letter to the administrations of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan./The Epca also ordered a complete ban on construction work, firecracker use, and activities of polluting industries such as stone-crushers./The order came amid growing criticism of the response mechanism - the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) - and a rule that says escalating curbs will apply only when pollution has been severe for more than 48 hours./Experts, including some from within Epca, also questioned why some curbs such as shutting of schools was kept only in most extreme scenarios such as when an emergency had to be declared./According to officials, people in NCR will need to wait till the weather changes for any relief. ""A western disturbance is approaching and this is expected to trigger some strong surface winds, which in turn would help flush out pollutants. Significant improvement is expected from Sunday onwards,"" said a senior official of Safar./Delhi, meteorologists explained, is at present trapped in a cycle of pollution that blocks out the sun, which in turn makes the day temperatures cooler - a crucial factor that again leads to pollutants being trapped in the air. Once winds help clear some pollutants, more sunshine will aid in warming and, thus, clearing away more particles./Beginning on Monday, odd-even road rationing restrictions will apply in the national capital. The Delhi government also announced that 42 agencies, including Delhi government departments, municipal corporations and the state election commission, will work in staggered office timings untill odd-even restrictions end on November 14./The crisis in the national capital also took a political turn, with chief minister Kejriwal demanding the Centre and the state governments of Punjab and Haryana come up with ""specific timelines"" to end the practice of farm fires./Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday said Kejriwal was ""politicising"" the pollution problem and indulging in a ""blame game"", before making accusations against the Delhi administration for not taking enough steps. The minister said Kejriwal's government had not released the state's share for the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and a bypass road that could reduce pollution levels in the national capital. ""The state government had to release ~3,500 crore but they did not give it. They had to release ~1,000 crore on a court order,"" Javadekar said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Toxic air does deeper damage than we think,"New Delhi, Nov. 3 -- Air pollutants cause frequent lung infection, chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, heart attack and stroke, but lesser known is the long-term health damage from non-cardiopulmonary diseases and infections./One in eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution, accounting for at least 11% of all premature deaths in people younger than 70 years, according to the most comprehensive state-wise estimate of air pollution-related disease and deaths published in The Lancet Planetary Health in 2018./While most people associate air toxins with lung disease, 38% of the disease burden from air pollution in India is from heart disease and diabetes, found the study, which estimated it accounted for 1.24 million or 12.5% of the annual deaths./The study found that no state in India has an annual mean fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5 micrometres are particles one-400th of a millimetre) lower than the WHO recommended level of 10ug/m3, with 76.8% of India's population was exposed to mean PM2.5 more than 40ug/m3, which is the recommended limit set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of India./""Air pollution is now the most pervasive public health threat across ages. From affecting the health of the unborn child through placental transfer and damaging the lungs of the young child to asthma, heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive lung disease, dementia and osteoporosis, the list of health disorders is growing in range of recognition by research and magnitude of documented damage,"" said Dr K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India./Among the lesser known extrapulmonary diseases of air pollution contributes to and exacerbated are:/Diabetes/Air pollution damages a several biological pathways associated with glucose metabolism and leads diabetes. Long-term exposure to PM10 in India led to higher glycaemia and insulin resistance and exacerbated the progression and complications of diabetes, found the Wellcome Trust Genetic Study co-authored by researchers from four institutes in Pune. ""Atmospheric pollution, particularly PM2.5 and PM10, is directly related to inflammation, insulin resistance and diabetes, which has been shown in India and several countries. Of equal importance is increased progression to complications of diabetes, in particular, heart attacks in people with diabetes. It is the leading cause of death in people with diabetes,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis Centre of Excellence for diabetes, metabolic diseases and endocrinology./Exposure to PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from vehicular and power plant emissions raises diabetes prevalence and levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, which is a measure of glucose control over the past three months), according to International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. People with HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% have a higher chance of getting diabetes, 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes./Anaemia/Chronic exposure to pollution raised systemic inflammation and affect red blood cells production (erythropoiesis), leading to anaemia, reported a study in the journal, Environment International. Anaemia is defined as haemoglobin count of &#38;lt;13 g/dL for men and &#38;lt;12g/dL for women, and leads to chronic fatigue, lowers immunity, impairs movement and lowers brain function. The study found that air pollution exposures were associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of anaemia and a drop haemoglobin levels in older adults in the US, where chronic ambient air pollution levels are much lower than across India./Osteoporosis/Two independent studies have linked high PM2.5 level with the loss of bone mineral density and osteoporosis-related fractures in people 65 years old and above in the US. The first study found the risk of bone fracture hospital admissions was greater in areas with higher PM2.5 concentrations, particularly in low-income groups. The second study linked carbon concentration in the air with higher loss of bone-mineral density over time at multiple anatomical sites, including femoral neck (where the leg bone joins the hip joint) and ultradistal radius (bone in the forearm), which raises risk of hip and arm fractures./Chronic kidney disease/High PM2.5 concentrations leads to increased chronic kidney disease (CKD) and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney function decline (glomerular filtration rate or eGFR decline 30%), and kidney failure, according to a study in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. The risk of CKD and its progression was most pronounced at the highest levels of particulate matter concentrations, the study found./People living closer to a major road had lower eGFR than patients living farther away, found a study of living in the proximity to a busy road and kidney function in the Boston area in the US, reported a study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. People living within 50m of a major road had 3.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 lower eGFR than those living 1,000m away, which is comparable to what's people who are at least four years older in population-based studies. The constellation of findings suggests that chronic exposure to PM2.5 adds to risk of development and progression of kidney disease./Inflammation/Toxins in the air we breathe elevate levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation associated with inflammatory conditions such as cardiopulmonary disease and several autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and some inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, certain cancers like that of the lung and, possibly, colorectal, breast, and ovary./On high pollution days when PM inhalation is unavoidable, experts advise people over 65 years of age and those with existing diseases minimise exposure and use anti-inflammatory treatment./""Even in places where air pollution is comparatively low in India, it exceeds national and WHO norms during seasonal peaks, leading to cumulative exposure and sustained damage to the entire population. Action must be local but policies must address the concerns of the entire population to ensure everyone gets to breathe clean air,"" said Dr Reddy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"No respite, air pollution continues its choking grip on Delhi","India, Nov. 3 -- Despite a light drizzle, the air emergency continued in Delhi on Sunday morning, with the air quality index (AQI) reaching 473 at 9 am, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data./The air quality at most monitoring stations on Sunday morning was in the 'severe' category. At ITO the AQI levels were 488, while at Anand Vihar and RK Puram the levels were 483 and 457 respectively as the national capital continued to grapple with its annual nightmare./The brief improvement on Saturday, with the overall AQI of the city settled at 399, in the 'very poor' category, did not last long and after 9 pm on Saturday the pollution levels started rising again. On Friday, Delhi witnessed the worst air in two years with the AQI being recorded as 484, the worst since November 2017 when it was 486./""By 8.30 pm on Saturday the wind speed had dropped to around 6 kmph. As the wind speed dropped, pollutants again started accumulating,"" said a senior official of the India Meteorological department (IMD) explained./An increase in wind speed and sporadic rain in some parts of Delhi and the national capital region (NCR) had helped bring air pollution out of the ""emergency"" status on Saturday, but weather officials and meteorologists warned the crisis is not over yet./On Friday, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) had declared a health emergency and directed a slew of measures, including shutting down of schools and a complete ban on construction activities in Delhi and the neighbouring satellite towns until November 5./The situation is expected to remain grim as the period till November 15 is vulnerable to a surge in air pollution because smoke from farm fires in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana settles over NCR and adjoining regions./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

What we've learnt from another failure,"New Delhi, Nov. 3 -- The national capital region (NCR) and much of the Indo-Gangetic plains were shrouded in a toxic haze since last week, a rerun of an annual pollution crisis that is turning into a headache for policy makers and administrations./While the average annual air quality index readings have shown a slight decline since 2017 - it was 165 that year, 154 in 2018 and 135 in the months till now -the improvement appears to be largely due to weather conditions in summer months while winter pollution has shown little change./Experts say that this is significant because it suggests the hectic efforts that were put in place in response to the pollution crisis in 2016 have failed to make any impact and that improvements have mostly been due to meteorological factors that are outside of human control. Insights from efforts that did not work, and some that did, in the past couple of years can largely be distilled into the following action plans, experts and scientists told HT./IMPROVE GRAP/The graded response action plan (Grap), the sets of curbs that are meant to be automatically implemented when pollution levels cross certain thresholds, has not been effective due to a combination of factors. Experts have said the plan is not pre-emptive and some additional measures, such as beefing up public transport infrastructure, should have been taken to make it successful./""Grap of the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) has not had impact since the government failed to increase parking fees, augment public transport, increase metro frequency and put a check on vehicle registration,"" said Ritwick Dutta, a Delhi-based environment lawyer./A former official of the CPCB said one of the problems is a lack of focus in seasons when pollution is not an apparent problem. ""This is because work on combating air pollution starts just when there is a spike instead of working going on around the year,"" said this former scientist, who asked not to be named./CRACKERS MUST GO/This year's crisis in the capital began following Diwali on October 27, when people defied restrictions on how long and what kind of firecrackers they could burst, leading to an almost immediate build-up up of toxic air that lingered on for most of the week. By midnight on the night of Diwali, the concentration of PM2.5 pollutants - the most harmful of all aerosols -- shut up almost 16 times./""Our analysis showed that bursting of crackers Sunday night had spiralled the pollution curve to nearly the same severe levels that was observed during 2018 Diwali. This despite the fact that 2019 Diwali was warmer and windier. This temporarily undid the comparatively better air quality gains of this season due to favourable weather, on-going pollution control action, and preventive measures,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury from the Centre of Science and Environment./A day after Diwali, there was an increase in patients in hospitals with breathing ailments. ""We are increasingly seeing healthy people who have no previous history of chronic respiratory diseases coming in with asthma-like symptoms. Many now have to use steroids inhalers for up to four weeks,"" said Dr Karan Madan, associate professor of pulmonology at All India Institute Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered that only so-called green firecrackers - made without certain chemicals and emit 30% lower pollutants - should be used in Delhi-NCR, and can only be burst between 8pm and 10pm./According to Dutta and Roychoudhury, implementation of such curbs is difficult and the solution may lie only in a complete ban on sale of firecrackers in the NCR area for all of winter./COMPLETE STOP ON FARM FIRES/According to ministry of earth sciences' air pollution monitoring body system for air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), stubble burning contributes 8% to 50% to capital air pollution load between mid October and mid-November./Around 70-80 million tonnes of paddy straw is burnt every year in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh to clear fields for winter crop, according to an IIT, Kanpur 2016 study. ""Emissions from stubble burning can certainly impact air quality in Delhi and other cities in Gangetic plain,"" the study said./Despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asking Punjab and Haryana governments to prevent burning of stubble, data recorded by NASA website Thursday showed that number of fire incidents (mostly farm fires) till October 30, 2019, were higher than what was seen in 2018 and 2017. Over 52,352 incidents of fires were recorded as compared to 45,736 in 2018 and 52,136 in 2017 during the same period, as per information analysed by HT./Since 2017, authorities have attempted to coax and punish farmers into quitting the practice, but the efforts fall short of ground realities, where it is still financially more viable for them to continue burning crop residue and paying the 2,500 fine instead of on machinery that can prevent the need for it. Farmer unions have said government subsidies for the machinery have either been inadequate or have not reached farmers at all./MANAGING HOTSPOTS/The Environment Protection (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) has identified 13 pollution hot spots in Delhi-NCR. These are areas where air pollution levels are highest and contribute heavily to the overall pollution levels of the city./Hot spot management is consistent with global regulatory trends and is based on the principle that if cities are safe for the most vulnerable, it will be safe or all, Roychoudhury said, explaining that it was crucial to focus on people who were affected in hot spot areas. In Delhi, effective hot spot management will need collaborative effort between the government and the three municipal corporations. CSE estimates that hot spot management can lead to a 65% cut in local emissions, which contributes about 70% to Delhi's base air pollution./FIGHTING DUST/The 2016 IIT study that identified sources of pollution said road dust was a prominent contributor pollution. ""The top four contributors to PM10 emissions are road dust (56%), concrete batching (10%), industrial point sources (10%) and vehicles (9%); these are based on annual emissions...The top four contributors to PM2.5 emissions are road dust (38%), vehicles (20%), domestic fuel burning (12%) and industrial point sources (11%),"" it said./Fighting sources of dust alone can cut Delhi's pollution by a third, said Mukesh Sharma of IIT, Kanpur, who anchored the study./The CPCB and the NGT, through several orders in the last three years have focused on landscaping of all roads to reduce dust recirculation./In 2016, the CPCB issued comprehensive rules for dust management including construction and demolition sector to the state governments and asked them to put in place effective monitoring system in place in three years./A recent Epca report said the rules had no impact as developers continue to operate with disregard. Former CPCB member secretary AB Akolkar said the state governments have been slow in implementing the guidelines, which were voluntary in nature. ""Most pollution control boards don't have manpower to implement the rules and the municipal bodies enough funds to implement the regulations,"" he said./Dutta said Delhi and other state governments in the NCR need to provide specific funds for dust management. Roychoudhury added that Resident Welfare Associations should be made part of waste management and dust control measures for it to be effective./ACCOUNTABILITY/Senior Supreme Court lawyer, M C Mehta, in whose petition CNG was introduced in Delhi in 2000, said reducing air pollution in Delhi would be a difficult task unless authorities are held accountable for failing to implement directions of courts and pollution watchdogs./The Delhi government agreed to introduce environment friendly compressed natural gas for public transport only when the Supreme Court summoned chief secretary of Delhi and threatened to send him to jail for failing to implement its orders, Mehta said./""The SC had shown the path but there is no political will to follow that path,"" he added./""Leaders are blaming each other for Delhi's high air pollution as people suffer. Sadly, all gains from introduction of CNG have been lost and we are back to dark days of 1990s when Delhi used to fume with toxic air.""/Vijay Panjwani, who has been CPCB's counsel, said: ""There has been a lot of talk on how to control air pollution in recent years but very little real action has taken place. The reason is that real action will result in inconvenience to some people that political parties are not willing to risk. So, we need a law that stipulates time-bound implementation and punitive action against officials and persons for failing to implement the law,"" he said./(WITH INPUTS FROM VIJDAN MOHAMMAD KAWOOSA IN DELHI AND HTC, CHANDIGARH)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Amarinder writes to PM Modi, seeks Centre's intervention","Chandigarh, Nov. 3 -- Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing ""anguish"" at the emergency-level pollution in the national capital./Smoke from farm fires in Punjab is known to contribute to high pollution levels in Delhi and other parts of north India as farmers burn paddy stubble in preparation of sowing wheat./In the letter he accepts Punjab's role in the deterioration of air quality but included other governments, including the Centre, for the mess. ""Together, we have allowed this state of affairs to emerge and sustain, with our various acts of commission and ommission,"" Singh wrote./In his letter, he said that ""No Indian, and definitely no person in Punjab, is oblivious to the misery of our brethren in the national capital, whatever many around the country might have been led to believe.""/Pointing out that his own children and grandchildren living in Delhi, were currently sharing the plight of the lakhs of people in the national capital as a result of the toxic air enveloping the city, he said the prevailing situation ""has exposed the hollowness of our claims of being a progressive and developed nation."" ""How can a country be called developed when its capital city has been reduced to a gas chamber, not by any natural disaster but a series of man-made ones?"" Singh asked./Singh admitted that stubble fires, supported by winds, were contributing to the toxic levels of air pollution . He noted data from several independent agencies had pointed out that large-scale industrial pollution, the traffic overload, the excessive construction activity taking place in Delhi were equally, if not more, to blame. He said the crux of the problem was that we have persistently and foolishly refused to rise above political considerations to launch a collective search for a permanent solution./Singh wrote that Punjab had tried to enforce the law against stubble burning to the maximum extent possible, and was even penalising the farmers./""Even though it goes against my conscience to punish a community that continues to suffer at the hands of an ungrateful nation. But that does not really deter the farmers from resorting to the burning of the paddy straw to keep their pathetic margins from falling further,"" he said./Delhi and Haryana, too, were doing what they could, in their own ways, he pointed out but said the role of the Centre had remained dubious, even though it was the biggest stakeholder of national prosperity./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India vs Bangladesh:?Haze lifts just enough for first T20I to be held,"India, Nov. 3 -- All's well that ends well. The Delhi and District Association (DDCA) president Rajat Sharma could afford to smile as the first T20 international between India and Bangladesh neared the start after hours of speculation that it may have to be called off due to the heavy air pollution./About 90 minutes into the match, the spectators began flashing their mobile torches, giving an idea to what extent the stadium was filled, with most seats in the lower denomination ticket stands occupied./However, the picture had been pretty gloomy in every sense at 3.30 pm with talk of the match being called off on. The Air Quality Index (AQI) at the Dhyan Chand National Stadium, closest to Ferozeshah Kotla where AQI can be measured, reported levels of around 700 at that point. ""It all depends on the ICC match referee (Ranjan Madugalle),"" said a top DDCA official as a thick haze hung over the city, leaving people struggling to breathe and eyes watering./Some fans turned up to seek refund but that request couldn't be accommodated. The match, as is the norm, was insured so in case of abandonment without a ball being bowled, DDCA would have been compensated. But even one delivery bowled would have spoilt the fans' plans and may have made life tough for the officials. There was suggestion to deploy extra police personnel to counter any unruly fan behaviour, a top official said./Madugalle was slated to arrive at the stadium at 4.45pm and an official announcement on the match was expected at 6.15 pm, just before the toss. The hour before that, and 40-45 minutes after that leading up to the start of the game, was going to be crucial./As luck would have it, the wind picked up, and by 6.30 pm, the AQI levels at the National Stadium had dropped to 370, which is still ""very poor"" but not life threatening./""It has become clear now thanks to the rain in the morning. It had looked slightly worrying in the afternoon,"" said Rajat Sharma, before the match began./Fans then began to trickle in. Though some stands were empty when the first ball was bowled, the stands for lower denomination tickets began to fill before the powerplay overs were completed. DDCA officials had expected the fans to turn up. But what the pollution spoiled was revenues that would have come from the sale of high-end tickets./A top DDCA official said around 3.30 pm, ""We had a few people asking for refund but we could not give as it is not our policy. Most of our revenues suffered due to a lack of sales of high-end tickets. The low denomination tickets were mostly sold out. But the corporate boxes, marquee section and the bay area (all prime areas) were not. We suspect it was because of the pollution levels over the past few days. We expected about R3.5 crore in tickets sales but couldn't sell even R1.25 crore worth of tickets. It is the rich who kept away.""/The official confirmed that match day did not see the sale of a single ticket and that less than 50% of the tickets in the three prime sections were sold. The top-tier tickets in those sections were priced at R10,000 and R12,500. Many tickets in corporate boxes were given as complimentary. There are fewer than 3000 top-tier seats, but they are the ones that bring the chunk of the revenue from tickets./Delhi got the match at this time of the year when the Capital struggles due to pollution, because of BCCI's rotation policy. The reason, according to Board officials, is that December-January would be too foggy in Delhi and no India games are scheduled for February-March./The cricket officials would also have heaved a sigh of relief that no player showed signs of unease or breathlessness in the game, which Bangladesh won by seven wickets./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Wind picks up but air crisis is far from over,"India, Nov. 3 -- Winds picked up and sporadic rain in some parts of Delhi and the national capital region (NCR) helped bring air pollution out of the ""emergency"" status on Saturday, but weather officials and meteorologists warned the crisis may have only relented slightly and is not over yet./According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s 4pm bulletin, the average air quality for the preceding 24 hours had come down from 484 to 399. By evening, however, the AQI had started inching up and was at 411 by 11pm./""Even though we have come out of the emergency levels air quality is still very poor and just two notches below the severe zone. It is like coming out of an ICU but still being in the hospital. There is no room for any complacency and we should take utmost care to keep pollution levels under check,"" said D Saha, former head of the CPCB's air quality laboratory./Air quality is considered good when the AQI is below 50 and satisfactory as long as it is under 100. The concentration of PM2.5 pollutants - the most harmful of all aerosols - was at 293 ug/m3, nearly five times the level considered safe, around 11pm./Scientists at the India Meteorological Department said chances of another spike in pollution levels is low till at least November 10 since another western disturbance - a weather phenomenon that brings in rain -- is likely to arrive around November 6-7./The period till November 15 is vulnerable to pollution spikes since this is the time when farm fires in the neighbouring state of Punjab and Haryana peak and the resulting smoke settles over NCR and adjoining regions./""Even though this spike is dissipating and air quality is improving, we are still in the critical pollution period and there could be a rise anytime if the weather parameters like wind speed and wind direction become unfavourable for Delhi and there is any additional input such as from stubble burning,"" said Gurfan Beig, the head of Union environment ministry's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar)./According to farmers in Punjab, where the bulk of farm fires has taken place this year, only half of paddy harvesting has been completed till now. ""50% of paddy harvest is still left,"" said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union, Punjab./It is stubble left behind after the harvest that is often burnt by farmers as a quick and cheap way of clearing the field for the next round of sowing, which usually needs to be completed by November 15./The chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab wrote to the Union government over the air quality crisis on Saturday, separately urging the centre to step in./""German chancellor Angela Merkel is in Delhi for an official visit. I wonder what impression would she carry of India with such high levels of pollution. The images of international cricketers playing cricket wearing masks does not create a good image of India,"" Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal wrote in a letter to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar./Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wrote, ""we have persistently and foolishly refused to rise above political considerations to launch a collective search for a permanent solution""./On Saturday, the contribution to Delhi's pollution load (PM2.5 levels) from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana dropped from around 38% on Friday to around 17%.

Don't politicise pollution: Kejriwal,"New Delhi, Nov. 4 -- Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the issue of pollution should not be ""politicised"" even as he attributed Sunday's hazardous air quality to stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab./Addressing people via video on social media a day ahead of the odd-even road space rationing drive, Kejriwal urged all neighbouring states and the Centre to ""sit together"" and deliberate on how to prevent stubble burning./""What will we get by playing blame-game? We are just saying that the smoke in Delhi is due to stubble burning and we have to stop it collectively. Even scientists and environmental experts are now saying that stubble burning is the main cause of smoke in Delhi. We just wish that all the state governments and the central government come together to solve the matter,"" he said./Kejriwal further questioned the pace at which the Centre was distributing straw management systemsto farmers to stop stubble burning. ""Till now 63,000 machines have been made available to farmers in Punjab and Haryana. There are 27 lakh farmers in these states. How long would it take to distribute these machines to all these farmers? For how long do we have to bear this pollution?"" he asked./Straw management systems are to be fitted with harvesters. Once these are fixed, these machines cut paddy straw into small pieces and spread evenly across the field. As a result, farmers do not have to burn the straw as it is./Opposition slams govt/The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, however, alleged that there has been laxity on the part of the Kejriwal government in mitigating air pollution in the city./The Delhi Congress on Sunday organised a protest outside Kejriwal's residence against the soaring pollution levels in the city./Over 100 people, along with Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra, demanded to meet the CM. The protest turned violent after protesters pushed through barricades./The police detained Chopra and former MP JP Agarwal at the Civil Lines police station for nearly 45 minutes./""We demand answers from the Delhi CM. Instead of meeting us and discussing ways to implement a better plan for the pollution in Delhi, he left the police to stop us. We will continue to raise people's voice and the government will have to provide answers,"" Chopra said./BJP's Rajya Sabha MP and former union minster Vijay Goel said past experiences of the odd-even drive, the third edition of which begins from Monday, have not had favourable impact on the city's air./""Every environmental agency has stated that odd-even drive has not helped in improving Delhi's air. To protest against the drama put up by the Kejriwal government, tomorrow (Monday) I will take my car out on the city's street,"" said Goel./BJP MLA from Rohini Vijender Gupta criticised the government for not being able to add adequate number of buses ahead of the drive. ""Despite Kejriwal announcing the scheme way back in September, the government only managed to get over 830 private buses before rolling out the odd-even rule. It also missed its target of adding at least 300 cluster buses for the drive and instead inducted merely 125 buses,"" he said./The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) instead asked five questions to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on the Center's plan to curb the increasing number of stubble burning in the states of Punjab and Haryana./Senior AAP leader Atishi said, ""My first question is what the central government has done to curb stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. My second question to him is why the central government in the last five months has not called any multi-state meeting with all the environment minister of the NCR states on the issue of air pollution.""/The party also demanded to know the Centre's time-bound plan for next year to combat stubble burning./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Masks stop-gap solution for the pollution menace,"New Delhi, Nov. 4 -- Masks are complex, if you're using them to fight air pollution. As North India is haze-hit and it moves eastwards, many of us look out for masks. I won't talk about which mask-N95s are available for lower prices - but do they work for everyone?/Leading doctors have gone public about how masks must fit well, without air leakage, to be effective. That's hard, because all of us have differently contoured faces, so one cannot expect to find the perfect fit./Besides, correctly worn masks trap carbon-dioxide, so you feel suffocated. CO2 also impacts the brain. But if you let air into your mask then you've taken in pollution. It is almost impossible to fit on your mask well and exercise or work. Workers report that they cannot garden with a well-fitting mask, or be heard clearly, or move constantly./These challenges aside, masks prevent some pollution from entering your bloodstream - a positive outcome. Given how vulnerable young children and the elderly are, we must minimize their exposure. I believe even an imperfect N 95 mask is OK in such trying times./Having said all this, it's all not OK to turn to masks as a policy prescription-it hides the shortcomings and offers a false sense of security. For policy makers, for leaders, what we expect is to take on the big challenges, like public transport and construction. We don't need a semi-solution that we can muddle along with ourselves.

This Congress leader has a solution to tackle Delhi's air pollution,"India, Nov. 4 -- Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi has suggested a solution for Delhi's severely-affected air, which on Monday had air pollutants many folds higher than the permissible limit./Delhi was once again engulfed in a thick blanket of smoke and dust as pollution levels continued to hover close to ""emergency"" levels on Monday morning and there has been a marginal improvement since Sunday./The 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) value at 9:30am on Monday was 437, which was 494 around 4pm on Sunday. The average level of PM2.5 - the finer and more harmful of the particulates - was more than seven times the safe levels on Monday morning. It had shot up to nine times on Sunday./The opposition party's senior spokesperson tweeted that India could have multiple capitals and just like other countries across the world./""This entire choking of Delhi makes me see what is happening around the world. Indonesia is shifting it's capital. Australia has Canberra for smooth admin functioning only. Why not have two to four capitals in India? (sic),"" he asked./Indonesia is in the process of shifting its administrative capital from Jakarta to an area near Borneo, as the capital faces the risk of sinking, with two-fifths of the landmass already underwater./In a second tweet, Singhvi said that Delhi is already under severe strain for land and resources./""separate capitals cos Delhi is already very strained for land &#38; resources. Suggesting Mumbai &#38; Calcutta is no good. Amravati &#38; Ranchi is a good idea. Parliament &#38; SC can have alternate sessions. MPs don't need permanent houses, 1 is enough (sic),"" he said./Singhvi said while speaking to HT that Amravati and Ranchi are just examples./""Any city that is on the lines of these cities, which are virgin territories and have large tracts of land,"" said Singhvi./While several Twitter users questioned the Congress leader after his multiple-capitals suggestion, some even called the idea ""precious.""/""So that MPs can get 4 houses across the country on taxpayer money. Why not?"" a user asked./""So our honourable MPs will escape the pollution. That's wonderful. But what about the rest of us? (sic)"" another user said./""Is that the solution?? Shifting capital?? Let common people die of smog n politicians can conveniently shift their base!!"" Tweeted another./However, some called for Singhvi's idea to be put to use./""Agree, Indian capital should be split into 4, with telecommunication infrastructure, it is not required to be colocated (sic),"" said one user./""The idea of four capitals is good.

"Delhi's homeless at highest risk, but are least equipped","New Delhi, Nov. 4 -- ""I am feeling a strange burning sensation in my eyes,"" says 40-year-old Dhanno, bent over a smoke-filled stove, cooking dinner for her five children and husband who live with her in a small slum cluster, surrounded by garbage on one side and a busy parking lot for buses on the other, opposite the Kashmere Gate Metro station. Asked if she would want to visit a doctor for her eyes, she smiles and says ""this is no major issue. It will be fine soon.""/While the government has declared a health emergency after air pollution across Delhi reached alarming levels - the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi escalated to 494 on Sunday, the worst level of pollution since November 2016 - a large number of the city's residents worriedly resorted to anti-pollution masks for the outdoors and air purifiers for their homes./The poor and homeless, however, are uncertain how to react./Sarika,35, who lives with her husband and two children in a slum next to the Kashmere Gate Metro says ""my six-year old son has been coughing for the last one week."" Speaking about whether she intends to buy a mask for him she says, ""I do not know anything about masks.""/Experts say those living closest to the streets are at the highest risk of suffering from health problems. ""It has been established that people close to the main roads are at the highest risk since they have maximum exposure to pollutants,"" said Dr Jugal Kishore, director, head of department, community medicine, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital./""The best solution for those on streets would be to relocate them to less polluted areas, away from traffic junctions,"" said TK Joshi, environmental health advisor to the central government./But Dhanno says concerns over the ill-effects of pollution are reserved mainly for the rich. ""Those who live inside air-conditioned homes are bound to feel uncomfortable in this weather. My children have grown up playing in mud and dirt. This is normal for us,"" she says./Fifty-year old Suresh who has been living in a tent at Kashmere Gate for the past 25 years, says that ""it is impossible for us to calculate when the pollution is high or low. If we start wearing masks now, we will become an object of ridicule among our people.""/There are several on the streets though, who feel no difference in the air. Twenty-five year old Seema who is busy putting her six-month-old son to sleep on the pavement next to AIIMS is perplexed when asked about pollution. ""My child feels very cold in the night.

Odd-even scheme begins as Delhi battles toxic pollution: 5 points,"India, Nov. 4 -- The odd-even road rationing scheme came into force in Delhi from 8 am on Monday as the national capital continued to be engulfed by a dense, toxic smoke./Only private cars having registration numbers ending with 0,2,4,6,8 are allowed to ply on Delhi roads on Monday between 8 am to 8 pm. Odd-numbered private cars will ply on odd dates./The third edition of the odd-even scheme will be carried out from November 4 to 15 barring Sunday. The road rationing scheme was introduced in 2016 in an effort to control vehicular pollution in the capital. As per various studies, vehicular emissions contribute anywhere between 20 and 30% to Delhi's air pollution./According to government estimates, 1.2 million of over 11 million registered vehicles in Delhi will be off road every day during the 12-day drive./Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted urging people to follow the odd-even scheme and make it successful./Five things to know about odd-even scheme:/Who will be a part of odd-even?/All private petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid cars, including those entering the city from other states, are required to be a part of the drive. Only CNG-fuelled commercial vehicles such as auto-rickshaws, taxis, trucks, buses, tempos and gramin sewas will be allowed to ply during the 12-day arrangement. The scheme will also cover ministers and officers of Delhi government, including the chief minister and other cabinet members./Exemptions and exceptions/Two-wheelers, commercial vehicles, cars driven by women or carrying only women passengers, specially-abled people or school children will be exempted from the drive. Parents returning after dropping their children to school or going to pick them and vehicles carrying patients will be allowed on ""trust"" basis. On the directions of the Prime Minister's Office, private electric vehicles will also be exempted from the drive./Fines for violations/The fines have been doubled this time and violators will have to pay Rs 4,000. However, a person will be fined only once a day by the enforcing agencies, which include traffic police, SDMs, tehsildars, transport department and assistant traffic inspectors./Challenge for public transport/The fleet of Delhi's state-run buses has been increased to 5,658. Till 7pm on Sunday, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) managed to get over 837 private CNG buses against its target of 2,000 and the transport department received another 100 cluster buses, in addition to the 129 buses added last week./The Delhi Metro would be conducting 61 additional trips every day, increasing the total daily trips to 5,100 trips through 294 trains. While the government has asked 95,000 registered auto-rickshaws not to overcharge or deny rides, cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber said there would be no surge pricing during the 12-day drive./Enforcement agencies/Government has engaged 5,000 civil defence volunteers who were given a day-long training on Sunday. These volunteers will be deployed with placards at major traffic intersections and Delhi's borders to inform motorists about the scheme. There will also be at least 20 teams of photographers and videographers to keep documentary evidence of violators./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurugram fights pollution without data or plan,"Gurugram, Nov. 4 -- Since 2012, Gurugram, a city of at least 25 lakh people-declared the most-polluted in the world a Greenpeace report in 2018-has been dependent on just one government-owned air quality monitor for monitoring overall air pollution./The Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) criteria require cities with a population of 10 lakh or more to have a minimum of three monitoring stations. As per this criterion, Gurugram should have at least nine monitoring stations. But, all plans by the CPCB to install a citywide network of air quality monitoring devices have mostly remained on paper. The most recent in such plans was the one announced by officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in October when they said that at least two new monitors would be installed before the year ends./Lack of adequate number of monitors in Gurugram ensures the available official air quality index (AQI) is neither accurate nor does it provide a real-time picture of the city's overall air quality. Experts said this has resulted in insufficient ground-level implementation of pollution-control measures./ONE MONITOR NOT ENOUGH FOR WHOLE CITY/The only air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11 measures pollution levels in the area within a 5km radius, which includes Rajiv Chowk, Civil Lines and Sectors 44 to 48. However, the air quality index for this area is highly unlikely to be representative for all of Gurugram which is spread across 738 square kilometre, experts said. For instance, this figure can't possibly denote a realistic level of air pollution levels in the outskirts of the city, where the population is now increasing and thus, construction is also higher. Therefore, detailed, area-wise air quality indices need to be ascertained, experts said, adding that authorities need to determine hotspots and constantly monitor air quality at these places./Additionally, it has often been alleged that the Vikas Sadan monitor malfunctions frequently and thus provides inaccurate AQI data./Recently, on the day after Diwali, the CPCB's AQI bulletin, which lists pollution data from all monitoring stations in the country, showed that Gurugram had an AQI of 372 (very poor), which was the same as the level of PM2.5 on that day. But data later ratified by the HSPCB, after taking into account all pollutants, put the AQI at 299./""Either data from the air quality monitor is wrong or the way the AQI is being calculated is wrong. It is done automatically and might need some correction,"" HSPCB senior scientist Rajesh Garhia had then said. However, Garhia retracted his comment on October 31 and said all data was accurate./Experts said these glitches happen because of improper maintenance./GLITCHES BEHIND LOWER AQI?/If one goes by CPCB's AQI data for Gurugram, citizens breathed much cleaner air in October this year as compared to the same period in 2018. On most days of October-the month that sees the national capital region's first spell of severe air pollution-the AQI in Gurugram was the lowest in the region. But, privately-owned air quality monitors installed across several spots in the city showed much higher AQI readings on days when the CPCB monitor recorded low AQI./On and after October 10, when AQI was 'very poor' in other NCR cities, including Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida, Gurugram's AQI was still in the 'moderate' and the lower end of the 'poor' category, showed CPCB's AQI bulletin./This year, city's AQI crossed the 200-mark on 14 days, while last year it had crossed the 200-mark at least 24 times, even touching the 'severe' category, i.e., beyond 400 (when air pollution affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with respiratory diseases) twice. As per CPCB data this year, October ended with no 'severe' AQI days./Air quality experts said that irrespective of what the CPCB data suggests, there's not much to rejoice about. While all of NCR recorded a much lower AQI this pollution season than last due to meteorological factors, experts said there can't be a huge difference between neighbouring cities where geographical factors were more or less similar./""Meteorological factors, such as wind speed, temperature across the region, were largely similar in October. A large difference in the AQI of other NCR cities and Gurugram is highly improbable and can't exceed 20-30 points,"" city-based air quality expert Sachin Panwar said, adding that experts and residents, who regularly monitor air quality in the city, have been flagging the faulty readings from the Vikas Sadan monitor for a long time./Panwar said he suspects particulate matter (PM) analysers of the Vikas Sadan monitor are not caliberated and thus, report faulty data. Experts added that sensors of air quality monitors need regular maintenance and should ideally be caliberated every six months./HSPCB's Garhia, however, said the instrument is caliberated every six months and is being maintained as per requirements./Several studies have found that errors in PM monitoring primarily due to incorrect caliberation./HOW IS AQI MEASURED/How bad or good is the quality of air we breathe can be understood by monitoring data and interpreting it vis-a-vis the air quality standards. The Vikas Sadan monitor is an automatic, continuous ambient air quality monitoring station (CAAQMS) that monitors pollutants through different analysers generating data every minute and disseminating them digitally. The CAAQM stations collect the data of eight pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, lead, carbon monoxide and ammonia), except metals, such as benzene, arsenic and nickel and BaP./""The eight pollutants are measured on a daily basis and are compared against the national air quality standards. But the method of measurement for each pollutant may vary,"" Dipankar Saha, scientist at the CPCB lab, said./Another possible explanation as to why privately owned air quality monitors in the city show a higher reading could be that they don't have an adjustment for humidity, Panwar said. ""Water droplets are particles that can show in the AQI readings, especially on private monitors as they don't have a correction for humidity. So if the humidity is high, the AQI tends to be on the higher side,"" he said./However, the level of humidity in the last week of October was around 50%./Namita Gupta, founder of Airveda which has low-cost monitors across the city, said she, too, has reasons to doubt the AQI data from the Vikas Sadan monitor for being too low on days when other monitors record high level of pollution. ""The difference between the CPCB monitor and the private laser monitors should be in a range of 10%. But the difference has been much higher,"" she said./GOOD DATA DRIVES STRONG ACTION/Accurate, historical air quality data of a city is important for policy changes. Steps to combat air pollution fall short if such data is lacking or missing, experts said, adding that another reason why ambient air quality should be monitored is to create public awareness around environmental conditions. Without such data, targets to reduce pollution, area-wise milestones and compliance measures can't be met, said members of the Environment Pollution (Prevention &#38; Control) Authority (Epca)./In meetings of the CPCB task force, the performance of Gurugram has been found to be sub optimal in implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) that comes into force every winter to mitigate pollution./According to a January report by Greenpeace, titled Airpocalypse III, several cities in India which had dangerous levels of particulate matter pollution were left out from the purview of the NCAP; no city in Haryana was is named in the list./Additionally, Epca member and IIT Delhi scientist Mukesh Khare pointed out that Gurugram doesn't feature in the CPCB's list of 102 non-attainment cities that have consistently showed air quality poorer than the national ambient air quality standards. The list includes Delhi, Varanasi, Bhopal, Kolkata, Noida, Muzaffarpur and even Mumbai. Environmentalists have criticised the board for leaving out cities that were equally polluted, if not more./""If Gurugram were in the list, officials would have been forced to take appropriate action to monitor and curb pollution. Without a specific action plan, steps remain inadequate. Gurugram urgently needs more air quality monitors and that locations where the existing monitors are installed also seem erroneous,"" Khare said./While authorities in Gurugram said anti-pollution measures are taken under Grap every winter, as per the Epca's order, they failed to list policy changes around the issue that have been taken or will be taken./""Interventions under Grap have are being taken. Departments have been actively tracking and penalising violators to enforce the rules,"" Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, adding that long-term policy changes were under the purview of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), and referred to the pollution action plan prepared for Gurugram by the HSPCB earlier this year./GMDA officials did not respond to repeated requests for a comment./SOLUTIONS/Dipankar Saha, former head of the CPCB's air quality lab, offered a broad solution to the problem of air quality monitoring. ""We need a combination of automatic and manual systems to track air quality,""?he said. Automatic systems, like the one at Vikas Sadan, provide real-time data. ""These need to be supplemented with enough manual testing, which involves collecting air samples and testing them in a lab,"" Saha said./Unlike automated systems, which are only quantitative, manual testing is necessary to ascertain the exact nature of airborne pollutants. ""It will not only tell you how much PM2.5 you are breathing, but also tell you how toxic the PM2.5 really is,"" Saha explained. Manual testing is especially important in winter months, when secondary aerosols in the air create smog./As an interim measure, air quality experts suggested a second monitor be installed at the same spot in Vikas Sadan to check the accuracy of the existing monitor, and that the CPCB start providing certification to private monitors.?/""It will lend credibility to our data and make those, who own private monitors, more accountable,"" air quality expert Gupta said./Other cities have taken significant steps in monitoring and generating air quality data and making it available to the public, experts said, quoting Kolkata as an example where studies have been conducted to generate specialised data on unregulated pollutants such as air toxins. Delhi, too, has a robust system of air quality monitors, both private and government-owned, and has technology that provides advance daily forecast of the expected level of air pollution./""Air quality in cities is typically and significantly influenced by outside sources,"" Khare said, adding that addressing the problem requires moving the conversation towards addressing pollution at a regional 'airshed' level./""Instead of having different action plans for each NCR city, the region should be defined as an airshed so that so policies apply in all towns leading to better pollution control,"" Khare suggested, adding that Beijing, which has defined an airshed to manage its pollution problem, is a model to look up to./An airshed is an area within which the air frequently is confined or channeled with all parts of the area, thus being subject to similar conditions of air quality./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Odd-even scheme begins in Delhi's battle with toxic pollution: 5 points,"India, Nov. 4 -- The odd-even road rationing scheme came into force in Delhi from 8 am on Monday as the national capital continued to be engulfed by a dense, toxic smoke./Only private cars having registration numbers ending with 0,2,4,6,8 are allowed to ply on Delhi roads on Monday between 8 am to 8 pm. Odd-numbered private cars will ply on odd dates./The third edition of the odd-even scheme will be carried out from November 4 to 15 barring Sunday. The road rationing scheme was introduced in 2016 in an effort to control vehicular pollution in the capital. As per various studies, vehicular emissions contribute anywhere between 20 and 30% to Delhi's air pollution./According to government estimates, 1.2 million of over 11 million registered vehicles in Delhi will be off road every day during the 12-day drive./Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted urging people to follow the odd-even scheme and make it successful./Five things to know about odd-even scheme:/Who will be a part of odd-even?/All private petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid cars, including those entering the city from other states, are required to be a part of the drive. Only CNG-fuelled commercial vehicles such as auto-rickshaws, taxis, trucks, buses, tempos and gramin sewas will be allowed to ply during the 12-day arrangement. The scheme will also cover ministers and officers of Delhi government, including the chief minister and other cabinet members./Exemptions and exceptions/Two-wheelers, commercial vehicles, cars driven by women or carrying only women passengers, specially-abled people or school children will be exempted from the drive. Parents returning after dropping their children to school or going to pick them and vehicles carrying patients will be allowed on ""trust"" basis. On the directions of the Prime Minister's Office, private electric vehicles will also be exempted from the drive./Fines for violations/The fines have been doubled this time and violators will have to pay Rs 4,000. However, a person will be fined only once a day by the enforcing agencies, which include traffic police, SDMs, tehsildars, transport department and assistant traffic inspectors./Challenge for public transport/The fleet of Delhi's state-run buses has been increased to 5,658. Till 7pm on Sunday, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) managed to get over 837 private CNG buses against its target of 2,000 and the transport department received another 100 cluster buses, in addition to the 129 buses added last week./The Delhi Metro would be conducting 61 additional trips every day, increasing the total daily trips to 5,100 trips through 294 trains. While the government has asked 95,000 registered auto-rickshaws not to overcharge or deny rides, cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber said there would be no surge pricing during the 12-day drive./Enforcement agencies/Government has engaged 5,000 civil defence volunteers who were given a day-long training on Sunday. These volunteers will be deployed with placards at major traffic intersections and Delhi's borders to inform motorists about the scheme. There will also be at least 20 teams of photographers and videographers to keep documentary evidence of violators./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Odd-even in place in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal carpools to office","India, Nov. 4 -- Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal carpooled with his cabinet ministers to work on Monday as the 11-day odd-even scheme or road rationing began in Delhi on Monday as part of efforts to check the rising air pollution that reached its worst levels since 2016 in the capital on Sunday./Delhi government officials said that Kejriwal and his colleagues, Gopal Rai and Satyendar Jain, left the chief minister's residence on Flagstaff Road in Civil Lines around 10:30 am for the state secretariat. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot carpooled with his officer on special duty while deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia cycled to work./Delhi ministers and officers are required to follow the rules of the scheme even as vehicles of the president, vice-president, prime minister, governors, chief justice of India, Lok Sabha speaker, Union ministers are exempt from the road rationing drive./""We are fully prepared. Till now, we have registered around 850 [new] buses. We hope we will register around 2,000 buses in the next two days. Action will be taken against cab aggregators if they implement surge pricing,"" Gahlot said, referring to the pricing strategy wherein cab aggregators set flexible fares based on prevailing market demands./Kejriwal on Sunday urged people to follow road rationing measures. ""I urge people to use carpooling when they are not able to drive their car during this scheme. I will also be following the scheme strictly,"" he said./The Delhi government on Friday declared a public health emergency and closed schools and all construction activities to deal with the pollution./Under the third road rationing measures in Delhi since 2016, private cars with odd-numbered registration plates will be allowed to run on odd dates from 8 am to 8 pm, barring Sundays. Those with even-numbered plates will ply on even dates. The drive exempts two-wheelers and cars driven by women or carrying only women, schoolchildren and electric vehicles. All private petrol, diesel, and CNG cars in Delhi and the ones entering the city with registration numbers of other states will have to follow the rules. Any violation of the scheme will lead to a fine of Rs 4,000./The road rationing drive will continue until November 15, the period that is vulnerable to pollution spikes since this is the time when farm fires in Punjab and Haryana peak. The resulting smoke settles over the National Capital Region and adjoining regions. Farmers often burn stubble left behind after the harvest as a quick and cheap way of clearing their fields for the next round of sowing./According to the Union environment ministry's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, satellites captured over 3,000 incidents of farm fires last week in Punjab and Haryana. They contributed to 46% of Delhi's pollution on Friday last, the season's highest./Delhi has been in the grips of a bad air crisis since Diwali. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's 4 pm bulletin on Sunday, the average air quality index (AQI)?for the preceding 24 hours sharply rose from 399 to 494. This was the worst level recorded since November 6, 2016, when it was 497./Farm fires and emissions from firecrackers result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 ultrafine particles in the air, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs./Air quality is considered good when the AQI is below 50 and satisfactory under 100. The concentration of PM2.5 pollutants - one of the most harmful aerosols - peaked at 992 Microgram/m3 in the Alipur monitoring station, over 16 times the level considered safe on Sunday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Smog doesn't lift but Delhi plays host nonetheless,"New Delhi, Nov. 4 -- The Delhi and District Association (DDCA) president Rajat Sharma could afford to smile as the first T20 international between India and Bangladesh neared the start after hours of speculation that it may have to be called off due to the heavy air pollution. About 90 minutes into the match, the spectators began flashing their mobile torches, giving an idea to what extent the stadium was filled, with most seats in the lower denomination ticket stands occupied./However, the picture had been pretty gloomy in every sense at 3.30 pm with talk of the match being called off. The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was 494, the second highest figures ever. ""It all depends on the ICC match referee (Ranjan Madugalle),"" said a top DDCA official as a thick haze hung over the city, leaving people struggling to breathe and eyes watering./Some fans turned up to seek a refund but that request couldn't be accommodated. The match, as is the norm, was insured so in case of abandonment without a ball being bowled, DDCA would have been compensated. But even one delivery bowled would have spoilt the fans' plans and may have made life tough for the officials. There was suggestion to deploy extra police to counter any unruly fan behaviour, a top official said./Madugalle was slated to arrive at the stadium at 4.45pm and an official announcement on the match was expected at 6.15 pm, just before the toss. The hour before that, and 40-45 minutes after that leading up to the start of the game, was going to be crucial./As luck would have it, the wind picked up by 6.30 pm, when the toss happened./""It has become clear now thanks to the rain in the morning. It had looked slightly worrying in the afternoon,"" said Rajat Sharma, before the match began./Fans then began to trickle in. Though some stands were empty when the first ball was bowled, the stands for lower denomination tickets began to fill before the powerplay overs were completed. DDCA officials had expected the fans to turn up. But what the pollution spoiled was revenues that would have come from the sale of high-end tickets./revenue hit/A top DDCA official said around 3.30 pm, ""We had a few people asking for refund but we could not give as it is not our policy./""Most of our revenues suffered due to a lack of sales of high-end tickets. The low denomination tickets were mostly sold out. But the corporate boxes, marquee section and the bay area (all prime areas) were not. We suspect it was because of the pollution levels over the past few days. We expected about ~3.5 crore in tickets sales but couldn't sell even ~1.25 crore worth of tickets... It is the rich who kept away.""/The official confirmed that match day did not see the sale of a single ticket and that less than 50% of the tickets in the three prime sections were sold. The top-tier tickets in those sections were priced at ~10,000 and ~12,500./Many tickets in corporate boxes were given as complimentary. There are fewer than 3000 top-tier seats, but they are the ones that bring the chunk of the revenue from tickets./Delhi got the match at this time of the year when the Capital struggles due to pollution, because of BCCI's rotation policy. The reason, according to Board officials, is that December-January would be too foggy in Delhi and no India games are scheduled for February-March./The cricket officials would also have heaved a sigh of relief that no player showed signs of unease or breathlessness in the game, which Bangladesh won by seven wickets./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Moving smoke clouds raise alarm,"New Delhi, Nov. 5 -- Satellite maps showing a plume of smoke filled with PM10 and PM2.5 particulate matter travelling from northwest India past the Indo-Gangetic plains into the Bay of Bengal, and then moving southwards towards Chennai, grabbed the attention of researchers and scientists on Monday./Some experts said the deadly smog in Delhi on Sunday may be linked to the moving smoke clouds, while experts at India Meteorological Department contended the particulate matter near Chennai may be from a different source altogether./Irrespective of whether it is the same source or not, they agreed that local pollution can accumulate and travel great distances depending on meteorological conditions, in this case to the Bay of Bengal and beyond./""Our Copernicus model is also showing the plume travelling. Maybe its blowing across because the winds are strong and carrying local pollution with it. But the smoke near Chennai could be from a different source. It could be sea salt particles. We are assessing this,"" said M Rajeevan Nair, secretary, ministry of earth sciences./The Earth Null School map, which isolates PM 2.5 and PM10, along with wind data, shows the plume travelling./""This map just shows wind vectors and pollution movements... we have the same at a higher resolution online,"" said Sarath Guttikunda, scientist and founder director of urbanemissions.info./Forecast maps for November 5, 6 and 7 also show the particulate matter levels increasing in certain parts in southern India, including Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The air quality index in Chennai was in the moderate category on November 3, with an AQI of 107. It went up to the ""poor"" at 262 on Monday./""I don't think the stubble fires would have travelled so far. It could be that local pollution is blowing with the wind and sea particles are also accumulating. Moreover, winds are northeasterly in Chennai. It's impossible that the pollution from here travelled up to Chennai,"" said an India Meteorological Department official, asking not to be named./He added that wind speed has been good over Delhi at around 15 to 20 kmph since Sunday night, and direction continues to be northwesterly./Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, a remote sensing analyst at World Resources Institute tweeted: ""Not just Delhi, most of India is hit by air pollution crisis.

Under the scheme, private vehicles with odd-numbered registration plates are allowed to run on odd dates, while those with even numbers are permitted on even dates. Studies conducted in the past have raised concerns about effectiveness of the move as many vehicles, including two-wheelers, are exempted./The SC asked the Delhi government within hours of the scheme's launch as to why the authorities stopped plying cars that are less polluting compared to two- and three-wheelers, and cabs./Stopping all construction and demolition activities as well as garbage and waste burning till further orders, the SC directed neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh to prevent stubble burning./The court's remarks came on a day farm fires saw a sharp spike in Punjab. As the cloud cover that militated against an effective mapping of stubbing burning cases in the region cleared, Punjab on Monday reported highest number of farm fires this season - 5,953 in a single day, according to data from the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU). Before Monday, the highest number of stubble burning incidents was 3,135./Experts have said that the detection of farm fires with the help of satellites could be erroneous as clouds were obscuring the fire incidents. ""Satellite fire detection capability is strongly doubtful under dense cloud cover which is prevailing. The unusually low fire counts detected on 2nd November (57) may be partly due to this,"" said a statement issued by Safar on Monday./The period till November 15 is vulnerable to pollution spikes since this is the time when farm fires in Punjab and Haryana peak, and the resulting smoke settles over NCR and adjoining regions. Stubble left behind after the harvest is often burnt by farmers as a quick and cheap way of clearing the field for the next round of sowing./Farm fires and emissions from firecrackers result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 ultrafine particles in the air, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs./The Delhi government declared a public health emergency on Friday and closed schools and all construction activity./Pollution levels in Ghaziabad (440), Noida (430) and Greater Noida (428) remained at alarming levels. Gurugram and Faridabad's AQI stood at 370 and 403 respectively, as per the 4pm bulletin./Principal secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PK Mishra, reviewed the measures taken by the states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to tackle the air pollution. He sought to know the details of additional measures taken to check fresh cases of fire and stubble burning in these states during the last 24 hours./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Spike in air pollution levels in southern, eastern India","India, Nov. 7 -- There was a spike in air pollution levels in eastern and southern India on Thursday with the Air Quality Index (AQI) in some parts of Chennai touching 300 over the past 24 hours. Officials said that this was primarily because winds were carrying pollutants from the northern plains towards the Bay of Bengal and local poor dispersal of pollutants./A Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) official, who did not want to be named, said that north-westerly winds have blown the smoke created because of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana from the northern plains because of a developing cyclonic depression over the Bay of Bengal./Pollution spikes are common in the first half of November in northern India as farm fires peak in Punjab and Haryana during this time and the resulting smoke settles over the region. Farmers often burn stubble left behind after harvest as a quick and cheap way of clearing their fields for the next round of sowing./The air quality in Delhi was reduced to its worst level since 2016 on Sunday as the AQI sharply rose to a severe level of 494. Severe air pollution can worsen existing respiratory illnesses and also affect even healthy people./The CPCB's real-time monitor showed the AQI crossing the 300-mark in some parts of Chennai. The average AQI of Chennai was 272, almost double the level on November 2. Odisha's Talcher recorded the highest AQI in the country--413./The air quality is considered good when the AQI is below 50 and satisfactory when it is under 100./The AQI in Andhra Pradesh's Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada rose to 224 and 204-from 252 and 197 last Saturday. The AQI in Kolkata was 215 while it was 317 a day earlier. The pollution levels dipped in Bangalore with the AQI being 156 compared to 165 on Wednesday because of the local weather conditions./An India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said that the cyclonic storm, which is expected to make landfall on Friday, is preventing pollutants from dispersing over the Bay of Bengal as it is moving towards the eastern coast./""In fact, strong inward winds from. [the Bay of Bengal] have pushed the winds carrying the smoke towards south from eastern India.,"" an IMD scientist said./The CPCB scientist quoted above said that the pollution levels in southern and eastern cities have also increased because of the local factors like emissions from vehicles but the spike was because of the winds carrying the particulate matter./Air Visual Earth, which tracks the wind movement of particulate matter pollutants, showed that the spike in southern cities was because of winds carrying pollutants from the northern plains./The CPCB?scientist cited above added that the situation is likely to improve in a day or two because of change in wind direction. The impact of the depression in the Bay of Bengal will also end with heavy rains, which is also expected to bring some respite./Officials said that unlike in the northern Indian plains, the air pollution monitoring in eastern and southern India, considered to be comparatively cleaner, is less common. For instance, Kolkata has only seven monitoring stations, Chennai four and Visakhapatnam one. Delhi has 38 pollution monitoring stations./Environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman said that Chennai's air pollution has worsened due to growing vehicles, three harbours, thermal power plants and oil refineries. ""The wind blowing from...[north India] is also causing pollution in Chennai...,"" he said./Environmentalist E A S Sarma said that the CPCB declared Visakhapatnam ""critically polluted"" and imposed a moratorium on new industrial projects in 2014. ""The moratorium was lifted under pressure from politicians [in 2017],"" he said./Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, a remote sensing analyst with the World Resources Institute, too, blamed the farm fires' smoke for the rise in pollution levels in eastern and southern India. ""The Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System [used to calculate concentrations of pollutants] shows that the plumes of the smoke have reached southern India,"" said ./The rising pollution prompted Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday to order the phasing out of diesel and old petrol autos. He also ordered a revamp of the public transport system as the AQI in Patna rose to 414 on Wednesday. The AQI?came down to 347 on Thursday, which still comes under the ""very poor"" category./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Smog in north spikes air pollution in southern cities,"India, Nov. 7 -- Air pollution levels in cities of east and south India rose on Thursday morning, with Air Quality Index in many places close to 300, primarily because winds carrying pollutants from the northern plains are moving towards the Bay of Bengal./This means that smoke due to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has now reached as far as Chennai./A Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) official, who didn't want to be named, said north westerly winds blew the plume of smoke away from the northern plains because of the developing cyclonic depression in the Bay of Bengal./Although the AQI at Chennai was 257 on Thursday morning, CPCB's real time monitor showed the pollution levels crossing 300 in some locations in the capital city of Tamil Nadu./Similar phenomenon was clearly visible in other cities on the eastern coast. Visakhapatnam saw AQI of 274, Vijayawada's AQI was 204 and Kolkata 262. As one moved inwards, the pollution levels also dipped with Bangalore's AQI being 157./An official of India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal, which was moving towards the eastern coast and is expected to make a landfall on Friday, is preventing pollutants from dispersing over the Bay of Bengal./""In fact strong inward winds from the ocean have pushed the wind towards south from eastern India, which is the plume from the north,"" an IMD scientist said, refusing to say whether it carried pollutants or not./The CPCB scientist quoted above said the pollution levels in these southern and eastern cities have increased because of the in-house air pollution and the winds carrying particulate matter./The scientist, however, expected that the spike will get over in a day or two as winds will bring cleaner air and impact of the depression in the Bay of Bengal will also end with heavy rains, expected to bring some respite./Unlike plains of northern India, air pollution monitoring in eastern and southern India, considered to be comparatively cleaner, is less stringent. For instance, Kolkata has only three monitoring stations, Chennai four and Visakhapatnam one./The flow of pollutants and wind speed by airvisual.com clearly showed that the north-westerly winds are moving particulate matter pollutants towards east and then to southern India along the coast./Experts said that rise in pollution level in eastern and southern Indian cities was because of the plume. ""Dispersion model shows that the plume as reached southern India,"" said Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, a remote sensing analyst with the World Resources Institute./On Wednesday, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had ordered phasing out of diesel and old petrol autos and revamping of the public transport system as the air pollution levels in Patna crossed over 700 in the real-time. The AQI was, however, 414 on Wednesday and came down to 347 on Thursday, still in ""very poor"" category./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurugram: IMD?forecasts cleaner air till Nov 10 as wind gathers speed,"Gurugram, Nov. 7 -- After days of gasping for clean air, the city recorded a 'moderate' air quality of index(AQI) of 168 on Wednesday./According to data by Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality is not in the 'very poor' or 'severe' category for the first time since Diwali. Forecast by the India Meteorological Department(IMD) predicts that the wind speed will pick up further on Thursday creating conditions for better air quality at least till the weekend./"" We are observing an improvement in the air quality after weeks,"" Rajesh Garhia, senior scientist, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said referring to the real-time data collected from the Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Station at Vikas Sadan, Rajiv Chowk. ""The average PM 2.5 concentration has also reduced to 167 ug/m3, which is a good sign,"" said Garhia. The PM2.5 concentration varied from 242 to 86 ug/m3 throughout the day. ""We are noticing an increase in the wind speed during the daytime which is not allowing the PM2.5 particles and other gases to settle. It has dispersed the thick haze. Still, there are various gases in the upper atmosphere,"" he added./The air quality index had immediately dropped to 'very poor' after Diwali and later deteriorated to emergency levels, with a thick layer of pollutants engulfing the city. The ?Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Committee (Epca) had declared a public health emergency in the national capital region(NCR) on November 2. Various private hospitals had also reported a 25% increase in the number of patients with sickness related to air pollution during this period./According to the forecast by the IMD, the improvement in the air quality,because of increase in wind speed, will continue till November 10. On Wednesday, the maximum wind speed recorded was 10 km/h which is likely to increase to 20 km/h on Thursday. The forecast also predicts light rainfall on Thursday which is likely to bring further down the level of PM10 and PM2.5./Sachin Pawar, an independent air quality expert, attributed increase in day temperature and better humidity for 'moderate' air quality, ""Bright sunny days, leading to increase in day temperature is not allowing the pollutants to settle. We are also seeing a cumulative effect of rainfall in the past and an increase in wind velocity,"" Pawar said./Experts say a series of initiatives taken in the last few days to curb dust and carbon emission dust are also showing their impact. ""PM10 and PM2.5 levels have reduced. The situation will improve but as the temperature dips we'll experience a situation similar to last week. But the situation won't be as bad as before,"" Pawar said./3 Sarpanchs suspended/Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Meena placed three sarpanchs of Hisar under suspension for failing to check stubble burning in their respective villages./According to a government release, DC Meena suspended the sarpanchs of Bithmada, Chamarkhera and Ghirai villages as they allegedly failed to monitor and restrain farmers from burning the paddy straw./The release also claimed that so far 14 FIRs have been registered against farmers for stubble burning in the district./Meanwhile, Fatehabad DC Dhirendra Khadgata claimed the district saw 50% less stubble burning this year. Khadgata claimed that in 2018, 1,312 fire cases were reported around this time of the year, while this time, it has been reduced to 625./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Spike in air pollution levels in southern, eastern India","New Delhi, Nov. 8 -- There was a spike in air pollution levels in eastern and southern India on Thursday with the Air Quality Index (AQI) in some parts of Chennai touching 300 over the past 24 hours. Officials said that this was primarily because winds were carrying pollutants from the northern plains towards the Bay of Bengal and local poor dispersal of pollutants./A Central Pollution Control Board official, who did not want to be named, said that north-westerly winds have blown the smoke created because of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana from the northern plains because of a developing cyclonic depression over the Bay of Bengal./Pollution spikes are common in the first half of November in northern India as farm fires peak in Punjab and Haryana during this time and the resulting smoke settles over the region. Farmers often burn stubble left behind after harvest as a quick and cheap way of clearing their fields for the next round of sowing./The air quality in Delhi was reduced to its worst level since 2016 on Sunday as the AQI sharply rose to a severe level of 494, which can worsen existing respiratory illnesses and affect even healthy people./The CPCB's real-time monitor showed the AQI crossing the 300-mark in some parts of Chennai. The average AQI of Chennai was 272, almost double the level on November 2. Odisha's Talcher recorded the highest AQI in the country--413. The air quality is considered good when the AQI is below 50 and satisfactory when it is under 100./The AQI in Andhra Pradesh's Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada rose to 224 and 204-from 252 and 197 last Saturday. The AQI in Kolkata was 215 while it was 317 a day earlier. The pollution levels dipped in Bangalore with the AQI being 156 compared to 165 on Wednesday because of the local weather conditions./An India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said that the cyclonic storm, which is expected to make landfall on Friday, is preventing pollutants from dispersing over the Bay of Bengal as it is moving towards the eastern coast. ""In fact, strong inward winds from... [the Bay of Bengal] have pushed the winds carrying the smoke towards south from eastern India...,"" an IMD scientist said./The CPCB official quoted above said that the pollution levels in southern and eastern cities have also increased because of the local factors like emissions from vehicles but the spike was because of the winds carrying the particulate matter./The CPCB official cited above said the impact of the depression in the Bay of Bengal will also end with heavy rains, which is also expected to bring some respite./Officials said that unlike in the northern Indian plains, the air pollution monitoring in eastern and southern India, considered to be comparatively cleaner, is less common. For instance, Kolkata has only seven monitoring stations, Chennai four and Visakhapatnam one. Delhi has 38 pollution monitoring stations./Environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman said that Chennai's air pollution has worsened due to growing vehicles, three harbours, thermal power plants and oil refineries. ""The wind blowing from...[north India] is also causing pollution here...,"" he said./Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, a remote sensing analyst with the World Resources Institute blamed the farm fires' smoke for the rise in pollution levels in eastern and southern India./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Vulnerable sections likely to bear brunt of global warming,"DELHI, Nov. 11 -- An increase in the global temperature of more than 1.5 degree Celsius over the pre-industrial levels will put the world at risk of severe heatwaves, heavy rainfall, frequent extreme weather events such as cyclones, and rising sea levels. And, it will be the world's poor who will bear the brunt, experts have warned./A special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released in October last year urges countries across the world to take steps to drastically reduce emissions to maintain the temperatures within the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold also states: ""Populations at disproportionately higher risk of adverse consequences with global warming of 1.5C and beyond include disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, some indigenous peoples, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods.""/The average annual temperature on Earth has gone up by 1Celsius as compared to levels before the industrial age (1850 -1900). The IPCC report warns that a jump from 1.5degreeC to 2degreeC will lead to a substantial increase in risks; particularly in developing nations and island countries in the tropics that have limited capacity to adapt./Not only will the poor be affected more, climate change is expected to increase poverty and disadvantages faced by the vulnerable./""The relationship between climate change and poverty is very well established now. Not only will it affect the poor people the most, the effects of climate change will push people who are above the poverty line right now into poverty. The people and the governments need to have serious discussions about the challenges that we will face. It has to be constructive and look for solutions needed,"" said Dr Leena Shrivastava, vice chancellor, TERI School of Advanced Studies./The impact of climate change will be more pronounced in underdeveloped and developing countries with huge proportions of vulnerable people and lower adaptive capability./""No country will escape the impact of climate change. Some countries might be better equipped to deal with the extreme weather conditions and the resulting losses. The impacts would be more pronounced in developing countries like India because not only will there be the climactic shocks but also a huge vulnerable population that is not prepared to cope with it,"" Dr Malancha Chakrabarty had told HT. She is a Fellow with the Climate Change and Development Initiative at think tank Observer Research Foundation./Shrivastava added that increase in temperatures, air pollution levels, or rainfall leading to flooding will also have a higher impact on the poor, who are more exposed and vulnerable./""The poor have a low adaptive capacity. If we look at the current air pollution crisis in Delhi, you will see a certain class of people wearing masks, but the poor who spend more time outdoors are unable to afford it. It is also the affluent who can afford to stay indoors and get an air purifier. [It's the] same for increasing temperatures; poor people living on the street face the brunt of the high temperatures along with the urban heat islands,"" Shrivastava said./The Delhi-National Capital Region has seen air quality plunge to emergency levels since Diwali, on October 27, with pollution from firecrackers, farm fires and other weather conditions resulting in creation of toxic haze that envelops the area during the winter months./Continued emissions of greenhouse gases are projected to lead to a 4degree rise in average annual temperature in India by 2100, with the average number of extremely hot days around the country projected to increase by more than eight times per year - from 5.1 (in 2010) to 42.8, shows a study 'Climate Change and Heat Induces Mortality in India' by the by the Climate Impact Lab in collaboration with the Tata Centre for Development at UChicago./Countries also need to keep climate change in mind when it comes to addressing urban poverty and providing a safety net to citizens./""There is a need to help build resilience. And, when governments talk about social housing programmes, they need to keep the issues that come with climate change in mind./""The focus needs to be on building comfortable housing facilities that can keep the people safe rather than just building a shelter. Climate change vulnerability has to become part of every action we take,"" she said./Several studies have also shown that climate change has resulted in an increase in the number of extreme rainfall incidents in India./A 2017 study published in Nature Communications shows that there has been a threefold increase in widespread extreme rain events over central India during 1950-2015./""There are a huge number of people in this country who depend on agriculture, even subsistence agriculture, who will face a lot of economic hardship with even slight changes in rainfall,"" said Dr Chakrabarty./According to the sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6) presented at this year's United Nations Environment Assembly, loss of biodiversity due to climate change will affect the poor and the vulnerable ""disproportionately""./""Biodiversity loss is also an equity issue, disproportionately affecting poorer people, women and children. The livelihoods of 70% of people living in poverty directly depend on natural resources,"" it reads./India has lost over 1.6 million hectare of tree cover between 2001 and 2018; the total tree cover which used to be 12% of the country's geographical area in 2000 reduced to 8.9% in 2010, according to a study released by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a global research non-profit./The GEO-6 report also said that ownership of land by local communities can help turn land assets into development opportunities and secure a more sustainable use of land./""Indigenous and other forms of community-managed land could generate billions of US dollars' worth of ecosystem benefits through, among other things, carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and erosion control,"" the report said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Demand for oxygen therapy to combat pollution rising but docs divided on its use,"Gurugram, Nov. 13 -- The persistent high air pollution in the city over the last month has led to respiratory problems and other health issues among residents who, doctors say, are seeking ""oxygen therapy"" to deal with the problem./According to several hospitals in the city, there has been a rise in cases where hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), which involves breathing oxygen in a pressurised room or tube, has been administered to patients with respiratory illnesses. The therapy ensures the immune system has enough oxygen to keep the body healthy./Doctors also said that many people without any severe respiratory illness too have been seeking the therapy./However, doctors were divided on whether the therapy is effective in fighting air pollution, with a few saying it shouldn't be the norm./""Pollution particulates irritate lungs and the airways and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic smokers have required supplemental oxygen during high pollution days. Around five in 20 patients with respiratory distress that I see daily have needed oxygen therapy over the last few weeks,"" said Dr Amitabha Ghosh, a general physician at a city hospital./HBOT is also a preventative measure of carbon monoxide poisoning. ""Oxygen therapy can combat metal, mineral toxins and wash them out of the body. Car exhaust fumes produce high concentrations of carbon monoxide,"" said Dr Alok Chopra, who works at another city hospital./He said many takers of the therapy over the last month have been people with no major diseases but those who want to counter the ill effects of pollution. However, he added, a chest X-ray and a physical examination before the process is done. ""This trend is catching up in the country and people are increasingly opting for it to counter health problems that arise due to pollution,"" he said./Other hospitals confirmed they've been getting queries about the therapy, which can range between Rs 1,800 to Rs 5,000 per session, and how it can help; however, don't recommend it as an anti-pollution measure. ""Healthy people don't require oxygen therapy. It doesn't purify the blood. HBOT is recommended only for chronic, severe respiratory issues and not as a preventative measure,"" said Dr Manoj Goel, a pulmonologist./Experts also noted that preemptive measures such as masks and inhalers should be preferred to protect from pollution. ""Unless the body's oxygen levels don't drop, one doesn't need additional oxygen. HBOT isn't advisable for those without any serious illness,"" said Dr Mitali Agrawal, city pulmonologist./Box/What is oxygen therapy?/The patient is placed in a tube or room where they are exposed to almost three times the normal air pressure thereby increases the volume of oxygen in the blood and in the cells, leading to better and faster healing and an immunity boost./For whom is it recommended?/Those suffering from chronic asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetic foot ulcers, pulmonary hypertension and wounds, and smokers. These people have reduced lung capacity and suffer from low oxygen in the blood./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Bad air a major cause of deaths among children with pneumonia,"India, Nov. 13 -- Air pollution is the second biggest risk factor for child deaths from pneumonia in India after wasting, according to a new report released on Tuesday by Unicef and the non-profit Save the Children./Pneumonia killed an estimated 126, 535 children under the age of five in India in 2017 - 14 children every hour - of which 27% were attributable to outdoor air pollution and 22% to indoor air pollution, according to the report titled Fighting For Breath - Call to Action./""Air pollution is responsible for one in four deaths of children due to respiratory ailments; it is a very important factor. When it comes to pneumonia, earlier we would talk about indoor air pollution and replacing chullahs, now outdoor air pollution is also very bad. It makes the lungs susceptible to all kinds of respiratory infections. It is akin to pouring oil in the fire,"" said Dr Narendra Arora, a public health expert on respiratory ailments in children and executive director of INCLEN trust./While the link between air pollution and respiratory infections is known, this report specifically quantifies the risk of pneumonia from exposure to both indoor and outdoor air pollution./Owing to a huge population, India reported the second highest pneumonia-related child mortality 2018 in terms of absolute numbers. However, with a mortality rate of 5.2 children per 1,000 live births, India is one of the better performers among the 30 ""high burden"" countries. This includes 22 countries with the highest absolute number of pneumonia deaths and top 14 countries with the highest pneumonia mortality rates./""The average annual rate of reduction in pneumonia mortality between 2000 and 2018 was 7%. At the same rate, India is expected to reach the 2025 GAPPD (Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea) target in 2026,"" the report said./Only three of the 30 high-burden countries - Bangladesh, Indonesia, and China - are on track to achieve the deadline./Pneumonia - the biggest infectious killer/Between 2000 and 2018, there has been a 54% reduction in deaths due to pneumonia in children under the age of five, yet it remains the world's leading infectious killer of children. The disease claims the lives of more than 800,000 children under the age of five every year or more than 2,000 every day./After pneumonia, diarrhoea was the biggest killer with 437,000 deaths in 2018./""Ten or 15 years ago, pneumonia and diarrhoea were the biggest challenges for children in India, especially during the first month after birth. Since then, the deaths due to diarrhoea has gone down mainly due to improved sanitation and hygiene, access to better quality potable water, availability of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), and for the last few years, the use of rotavirus vaccine that prevents deaths due to severe viral diarrhoea. Similar developments haven't happened when it comes to pneumonia,"" said Dr Arora./Pneumonia deaths can be brought down by improving the nutrition status of children, expanding the coverage of pneumococcal vaccine, ensuring antibiotic treatment is completed, and making oxygen and IV fluids are available to manage severe cases at the lowest level of health care./""The treatment is simple and inexpensive. The challenge is the accessibility of a healthcare facility in some parts of the country and health-seeking behaviour among people. The World Health Organisation has given a clinical case definition of pneumonia to help identify the cases even without diagnostics in high burden countries. The health care workers can count the respiratory rate and check whether the child is experiencing difficulty breathing to diagnose pneumonia. Now, the healthcare workers have also been empowered to give some antibiotic treatment,"" said Dr SK Kabra, professor of paediatric pulmonology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences./Health seeking behaviour is also important for timely treatment./""What we see is people trying home remedies when the child develops symptoms initially, then they go to a local quack, and reach a hospital only when the child has complications. Parents need to be made aware that cough with rapid respiration, fever and cold needs to be treated by a doctor immediately,"" he said./""Now the availability of antibiotics is not such an issue. But, health-seeking behaviour is. A study we did in Kerala and Tamil Nadu showed that for every death due to pneumonia in children, 20 to 25 got admitted seeking care. In North India, only 1 to 1.5 children were taken to hospitals for every death. There is a need for aggressive social mobilisation,"" said Dr Arora./Poorest are the worst affected/Child deaths from pneumonia are concentrated in the world's poorest countries and within these countries it is the most deprived and marginalised children who suffer the most, according to the report./""Children from the poorest families living in low- and middle-income countries are nearly twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday as children from wealthier families, because of social and economic inequalities and poor access to basic, good-quality health services through the poorer provision or out-of-pocket costs.

Air quality worsening at faster rate in smaller towns than Delhi: Study,"India, Nov. 13 -- This winter the air pollution levels in several cities in northern India were higher than the national capital, the Central Pollution Control Board air quality index (AQI) data shows, implying that air quality is deteriorating in these smaller towns at a faster rate./Since October 1, when the pollution levels in the northern plains started to deteriorate, several northern cities had higher pollution levels than Delhi. Tracking air pollution this winter clearly shows that several cities in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as the new hot spots as compared to places such as Gwalior and Jhansi, which used to have high particulate pollution./Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh had highest AQI level of 500 on November 4 in the country, a day after Rohtak in Haryana topped the CPCB's AQI charts of 102 cities across India. On November 6, Jind in Haryana was most polluted place in the country. On November 11 and 12, Panipat, another town in southern Haryana, had highest pollution levels in the country,/Between October 1 and November 11, Panipat had topped the chart five times, Jind and Hisar four times each, Rohtak twice and Baghpat once. Ghaziabad, neighbouring Delhi in Uttar Pradesh, had been the most polluted place 11 times, Noida, twice and Lucknow once. The coal city of Talechar in Odisha also topped the CPCB AQI chart twice because of base pollution load and particulate matter flowing from the north India, the data analysis showed./In this period, Delhi's AQI level was highest only thrice, including November 27, the Diwali night, according to the CPCB data. To be sure, Delhi has 38 air pollution monitoring stations unlike other towns which have maximum of five monitoring stations. As AQI is an average of pollution levels at all stations, Delhi's AQI may not reflect the highest pollution level at a particular place in the city./""It is not fair that air pollution focus is just on Delhi,"" said Chandra Bhushan, former deputy director general of Centre for Science and Environment. ""The data clearly shows that air pollution is pan north Indian plains problem and in several places pollution levels are higher than in Delhi.""/There are two primary reasons for spike in air pollution in the northern plains-stubble burning, which picked up from October 15 and was maximum on November 4, and the increase in local pollution load. The north-westerly winds carry the stubble smoke from paddy fields of Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi and the national capital region and its contribution to pollution load had been at a maximum of 25% this winter, according to analysis by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a wing of ministry of earth sciences./Experts say the second reason is that there are virtually no action plans to deal with increasing pollution load in these smaller towns and cities, which have not come under the Supreme Court radar./For instance, Panipat, which has seen 20% increase in population between 2001 and 2011, has seen several new small industries coming up and vehicle registrations rising almost two-fold in the past five years, according to Haryana statistical report of 2018. The report shows similar increase in population and vehicles in Karnal, Rohtak and Jind./""A large number of industries which closed in Delhi have shifted close to GT Karnal Road between Panipat and Sonipat making it a new pollution hot-spot,"" said an official of Haryana pollution control board, who was not willing to be named./He added that a similar trend is also visible in and around Rohtak, where pollution levels have almost doubled in the past three years. And same is the case with Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh, which is emerging as a new residential and industrial belt next to Delhi./Haryana pollution control board member secretary, S Narayanan, said they have prepared pollution plans for these cities, which were being implemented by the district authorities. ""The CPCB is monitoring the situation and issuing directions to mitigate air pollution which is being followed,"" he said./The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board also has air pollution mitigation plan, which is being monitored by the CPCB. ""The problem is that these plans are based on assumptions and not real data. We need to know real sources of air pollution in these towns and then prepare area specific action plans,"" Bhushan said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Crop fires raged through all of last week: Data,"New Delhi, Nov. 13 -- Crop stubble fires have continued through last week, even peaking for a couple of days despite the Supreme Court ordering national and state governments to take action to improve air quality a week ago, shows latest satellite data./The Supreme Court last week ordered immediate implementation of interventions to stop stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, which was followed by Punjab chief minister Captain Amrinder Singh and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal calling for a solution to stubble burning./""Stubble fires have continued even after the SC order. The drop in temperature combined with the calm weather led to an accumulation of pollution from various sources,"" said VK Shukla, head of air quality lab, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./Until November 9, wind direction was southeasterly and blew pollutants away from Delhi, which hardly felt the impact of crop fires. This week, the wind direction changed to northwesterly, bringing smoke from Punjab and Haryana to the Indo-Gangetic plain./Wind speed also reduced from 20 kmph till November 10 to only about 7 to 8 kmph on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said./With a change in wind direction and a gradual drop in wind speed, the contribution of crop stubble fires to Delhi's air pollution has once again shot up./The ministry of earth sciences' air quality early warning system stated on Tuesday air quality was likely to deteriorate to severe + category on Thursday./The warning says stubble burning fire points have been observed in Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring Pakistan./The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research (Safar) at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said fires had reduced but conditions were favourable for plume intrusion(flow of pollutants in the form of vapour or smoke) for the next two days./""What you are seeing outside is smoke. Visibility has reduced mainly due to an accumulation of pollutants. Wind direction will continue to be northwesterly and wind speed will range between 8 and 10 kmph till November 14, after which we expect winds to pick up,"" Kuldeep Shrivastava, director of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC), said./A study, ""Connecting Crop Productivity, Residue Fires and Air Quality over Northern India"", in Nature Journal on Tuesday by scientists at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre made a direct linkage between crop output, stubble fires and the rise in air pollution over Delhi. The study said rice production in Punjab had increased by 25%, and so had the vegetation index (measure for greenness that can indicate crop or vegetation cover)with a net increase of 21% between 2002 and 2016./Post paddy harvest, fires increased by 60%, leading to nearly 43% increase in aerosol (suspension of particles) loading over the Indo-Gangetic plains . Ground-level PM 2.5 concentrations showed a simultaneous uptrend of 6ug/m3 per year, leading to 60% increase during the post-monsoon season, the study found./Nasa's data for 2018 had indicated that there was virtually no decline in the number of crop stubble fires last year compared to 2017 even as the Centre implemented a new policy worth 1,150 crore for in-situ management of crop residue. The Centre's scheme subsidised farm straw-management machinery by 50% but high crop fire numbers this year also indicated the scheme had not made a dent./Farmer groups such as Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said very few farmers had access to the machines and that it was cheaper to burn the stubble than hiring machines from farm cooperatives for 1,200 to 1,500 per acre. Farmers had demanded a direct subsidy of 100 per quintal for all paddy farmers./Following a steep spike in air pollution levels on November 2 and 3, the apex court heard the air pollution matter on November 6 and directed that all farmers be given an incentive of Rs 100 per quintal to prevent them from setting their fields on fire in preparation for the next crop, and provide them free machines to get rid of the residue. ""Nobody will be spared if found violating rules.You just want to sit in your ivory towers and rule. You are not bothered and are letting the people die,"" the court had said./But even a subsidy of 100 per quintal has not managed to impress farmers. ""The subsidy was announced very late when farmers were busy preparing their fields for wheat. Later, farmers were told it's only for those with less than 5 acre farms. What about those who don't own farm land and only rent it? What about farmers with slightly bigger plots? Farmers haven't accepted the scheme so fires have continued,"" said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in Punjab./Experts said the SC should consider breaking the wheat-paddy combination in Punjab and Haryana. The problem of stubble burning is acute because in paddy is harvested in October. Stubble has to be cleared and fields prepared for wheat sowing by mid-November./""All the incentives are going to paddy. Even the 100 per quintal is for paddy farmers. Why will farmers move away from it to oil seeds or pulses? As long as the paddy-wheat combo continues, this problem will remain. It's time the government encouraged and procured and incentivised other crops,"" said Ramanjaneyulu GV, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture./The amount of agricultural waste generated post-harvest is estimated to be 1.5 to 2.25 times the actual quantities of crop. Ramanjaneyulu's analysis shows just one tonne of straw burning can release up to 3 kgs of particulate matter (PM), 1460 kgs of carbon dioxide(CO2) and 199 kgs of ash. Burning stubble leads to an immediate decline in the bacterial and fungal population in the top 2.5 cm of the soil./Repeated burning in the field permanently diminishes the bacterial population by more than 50% leading to increasing dependence of farmers on fertilisers and pesticide inputs./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Bad air a major cause of deaths among children with pneumonia,"New Delhi, Nov. 13 -- Air pollution is the second biggest risk factor for child deaths from pneumonia in India after wasting, according to a new report released on Tuesday by Unicef and the non-profit Save the Children./Pneumonia killed an estimated 126,535 children under the age of five in India in 2017 - 14 children every hour - of which 27% were attributable to outdoor air pollution and 22% to indoor air pollution, according to the report titled Fighting For Breath - Call to Action./""Air pollution is responsible for one in four deaths of children due to respiratory ailments. When it comes to pneumonia, earlier we would talk about indoor air pollution, now outdoor air pollution is also bad. It makes the lungs susceptible to respiratory infections. It is akin to pouring oil in the fire,"" said Dr Narendra Arora, a public health expert on respiratory ailments in children and executive director of INCLEN trust./While the link between air pollution and respiratory infections is known, this report quantifies the risk of pneumonia from exposure to both indoor and outdoor air pollution./Owing to a huge population, India reported the second highest pneumonia-related child mortality in 2018 in terms of absolute numbers. However, with a mortality rate of 5.2 children per 1,000 live births, India is one of the better performers among the 30 ""high burden"" countries. This includes 22 countries with the highest absolute number of pneumonia deaths and top 14 countries with the highest pneumonia mortality rates./""The average annual rate of reduction in pneumonia mortality between 2000 and 2018 was 7%. At the same rate, India is expected to reach the 2025 Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea target in 2026,"" the report said. Only three of the 30 high-burden countries - Bangladesh, Indonesia, and China - are on track to achieve the deadline./Pneumonia - the biggest infectious killer/Between 2000 and 2018, there has been a 54% reduction in deaths due to pneumonia in children under the age of five, yet it remains the world's leading infectious killer of children. It claims the lives of over 800,000 children under the age of five every year or more than 2,000 every day. After pneumonia, diarrhoea was the biggest killer with 437,000 deaths in 2018./""Ten or 15 years ago, pneumonia and diarrhoea were the biggest challenges for children in India, especially during the first month after birth. Since then, the deaths due to diarrhoea have gone down due to improved sanitation and hygiene, access to better quality potable water, availability of Oral Rehydration Solution, and for the last few years, the use of rotavirus vaccine that prevents deaths due to viral diarrhoea. Similar developments haven't happened when it comes to pneumonia,"" said Dr Arora./Pneumonia deaths can be brought down by improving the nutrition status of children, expanding the coverage of pneumococcal vaccine, ensuring antibiotic treatment is completed, and making oxygen and IV fluids available to manage severe cases at the lowest level of health care./""The treatment is simple and inexpensive. The challenge is the accessibility of a healthcare facility in some parts of the country and health-seeking behaviour among people. The World Health Organisation has given a clinical case definition of pneumonia to help identify the cases even without diagnostics. The health care workers can count the respiratory rate and check whether the child is experiencing difficulty breathing to diagnose pneumonia. The healthcare workers have also been empowered to give antibiotic treatment,"" said Dr SK Kabra, professor of paediatric pulmonology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences./""What we see is people trying home remedies when the child develops symptoms, then they go to a local quack, and reach a hospital only when the child has complications. Parents need to be made aware that cough with rapid respiration, fever and cold needs to be treated by a doctor immediately,"" he said./""The availability of antibiotics is not such an issue. But, health-seeking behaviour is. A study we did in Kerala and Tamil Nadu showed that for every death due to pneumonia in children, 20 to 25 got admitted seeking care. In North India, only 1 to 1.5 children were taken to hospitals for every death,"" said Dr Arora./Poorest are the worst affected/Child deaths from pneumonia are concentrated in the world's poorest countries and within these countries it is the most deprived and marginalised children who suffer the most, according to the report./""Children from the poorest families living in low- and middle-income countries are nearly twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday as children from wealthier families, because of social and economic inequalities and poor access to basic, good-quality health services through the poorer provision or out-of-pocket costs. They are further disadvantaged by high rates of malnutrition, co-infections with other diseases, exposure to polluted air, and limited access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene,"" the report states,"" the report said./In India, childhood deaths more common in poor with 72 deaths per 1,000 live births in the poorest households as compared to 23 deaths per 1,000 in richest households./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"In China, questions raised over efficacy of smog towers","India, Nov. 13 -- China's experiment with installing giant outdoor ""smog-free towers"" in its polluted cities haven't had the desired results despite generating interest when first talked about in 2016./Instead, emission control remains the only effective way to control pollution, experts told HT./A seven metre high anti-smog tower, designed by Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde, was the first to be put up in an art district in Beijing in 2016./It was the last./Within months, China's state-controlled media had trashed the tower, calling it an ""eyewash"" and ineffective in a megacity with more than 20 million people like Beijing./A larger, skyscraper-sized smog-tower was also built in Xi'an, the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi province, another heavily polluted city, the same year./Two years later, in 2018, the evidence of its effectiveness was questioned by a research institute./""A skyscraper-sized air purifier curbed pollution by about 15% in a 10-square kilometer area over two years in one of China's most polluted cities,"" the state-controlled tabloid, Global Times said in a report./""It would take about 1,000 to do the same for the entire city of Xi'an,"" the tabloid quoted Cao Junji, from the Institute of Earth Environment at the Chinese Academy of Sciences as saying./The 60-meter-high air purifier cost 12 million yuan ($1.91 million) when it was installed in 2016./About 1,000 such structures could handle 10,000 square kilometers, Cao said./""It is costly and works for a limited area like 100 metres, and the pollutants can be easily transported to clean air (area) again. It is not practical to use these (smog-towers) to control air pollution,"" Hongliang Zhang from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering from Shanghai's Fudan University told HT./""People build it for reasons but no one academia thinks it is effective,"" Hongliang added./""The haze towers in Chinese cities have not been used much; their effectiveness is limited to 100 metres (in the immediate surrounding areas). It has a limited effect on the environment,"" a Liping Zhang, a consultant on pollution based in eastern China's Hangzhou said./""The economic feasibility of such towers is relatively poor for improving the environment on a large scale. They could have an impact on the environment at a very local level,"" Liping added./""Emission is the only way to control pollution,"" Hongliang, the first expert, said./In March, Beijing announced that it will allocate 25 billion yuan or $3.73 billion to prevent and control air pollution, an increase by 25% year on year./As for the towers, they could probably work as anti-pollution symbols but the cost involved in building such structures in the first place puts a question mark on the projects./The one already put up in Beijing, for example, has since been renamed as ""smog reminder"" instead of the more ambitious ""smog tower"", state media reported, adding that the structure was retained for educational purposes./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"May extend odd-even, depending on pollution levels: Kejriwal","New Delhi, Nov. 13 -- : With air quality plunging further, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday blamed continuing farm fires in neighbouring states, and said his government may consider extending the odd-even road space rationing scheme beyond November 15, when it was scheduled to end. The decision will depend on pollution levels, he said./At 4pm, the air quality index (AQI) read ""severe"" for the second consecutive day on Wednesday at 456. On Tuesday, it was 425./""Odd-even may be extended if necessary. I would like to appeal to the Opposition not to oppose odd-even. Pollution has increased drastically. All of Delhi is demanding odd-even and at such a time the Opposition parties should support people's wish.,"" said Kejriwal./Meanwhile, a review meeting on the odd-even scheme - in which the city government was likely to discuss extending the ongoing edition of the scheme - was scheduled to he held on Wednesday. But it was called off, senior officials said./Criticising the state governments in Punjab and Haryana for allegedly failing to have controlled instances of stubble burning, Kejriwal on Wednesday said, ""The smoke coming from Haryana and Punjab because of the burning of stubble has polluted Delhi again. There was relatively less smoke in between for 3-4 days, but that was because of weather changes and rain in those states. Today, the instances of stubble burning have started again. I am highly disappointed that the states are not even obeying the directions given by the Supreme Court.""/Kejriwal's comments on Wednesday came close on the heels of the Supreme Court issuing a notice to the Delhi government seeking daily data of the ongoing edition of the odd-even scheme in connection with a public interest litigation challenging its efficacy./Last week, the Supreme Court had lashed out at the state governments in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for failing to have reduced stubble burning. Earlier, the top court had rebuked the Centre and the Delhi government for allegedly passing the buck when it came to Delhi's annual air pollution crisis./Many opposition leaders such as Bharatiya Janata Party's Rajya?Sabha MP Vijay Goel and Vijender Gupta had criticised the road space rationing scheme calling it a politically gimmick and an 'election stunt'/PROSECUTION NUMBERS/On Wednesday, 552 individuals were prosecuted for violation of the odd-even scheme, taking the total number of fines to 3,834 so far./The scheme was lifted for two days on November 11 and 12 in the light of the 550th birth anniversary celebration of Guru Nanak Dev. It resumed on Wednesday and is scheduled to be enforced till Friday./Under the scheme, private cars with even and odd registration numbers are restricted from plying on the roads in odd and even dates respectively, exempting cars driven by women and those with children in school uniforms./The violation can attract a penalty of Rs.4,000.

"Delhi's air severe again, may hit emergency level by today","India, Nov. 13 -- A thick haze returned to Delhi on Tuesday amid stubble burning in neighbouring states, with official forecasters saying the air quality could hit ""emergency"" levels during the next two days because of low surface wind and cloud cover, sparking concerns by parents over schoolchildren being exposed to poisonous pollutants outdoors./The Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) 4pm bulletin on the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday showed the pollution was ""severe"" at 425, a sharp rise from 360 the previous day. By 11pm, the AQI had dipped to 449./The 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 ultra-fine particles reported by the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management-Delhi NCR's dashboard breached the 300ug/m3 level regarded as the threshold beyond which the pollution is considered to be in the emergency zone./The government's air quality monitoring system, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said winds blowing from the northwest carried plumes of smoke from burning stubble in Punjab and Haryana to New Delhi, causing the pollution to rise. "".The transport level wind direction is forecasted to be highly favourable for plume intrusion for the next two days,"" it said./""No sudden recovery is expected under this condition at least for the next two days and AQI is likely to deteriorate further towards SEVERE+ category by tomorrow (Wednesday). The condition may slightly improve by 15th November,"" it added./The agency said that while the farm fire count had gone down, the wind pattern was bringing in airborne particles that are harmful to human health./The Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government said it restricted outdoor activities in schools, but there were no immediate plans of shutting down schools. The extension of road rationing measures, popularly called the odd-even scheme, will be reviewed on Wednesday after assessing the pollution over the next 24 hours, Delhi's environment minister Kailash Gahlot said. The scheme was suspended on Monday and Tuesday for the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak./Authorities have faced criticism in the past over a delay in announcing a shutdown of schools over a technicality in the emergency action plan, even as experts say young children should be kept indoors till pollution levels ease./On November 3, the AQI level hit 494, the worst since 2016, triggering widespread complaints from residents of burning eyes, itchy throats and shortness of breath. Days after the air emergency, the Supreme Court pulled up the Union government and the administrations of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for failing to stop farm fires. When informed that farm fires were lower in Haryana than Punjab, the judges summoned Punjab's chief secretary and made stern remarks./Farm fires result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 ultrafine particles in the air, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs./Weather experts said the national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 11.7 degrees Celsius, the season's lowest so far, on Tuesday morning. It was two notches below normal for this time of the year. A dip in the wind speed and temperature makes the air cold and denser, leading to accumulation of pollutants./CPCB data showed that all 38 monitoring stations across the city were in ""severe"" category on Tuesday. At 8pm, the average PM2.5 level was 332.8./""The air quality is likely to deteriorate on Wednesday and reach upper end of severe category. The air quality is likely to deteriorate further on Thursday and may reach in severe plus category,"" a bulletin by the union environment ministry said./""Stubble burning fire points in Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring Pakistan were observed which is also contributing to deteriorating air quality,"" it added./As people reported of breathing difficulties on Tuesday, Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) member Sunita Narain said that the city was already in a ""virtual shutdown mode""./""The construction activities are banned, the industries are not operational, and there is massive efforts in force. Even though odd-even plan should have been in place today (Tuesday), at least it will be back tomorrow. Enforcement can be better but we need to now recognise how much more we need to do,"" Narain said./According to SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's air pollution on Tuesday was 25%.

"Baghpat, Jind among new pollution hot spots in north India, shows data","New Delhi, Nov. 14 -- This winter the air pollution levels in several other northern cities was higher than the national capital, the Central Pollution Control Board air quality index (AQI) data shows, implying that air quality is deteriorating in these smaller towns at a faster rate./Since October 1, when the pollution levels in the northern plain started to deteriorate, several northern cities had higher pollution levels than Delhi. Tracking air pollution this winter clearly shows that several cities in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as the new hot spots as compared to places such as Gwalior and Jhansi, which used to have high particulate pollution./Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh had highest AQI level of 500 on November 4 in the country, a day after Rohtak in Haryana topped the CPCB's AQI charts of 102 cities across India. On November 6, Jind in Haryana was most polluted place in the country. On November 11 and 12, Panipat, another town in southern Haryana had highest pollution levels in the country,/Between October 1 and November 11, Panipat had topped the chart five times, Jind and Hisar four times each, Rohtak twice and Baghpat once. Ghaziabad, neighbouring Delhi in Uttar Pradesh, had been the most polluted place 11 times, Noida, twice and Lucknow once. The coal city of Talechar in Odisha also topped the CPCB AQI chart twice because of base pollution load and particulate matter flowing from the north India, the data analysis showed./In this period, Delhi's AQI level was highest only thrice including November 27, the Diwali night, according to the CPCB data. To be sure, Delhi has 38 air pollution monitoring stations unlike other towns which have maximum of five monitoring stations. As AQI is an average of pollution levels at all stations, the Delhi's AQI may not reflect the highest pollution level at a particular place in the city./""It is not fair that air pollution focus is just on Delhi,"" said Chandra Bhushan former deputy director general of Centre for Science and Environment. ""The data clearly shows that air pollution is pan north Indian plains problem and in several places pollution levels are higher than in Delhi.""/There are two primary reasons for spike in air pollution in the northern plains -- stubble burning, which picked up from October 15 and was maximum on November 4, and the increase in local pollution load.

"In China, questions raised over efficacy of smog towers","New Delhi, Nov. 14 -- China's experiment with installing giant outdoor ""smog-free towers"" in its polluted cities haven't had the desired results despite generating interest when first talked about in 2016./Instead, emission control remains the only effective way to control pollution, experts told HT./A seven metre high anti-smog tower, designed by Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde, was the first to be put up in an art district in Beijing in 2016./It was the last./Within months, China's state-controlled media trashed the tower, calling it an ""eyewash"" and ineffective in a megacity with more than 20 million people like Beijing./A larger, skyscraper-sized smog-tower was also built in Xi'an, the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi province, another heavily polluted city, the same year. Two years later, in 2018, the evidence of its effectiveness was questioned by a research institute./""A skyscraper-sized air purifier curbed pollution by about 15% in a 10-square kilometer area over two years in one of China's most polluted cities,"" the state-controlled tabloid, Global Times said in a report./""It would take about 1,000 to do the same for the entire city of Xi'an,"" the tabloid quoted Cao Junji, from the Institute of Earth Environment at the Chinese Academy of Sciences as saying./The 60-meter-high air purifier cost 12 million yuan ($1.91 million) when it was installed in 2016./About 1,000 such structures could handle 10,000 square kilometers, Cao said./""It is costly and works for a limited area like 100 metres, and the pollutants can be easily transported to clean air (area) again. It is not practical to use these (smog-towers) to control air pollution,"" Hongliang Zhang from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering from Shanghai's Fudan University told HT./""People build it for reasons but no one academia thinks it is effective,"" Hongliang added./""The haze towers in Chinese cities have not been used much; their effectiveness is limited to 100 metres (in the immediate surrounding areas). It has a limited effect on the environment,"" a Liping Zhang, a consultant on pollution based in eastern China's Hangzhou said./""The economic feasibility of such towers is relatively poor for improving the environment on a large scale. They could have an impact on the environment at a very local level,"" Liping added./""Emission is the only way to control pollution,"" Hongliang, the first expert, said./In March, Beijing announced that it will allocate 25 billion yuan or $3.73 billion to prevent and control air pollution, an increase by 25% year on year./As for the towers, they could probably work as anti-pollution symbols but the cost involved in building such structures in the first place puts a question mark on the projects. The one already put up in Beijing, for example, has since been renamed as ""smog reminder"" instead of the more ambitious ""smog tower"", state media reported, adding that the structure was retained for educational purposes./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

But it was called off, senior officials said./Criticising the state governments in Punjab and Haryana for allegedly failing to have controlled instances of stubble burning, Kejriwal on Wednesday said, ""The smoke coming from Haryana and Punjab because of the burning of stubble has polluted Delhi again. There was relatively less smoke in between for 3-4 days, but that was because of weather changes and rain in those states. Today, the instances of stubble burning have started again. I am highly disappointed that the states are not even obeying the directions given by the Supreme Court.""/Kejriwal's comments on Wednesday came close on the heels of the Supreme Court issuing a notice to the Delhi government seeking daily data of the ongoing edition of the odd-even scheme in connection with a public interest litigation challenging its efficacy./Last week, the Supreme Court had lashed out at the state governments in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for failing to have reduced stubble burning. Earlier, the top court had rebuked the Centre and the Delhi government for allegedly passing the buck when it came to Delhi's annual air pollution crisis./Many opposition leaders such as Bharatiya Janata Party's Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel and Vijender Gupta had criticised the road space rationing scheme calling it a politically gimmick and an 'election stunt'/On Wednesday, 552 individuals were prosecuted for violation of the odd-even scheme, taking the total number of fines to 3,834 so far. The scheme was lifted for two days on November 11 and 12 in the light of the 550th birth anniversary celebration of Guru Nanak Dev. It resumed on Wednesday and is scheduled to be enforced till Friday./Under the scheme, private cars with even and odd registration numbers are restricted from plying on the roads in odd and even dates respectively, exempting cars driven by women and those with children in school uniforms./The violation can attract a penalty of 4,000./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

On Tuesday, the AQI was at 425./""Odd-even (road rationing scheme) may be extended if necessary. I would like to appeal to the opposition not to oppose odd-even. Pollution has increased drastically. All of Delhi is demanding odd-even and at such a time the opposition parties should support people's wish,"" said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal./A decision of whether the odd-even curbs need to be extended will be taken on Friday, the day the drive is supposed to end./The task force of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) met on Wednesday as AQI strayed deeper into the ""severe"" category, with levels of ultra-fine PM2.5 particles remaining above the danger mark of 300ug/m3 for over 24 hours (starting Tuesday 12pm). These levels are regarded as hazardous for young people, the elderly, and those with existing bronchial conditions./The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) asked administrations in NCR to shut all schools for two days -- Thursday and Friday./""The Delhi government has decided to shut all government and private schools in the city for tomorrow and day after (Thursday-Friday) on account of deteriorating air quality because of stubble burning pollution in north western India,"" Delhi's deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia said in tweet late on Wednesday./Later in the evening, district officials in Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida also issued orders for schools in their areas to be closed./According to Epca's letter sent to all state officials, the air quality in Delhi-NCR was ""extremely unhealthy"" without any possibility of dispersion of pollutants at least till the next two days./""All agencies will have to control local sources of pollution so that the situation can be mitigated as far as possible,"" the letter read./The issue also came up in Supreme Court on Wednesday, when judges directed the Union government to explore the feasibility of a hydrogen-based fuel technology as a permanent solution to the air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region and other parts of north India./At another hearing on a related issue - a petition challenging the legality of the odd-even curbs - a separate bench asked the Delhi government to present air quality data for the period that fell when the plan was in force as well as comparative data for the period of October 1 to December 31, 2018./Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said air quality will deteriorate till Thursday afternoon, after which wind speeds could pick up. Wind speed from Friday till November 18 is expected to be 15-20kmph, which will help improve air quality./Construction activity has been suspended in the national capital as well as operations in polluting industries as the capital grapples with a problem that has become predictable but virtually unavoidable in recent years./A significant trigger for the pollution, according to experts, has been farm fires in the states of Punjab and Haryana. The smoke from these areas has been estimated to have reached as far as Kolkata, covering cities, towns and villages in the Gangetic plains in a hazardous smoke cloud./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution an additional stress for heart patients,"New Delhi, Nov. 15 -- Winter had been a nightmare for 27-year-old Bilal Ahmed for almost two years./Bilal, who had lost around 85% of his heart fuction and had been waiting for a transplant, became breathless and had chest pains every once in a while. But the number of times he had to visit the hospital emergency went up every time the pollution levels spiked in the city./More than half of Bilal's nearly 15 yearly visits to the emergency department of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) were during the months when the pollution levels were high./""The pollution levels in the city troubled me a lot; every ten to fifteen days, I would end up in the emergency with chest pains and breathlessness. I got a little better only when the doctors gave me some injection,"" said Ahmed, who underwent a heart transplant at AIIMS in March this year./He had dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart chamber enlarges and weakens reducing the heart's ability to pump blood./""When a patient is in heart failure, their heart and lungs are already under a lot of stress. A spike in pollution levels puts more stress on the organs and aggravates the symptoms of patients suffering from such conditions,"" said Dr Sandeep Seth, the doctor who treated Bilal and a professor of cardiology at AIIMS./For patients like Bilal, whose condition cannot be reversed, heart transplant is the only option. ""I could barely do anything when I was waiting for a transplant. Moving around felt like a huge task. Even during my initial consultation with a cardiologist, I was told that I would need a transplant because there was hardly any heart function left,"" said Bilal, who runs a saloon in Pitampura/Every year, almost 10,000 people in the country need a heart transplant, but only 150 to 200 receive it because of a shortage of organs. There is a severe shortage of all organs - only 8,000 of the two lakh in need of a kidney transplant get it and almost 1,800 of nearly 80,000 in need of liver transplant get it. In India, the rates of organ donation is very low - only 0.8 per million population./To promote organ donation, the Organ Retrieval and Banking Organisation at AIIMS felicitated the families of organ, tissue, and whole body donors on Wednesday./Air pollution is also a major risk factor for several cardiac diseases, especially heart attack./""It is well known that pollution increases the risk of heart attack and stroke, along with respiratory ailments. The link between air pollution and conditions like hypertension and diabetes is also well known, which are risk factors for several heart diseases,"" said Dr Sharma./A study published in Lancet Global Health last year shows that ischaemic heart disease lead to 23.8% of all pollution related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) or the number of years lost due to ill-health attributable to pollution. The study showed that Indians would live 1.7 years more on average if there was no air pollution./""When ORBO was set up, the deceased donation activity was negligible in Delhi. ORBO started facilitating organ donation, started a brain death donor registry, and carried out mass awareness. Now, we have a real-time mandatory notification of all brain dead patients and also round the clock availability of transplant coordination staff. We are the first institute to have started it,"" said Dr Aarti Vij, head of ORBO./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

An early warning system that helps scientists check sources of foul air,"New Delhi, Nov. 16 -- As Delhi gasps for breath under a spell of severe air pollution, an early warning system - developed by the Union ministry of earth sciences - has been helping scientists accurately determine causes of foul air and take effective steps to check it./The early warning system, which has been functioning for a year now, sends inputs to agencies about an estimate of PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) pollution from biomass burning, dust and also an indication if it's from local emission sources./Last month, the model's resolution was scaled down from 2km to 400metres, helping it pick up sources and transport of air pollution more accurately./The early warning system uses a WRF-Chem model (weather and chemical transport of pollutants) which can assimilate fire counts, weather data, aerosol optical depth (an indirect proxy for air quality, which shows how solid and liquid particles in polluted air block sunlight and lead to smog) to produce a three day forecast for air quality./For example, the warning system gave a forecast of three ""severe"" days on November 10, on the basis of which the Supreme Court-mandated environment pollution control authority extended the severe category interventions like shutting schools, stopping all construction work, prohibition on use of diesel gen sets and introduction of odd and even scheme./The forecast model showed a layer of smoke over Delhi-NCR and other neighbouring areas on Friday afternoon, when this HT reporter visited a mini air quality forecast control room at India Meteorological Department. The apportionment data on Friday estimated that biomass burning was contributing only 10 micrograms per cubic metres to the PM 2.5 concentrations of Delhi, while contribution from dust was nearly zero./""We are seeing a declining trend in crop fires now. But whatever has accumulated hasn't dispersed. The fresh emissions from biomass fires may be less today but pollutants have life. They can remain suspended. There were a large number of fires last week,"" said VK Soni, senior scientist at IMD, who analyses modelling data released by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune's control room and briefs the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the SC mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) everyday on air pollution outlook./The model developed by Pune based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) has the capability of apportioning other sources also. The team will consider dissecting those sources in future./Soni, who has been seeing how pollutants travel from the northwest or the east to Delhi depending on the wind direction and accumulation of local pollutants over the region, doesn't mince words about the crisis. ""We cannot change meteorology. All we can do is to reduce pollution sources and emissions as much as possible,"" he said./He adds that agencies have so far promptly acted on his forecast for the past few months but pollution sources are innumerable./The accumulation of smoke over Delhi is mainly a result of lack of wind, which picked up on Friday but not enough to disperse pollutants. ""We have a wind speed of 8 to 10 kmph. Our model says it will rise 20 kmph on Saturday and that conditions will be favourable for dispersion.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Toxic air reducing learning ability of kids, causing irreversible damage","New Delhi, Nov. 17 -- Airborne ultrafine particulate matter (PM &#38;lt;0.1) from fuel emissions were linked this week to increased risk of brain tumours by a large study from Canada, which once again put the spotlight on the extrapulmonary damage to health from airborne toxins./The World Health Organisation (WHO) annual mean cut-off for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is &#38;lt;10 ug/m3, but Delhi's annual mean was 115ug/m3 in 2018, and 97.7ug/m3 till November 14 this year, according to Central Pollution Control Board./The brain is the biggest oxygen guzzler, consuming 20% of the total body oxygen while accounting for just 2% of the body weight. This makes it more susceptible to the air-borne toxins./Everyone is vulnerable to air pollution, but younger children are at the most at risk./With every breath, children take in more air per unit of body weight than adults. They breathe faster than adults and inhale two to three times more pollutants than older people, inhaling far more toxins per unit of body weight than adults./Compared to an adult who inhales between 12 and 18 times a minute, a newborn breathes in 30 to 40 times a minute, and a toddler 20 to 30 times./Irreversible damage/Children often do not show visible signs of health damage, which accrues over time and becomes irreversible when they get older. ""All of us have a reserve that stops us from becoming breathless when lung capacity falls to some extent. But when that reserve goes as you age, the chances of getting respiratory problem become higher. So it will cause problems in later life, it may not cause that much of a problem in the younger age group,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and head of the department of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders./The blood-brain barrier is not fully formed in children, which allows fine and ultrafine particles to cross the blood-brain barrier(a delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxins) to cause neuro-inflammation and damages the brain cells. This lowers a child's thinking and cognitive ability and affects intellectual development over time./In older adults, the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier has been strongly linked degenerative brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Experts say brain damage in young children begins at doses much lower than those that damage an adult brain. ""Studies have found associations directly between air pollution exposure and cognitive outcomes, including reduced verbal and nonverbal IQ, memory, test scores and grade-point averages among school children, as well as other neurological behavioural problems,""according to the Unicef's report, Danger in the air: How air pollution can affect brain development in young children./Then there are the ripple effects of missing school from frequent illnesses, schools being shut, and restricted outdoor activity, all of which further limits children reaching their full learning and developmental potential./Womb not safe/The damage begins in the womb. A mother's exposure to toxic air during pregnancy reduces her unborn child's heart rate variability, which affects stress response and is a known risk factor for heart disease, asthma, allergies, and mood and behavioural disorders, according to a study published in Environmental Health Perspectives in October./Air pollutants inhaled during pregnancy cross the placenta to produce potential lifelong effects, such as low birth weight, developmental delays at age three, and psychological and behavioural problems later in childhood, including symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression. One study found a four-point drop in IQ by the age of 5 among a sample of children exposed in utero to toxic air pollution./A new study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) this week found a link between air pollution and changes in the corpus callosum, a region of the brain associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Each 7 ug/m3 rise in PM2.5 levels was associated with a nearly 5% fall in the mean volume of the corpus callosum, according to the study in in Environmental Research./Protecting kids/A nutritious diet high in protein and micronutrients from fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds help build immunity and minimise damage, including offering protection from infections such as seasonal influenza and pneumonia. Vaccinating children with the pneumococcal vaccine and the flu vaccine gives additional protection against infection, as does exclusive breastfeeding (with no other fluids or solids) for six months and then continued along with solid foods for two years or more./Policy changes, like the adoption of unleaded petrol to protect children from neural and brain damage, can reduce the potential scale and impact of air pollutants, as can reducing the use of fossil fuels by opting for cleaner, renewable sources of energy, including the use of solar, wind and thermal power. Improved and affordable public transportation, better waste management, smart urban planning with adequate trees and green areas within neighbourhoods help improve local air quality while offering children a space to play./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Combating Air Pollution: Niti Aayog, CII draft plan for clean industry","India, Nov. 17 -- A NITI Aayog and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)-led task force on combating air pollution has drafted an action plan for a clean industry, which includes measures for prevention and control of fugitive particulate matter (dust and ash) emissions.The plan recommends mandatory funds allocation for air quality management under the Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) in cities with high pollution levels and mandatory contractual obligations for ""clean"" construction./Underlining the need for developing capacity of urban local bodies in the National Capital Region (NCR) to ensure clean constructions, the plan seeks mandatory provisions under the National Building Code for ambient air quality management./The task force has suggested that for a city figuring as non-compliant in any particular year, 40% of the CER funds may be diverted toward indicative activities as listed above based on the local requirements./The action plan is a part of the task force's report, a copy of which HT has reviewed, on clean industry./The action plan has recommended a comprehensive strategy to address the particulate matter from concerned subsectors. It encompasses prevention and control of fugitive emissions across construction activities at sites, operation of various utilities including waste management within NCR and allied construction industry including brick kilns, concrete batching plants, stone crusher etc./The task force has also recommended incentives for co-firing biomass in existing coal power units and giving priority status to clean generation and gas-based thermal power generation units./""Leapfrogging to advanced biomass co-firing [more than 10% biomass] requires a long-term and comprehensive policy for the promotion of biomass co-firing in thermal power plants. Commercial feasibility of enhanced co-firing is still being evaluated at this stage. However, in long term, this could potentially unlock a cost-effective strategy for greening the coal power and simultaneous reduction of emissions from stubble burning in North West region,'' the report says./Pollution spikes are common in the first half of November in northern India as farm fires peak in Punjab and Haryana during this time and the resulting smoke settles over the region. Farmers often burn stubble left behind after harvest as a quick and cheap way of clearing their fields for the next round of sowing./The report says that the GST can provide a level playing field for sustainable building materials. It adds that favourable taxation is recommended for all sustainable building materials./""As per the inputs from task force members, key barriers for adoption of sustainable building materials [despite clear economic and environmental benefit] arise from sourcing of virgin materials from illegal mining [such as aggregates, sand]. Therefore, fiscal or tax incentives are crucial to promote sustainable bulling materials,"" it said./In the report, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant notes that air pollution is a major threat to a healthy environment. He adds that the government think tank has been working closely with the CII and other stakeholders for controlling air pollution and that four task forces were constituted to recommend suitable interventions for clean fuel, clean transport, clean industry and biomass management./The task force on biomass management had noted that its intervention in supporting improved crop residue management, covering 16,000 acres of farmland in Punjab's Ludhiana and Patiala districts, resulted in reducing stubble burning. ""Post the intervention, a total of 12,000 acres of farmland [75% of the total area] became free of stubble burning, compared to 3.5% of farmland in the previous season,"" the report says./CII's deputy director-general Seema Arora said that they undertook a pilot project in 2018 after a report on biomass management. ""The report gave recommendations on how to make machines affordable for marginal and small farmers. We worked in 19 villages and demonstrated the use of technology to avoid stubble burning.

On their own in fight against toxic air,"New Delhi, Nov. 17 -- Delhiites have been largely left to their own devices to fight air pollution in a city which, for the past couple of weeks, has become a virtual gas chamber. Here are the many things they are doing to cope./Taking the fight to the streets/The fight began on social media, with groups and communities on Facebook - such as 'Let Me Breath' and 'My Right To Breathe' - using hashtags as tools of mass mobilization. As air pollution levels rose again this year, Delhiittes wearing masks, held a massive protest on November 5 at India Gate./""The protest took place within 36 hours of an angry message on social media by a concerned citizen. However, the vendors, the rickshaw pullers, the auto-rickshaw drivers - the most vulnerable group - were not present. They too need to be sensitised on how pollution affects their lives,"" said Brikesh Singh, who has formed the Clean Air Collective, a pan-India coalition of organisations and individuals working for cleaner air./According to Tamseel Hussain, who runs Let Me Breathe - a digital platform which crowd-sources pollution stories from across the country - 40% of the 2,500 video stories on the platform are from the national Capital. ""The stories are more nuances now, unlike two years ago when people seemed to express vague concerns on pollution,"" says Hussain./According to environmentalists, the best part about growing involvement of the common people is that it has democratised the debate around pollution./""This is helping build pressure on authorities. One positive aspect is that the conversation is also breaking out of the middle-class bastions, as well as the economically weaker sections,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./He came as a man from the future/Every Saturday, 23-year-old Nimit Pahwa dresses up like a ""man from the future"" and walks around the city wearing a heavy oxygen mask, a printed letter in his hand, trying to tell people how in the year 2030 fresh air and blue skies could become a subject of history books./This Saturday, from 12pm to 7pm he was in central Delhi's Connaught Place. A few were keenly reading his letter, which, among other things, says:/""It has been five years since oxygen masks became one of our face accessories and we are helpless./""Scientists suggest that if we had realised our responsibilities towards nature a decade ago, the world could have been saved from a crisis./""The idea is to tell people that a terrifying future awaits us if we do not act now. While a lot of curious people stopped and watched me from a distance, about fifty people walked up to me and asked about why I was doing what I was doing,"" says Pahwa, who works as a social media manager for a company in Gurgaon. ""One does not have to be an activist to take up an issue,"" he says./Adopting an anti-pollution diet/Shobha Gupta, a homemaker in Jungpura, feels a change in food habits can help fight affects of air pollution. In the past two weeks, she has eliminated milk from her family's menu. ""Milk products increase phlegm and add stress on the respiratory system. I make sure we eat one apple a day,"" says Gupta. ""Of late, I have also incorporated more fruits and vegetables to tackle the effects of air pollution on the body. Even hot water helps,"" she adds./And there are many like her./Dieticians believe incorporating antioxidants into one's diet builds immunity. Consuming anti-inflammatory food items such as ginger, turmeric, and tulsi, which they say can help a lot. ""Along with a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables which have antioxidants, beta carotene, Vitamin A and protein, people must also eat a lot of nuts and keep themselves hydrated,"" said Rekha Sharma, former chief dietician of the AIIMS./A government school in Rohini has been making efforts to ensure some form of vitamin C is part of students' diet. ""We had distributed amla (Indian gooseberry) among our students and made sure they ate them. We must ensure they have some sort of Vitamin C,"" says principal AK Jha./Turning to machines/It was after Diwali, when Delhi's air turned from bad to worse, that Nandini Mishra, a 34-year old manager at a toy company, decided it was time to buy an air purifier. ""I used to wake up sneezing, with and a nagging headache. I then got an air purifier. It helps me sleep peacefully,"" said Mishra, a resident of Malviya Nagar./Shops owners and e-commerce portals have registered a major increase in the demand for air purifiers and anti-pollution masks. E-commerce major Amazon said the demand for air purifiers tripled in the week post-Diwali this year. ""Between October 31 and November 3 this year, we saw a three-time spike in sales of air purifiers, as compared to the same period last year,"" said Amazon in an email response./Flipkart, another e-commerce giant which started selling air-purifiers in October last year, says it registered a 55% year-on-year growth in this category. ""Interestingly, we have noticed a pattern of consumers buying more than one air purifier for their homes,"" Flipkart says in a response to an email from HT. The company says that the demand for pollution masks too has seen a spike of 30 times since last year./Experts, however, believe air purifiers are more of a ""fad"" than a ""necessity""./Dr TK Joshi, health expert of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) task force, says even the WHO does not recommend air purifiers at homes. ""We believe masks do a better job than air purifiers because the increase in pollution is mostly due to particulate matter and gases which purifiers don't effectively trap. There's no empirical evidence that they improve an individual's well-being in the long run,"" he says./""Best way is to limit your exposure to pollution. Inside homes, activities that involve combustion such as smoking or burning incense sticks should be stopped when pollution is high,"" he says./Escaping to cleaner environs/For some, Delhi's pollution became so ""unbearable"" that they opted to go out for a few days. Prashant Arora, a businessman who lives in Gulmohar Park, left with his family on November 2 and returned on the 10th, only to find his child again struggling to breathe as the city's air quality plunged further. ""We had holiday plans around Christmas but changed our plans and left earlier,"" says Arora./According to travel website Yatra.com, the ""severe"" AQI has affected inbound travel. ""We have seen travellers rescheduling their trips to the city. Booking inquiries to Delhi have slumped since Diwali,"" says Sabina Chopra, co-founder and COO, corporate travel, Yatra.com. Chopra added the travel portal witnessed an increase in bookings - all related to travel to hill-stations from Delhi - by 17% compared to last year around this time./'Planting' fresh air/The Snake Plant, popular as the ""mother-in-law's"" tongue, Warneck Dracaena or the spider plant, Bamboo palm and Devil's Ivy are some of the plants which residents of the city are turning to for combating air pollution indoors./Anil Kumar, an employee at a nursery in Sunder Nagar, has started watching videos online to sharpen his salesman skills. ""Most people come with vague ideas, so I have to be ready for demonstrations. These days, most people want plans that can clean polluted air,"" he said./Besides, there are many organisations that are conducting workshops to make people aware on the types of plants that can be kept inside homes./One such organisation, Edible Routes, organizes workshops (it costs Rs 1,100) on indoor air-purifying plants. ""There are many reasons which turn our air putrid... Our workshops help deal with Delhi's viscous air by elaborating on how, what and which indoor air-purifying plants work best,"" reads the workshop invite./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Let's fight air pollution every day of the year,"New Delhi, Nov. 18 -- Delhi has just got out of yet another air emergency. As I write this on Sunday, the sun is shining in a blue sky. Yet, this is only an illusion of comfort. While escaping the 'severe' band of the air quality index (AQI) is a relief, the air remains very much toxic in the 'very poor', 'poor' and 'moderate' ranges./Read the health warnings on Sameer, the government's AQI app. It says 'severe' air pollution affects even ""healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases"", and warns of ""respiratory illness on prolonged exposure"" under the 'very poor' category. Likewise, 'poor' air quality can cause ""breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure"". Even on 'moderate' air quality day, ""people with lung, asthma and heart diseases can face breathing discomfort""./For some perspective about 'prolonged exposure', remember Delhi's air quality has been monitored as 'very poor' or 'severe' on 206 days in 2018, 213 in 2017 and 247 in 2016./In 2018, as HT reported last week, Delhi was exposed to pollution levels 11 times higher than what is considered safe by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This analysis, based on average PM2.5 concentration, showed that the health crisis was not limited only to pre-winter months when the pollution levels get up to 45 times as high./While the WHO recommends annual average PM 2.5 level be kept under 10 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3), India's national air quality standards set the safe annual average limit at 40 ug/m3 and a 24-hour standard of 60 ug/m3. Last year, Delhi's annual average PM 2.5 was 115 ug/m3./Our business-as-usual keeps the baseline pollution very high all through the year. During the non-winter months, Delhi sees some relatively cleaner days due to favourable weather conditions, although freak build-ups such as the dust storm in summer lead to pollution spikes./In winter, when the baseline pollution is anyway high, adverse weather conditions and seasonal factors such as stubble burning quickly push it to hazardous levels. It is only then we seem to recognise that Delhi has always been living on the edge./The Supreme Court-approved graded response action plan (Grap) is meant to be a year-long exercise to check polluting activities even when the air is ""moderately"" clean. For instance, for ""moderate to poor"" days, Grap directs municipal and road-owning agencies to stop garbage burning, impose heavy fines for non-compliance, conduct mechanised sweeping on busy streets, sprinkle water on unpaved roads every two days and stringently enforce rules for dust control in construction activities. To control vehicular emissions, it directs the transport department to stop plying of visibly polluting vehicles by impounding them or imposing heavy fines and ensure 'pollution under control' norms are followed./Unfortunately, much of this exercise has been reduced to a calendar event to be observed when winter pollution peaks.Bhure Lal, the chairperson of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, says that in many places, enforcement is lacking and even if agencies are taking action on cases of polluting activities flagged by EPCA, it is often ""after the event""./Round-the-year enforcement require massive and rapid capacity building in the municipalities, transport department and the pollution control board. The municipalities say they also require more funds to meet the operation and maintenance cost of running mechanical sweepers and sprinklers, and to repair roads and footpaths to reduce dust pollution./These logistics have to be taken care of not just in Delhi but the entire National Capital Region, which is yet to have a uniform pollution monitoring machinery. While Delhi has 37 automatic air monitoring stations, Ghaziabad and Noida have four each, Gurugram has two and Faridabad just one./Proper monitoring help in identifying pollution hot spots and the contributing factors so that agencies can work on location-specific solutions. For now, the Ghaziabad administration has conveniently blamed the location of its four stations - a gas station, a parking lot, generator sets and a waste dump - for high AQI readings./Without administrative will, even an adequate enforcement machinery cannot ensure compliance. While watchdogs such as EPCA must put their foot down in exercising the powers vested in them, citizens can also force accountability. If nothing else, report to authorities every time you spot someone fouling the air, make noise if there is no action, and, above all, stop treating air pollution as a seasonal woe./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi's dirty air carries intangible costs for a slowing economy,"India, Nov. 19 -- Flight disruptions, fewer tourists, lost work hours and missed school days have come to portray India's struggles with toxic air quality in its capital city, and the intangible costs may be adding up for an economy grappling with a sharp slowdown./India's losses from air pollution increased more than four times to $560 billion between 1990 and 2013, according to the World Bank, which attributed the economic burden to the rising costs of public health-care and workforce disruption. Pollution is now being counted among the hidden costs like repelling top corporate talent, according to analysts and industry lobby groups./""This feeds into the broader economic environment,"" said Hemant Shivakumar, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at Control Risks that advises clients on political and security risks. ""If the air pollution escalates year after year and there's no response then it's likely to send investors a different message.""/The Narendra Modi government deployed 300 field teams to curb pollution after it reached record levels earlier this month, as winds carried smoke from farm stubble burning in areas around New Delhi. Despite the measures and the state government imposing restrictions on use of private vehicles, pollution levels remain a cause for concern in the capital city of what was until recently the world's fastest-growing major economy./New Delhi's air quality index, or AQI, improved to 'poor' on Monday from 'severe' last week. A reading above 400 is classified as severe and ""affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases,"" according to the Environment Ministry./""It affects us all,"" Frank Hans Dannenberg Castellanos, the ambassador of the Dominican Republic to India and the dean of the Diplomatic Corps, was cited as saying by the Press Trust of India. ""This is a problem of major proportions to be solved"" by the city and the federal government./Pollution in the national capital could push talent to work in other cities in India or abroad, according to industry group the Associated Chambers of Commerce &#38; Industry of India./While gross domestic product growth slipped to a six-year low in the quarter ended June, air pollution adds another layer of challenge for the Modi government that's taken several steps to boost the economy, although there are no signs of a quick revival so far./""There are a number of economic detriments linked with Delhi's ongoing pollution crisis,"" said Natasha Mudhar, the chief executive of London-based business consultancy Sterling Global, and Founder of The World We Want, which is working toward achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. ""Employers in the city are finding it increasingly hard to retain top-level executives and highly skilled workers who are looking to get out of the city and away from the hazardous air.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Let's curb pollution, a silent killer, for our children's sake","India, Nov. 20 -- Last Sunday, over 3,000 people turned up in the morning to protest against the growing air pollution in Gurugram. Protests are part of our society, so it was not surprising to see people turning up in the Leisure Valley Park. But, what was surprising was the cause. Air pollution is still not a mainstream conversation in India, and therefore, expecting people to come on the streets for protest is a little unexpected. It was even more surprising that a large number of children came out demanding cleaner air./This year, students across Delhi-NCR were forced to celebrate the Children's Day at home. Schools were closed due to hazardous air quality. This is undoubtedly not the way that children would like to celebrate November 14. It comes in after a couple of pollution-related breaks that the schools got due to hazardous air quality./Air pollution is a silent killer in India, and as per the State of Global Air 2018 report, the country lost 11 lakh people due to it. But, we have still not understood the severity of the issue. Children are the worst affected due to air pollution. Therefore, it was hearting as well as sad to see children demanding cleaner air because it is they who are the worst impacted due to toxic air. How? Let me explain a little more./Impacts the birth/The impact of air pollution on children starts even before they are born. A research from Ohio, USA looking at the effects of PM2.5 exposure and childbirth found shocking results. Fine particulate matters, especially those that are less than 2.5 micrometres, also called PM2.5, pose a severe health threat. These particulate matters travel deep into the respiratory tract and deposit in the lungs causing all kinds of health issues from allergy to deadly cancer. The Ohio study found that for every 10 ug/m3 increase in pm 2.5 levels, there was a 19% increase in the chances of babies with congenital disabilities. What is also important to note is the fact that the US Environmental Protection Agency standard for particulate matter levels was 15 ug/m3. Our cities usually have PM2.5 levels in three digits. Therefore, it is not rocket science to understand the impact of such toxic air on childbirth in our country./Reduces growth &#38; development/A Southern California Children's Health Study looking at 10-year data found that kids who grew up in more polluted areas had reduced lung capacity. To make the matter worse, the lungs of these children may never recover to the full size, thus impacting them lifelong. The impact is similar to children who grew up in homes where their parents smoked. Therefore, air pollution is forced smoking for children. We also need to remember that children's lungs take time to develop. In fact, at birth, most children only have 20% of an adult's lung mass. They get full lung only when they reach their teens. The lower lung capacity makes children breathe much quickly. It means they will inhale far more air pollutants than any of the adult. Children's immune system is also not that strong, as compared to adults. Therefore, a significant amount of contaminants plus a lower immune system means children will be more likely to develop respiratory issues related to air pollution. Thus, air pollution impacts the growth and development of children./Decreases life expectancy/The WHO report - Air Pollution and Child Health: Prescribing Clean Air - revealed that the world over around six lakh children died due to air pollution. The problem is much more acute in developing countries like India as compared to the west as approximately 98% of the children breathe air that has higher levels of PM2.5 than that prescribed by the WHO. The Global Burden of Disease report of 2017 found that India loses one child every three minutes due to polluted air. The data from 1990-2017 linked air pollution as the primary reason for lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). The LRI was the second primary reason for child mortality, after neonatal disorder. In the last three decades, more than a crore of children could not live to see their 60th birthday due to LRI./Studies from around the world have shown the reducing air pollution has a positive impact on children. The Southern California study found that reducing pollution improves children's health. In Switzerland, particle pollution dropped in the 1990s due to a series of steps taken by the government. Researchers found that during the years with less pollution, the children had fewer episodes of air quality-related diseases like chronic cough, bronchitis, common cold, etc. Therefore, cleaning air does improve children's health and well being./Air pollution has far-ranging impact, be it health, productivity, quality of life, city image, etc. If these are not compelling arguments for action, then we should act for the sake of our children. Else, we will take away their fundamental right - the right to breathe./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution report: Rise in vehicles worsens Kalyan's air quality,"India, Nov. 21 -- Kalyan/Seventy per cent of air pollution in Kalyan and Dombivli is caused due to the smoke emitted by vehicles./This is what the yearly report by Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) states./The civic body has identified seven locations to study air quality every year./The prime locations are Adharwadi, Rambaug, Shivaji Chowk, Shahad Jakatnaka, and Kalyan railway station in Kalyan (West), KDMC headquarters and Phadke Road in Dombivli./The air pollution index (API) has increased at all these places in 2018-19 compared to the previous two years./""During the study, it was found that air pollution was much higher during traffic jams. The smoke released from vehicles adds to pollution. Earlier, the air quality at all these places was better,"" said a KDMC official./As per the Kalyan RTO, the vehicle count as on March 31, is 90,1514./The API at Kalyan station, Shivaji Chowk and Shahad Jakatnaka has touched 80, which is comparatively higher than other places./If the API is below 50, then the air quality is excellent; if the API is between 51 and 100, then the quality is good and API of 101-150 means it is slightly polluted./""Although the API in Kalyan and Dombivli has not crossed 100, it still is a cause of concern. The civic body should take necessary steps to ensure air quality improves next year,"" said Raju Nalawade, a social activist from Dombivli, who is working on environmental issues in the city./Motorists have been complaining about dusty roads and traffic congestion which contribute to air pollution./""Once you get stuck in traffic, engines are still running and this leads to increased pollution. The traffic situation in Kalyan and Dombivli is bad due to the ongoing infrastructure works. Sometimes the vehicles are stuck for hours,"" said Sanuj Srivatsav, 34, a commuter who takes the Kalyan-Shilphata road to got to Thane for work daily./As per Kalyan Regional Transport Authority, the number of vehicles in the city increases by at least 1 lakh every year. In 2018-19, 1,00,892 vehicles were registered. The total number of vehicle population is expected to touch 10 lakh in Kalyan RTO this year./""When vehicles are increasing, there is a need to have proper infrastructure to deal with it. With bridges shut for repairs, roads either dug-up or riddled with potholes, motorists are bound to suffer,"" said Uday Pandey, 30, a traffic warden at Kalyan railway station./Kalyan railway station, Shivaji Chowk and Shahad Jakatnaka see heavy traffic during peak hours./""The station road is congested as it is occupied with autorickshaws and hawkers making it other vehicles to move, ""added Pandey./Most roads in Kalyan and Dombivli have work going on. This has been leading to congestion in the city and worsening pollution./""There is a need to solve traffic snarls by completing projects at the earliest. Most projects are of bridges and roads which affect traffic,"" said Prateek Shinde, 39, a commuter, who drives on the busy Manpada road in Dombivli every day./Nagesh Tekale, 70, environment expert from Thane, said the authorities should start green measure such as electric vehicles./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution worsens in Capital as wind speed slows down,"India, Nov. 21 -- Levels of air pollution began inching back up again on Wednesday, re-entering the ""very poor"" category as smoke from farm fires from Punjab and Haryana drifted back in and winds speed dropped, a set of exacerbating factors that is likely to persist and potentially push the air quality into ""severe"" levels by Friday./The deterioration was expected but comes at a time when a key anti-pollution measure - the odd-even car use curbs - is no longer in force and schools have been reopened. The conditions, however, are unlikely to hit the extreme levels they had in two spells earlier this month./""We are closely monitoring the situation and may review measures on Thursday. Air quality is expected to plunge to higher end of very poor or may even touch severe for a host of unfavourable conditions and higher share of stubble burning,"" said a senior Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) official, who asked not to be named./The air quality in the national capital on Wednesday was at 301, according to the 4pm bulletin. The figure was 366 for Ghaziabad, 320 for Noida and 221 for Gurugram. By 11pm, the Delhi AQI climbed to 329./On Wednesday, a parliamentary standing committee meeting -- previously aborted due to low attendance -- met to take stock of the measures taken and possible options for reducing air pollution./According to lawmakers present in the meeting, the Centre told the panel that it wants to convert all commercial vehicles to CNG in future, replace thermal-based plants by gas-based plants and not allow industries in specified areas./The officials said that out of Rs.300 crore given for pollution control, Rs.146 crore had already been released for Delhi./Panel chairman Jagdambika Pal, who rushed back from his constituency in UP early morning to ensure the meeting took place, said ""23 MPs were present in the meeting and all agencies came to depose before the panel""./Meanwhile, a discussion on pollution went on in Lok Sabha for the second straight day, and is likely to conclude on Thursday. During the debate, the Congress accused the governments at the Centre and in Delhi of turning the national capital from the ""greenest"" to ""most polluted in the world"" in the last five years, with former Delhi Congress president Arvinder Singh Lovely alleging that the crisis was due to the inability of the Kejriwal government to scale up public transportation in the city./The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had earlier this week warned Delhi's air quality may deteriorate to ""severe"" zone on November 21-22 because of unfavourable weather conditions and a higher share of pollutants from crop stubble burning in neighbouring states./According to experts, the deterioration defies usual trends - when the air quality begins improving by the third week of November - and is caused because of a long-drawn monsoon that has delayed the harvesting of paddy./""This year because of prolonged monsoon, the (crop) stubble burning activities is still intensive. The stubble burning usually subsides completely by November 20 and all that Delhi faces is emissions from local sources. This time the continuing burning activities were made worse by the low wind speed,"" Sharma said./An analysis of pollution data published by HT on Wednesday showed that farm fires can potentially push pollution into severe zone./An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered ""poor"", 301-400 ""very poor"" and 401-500 ""severe"", with the last category dangerous for the health of vulnerable people such as children and the elderly./According to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), this November, Delhi has already seen three Western Disturbances and a fourth one is approaching on November 23. All the three WDs so far were weak and brought clouds but only scant rain, which in turn trapped pollutants./""Usually there are two to three WDs that hit Delhi during this month. However, this year, we are already looking at the fourth such activity. The past activities were not strong enough to induce rain that could have washed pollutants. The cloud cover barred sunlight and winds slowed down, said, Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC), IMD./The fourth activity, Srivastava said, is likely to be intense and rainfall is likely on November 26. Also, wind speed is likely to pick up to 20-25kmph on November 24-25./The minimum temperature recorded in the early hours of Wednesday was 11.4degC./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air crisis engulfs both Houses of Parliament,"New Delhi, Nov. 22 -- Lawmakers on Thursday agonised over the pollution crisis confronting large parts of north India, especially the Capital, and mused over potential solutions, holding a rare simultaneous discussion in both houses of Parliament even as the air outside continued to slide back to unhealthy levels after an all-too-brief respite./Members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha united across party lines to call for long-term action as they rued the human and the economic costs of a problem that has now become an annual occurrence, despite a clutch of interventions from the highest levels of the government and the courts./The debate, which began in the upper house after a calling-attention motion by ruling Bharatiya Janata Party MPs Vijay Goel and KJ Alphons, lasted nearly three hours during which members spoke about the perils of living with bad air and urged concerted efforts to fight the problem./Outside, a thick layer of haze returned and blocked out the Sun by late afternoon. The air quality index (AQI) jumped from 301 on Wednesday to 366 on Thursday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's 4pm bulletin. By Friday, the index is expected to cross 400, the threshold above which pollution is considered 'severe'./The spike in pollutants is largely believed to be a consequence of weather conditions: a lack of wind and colder night temperatures. A scientist from the Union government's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the current spike came mainly from local sources./""There was an accumulation of pollution from local sources. This means that because of low wind speed, the outlet of pollutants was not as fast as the inlet, thus the equilibrium was not maintained,"" a SAFAR scientist said./The discussion in Parliament was also divided on political lines, with some BJP members in the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha accusing Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his administration of not taking adequate steps./Members of Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said the blame lay with the Union government, which had not done enough to tackle the problem of farm fires in neighbouring states./Despite a request made by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to all MPs to be present in the House during the discussion on air pollution, a majority of the MPs did not attend the session./In Lok Sabha, where the discussion has been on since Tuesday, BJP member Sanjay Jaiswal said pollution in Delhi had peaked since Wednesday after winds slowed down. ""We blame the farmers when the fault is ours,"" he said, prompting a reaction from AAP member Bhagwant Mann./Mann, who represents the Sangrur constituency in Punjab, said the BJP-led Union government must do more to help paddy farmers manage the stubble left behind after the harvest. ""Why give MSP (minimum support price) for crops that produce stubble? More the rice production, more stubble produced. Provide us more funds, we will opt for substitute crops,"" he said./The MP's reference was to the price guarantee offered on rice, which experts have said is a factor in farmers mostly opting to grow paddy. In Rajya Sabha, AAP leader Sanjay Singh listed measures such as curbs on polluting industries to defend the Delhi government's initiatives in tackling the problem./BJP's Goel and Alphons targeted Singh's party for, what they said, were a lack of interventions by the Delhi administration./Venkaiah Naidu restrained Goel from attacking the Delhi CM, saying he couldn't be named since he was not a member of the House, and advised him not to display items such as pollution masks that the MP sought to use while criticising the AAP leader./Following the exchange of blame, minister Javadekar told members that a frenzied approach to the problem will not work and there was a need for systematic and scientific solution. ""We need to look upon some issue rising above party level and have to prepare common minimum agenda,"" he said./Other members too largely backed calls for more long-term solutions./""After and before Diwali the debate on the issue peaks up. But, it is a national issue, a perennial issue. It's a perennial problem we must solve together I would urge to work so that we can give our children a decent air to breathe,"" said Congress's Shashi Tharoor in Lok Sabha./""Many foreigners are scared to even come to Delhi. Foreigners have a choice, but Indians and Delhiites don't. Bringing up children in Delhi is a crime against our children,"" he added./In the Rajya Sabha, Tharoor's party colleague Ghulam Nabi Azad urged the Centre to convene a meeting of all chief ministers with the Prime Minister to discuss solutions./Nationalist Congress Party's Vandana Chavan said the problem stretches beyond Delhi. ""India is home to 14 most polluted cities in the world..."" she said./BJP's Alphons also referred to Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has campaigned for more focus on the climate emergency./""In September, a 16-year-old girl thundered at the United Nations; 'how dare you'. These words by Greta Thunberg, I feel, were addressed to each one of us even in this House,"" he said./Trinamool MP Mala Roy raised the issue of plastic pollution in the country and said Centre's campaigns on the making India free of single-use plastics was ""far from reality"". ""The ministry should encourage alternatives like glass, wax coated cloth, wood, bamboo and earthen pots which would not only be eco-friendly but also address the need of common people,"" said Roy./Parliamentarians from the Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Apna Dal and Biju Janata Dal too spoke on the issue, with several of them urging the government to find a solution to the farm fire problem./Farmers in Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh set fire to remnants of crops after harvesting, a practice meant to cut costs and save time./Javadekar separately tabled a report that said levels of pollution had gone down in Delhi over recent years and enumerated the measures taken by the Union government to curtail pollution. He is expected to file his reply on the debate in Lok Sabha on Friday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

A scientist from the Union government's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the current spike came mainly from local sources./""There was an accumulation of pollution from local sources. This means that because of low wind speed, the outlet of pollutants was not as fast as the inlet, thus the equilibrium was not maintained,"" a SAFAR scientist said./The discussion in Parliament was also divided on political lines, with some BJP members in the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha accusing Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his administration of not taking adequate steps./Members of Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said the blame lay with the Union government, which had not done enough to tackle the problem of farm fires in neighbouring states./Despite a request made by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to all MPs to be present in the House during the discussion on air pollution, a majority of the MPs did not attend the session./In Lok Sabha, where the discussion has been on since Tuesday, BJP member Sanjay Jaiswal said pollution in Delhi had peaked since Wednesday after winds slowed down. ""We blame the farmers when the fault is ours,"" he said, prompting a reaction from AAP member Bhagwant Mann./Mann, who represents the Sangrur constituency in Punjab, said the BJP-led Union government must do more to help paddy farmers manage the stubble left behind after the harvest. ""Why give MSP (minimum support price) for crops that produce stubble? More the rice production, more stubble produced. Provide us more funds, we will opt for substitute crops,"" he said./The MP's reference was to the price guarantee offered on rice, which experts have said is a factor in farmers mostly opting to grow paddy. In Rajya Sabha, AAP leader Sanjay Singh listed measures such as curbs on polluting industries to defend the Delhi government's initiatives in tackling the problem./BJP's Goel and Alphons targeted Singh's party for, what they said, were a lack of interventions by the Delhi administration./Venkaiah Naidu restrained Goel from attacking the Delhi CM, saying he couldn't be named since he was not a member of the House, and advised him not to display items such as pollution masks that the MP sought to use while criticising the AAP leader./Following the exchange of blame, minister Javadekar told members that a frenzied approach to the problem will not work and there was a need for systematic and scientific solution. ""We need to look upon some issue rising above party level and have to prepare common minimum agenda,"" he said./Other members too largely backed calls for more long-term solutions./""After and before Diwali the debate on the issue peaks up. But, it is a national issue, a perennial issue. It's a perennial problem we must solve together I would urge to work so that we can give our children a decent air to breathe,"" said Congress's Shashi Tharoor in Lok Sabha./""Many foreigners are scared to even come to Delhi. Foreigners have a choice, but Indians and Delhiites don't. Bringing up children in Delhi is a crime against our children,"" he added./In the Rajya Sabha, Tharoor's party colleague Ghulam Nabi Azad urged the Centre to convene a meeting of all chief ministers with the Prime Minister to discuss solutions./Nationalist Congress Party's Vandana Chavan said the problem stretches beyond Delhi. ""India is home to 14 most polluted cities in the world..."" she said./BJP's Alphons also referred to Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has campaigned for more focus on the climate emergency./""In September, a 16-year-old girl thundered at the United Nations; 'how dare you'. These words by Greta Thunberg, I feel, were addressed to each one of us even in this House,"" he said./Trinamool MP Mala Roy raised the issue of plastic pollution in the country and said Centre's campaigns on the making India free of single-use plastics was ""far from reality"". ""The ministry should encourage alternatives like glass, wax coated cloth, wood, bamboo and earthen pots which would not only be eco-friendly but also address the need of common people,"" said Roy./Parliamentarians from the Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Apna Dal and Biju Janata Dal too spoke on the issue, with several of them urging the government to find a solution to the farm fire problem./Farmers in Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh set fire to remnants of crops after harvesting, a practice meant to cut costs and save time./Javadekar separately tabled a report that said levels of pollution had gone down in Delhi over recent years and enumerated the measures taken by the Union government to curtail pollution. He is expected to file his reply on the debate in Lok Sabha on Friday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

3 in 4 Indian adolescents not active enough: Study,"India, Nov. 23 -- Three in four adolescents and teens in India are not getting the one hour of daily exercise prescribed for optimal health, but they are still far more active than 11-17 year olds in the rest of the world, according to a new study./Globally, 81% of those surveyed were insufficiently physically active in 2016, with boys more active than girls. Around 77.6% boys were inactive, compared to 84.7% girls./In India, 73.9% children got ""insufficient physical activity"" in 2016, increasing their chances of being obese and developing heart disease, diabetes and mental health problems, including depression, according to a World Health Organisation analysis of 1.6 million students across 146 countries./Inactivity was the lowest in Bangladesh (66.1%), followed by Ireland (71.8%) and the United States (72%), and the highest in South Korea (94.2%), the Philippines (93.4%), and Cambodia (91.6%), according to the study published in The Lancet./Activity levels among the surveyed group has increased in India since 2010, when 76.6% of 11-17 year olds were inactive, but they still need more exercise and outdoor play./Successive studies in India have shown students in government schools have lower obesity levels than those going to private schools. ""An ongoing study being done by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on sleep apnea, a sleep disorder associated with obesity, screened school students in Delhi for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure, and found obesity rates much higher in private schools, where children come from more affluent families. An analysis of data show they have higher screen time (on smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, laptops and television), lower physical activity and more access to junk food than children from the lower socio-economic strata,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences./""With rising air pollution, urbanisation and increasing access to mobile phones keeping students indoors, inactivity will increase in the coming decades, and with it, non communicable diseases (NCDs),"" said Dr Guleria./NCDs, which include heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers, account for 60% of all deaths in India, killing more people than infectious diseases./""It's imperative to provide children a supportive environment for recreation, at home, in the neighbourhood, in school, and even while going to school. We need green parks and urban forests within a 0.5km radius, adequate playgrounds in schools and pavements as wide as the road to encourage play and walking, which will decrease pollution levels as a co-benefit,"" said Shifalika Goenka, head, department of social and behavioural sciences, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India and commissioner, Lancet Obesity Commission./The study found no clear pattern according to country income group. In low income countries, 84.9% of those surveyed got insufficient physical activity; this proportion was 79.3% in lower-middle-income countries, 83.9% in upper-middle-income countries, and 79.4% in high-income countries./WHO launched a new global action on physical activity called 'More Active People for a Healthier World' with the goal of 15% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity across ages by 2030./""All schools must have a dedicated time for all-inclusive sports, play and dance for everyone. The Central Board of Secondary Education already has a policy, but it needs more support,"" said Goenka./Walking and cycling, sport, physical education, or unstructured activity during leisure hours needs to be encouraged across ages, experts said./""Physical inactivity is a great leveller, it affects all countries. In India, people need to be more active than other populations because of our terrible metabolism. If physical activity is increased from schools, a substantial decrease in diabetes and heart disease could be achieved. It has to be done aggressively and time to begin is now,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-DOC hospital for diabetes and allied sciences, New Delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Eco-anxiety effects may not be as visible as those of disasters, but are just as critical","New Delhi, Nov. 24 -- Oxford Dictionaries declared ""climate emergency"" as the 2019 word of the year, following a hundred-fold increase in its usage. Another term that made the shortlist but not the cut was ""eco-anxiety"", which is defined as a feeling of chronic helplessness, depression, fear, fatalism and resignation to the impending environmental catastrophe./Unlike the documented mental health fallout of disasters such as droughts, floods and earthquakes, which lead to panic attacks, post traumatic stress disorder and increased suicide ideation and suicides - such as among farmers during sustained drought - chronic stress and despair from less extreme events like air pollution is less recognised despite becoming a visible affliction in many developing countries, such as India and China./""The chronic effect of eco-anxiety is not as visible as acute ecological emergencies like earthquakes and droughts, but they are documented to affect mental health, leading to fear, anger, frustration, despair, guilt and exhaustion from feelings of powerlessness, helplessness and inability to make a difference,"" said Dr Samir Parikh, director of mental health and behavioural sciences at Fortis Hospitals, who is getting an increasing number of children and parents across his centres in north India with air pollution-related anxieties./""Parents are among the hardest hit because they worry about the planet they are leaving their children and future generations,"" said Dr Parikh./One such parent is New Delhi-resident Komal Singh, who tracks the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi-NCR obsessively and keeps her seven-year-old daughter Shreya home from school on days it hovers close to 300, after which the air quality enters the 'severe' zone./Aside from the days schools were closed during Delhi's air emergency, Shreya has missed close to two weeks of school since October. Singh's toddler Samvit, 3, stays cocooned all day at home, which reverberates with the hum of half a dozen air-purifiers./""The air is so foul, what do you do? I've had to stop Shreya's tennis lessons. In other countries, schools are shut when the AQI reading touches 200 ('poor' category), but if I do that, my kids won't get an education. All the other parents in her school also keep children indoors,"" said Singh, 41, who is considering moving out of Delhi with her family./Eco-anxiety is adding to childhood and teen inactivity in north India and leading to increased physical isolation, obesity and over-dependence on social media and digital devices, such as smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, laptops and television./Three in four 11-17 year olds are not getting the one hour of daily exercise needed, which raises their chances of developing, obesity, heart disease, diabetes and mental health problems, including depression, according to a new World Health Organisation study of 1.6 million students in 146 countries released on Friday./""With rising air pollution, urbanisation and increasing access to mobile technology keeping students indoors, inactivity will increase in the coming decades, and with it, non communicable diseases (NCDs) will go up,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, on Friday./Non communicable diseases, which include heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers, account for 60% of all deaths in India, killing more people than all infectious diseases and injuries put together./""You have to balance things out as outdoor activities are good for children, but unhealthy air is not. When you have high levels of air pollution, outdoor physical activity should be restricted. You should wait for the sun come out and to at least for the pollutants to rise up,"" said Dr Guleria./The health benefits of outdoor activity are not affected by air pollution provided very vigorous exercise is avoided on bad air days, found a study from China, which is among the few places in the world with air toxicity peaks comparable with cities in Indo-Gangetic plains. It was published int he Journal of Epidemiology in September./Another study from China published in The Journal of Paediatrics recommended schools plan and adjust the intensity of outdoor physical activity on the basis of the current air pollution levels and children be asked to stop physical activity if they start coughing, wheezing or experience chest tightness./Children must be offered a supportive urban environment for play, including green spaces, parks and urban forests (&#38;gt;0.3 hectares) within a 0.5 km radius, and pavements free of encroachment for walking. That, coupled with schools adopting flexible timetables to plan for unstructured activity, sport, athletics and other activities on clean air days and keep indoor study for days when air quality deteriorates, will help children get the physical activity they need to stay healthy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

It's time for a democratic demand for clean air,"New Delhi, Nov. 24 -- Last Thursday, Members of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha, which is currently in session, debated air pollution. Besides the National Capital Region, which continues to suffer many days of severe air pollution, large swathes of the Indo-Gangetic plain are affected too. An MP from Maharashtra complained that even in a city like Pune, the air quality index in Hinjewadi (a major Information Technology hub) was over 400. Delhi has implemented another round of the Odd-Even scheme although claims that air pollution has significantly abated are unverifiable because of data gaps. That elected representatives are choosing to raise the issue shows that creating a democratic demand for clean air is beginning to find salience./Air pollution affects our health (there were 1.24 million related deaths in 2017) as well as economic growth. Using a 2013 World Bank estimate that the health cost of air pollution is 3% of the GDP, this amounts up to $80 billion as of 2018. Rather than being the engines of growth, our cities have become unliveable. However, change is possible. Our research suggests that 80% of India can breathe clean air if we adopted strong pollution controls. So, for a better tomorrow, here is my vision for India: By 2027 when India turns 80 as an independent nation, let us aim to reduce air pollution by 80% in 80 cities across India. Let's call it Mission 80-80-80./Air quality will not improve overnight. We need sustained and prioritised effort. After London's great smog in 1952, it took until the 1980s for smoke control programmes to be completed.Recently, London launched the ultra-low emission zone initiative to massively reduce vehicular emissions. The US Clean Air Act (1970), in part, responded to infamous air quality in Los Angeles. Interventions have been evolving for half a century even as LA experienced 145 days of unhealthy air in 2017. China got serious about air pollution from 2015./When air quality worsens in the NCR, a graded response action plan kicks in. The National Clean Air Programme lists 134 actions to reduce particulate matter by 20%-30% in 122 cities by 2024. These are good starts but have three limitations: they are not year-round solutions, the actions have not been prioritised, and they are not ambitious enough./To fulfil Mission 80-80-80, we need action at three levels: planning, enforcement, and political. Solutions have to be tailor made for sector-specific sources of pollution: vehicles, road and construction dust, industries, urban waste, and agricultural residue. Actions must be sequenced into what should be done immediately and what could unfold over the short, medium and long run./First, air quality plans must be developed at an airshed level. Air pollution does not respect administrative boundaries.Airsheds are areas where topography and meteorology impact the concentration of pollutants. We need regional airshed management authorities with powers to coordinate across jurisdictions. An airshed approach would help to prioritise regions needing urgent attention as well as increase the likelihood that sectoral interventions (say, regulating vehicular emissions) would succeed./A national airshed management authority could monitor overall progress and help reduce capacity and resource constraints for regional agencies and interventions./Secondly, enforcement remains weak without active monitoring and emergency response. An immediate priority is to create Pollution Control Rooms (PCRs) and Rapid Response Teams. Citizens should be able to call into the PCRs and report on flagrant violations, say construction waste disposal or industries that are found flouting pollution control norms. Another immediate action is to clamp down on open burning of urban waste. Of moderate difficulty are measures such as dust suppression systems at construction sites or ensuring that power plants are retrofitted with pollution control technologies. Similarly, more effort is needed for awareness and training programmes on in-situ crop residue management to reduce stubble burning./The hardest goal to achieve is continuous political engagement. A multi-party political process must recognise that air pollution is a national, not a city specific problem and is costing us lives and livelihoods. Then we can have a serious debate on reforming agricultural pricing, so that farmers can shift away from cultivating paddy in Punjab and Haryana, whose stubble is then burnt. Political consensus is needed to implement new parking rules, impose congestion pricing or pay for major increase in public transport infrastructure in cities./Finally, the vision and strategy for Mission 80-80-80 needs to be communicated to the public. The haplessness of citizens betrays a trust deficit that can be plugged if bureaucrats, enforcement agencies and political leaders periodically outline steps taken, impact expected, future measures, and what citizens can do to help./Air pollution is a wicked problem but not insolvable. It's time to breathe deep and begin./Dr Arunabha Ghosh is CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, and a TED Talk speaker.The views expressed are personal./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India can win the war against air pollution | Opinion,"India, Nov. 24 -- In 2015, Chai Jing, a journalist, produced a documentary, Under the Dome, on the pollution in China, largely driven by the concern about her little daughter's health. It went viral. At first, the Chinese government applauded it, but then got scared of how it was galvanising the public. Within a week, it was banned in China./However, the Chinese government understood the depth of public anger at the poor air quality. The then premier, Li Keqiang, declared a war against pollution. The China Clean Air Plan was made, which set a clear goal of reducing average annual PM 2.5 level to less than 50 by 2018./It had action steps, timelines, and resources were committed to achieving this goal. Air quality in Beijing and other cities improved, and the goal was achieved in 2018. China has now announced a follow up three-year plan to restore blue skies, and further reduce air pollution to reach WHO health standards./As China declared a war on air pollution, air pollution declared a war on India. By 2016, New Delhi became the most polluted capital in the world. Air quality in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), and most cities in north India, is alarmingly poor./We have a heath emergency in which the children, the elderly, and the poor are most at risk. More than half of lung cancer patients in Delhi are non-smokers and suffer due to air pollution. Amitava Ghosh, in his book, The Great Derangement, points out the serious risks to our coastal cities like Mumbai and Chennai from the climate crisis./But with concerted effort, air quality can improve, as has happened in other cities./The political leadership has to take the first step, recognise the gravity of the situation, and declare a war on air pollution. It must then provide for financial outlay of whatever it takes to restore blue skies. There must be clear goals, like setting a target of an average annual PM 2.5 level of 60 or less by 2025, and 30 or less by 2030 from the current levels of 120, in Delhi/NCR and other cities./But to achieve this goal, it is important to appoint a clear functioning authority, led by an individual respected across the political spectrum, with a proven track record of delivering on goals, such as Nandan Nilekani orE Sreedharan. This authority should then be vested with a specific mandate of improving air quality, provided adequate resources, and given the power to operate across states, multiple levels of government, departments, businesses, and the agricultural and the scientific communities. It should also be able to work with public, particularly young people, and encourage them to change their lifestyles ./This authority, then, can pursue a multi-pronged approach to tackle the issue. Here are ten possible steps./One, reduce coal consumption by increasing the current cess of ~400 per ton by 10% every year, and ensure financial incentives to coal-based power plants to bring down their emissions as per legal standards or convert to gas as fuel./Two, tax coal-based thermal power by ~2 per unit and provide these funds as subsidies to wind and solar power plants. Ensure that these renewable plants get priority of off take and payment over thermal plants./Three, tax all internal combustion two/ three wheelers and cars, and achieve electric vehicle targets set by the Niti Aayog. Limit the number of vehicles by restricting new licenses through high fees, or auctions or lottery. In China, all three are being tried./Four, impose additional taxes on petrol and diesel, gradually increase it, and use these funds to improve public transportation. Gradually, withdraw diesel buses and implement a plan to procure 100,000 electric buses and another 100,000 electric minibuses. This will reduce unit cost of these buses substantially./Five, reduce acreage under rice cultivation in Punjab and Haryana significantly by providing subsidies to farmers for switching to other crops. It will also raise the water table and improve soil quality./Six, reduce industrial emissions by reducing use of coal and converting to gas where feasible. There should be a particularly focus on industries like brick kilns, steel, cement, among others. Companies must have the goal of becoming carbon-neutral./Seven, improve indoor air quality in schools, colleges, hospitals, homes, offices, and public places./Eight, municipal governments should maintain pavements for pedestrians, bicycle lanes, have more plants and trees, and reduce road and construction dust./Nine, engage with the public, particularly children, to promote change in lifestyles, for instance, walking or using bicycle, and reducing electric consumption./And, finally, increase the monitoring of air quality by state governments by installing a network of monitors and satellite measurements./A clear political vision, the setting up of an all-powerful authority, and the implementation of these measures could help Delhi reverse the tide - and win the war against air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
