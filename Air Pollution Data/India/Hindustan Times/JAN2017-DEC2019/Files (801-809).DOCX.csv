New less polluting fogging technique being considered by municipal bodies,"New Delhi, Nov. 28 -- In view of the heavy pollution caused by conventional fogging mosquito control techniques that uses diesel as solvent for insecticides, Delhi's municipal bodies are considering a new device called Ultra Low Volume (ULV) that uses water instead./Insecticides are poisonous to humans and thus have to be diluted in a solvent before spraying. Conventional techniques uses a mixture that is 95% diesel and 5% insecticide. The new technique will have similar ratios but with water replacing diesel.Neither would it have the signature ""fog"" that the diesel-based spraying machines leave behind./According to municipal officials, they had thought about deploying ULV device earlier too. But one of the things that stopped them was public perception./""Diesel-based fogging causes fumes, the fog that the people see after spraying, which leads to public satisfaction that the municipalities are doing something to protect them,"" said Dr. Pramod Verma, Deputy Health Officer of the North Municipal Corporation of Delhi. ""Often, fogging is a tool for political leaders to appease residents of their constituency though we are aware that diesel fogging is not 100% effective outdoors. However, ULVs only create a 'water mist' which is invisible, and hence does not create that positive psychological effect that people seek,"" he explained./The ULV machine is extensively used in the United States, and the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme of India, which advises municipalities across the country on medicines and techniques to use for mosquito control, also allows it, municipal officials said./""At least 95% of the mixture in conventional fogging devices is diesel and only 5% is the insecticide - malathion or cyphenothrin, compounds which kill adult mosquitoes on contact,"" said a senior public health official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), who requested to be named. ""When this mixture is heated at temperatures like 700 C and sprayed at high pressure, the diesel turns into vapours and cause air pollution""/SDMC councillor and standing committee member, Narender Kumar, also recently recommended it in a meeting of the corporation. ""We are aware how severe Delhi's air pollution situation is right now. If we have an option like ULVs, which does not use diesel, we must explore it,"" Kumar said at the meeting./Other municipal officials, though, pointed out issues with ULV which have been forbidding the technology, though, it has existed for several years now. Another issue with ULVs is that they do well in colder climates, like in USA, where the suspended water droplets don't evaporate quickly and stay afloat in the air to kill mosquitoes. ""In temperate countries like ours, the water dries up quickly, so more insecticide has to be added per litre of water for it to be effective,"" Dr Somashekhar of east Delhi municipality./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Sydney smothered with bushfire smoke, AQI over 12 times worse than 'hazardous'","India, Dec. 11 -- Bushfire smoke smothered Sydney on Tuesday, setting off fire alarms, suspending ferry services and triggering health warnings over choking air pollution./The Sydney Opera House and harbor bridge were barely discernible through the thick haze enveloping the city, with smoke stinging the eyes and making it difficult to breathe./The Air Quality Index compiled by the state environment department reached as high as 2,552 in some eastern suburbs -- soaring past the ""hazardous"" threshold of 200. The pollution has been so bad it has set off smoke alarms in office buildings across the CBD, while ash has been washing up on the city's usually pristine beaches. Flight arrivals at Sydney Airport were delayed by up to 30 minutes due to poor visibility./The number of people seeking treatment at Sydney hospitals increased by about 25%, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. cited Richard Broome, New South Wales state's director of environmental heath, as saying. ""It is some of the worst air quality we've seen,"" he said./Authorities warned people with respiratory conditions, or heart and lung problems, to stay indoors. Office workers were seen wearing face masks in the street, an unusual sight in a city more used to clear blue skies and clean air./Temperatures are forecast to soar to 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in the city's west. Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, who is leading efforts to tackle more than 80 blazes across the state of New South Wales, said it would be a ""very complex, very difficult day"" for his team./Some 2.7 million hectares (6.7 million acres) of land, with a perimeter of 19,235 kilometers, have been burnt so far this bushfire season./The ferocious and early start to the fires this year has stoked a debate around whether Australia's government -- a champion of the coal industry -- is doing enough to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has repeatedly shut down claims that his government's approach to climate change has contributed in any material way to the current bushfire emergency./The devastating fire conditions were referenced several times at an energy summit in Sydney on Tuesday, where Matt Kean, the NSW state minister for the environment, said a transition to clean energy was inevitable./""Let's call it for what it is: these bushfires have been caused by extreme weather events, high temperatures, the worst drought in living memory -- the exact type of events scientists have been warning us about for decades that would have been caused by climate change,"" said Kean./The wildfires have generated more hotspots in the past two days than any other country, according to NASA satellite data./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air quality falls across north India,"India, Dec. 12 -- The air quality across north India deteriorated on Thursday, following a sudden fall in temperature, with Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh the most polluted across 102 cities monitored by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), as winds from the north and west brought pollutants towards the northern plains./Experts said that the high base level in the region led to the air quality being in the ""severe"" category./According to CPCB 4pm buletin, AQI in Ghaziabad on Thursday was 436, in Lucknow 320, and in Kanpur 400. In several parts of western Uttar Pradesh and south Haryana, including Gurugram, Rohtak, Sonipat and Panipat, the AQI was over 400./""Pollution levels are high in December because of the drop in temperature and increase in local biomass burning due to the cold weather,"" said a senior CPCB official, who asked not to be named. Air quality was likely to remain in the ""severe"" zone over the next 24 hours, he said./Since the first week of October, air quality in the northern region hovered between ""poor"" and ""severe"". Till November 20, stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana were said to be the reasons for high air pollutions levels. A sudden dip in temperature, low wind speed, and high humidity were said to be the main reasons for the rapid accumulation of pollutants from local sources. Low temperature and high humidity lead to the formation of mist, haze and shallow fog, which blend with pollutants, and cause air pollution./Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said only light winds were blowing over the Indo-Gangetic plains for the past few days. ""Dust, vehicular and industrial emissions remain suspended near the ground in the absence of favourable wind speed,"" he said./According to data from the UP Pollution Control Board, Lucknow did not have a single day of ""satisfactory"" or ""moderate"" -- below 100 AQI -- air quality since Diwali./Chief minister Yogi Adityananth on November 1 directed the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board to prevent stubble burning and check other factors contributing to air pollution. On Thursday, state agriculture minister Surya Pratab Shahi said 4,871 incidents of stubble burning were been reported across the state and close to 1,867 first information reports (FIRs) were lodged./In Bihar, where Patna witnessed its worst air quality in decades with AQI touching close to 490 in the first week of November, the government ordered the closing of polluting industries and banned running of vehicles older than 15 years. Diesel autos in municipal areas of Patna will be banned by January 31, 2021, and in other urban pockets such as Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwari Sharif by March 31 the same year, said an official of the state pollution control board on condition of anonymity./On Thursday, environmental advocacy organizations requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare a national health emergency with pollution levels in north India rising at an alarming rate over the last two days./""Almost all of north India, from West Bengal to Punjab, is reeling under severe air pollution, almost verging on 'hazardous'. This is causing irreversible health harm to every single resident of these areas,"" according to The Clean Air Collective, a network of organisations, citizens groups and institutions. ""We request the Prime Minister and all state governments to declare a national health emergency, enforce existing laws on trash and biomass burning strictly, and focus on controlling emissions arising from all sources urgently,"" it said in a statement./(With inputs from Patna and Lucknow)/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pneumonia deaths in children below five rose by 29.7% in 3 yrs: Govt data for Maharashtra,"Mumbai, Dec. 13 -- Pneumonia deaths among children under five years of age in Maharashtra increased by 29.7% in three years, revealed data from the state public health department. A total of 2,781 children succumbed to the acute respiratory infection from 2016-17 to 2018-19./Government officials attributed the rise in numbers to better reporting from the state's rural districts. Doctors, however, said that, in addition to partial immunisation, factors such as malnutrition owing to poverty and air pollution (especially indoors) are responsible for pneumonia deaths among children. According to officials, two to three children (under age of five) died every day from lung inflammation./In 2016-17, 781 children succumbed to the lung disease, which rose to 987 in 2017-18. This number increased to 1,013 in 2018-19./The data comes at a time when the state has directed that funds be released for vaccinating children against pneumonia at Palghar, Nashik and Gadchiroli./""As pneumonia symptoms are almost similar to that of general flu, families often reach hospitals when the child's condition is critical,"" said an official./""However, reporting of such cases has increased across the state even at community and public health centres owing to rising awareness among citizens and doctors,"" added the official./According to the latest United Nations (UN) report, India had the second-highest number of child-mortality cases due to pneumonia after Nigeria in 2018. According to a study, Fighting For Breath in India, conducted by Save the Children, UNICEF, pneumonia killed more than 1,27,000 under-five years of age children across the country in 2018./""There are different forms of pneumonia. During viral infections, patients generally get better and antibiotics are adequate for bacterial infections. In cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, patients are administered maximum antibiotic dose as the organisms found only in hospital environments display greater resistance to low dosage,"" said Dr Pallavi Saple, paediatrician and dean of JJ hospital./Doctors said lack of knowledge about pneumococcal vaccines that protects children against the infection is a stumbling block for the state to attain 100% vaccination. ""There is a strong association between pneumonia deaths among children and poverty. The only way one can save children, and especially those suffering from malnutrition, is through vaccination. Awareness needs to be raised through various campaigns, drives, and activities,"" said Dr Behram Pardiwala, internal medicine expert, Wockhardt Hospital, South Mumbai./Rising pollution levels also make children more vulnerable to the deadly infection. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every year almost 3.8 million people die prematurely owing to household air pollution, of which 45% is attributed to pneumonia./Dr Randeep Guleria, leading pulmonologist and director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi said, ""Long-term exposure of air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter) affects the pulmonary alveoli, which can become an additional factor in the development of pneumonia.""/Dr Vikrant Shah, consulting physician, intensivist and infectious-disease specialist, Zen Multispeciality Hospital, Chembur, said, ""Around half of all pneumonia-related deaths are associated with air pollution. Environmental factors have a substantial impact on the pulmonary system. Children with lesser immunity develop community-acquired pneumonia, which also adds to their comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.""/Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory lung infection that occurs due to bacteria, virus, and fungi. Children under five years and senior citizens (over 65 years) are most susceptible to the infection./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Kejriwal: Delhi will be pollution-free in the next five years if AAP returns,"New Delhi, Dec. 31 -- Addressing his third town hall meeting, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said his government would make Delhi free of air pollution in another five years if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is voted to power again./As part of its ongoing campaign for the upcoming Delhi polls, AAP is organising seven such town halls between December 26 and January 7 - one in each of Delhi's seven Lok Sabha constituencies. All of them are to be addressed by Kejriwal. These meeting comprise discussions on the party's ""report card"" released earlier this month, followed by question-and-answer sessions./""Pollution decreased by 25% in the last five years; we aim to make Delhi pollution-free in the next five years,"" said Kejriwal, who is also AAP's national convener, at Monday's town hall in north-east Delhi's Durgapuri./The CM was responding to a person who asked him how long Delhi residents would have to continue wearing anti-pollution masks in winters./The event, organised in an open area with a makeshift tent, was attended by around 1,000 people comprising men, women, students, businessmen, young professionals and elderly residents./""Delhi has seen immense development in terms of industrial and technical growth but despite that pollution has decreased by 25% in the last five years. Earlier, power cut was a major issue and around 6 lakh generators were used. There are no power cuts and generators are not in use, which reduced smoke and pollution,"" he said./He said, ""Secondly, we have carried out tree plantation on around 1,100 acres of land across Delhi, which has majorly decreased pollution in the city. Third, The Centre has constructed the East-West Peripheral Highway, which has reduced the number of trucks and goods carriers bypassing Delhi at nights. This has led to reduced pollution levels in the city. Through your support, we aim to make Delhi pollution-free in the next five years.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
