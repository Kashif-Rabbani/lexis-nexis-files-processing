HSPCB demands action report in four days,"Gurgaon, Nov. 8 -- Nothing wakes up state agencies like an emergency, and so it was on Tuesday when the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) told all departments and authorities concerned to submit within four days a report on action taken./""On Tuesday, we asked all civic bodies to submit within four days what action they have taken so far to combat air pollution in the city. Once we receive the plan, we will review it and further action plan will be framed out of it,"" JB Sharma, regional officer, HSPCB, said./City's air quality has been deteriorating since Diwali. On October 11, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) had asked all stakeholders to implement a graded response action plan (GRAP) in all districts of NCR to combat air pollution./On October 31, again, the HSPCB had told the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG), Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), resident welfare associations (RWAS), traffic police to submit the details of action taken by the authorities./The MCG and NHAI sprinkled water at on-going road project sites and covered them with cloth to keep construction dust from flying. The civic body and state pollution control board also formed teams that checked garbage burning in neighbourhoods, and clamped down on polluting industries and factories./Despite these measures the city's air quality has been worsened in the past few days. The air quality index (AQI) recorded by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) jumped to 368 on Tuesday against 331 on Monday./Experts attribute the worsening air quality to low wind speed of 0.66 m/s, dip in temperature and stubble burning across Delhi-ncr. The smog create by stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab resulted in the death of four people in a road accident on Monday./Experts were of opinion that the condition of air quality can improve only if the government and residents work together to bring in changes./""The smoke from waste burning and diesel generators mix with fog to make the air toxic. The wind flow is low and is adding to the problem,"" Shakti Singh, environmental engineer at HSPCB, said./Nagarro CEO Manas Fuloria, who is also chairperson of NASSCOM'S regional council for Haryana, said, ""The diesel autos and gen-sets should be banned in Gurgaon.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

DELHI GASPS FOR BREATH,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 -- The National Capital Region was engulfed in a toxic haze on Tuesday, with the worst pollution levels this season reducing visibility, disrupting flights and trains, and forcing the Delhi government and central authorities to announce a slew of emergency measures to minimise health hazards./A sharp drop in temperature, coupled with low wind speeds aggravated by high relative humidity, sent the average daily air quality index (AQI) to 448 - worse than the post-Diwali haze that had pushed the reading up to 403 for a day on October 20. Relief is not likely soon, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) warned, predicting similar conditions for the next two to three days./Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal described the city as a ""gas chamber"" and his government ordered the closure of all primary schools on Wednesday, while restricting the outdoor activities of senior students. Junior classes will remain closed for longer if the air quality doesn't improve, the government said./The EPCA-a Supreme-court appointed pollution control panel with sweeping powers - announced a fourfold hike in parking fees across NCR, and asked the Metro rail corporation to reduce fares during off-peak hours. It also asked the government to prepare for the odd-even road rationing scheme, which will be implemented if the air quality index breaches the ""severe-plus"" zone of 500 for 48 hours as per the Graded Response Action Plan./When contacted, civic agencies said implementing the increased parking fee hike would require other approvals and may take some time. Metro officials, too, said slashing ticket prices would be difficult as they had to be referred to the fare fixation committee. But EPCA member Sunita Narain contended that the authorities did not have a choice as all orders of the panel are legally binding./The haze that started settling on Monday night brought down visibility to 200m by 5.30am on Tuesday./The CPCB insisted that what Delhi was experiencing was ""fog"", because the sulphur dioxide level in the air was not high enough for it to be classified as ""smog""./""Currently, Delhi and its neighbouring region are seeing almost still conditions at the ground level, but in the upper atmosphere, there are two wind masses - one from Punjab bringing pollutants and the other from eastern UP bringing moisture. These are colliding at higher altitudes, leading to moisture and pollution in the air but no wind at the ground level,"" said A Sudhakar, member secretary, CPCB./The Indian Medical Association (IMA) issued a stern warning on potential health hazards, describing New Delhi as a ""public health emergency state"". This was primarily because the suspended particulate matter in the air was at ""hazardous"" levels through the day across all monitoring stations./In 2016, the air pollution in Delhi was the worst on record, and the city had experienced its thickest smog in 17 years, with the average AQI hitting a peak of 497./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi can't breathe and it's not over yet,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 -- As the air quality across Delhi and its neighbouring areas deteriorated to post-Diwali levels, hitting the severe zone after a gap of 18 days, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) identified four reasons for the sudden onset of pollution./Temperature, wind speed, mixing height and relative humidity worsened Delhi's air, CPCB experts said. Conditions are unlikely to improve over the next three days at least, they said./Delhi was already reeling under very poor levels of air pollution till Monday. Several factors such as vehicular emissions, road dust, construction dust, garbage burning and stubble burning had contributed to it. But unfavourable meteorological conditions aggravated the pollution levels further. ""Meteorological conditions were such that all the local pollutants got trapped and lingered in the air. These four parameters had a direct impact,"" said D Saha, head of the air quality laboratory of CPCB./TEMPERATURE/The higher the temperature, the lighter the air gets, which lowers its pollution-carrying capacity. Tuesday was the second-coldest day of the season so far with temperature dropping to 16.1 degrees Celsius. On Monday afternoon, when it was around 30 degrees Celsius, PM2.5 level was twice the permissible limit. But at 5am on Tuesday, when the temperature dropped to around 16.1 degrees, the PM2.5 level shot up by 9-10 times the permissible limit./WIND SPEED/The relation of wind speed and pollution level is straightforward. The stronger the wind, the faster the pollutants in the air disperse. While Delhi needs a minimum wind speed of 5 m/s to disperse trapped pollutants, the wind speed dropped to less than 1 m/s between 4am and 5am on Tuesday. The levels of PM2.5 were at least 10-15 times the permissible limit during this hour at several stations./""The condition was aggravated by north-westerly winds, which are bringing in smoke from the stubble burning regions of Punjab and Haryana. The south-easterly winds are helping the moisture build up. We apprehend that similar conditions would prevail over the next two to three days,"" said A Sudhakar, member secretary of CPCB./MIXING HEIGHT/Rooms with high ceiling are generally airy. The same applies to the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), which forms the ceiling within which our air circulates. Air quality improves when the height of ABL is more and pollution rises when it is low./In summers, when pollution is low, the mixing height of Delhi is at least 2km above ground level. In winters, it comes down to around 500m. On Tuesday, between 3am and 8am, the mixing height dropped below 200m, shooting pollution levels up by around 10-15 times above the permissible limit in many places./HUMIDITY/Pollution increases as relative humidity builds up as high moisture helps the air trap and retain more pollutants. Over the past few days, easterly winds increased the moisture in Delhi. In morning hours, when humidity was at its peak, pollution shot up. CPCB data shows humidity level was at its peak between 3am and 8am on Tuesday. During these hours, PM2.5 levels shot up by more than 10 times in almost all stations across Delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi air pollution: Haze horror likely to continue today, may clear by Friday","India, Nov. 9 -- The smog-like condition that the national capital is reeling under is likely to continue on Thursday./Delhiites, however, can expect some respite from Friday onwards when the pollution starts dissipating owing to weather conditions gradually turning in Delhi's favour MeT experts predicted./SAFAR, which is maintained by the Union ministry of earth sciences, has forecasted that the levels of both PM2.5 and PM10 - the two primary pollutants - could drop by nearly 50% by Saturday./But this means that the city's pollution level will improve slightly (drop to very poor from the presently severe level) compared to what it is now. The hopes of experiencing good or satisfactory air quality will still be a far cry./On Tuesday, the average AQI of the city was recorded at 448. It further spiked on Wednesday and hit the 478 level. An AQI value between 401 and 500 means that the air is severely polluted. Such high levels of pollution were last seen in November 2016 when the AQI had shot up to 497./""The level of PM2.5 - the ultrafine particles that can cause maximum harm - shot up more than 20 times above the permissible limit in some places such as Lodhi Road, Mathura Road, ITO and Delhi University on Wednesday. On Tuesday it was hovering around 10 - 15 times above the permissible limit,"" said an official of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./Experts said that the present meteorological conditions are such that it was not allowing any pollutants to disperse./""The pollution has got trapped. The primary reason for this is two-fold. While surface level winds have become very calm and are not allowing the pollutants to disperse, high altitude winds, that travel at least two kilometres above the ground and are primary responsible for transportation of pollutants, are strong. They are not only bringing in pollutants from stubble burning regions of Punjab and Haryana, but are also bringing in moisture from the east. This is aggravating the conditions,"" said a senior official of the MeT department./But this situation is likely to be reversed from Friday, experts have forecasted./""The surface winds, which are very calm at present, are likely to pick up speed again. This will help the pollutants trapped in Delhi's air to disperse. The high altitude winds, which are presently very strong, will also become weaker. This would ensure that the pollutants which they transport are not deposited over Delhi,"" said Gufran Beig project director of SAFAR./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

If the AQI continues to remain in the severe category even on Thursday, we will recommend the EPCA to roll out the odd-even policy,"" said A Sudhakar, member secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) which is the country's apex pollution monitoring body and acts as a feeder to the EPCA./The official said that the pollution control body had recommended making public transport free so that more Delhiites could take to mass transport rather than availing of individual cars and taxis./In a meeting attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday, Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal approved the EPCA's decision to enforce measures enlisted under the ""severe plus"" or emergency category of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). But no decision was taken on the suggestion of ""free public transport""./""The CPCB task force has advised EPCA that given the prevailing air pollution emergency in the city, there is a need to take action listed in the severe plus category,"" an EPCA member said./On Wednesday, PM2.5 levels across all stations crossed the ""severe plus"" categories. In some stations such as Lodhi Road, Delhi University north campus and Mathura Road, the level of microfine particles rose to more than 20 times the safe limit./The Delhi government issued an advisory for people to follow as the ""severe"" pollution levels persist./""Do not burn dry leaves, crops residue, wood, coal, gobar, upla etc. Use carpooling and public transport, as much as possible. Walk or use non-polluting mode of transport for short distance./""Avoid going outdoor during early morning and late evenings for walk or outdoor physical activity as the pollution levels are maximum during this time. Take extra precaution for high risk group like small children, elderly, pregnant women, asthma patients, patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases), patients of heart disease and stroke, diabetics, person with low immunity, N95 mask may be used if going outdoor during the peak pollution hours,"" the appeal said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Smog envelops city, leads to breathing problems","Lucknow, Nov. 9 -- The city experienced smog in the morning and evening and people complained that they had some problems in breathing. In the hospital OPDs, up to 10% rise was seen in patients with breathing problems./This was because the average concentration of PM 2.5 (atmospheric particulate matter) at 4 pm on Wednesday was 430 (as per CPCB report), hence Lucknow was marked under 'severe' category of air pollution that can have serious impact on those having respiratory problems ./The permissible level of PM 2.5 is 60. Visibility in the city was over 700 mts in the morning but for the entire day it was cloudy. The maximum temperature during the day was 29.3degree Celsius and minimum was 16.0 degreeCelsius ./PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter which has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres, about 3% the diameter of a human hair. ""When day and night temperatures have a big gap you can actually see smog. This happens as pollutants - smoke and gases from vehicles -do not travel vertically but horizontally due to moisture,"" said PK Srivastava, former scientist of CDRI. Doctors say smog attacks humans in three ways. ""It can cause respiratory troubles and even itching in the eyes. Prolonged exposure causes serious illness in the lungs,"" said Prof Surya Kant, HoD, pulmonary medicine at the King George's Medical University./Localities on the outskirts of the city such as Jankipuram, Rae Bareli Road, Sitapur Road and Chinhut, experienced smog. However, the visibility was clear. No trains or flights were delayed due to visibility problems. Senior DCM, NR, Lucknow Shivendrwa Shukla said, ""No trains got affected due to smog.""/WHY IS PM 2.5 A TROUBLE?/We breathe in 500 ml of air and exhale the same quantity. In the process, particulate matter that enters the body settle inside and cause illness, the chief among these being PM2.5. ""Watery eyes and head ache are a result of pollutants settling inside the body,"" said Prof Surya Kant, who is also the president of Indian Chest Society./IMA APPEAL TO GOVERNMENT/Indian Medical Association (IMA) Lucknow has appealed to the state government to ensure steps to reduce air pollution in Lucknow. ""Even healthy people are experiencing some level of discomfort on exposure to such high levels of pollution,"" said Dr PK Gupta, president IMA, Lucknow. It is advised that when the air quality index crosses 200, the time spent outdoors should be restricted. Children are more prone to harmful effects of air pollution as their lungs are still growing. Children who played or exercised outdoors needed more oxygen, so they took in more polluted air into their lungs, which hampered the growth of their lungs leading to breathing problems later on in life, said Dr Gupta./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Some schools shut till Sunday,"Gurgaon, Nov. 9 -- Taking a page from the Delhi government's safety book, some private schools in Gurgaon have decided to suspend all classes for the next few days owing to the increased air pollution and smog in the city. Air pollution in the National Capital Region hit 70 times the World Health Organisation's safe level on Wednesday, prompting doctors to issue a public health emergency./Though the Haryana government had directed all schools across the state to change their timings to 9am-3.30pm till November 30, it hasn't passed an order telling schools to temporarily close operations./On Wednesday, residents woke up to thicker smog as the air quality index (AQI), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), jumped to 459 for Gurgaon, against Monday's 368. This quality of air can affect the respiratory systems of healthy people, and has serious health impacts on people with lung/ heart disease. The health impacts of breathing this air may be experienced even during light physical activity./The independent decision comes in the backdrop of the Delhi government telling all schools to stay shut till Sunday./""We will comply with the changed timing from Thursday (November 9). However, the primary school (up till class 2) will remain closed till Sunday. We will review the (weather) condition on Saturday to decide on the future course of action,"" Aditi Misra, principal of the Delhi Public School (DPS) in Sector 4, told Hindustan Times./A circular issued by the Shri Ram group of schools to parents stated that all their campuses will remain closed till Sunday in light of the increased pollution./The Shikshantar school has also suspended all j unior classes for Thursday and Friday./Shiv Nadar school will also remain closed up to class 5 on Thursday, said a school spokesperson./""Dear Parents, further to the communication sent today (Wednesday), this is to inform you that the school will be closed for all classes from PG-VI on 9th & 10th November. Classes VII-XII will have regular school as per the revised time communicated,"" a circular issued by the Shiv Nadar school read./Authorities of Amity schools and the Scottish High International School said they are complying with the changed timing, as directed by the state government, but their schools shall conduct classes as usual./Meanwhile, the schools that will remain open have suspended all outdoor activities and some annual sporting events till the weather improves./Last year, four schools had independently suspended classes for a few days after the city was covered in a blanket of smog due to high pollution level on November 4. Later, eight schools decided to remain closed for a few days./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Amarinder seeks central assistance on stubble burning,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 10 -- Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention on Thursday to resolve the air pollution crisis in northern India, a day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal blamed smoke from crop field fires in neighbouring states for the thick haze shrouding the city this week./Kejriwal sought a meeting with his Punjab and Haryana counterparts, but Singh said only the Union government could tackle the problem./On Wednesday, the two leaders were engaged in a feisty Twitter exchange as the political tug-of-war over bad air continued./Satellite data from NASA show crop residue burning intensified on October 27, 29 and 31, and was mostly concentrated in Punjab./An estimated 35 million tonnes of paddy stalks were set afire in Punjab and Haryana to make room for the wheat crop./The Punjab chief minister expressed helplessness citing paucity of funds to help farmers abandon the ecologically harmful practice of burning paddy stalks to prepare their fields for the winter crop./In his letter to Modi, Singh requested him to bring chief ministers of the affected states and the Union agriculture and environment ministries on board to find a common solution. He had made a similar request this July./Singh also urged Modi to consider adding to the minimum support price (MSP) a bonus of Rs100 for each quintal of wheat and rice, as an incentive to discourage farmers from burning paddy stubble./The National Green Tribunal banned the practice in 2015, but efforts to check the fires failed. Authorities tried fining farmers and providing incentives to adopt eco-friendly technologies to get rid of the crop residue./Chief minister Singh said the problem was essentially scientific and economic, and could not be tackled through other means. He had earlier assured farmers that they won't be penalised./New Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, eastern Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan are covered in haze since Tuesday as pollution levels breached permissible standards by multiple times./""It takes about three to four days for the particulate matter to reach Delhi from Punjab,"" said Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at IIT-Kanpur, whose team helped collate the NASA data./The fires waned on November 7 as farmers got ready to sow the next crop. But the smoke lingered. If favourable weather conditions develop, such as surface winds picking up pace, air quality could improve after November 10, according to the India meteorological department./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution kills 30,000 people each year in Delhi-NCR: AIIMS director","New Delhi, Nov. 10 -- As air pollution chokes Delhi, Dr Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, talks about what works and what doesn't./Is the high level of pollution a health emergency?/Absolutely. The levels of air pollution in Delhi range from 'severe' to 'very severe' and it can lead to not only respiratory problems, but also increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke as well. However, in Delhi, this sort of air pollution is not unprecedented. Last year too, one week after Diwali, we had high levels of air pollution. Vehicular traffic and crop burning combined with temperature drop and very low wind velocity lead to the pollutants accumulating at the ground level./What are the immediate health impacts of the high levels of pollution?/People might experience breathing difficulties and tightness in chest. Even in healthy individuals, it can cause cough, wheezing, headache and buzzing in the head. The people who already suffer from conditions like asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), their symptoms aggravate. In fact, if we correlate the pollution levels and patient attendance in AIIMS OPD, we have seen that 48 to 72 hours after the pollution levels spike, there is a 20% increase in the number of patients coming to the respiratory and heart clinics./How does pollution affect health over a period of time?/The levels of pollution go up in Delhi every winter and living in conditions like this year-on-year can make our lungs look like that of a smoker. We are also adding a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes because the small polluting particles can travel in the blood stream and cause arthrosclerosis (a build-up in blood vessels leading to their narrowing). The impact is especially pronounced on children whose lungs have stunted growth, which can result in more respiratory problems in later years./Can pollution kill people?/Yes. In fact, it is estimated that every year, 25,000-30,000 people die of pollution-related causes in Delhi-NCR during the winter months, when the pollution levels are on the rise. However, it is just an estimate. This is because pollution is a silent killer; it does not directly kill anyone. But the increase in the levels of pollution can lead to aggravated respiratory symptoms or heart attacks and stroke, which can kill people. If we look at the London smog of 1952, one of the worst of all times, more than 4,000 people died due to pollution. The effects of pollution on human health and mortality are well documented./Are masks and air purifiers effective?/There is no data to suggest that masks or air-purifiers are effective in a practical setting. A good quality mask, like an N95 or N99, is very difficult to keep on for long periods of time as breathing in them is difficult. And, if there are gaps near the chin or any part of the mask, the pollutants are going to enter. If you use air purifiers in a completely closed room, the levels of particulate matter go down. But in a home with windows and doors that are periodically opened and shut, it will not have much effect. People get masks and air-purifiers because it gives them comfort (of being protected)./What needs to be done?/We have to make our city environment friendly by using more of public transport and having cycling tracks. The government needs to control the road dust, improve the fuel quality and get better engines for our vehicles. Even the industrialised countries had faced the challenges of pollution and now they have very good quality air and they did not have to give up cars for that. For immediate relief, people must avoid going out of their homes as much as possible, especially the people at risk - the children, the old, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems. Also, people who are suffering from chronic respiratory problems or heart problems must be vigilant about their condition./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Smog check: 7 UP cities in severe category,"Lucknow, Nov. 10 -- Toxic smog hung over UP for the second day with seven major cities falling under the 'severe category' for air pollution./On Thursday, Lucknow (with a PM 2.5 level of 468), Agra (449), Varanasi (358), Noida (487), Moradabad (414), Ghaziabad (499) and Kanpur remained under the 'severe category', as per the Central Pollution Control Board report for 4 pm. 'Severe category' means that the pollutants in the air will even affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. During morning hours, the visibility was poor as pollutants hovered at low levels due to moisture in the air./Doctors said children and especially those having some disease need to remain cautious. ""Those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diseases that affect lung capacity need to be cautious. Family members should monitor their health and make sure they do not go out in a place where air pollution level can be high,"" said Prof Vinod Jain, senior faculty KGMU. Prof Surya Kant of the pulmonary medicine department at KGMU said protecting the nose and mouth from pollutants can help. ""People often rush for masks, which they reuse. This is wrong. I would rather suggest that people cover their nose and mouth with scarf as they can wash and reuse it without much hassle,"" he said. As per the Meteorological department's forecast, dense to very dense fog is likely at a few places in the morning hours over Punjab and at isolated places Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, UP and Rajasthan. ""Metro construction is going on in almost half the city and we also need to ensure pollution does not spread from it,"" said PK Srivastava, ex-scientist, CDRI./BUS SERVICES HIT/About 50 buses that were to start for New Delhi from several cities in the state were suspended. A few buses that run from Lucknow to Anand Vihar in Delhi were also cancelled./VK Tiwari, ARM Alambagh depot, said that there had been a fall in the number of passengers hence it was decided to cancel some of the buses that run in the night. Many buses that run from Charbagh between 7.15 pm and 11.30 pm were suspended.

"Crop burning 'over' in Punjab and Haryana, worst of pollution crisis may be over","New Delhi, Nov. 10 -- Crop burning is over, officials of Punjab and Haryana said on Friday when top bureaucrats of several states and the Union government held an emergency meeting to discuss ways to reduce the blanket of toxic pollution that has enveloped much of north India./The meeting, chaired by environment ministry's secretary, was attended by the chief secretaries of Haryana and Delhi, the principal secretary of Uttar Pradesh department of environment, the chairman of Punjab's state Pollution Control Board and the secretary of Rajasthan's department of environment./Burning of paddy residue by farmers in Punjab and Haryana is regarded as the source of the thick haze, an annual occurrence during this time of the year. But this year, the haze was particularly bad, prompting doctors to urge people to stay indoors./Paddy is a summer crop and most fields in the region have to be cleared of their residue - stubble - before sowing for winter crops begins in second week of November./With the no new stubble burning and the Indian Meteorological Department forecasting rainfall in northwestern India next week, air quality is expected to improve significantly./On top of the agenda of Friday's meeting were ways to improve compliance with the Graded Response Action Plan notified this January to tackle alarming levels of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Officials identified effective implementation of bans on diesel generator sets, brick kilns, and other polluting industries, as well as on the entry of unauthorised trucks into the capital and methods to contain dust./Environment minister Harsh Vardhan dismissed allegations on Friday that the Centre was not doing enough to tackle the problem. He noted that a ""surgical strike"" against air pollution would not be effective./""We already know what we have to do, it is only a question of implementation,"" CK Mishra, secretary, environment ministry, told HT./Strict enforcement of fines on defaulters was also discussed./State government's were asked to set up monitoring groups that will ensure compliance. The possibility of setting up Flying Squads that can reach possible violation sites quickly was discussed./The ministry on Thursday set up a high-level 7-member committee, to look into short and long term solutions to the air pollution problem that grips the Indo-Gangetic belt almost every winter./The committee is expected to meet every 10 days during the peak pollution period and at least once every month after that./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Odd-even a farce, justify it first: NGT to Delhi govt","NEW DELHI, Nov. 11 -- The National Green Tribunal said on Friday the oddeven traffic policy was a ""farce"" and asked the Delhi government to explain how the move would curb pollution, hours after the state signalled its resolve to go ahead with the plan with free bus rides for a week./The tribunal, India's top environment court, said it will decide on Saturday whether to allow the curbs that ban private cars from being driven on alternate days based on whether they end in odd or even numbers./Officials announced the return of odd-even policy from Monday to Friday in an effort to reduce the potentially lifethreatening haze that engulfed the National Capital Region for more than three days./""You are getting the tag of the worst capital in the world. The SC (Supreme Court) and the NGT have suggested 100 measures to curb pollution, but you always opt for odd-even. Nothing has been done by the Delhi government in the past one year,"" the bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar said./The haze, however, appeared to relent on Friday afternoon and officials said it is likely to improve in coming days. The Air Quality Index fell from 486 on Thursday to 468 on Friday and is likely to show ""substantial improvement"" on Saturday, since it is calculated as an average of 24 hours./""The AQI is calculated taking 24-hour data from 4pm of Thursday to Friday 4pm. Thereby the departure is marginal. On Saturday, there should be a substantial improvement in the readings,"" Dipankar Saha, head of the Central Pollution Control Board air laboratory, told Hindustan Times./The air will still be in ""severe"" pollution category on Saturday and ease to ""very poor"" only on Sunday when surface winds are expected to pick up./The laboratory's data showed on Friday a steady decline in particulate matter, the main pollutant that officials say originates from burning of crop residue in agrarian states of Haryana and Punjab nearby./The gains from enforcing the odd-even formula twice last year has been a matter of scepticism among experts and the improvement in the air quality further weakens the case for it to be brought back next week./""Give us figures on how much cars contribute to the total air pollution of the city... also give us figures on how much one dieselrun heavy vehicle pollutes when compared to petrol cars...

These are a serious contributor to Delhi's emissions, accounting for 46% of the total air pollution,"" the court said./Sources said the lieutenantgovernor - the city's administrative head - approved the government's odd-even proposal, but said it is subject to the decision of the NGT./The Delhi government refused to make any comment on Friday, saying the matter is subjudice (in court). During the hearing, the government was also criticised for deciding to introduce 500 buses during the odd-even week and was asked how many of these would run on diesel./Hours before the NGT decision, it said rides on the state-run Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and the privately operated cluster buses will be free during the odd-even period./The DTC later said that 50% of seats will be reserved for women during the restrictions./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Don't panic: Here's an easy guide to staying sane this smog season,"India, Nov. 11 -- I woke up on Tuesday morning to a literary fantasy: nothingness. Influenced by heavyweight titles such as Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being to Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness, I sometimes get carried away by the wings of poesy to float on the most inane of metaphors. I regret to report that this morning my encounter with nothingness was most unsatisfactory. High-flown metaphors rendered useless as a solid block of nothingness confronted me./Forgive me, but since being away from the country for the past two years, I had somewhat forgotten the full impact of desi air pollution. As such, my reaction this morning on waking up to literally leaden skies and being surrounded by a thick blanket of homegrown fairy dust was raving and ranting like a woman possessed. I was apoplectic: how could one be expected to live in this situation? The resulting effect was a mental breakdown with me crying on the way to work and driving my colleagues mad with doomsday declarations./The smog situation in Delhi is by many yardsticks a public health crisis./But clearly, there's not much of an escape. So perhaps it's best to deal with the symptoms and the first order of business is tackling panic attacks when dealing with environmental disasters. While pundits endlessly debate on the best-practice strategies and tried-and-tested coping mechanisms such as going out for a walk to clear one's head are definitely not an option here are some ways to stay sane during smog season:/1. Dress the part: The commonest way to deal with air pollutants is to invest in a mask but to be mentally calm as well as physically safe, you have to be prepared to bear a greater - some will argue uglier - cost. You can only beat the Delhi air at its evil game by donning an apparatus that makes you look like Bane from Batman. I can't promise that Batman will save you from this treacherous season but maybe you can scare away lung cancer if you leer hard enough with a Bane mask on. The times call for replacing grinning-and-bearing with leering-while-coughing. It's no time for playing around, you gotta act tough and be a badass to...well, breathe, I suppose. More traditional approaches to mental wellbeing have included meditation and deep breathing, but in these nuclear-winter-simulation times meditation needs some special equipment./2. Engage with the community: As any mental health practitioner will tell you, the first step towards recovery is asking for help. In these fraught times, the Chief Minister too has issued a call for solidarity because hey, if Mumbai can demonstrate spirit during floods, so can we during a crisis situation. So open another tab on your work computer and tweet away. You will come have to make difficult decisions like whether to use the hashtag #DelhiChokes or keep it short with a sweet and simple #smog when running low on character count. Some of you will be brave enough to go all the way with #delhiairpollution but the important thing to remember is, there is no wrong hashtag. And when you want to take a break, you can open up another tab to browse discounts on air purifiers./3. Become an air purifier owner: Gone are the days when one asserted adulthood with a home loan. As a millennial your chances of owning property will reduce by half by the time you finish reading this article anyway, so you might as well focus on the bare necessities, hence why not begin with breathing. The true mark of contemporary adulting is paying EMIs till your dying breath to breathe easier, no pun intended. An air purifier won't make your rented matchbox any more of a home than rented furniture makes you a property owner, but you will have your very own oxygen chamber. Maybe you can personalise it by giving it a name and spending (good air) quality time with it. These are dark times and that friend who constantly bails on you might ultimately flake with a broken windpipe, so best not to form human attachments./4. Focus on the positives: I was going to say focus on the brighter side, but my vision is a bit blurry because of the *cough, clears throat* smog, but you get the general point. I don't know about these acid rain clouds but good old-fashioned ones have silver linings. So what if you cough and splutter your way through life (or what's left of it)? Life is best lived in the moments. If anything, this season of smog has given us plenty of gifts in the form of romantic time with bae whereby in a classic game of hide-and-seek you can replace the trees in Bollywood movies of yore with some serious air pollution. Besides, you really haven't lived (or died) until you snog in the smog (geddit?) Running low on Instagram content? Worry not, smog works as a great filter. You can even pass off your unsteady hands and utter lack of photography talent with artsy photos of fashionable silhouettes, i.e., decent men and women trying to survive in this gas chamber we call home./5. Kick the smoking habit: Giving up smoking has been on every new year resolution list you've made for the past few years and with a couple of months to go, maybe 2017 is the year you'll finally do it. Because, you see, the complex chemical combinations in the air currently would put even the richest Virginia tobacco to shame. Nicotine, you say? Pssh, child's play, says Delhi. Breathe in, and soon enough you are coughing and fearing lung cancer like the best smokers in the business. It's a sweet deal considering you're consuming toxic chemicals that you thought you could only get by smoking without paying a penny and sans judgment by those obnoxious non-smoker types. Remember that person who shamed you back in the day as you lit up by throwing that awful 'passive smoking' phrase? Well, you can at least have revenge in the knowledge you'll both end up in the same smoky hell./Editor's note: We strongly suggest you don't follow the advice in this piece as the writer's brain was quite foggy owing to the copious amounts of cough syrup she consumed at the time of writing./Sneha Khaund works in a publishing house in New Delhi and has degrees in literature from St. Stephen's College and SOAS.

"Delhi air pollution: From pileups to odd-even, here's what happened after smog set in","New Delhi, Nov. 11 -- Delhi has been enveloped in a haze of smog since Monday night, as air quality across most parts of the national capital deteriorated to 'severe' levels./On Thursday, the air quality index (AQI) at 7:30 am was recorded at 468, which was worse than Tuesday's average AQI of 448. Experts warned that light speed winds, high moisture levels and a drop in temperature leading to shallow fog early morning ensured that the cloud of smog wouldn't be entirely dispersed through the week./The choking cloud of smog brought back memories of similar conditions in November last year. Conditions improved a little by Saturday morning./Delhi's smog led to the Indian Medical Association declaring a 'public health emergency'. Here is what happened since Tuesday:/The smog descends/Delhi woke up to a blanket of smog on Tuesday, as visibility fell to 900 metres. Monitoring stations across the national capital recorded air quality as ""very poor"" and experts warned that the conditions would persist through the week./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), the levels of airborne particulate matter PM 10 was 289 micrograms per cubic metre (microg/m3) and PM 2.5 171 microg/m3 on Tuesday morning. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) considers 100 microg/m3 for PM 10 and 60 microg/m3 for PM 2.5 the safe limit./Accidents, pileups, delays/The cloud of thick smog persisted on Wednesday, as the hazy conditions and poor visibility lead to accidents and delays. Six people were injured when 13 vehicles were caught in a pile-up on the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida's Dankaur area due to low visibility./Dense smog on National Highway-9, which connects Haryana and its neighbouring Punjab with the national capital, affected the schedule of long-distance trains and state roadways buses. A senior railway official said the schedule of nearly 120 trains has been affected while flights on the Chandigarh-Delhi route got delayed for 30 minutes to two-and-half hours./'Public health emergency'/As the air quality index (AQI) - a measure of the level of pollutants in the air - shot past 400 in many places in Delhi on Tuesday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) issued a stern warning on potential health hazards, describing Delhi as a ""public health emergency state"" and asking authorities to shut schools as a precautionary measure./Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that Delhi had become a 'gas chamber' and requested education minister Manish Sisodia to 'consider closing schools for a few days'./Schools closed/The Delhi government ordered all schools to be closed till Sunday in view of deteriorating air quality. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Twitter that the order will apply to ""all classes and all private and government schools will remain shut for the period""./Odd-even flip flop/On Thursday, the Arvind Kejriwal government announced the return of the odd-even plan from November 13 to 17 as a measure to curb alarming pollution levels./The National Green Tribunal, on Friday, put a brake on the Delhi government's plans, calling the measure a ""farce"" and questioning the exemptions given to women and two-wheelers. ""Odd-even won't be implemented without a green signal from us. We are not stopping it yet. Hearing on Saturday,"" the tribunal ordered./On Saturday, the NGT gave the go-ahead for the scheme, without any exemptions for women, two-wheelers and government servants. In an emergency meeting called at Kejriwal's residence, the Delhi government decided to call off the odd-even plan./Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the government can't conduct the drive without exemptions. Gahlot said that the government would go back to the NGT on Monday and file a review petition, asking the tribunal to reconsider their decision regarding exemptions./Other emergency measures/As pollutions levels spiked, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution and Control Authority (Epca) ordered a four-time hike in parking fee and a cut in Metro fare during off-peak hours in a series of emergency measures./Announcing these measures, the Epca said the Capital was facing a ""crisis situation"", which was likely to persist for the next few days. The parking fee hike came into effect on Thursday. Other measures included a temporary ban on civil construction and banning the entry of heavy and medium sized vehicles in Delhi, except for those carrying essential commodities, till further orders./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Need to check air pollution with action plan,"Lucknow, Nov. 12 -- The poor air quality in Delhi and Lucknow is due to a terrible lapse, affecting the quality of life and health, of one and all. The trend was known and reflected from the information generated by the PCB, CPCB, IITR, Ecomen (in limited way and others)./A report on pollution caused by vehicles at Lucknow was prepared by Ecomen in 1997. Another report on environmental status at Lucknow was prepared in 2013. It also highlighted this aspect./In a meeting on October 30, 2015, in Club of Lucknow, I had emphasised on air quality pollution's increasing trend and a few steps to be to be taken to control the situation. We are talking a lot, yet still far away from ascertaining and analysing the sources of air pollution and implementation on remedial plan of action./The following needs to be done on priority in Lucknow:/1. Environmental carrying capacity study/2. Study for preparation of emission inventory with sources and systematic disposal for air quality control/3. Traffic management study./4. Vehicular pollution contributes about 75%of the air pollution load. Many reports have suggested remedial measures. Immediate measures as suggested be implemented./5. Implementation of the decisions taken. Sources of Air Pollution/* Dust from large area of land with little or no vegetation/* Deforestation/* Increase in concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere/* Oxygen depletion in the atmosphere/* Combution of fossil fuels: Coal, natural gas and petroleum are organic material. They are called fossil fuels. They generate energy on combustion and cause air pollution, burning of fossil fuels generated smoke, which contains poisonous gases such as corbon monoxide, sulphure dioxide and unburnt black carbon particles./Coal and oil also contain sulphur as impurity and release SO2 and CO2 when they burn./* Transportation: Modern transportation consists of cars, trains, taxis, trucks, scooters, buses, lorries and airplanes. CO, NO and NO2 released by internal combustion in engines cause air pollution. Automobile exhaust is responsible for more that 75% of the total air pollution./* Agricultural activities: pesticides and fertilisers used and a few practices in agriculture cause air pollution, especially, the sprays./Primary pollutants are particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitriogen oxides, hydrogen fluoride, volatile organic compounds, chol or of luro carbons, ammonia, organic acids Secondary pollutants are formed in the air by the interaction of primary pollutants among themselves or the reaction with normal atmospheric constituents, such as sunlight and water vapour, with or without photo activation. Experimental evidence indicated that exhaust gases from automobiles have particular importance in the formation of secondary pollutants such as smog and ground level ozone./Smog: Classic smog results from a mixture of smoke and sulphure dioxide but it results from vehicular and industrial emissions. These emissions are acted on in the atmosphere by ultraviolet light from the sun to form secondary pollutants, which also combine with and moisture in environment to form photochemical smog./In a democracy, one of the most fundamental and important rights citizens have is to voice their opinion about issues affecting their lives. Without the involvement and perspective of many, a democracy fails in its essence./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Meet these people who fight, survive pollution everyday in Delhi","India, Nov. 12 -- GREEN?CRUSADER/""I keep coming... Exercise (in foul air) can't be bad for health""/Bhure Lal, 75, Chairman, Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority/Bhure Lal begins his day on a yoga mat in a corner of Lodhi Garden come rain or smog. On the chilly, foggy Thursday morning, there was little to show that Lal, who heads the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA), the Supreme Court-appointed panel entrusted with implementing the Graded Response Action Plan against pollution, is the man of the moment as Delhi faces toxic air yet again as winter approaches./""It (air quality) seems to be better than yesterday. Hopefully, the smoggy conditions will clear out by tomorrow. What we witnessed in the past two days is an unusual phenomenon for this time of the year. The dirty hazy air we see is not only confined to Delhi-NCR but I've been told similar conditions are prevailing in places like Mughal Sarai and Lahore,"" Lal said, amid a confirmatory roll of murmur from his fellow walkers at the park in central Delhi./Does it make sense to exercise when pollution levels are the highest early in the day? Lal doesn't care. ""I keep coming, every morning and almost every evening. Exercise and walking can't be bad for one's health. This is a space to re-energise myself. I interact with people about things other than what I do as part of EPCA.""/In this green corner, 100-odd metre away from Muhammad Shah Sayyid's tomb, many regulars haven't been turning up in the past couple of days. Lal is flooded with phone calls both at home and work from people asking what they should do./""Things were very bad on Tuesday and Wednesday. There was a need more proactive action on the part of the authorities. We, as part of the EPCA, passed the directions regarding tougher measures the day the air quality got worse. The agencies dragged their feet. We can't go to them with a gun in the hand. We will report to the Supreme Court. Let it decide. I don't know why they were resisting . Maybe (it is) political pressure,"" Lal, known for introducing the cleaner CNG fuel in Delhi, said./Hectic work schedule is bound to take a toll but this 75-year-old is relentless. ""I have been travelling all over Delhi-NCR to visit pollution hot spots and meet officials. For more than a month, I have been going to the borders of Delhi at night to survey trucks. I speak to people there to understand their problems. I go as a layman and observe,"" he said./And how will it all end? ""The agencies will give me technical solutions that will take care of all these hot spots,"" said an upbeat Lal, before resuming his yoga asanas./As told to Ritam Haldar./DOCTOR/""Asthma cases have more than tripled over two decades""/Dr Rajesh Chawla, 59 Respiratory medicine consultant, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals/Dr Rajesh Chawla is a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist, but he cannot recall when he last slept through the night over the past fortnight./""I keep getting calls at odd hours from people with pollution-related symptoms. Last night, the gentleman who called at 2am had been to an outdoor dinner party and had developed severe breathlessness on his way back. Fortunately, he was not a Delhi resident and recovered when left for his home town the next morning,"" said Dr Chawla, senior consultant, critical care, pulmonary and sleep disorders at the Indrapastha Apollo Hospitals./""This is a bad time to organise outdoor events. We breathe 15 times in a minute, 900 times in an hour. Imagine what our system is going through,"" he said./He has lost count of phone calls and messages he gets in a day. ""When pollution is this high, not only are people with history of lung diseases affected but also those who are healthy. Almost everyone is complaining of throat pain or irritation, blocked nose and burning or dry eyes,"" he said./His 'by appointment' clinic has turned into a 'walk-in', with patients showing up in panic with complaints of breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing through the day. ""It is a sort of an emergency and we, as doctors, must respond. I even get calls from people asking which masks to buy,"" said Chawla, who has been practising chest medicine for three decades./""My clinical experience indicates asthma cases have more than tripled over the past two decades, with symptoms becoming more severe and people taking longer to respond to prescription medicines. Now I see more people with chronic cough that doesn't respond to treatment,"" he said./The numbers of people with chronic lung diseases have also shot up over two decades. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) was common only in smokers two decades ago, nowadays, I see non-smokers with the disease,"" he said./And the numbers will keep growing. ""The problem is that many of the most deadly effects of pollution appear over time, leading to heart disease, lung diseases and cancers, among others.""/As told to Rhythma Kaul./CHILD WITH ASTHMA/""I ask for firecrackers, but never get any""/Rehaan Chhabra, 9 Class 4 student, Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute/Delhi's high air pollution drives 9-year-old Rehaan Chhabra out of the city every winter. As the temperature dips and the level of pollution increases, his chronic asthma and respiratory allergies get aggravated with symptoms like wheezing, coughing and breathlessness./His parents take him out of town on short trips through the winter to give his lungs a break from air toxins. On days when the air quality is bad, he is not allowed to step out of home./""I really like cycling, I really do. I usually go to my friend's house and then we go out together. We had made plans to go cycling and play badminton yesterday because we had no school, but mom said I could not go out because the air pollution was terrible,"" Rehaan said. ""I sat at home all day.""/""I like to play badminton but my friends from the karate class mostly play cricket. Sometimes, I miss them and wish I could join them, but I can't ,"" said Rehaan./Strenuous activities like sports, especially when the air is highly polluted, leave Rehaan tired and breathless. ""By now, he knows what he can and cannot do, but some restrictions - like not being able to run around too much or avoiding sports like football and cricket - bother him,"" said his father Harinder Singh Chhabra, a banker who lives in Janakpuri in west Delhi./His parents first noticed that he had breathing difficulty when he was just one-year-old. With age, his immune system has become stronger and the symptoms have become more manageable, but medicines and nebulisers are not enough to help him light a firecracker during Diwali./""I am not allowed to burst firecrackers, but all the kids in the nearby houses burst bombs during Diwali. My parents said no, so I ask my grandparents to get some for me, but they said no too,"" said Rehaan./The Supreme Court ban on the sale of firecrackers this year helped improve air quality, feels his father. ""But crop burning, traffic. everything goes up during this time. Pollution is an annual nightmare and if it wasn't for my wife's and my job and our home, we would have moved to a different city,"" said Chhabra./As told to Anonna Dutt./TRAFFIC COP/""We don't have good days, it's always dusty""/Bijender Singh, 55, Delhi Police sub-inspector/Delhi Police sub-inspector Bijender Singh, 55, directs traffic with four other traffic cops and an incharge at Azad Market Chowk in north Delhi. For 8 hours he is surrounded by dusty haze from heavy traffic and construction work of the Rani Jhansi grade separator./""I have worked as a traffic cop at Patel Nagar, Civil Lines and Ashok Vihar, but pollution is definitely the worst at Azad Market. We do not have 'good days' in terms of pollution, it is always dusty. It used to be even worse, but our new sir, Babu Lal sir, has got people to sprinkle water here and fixed roads a little, which helps,"" said the father of two, whose mask has turned a murky shade of brown over 15 days./Singh is one of the 5,700 traffic police personnel in Delhi, of which around 5,000 are on duty on roads at any given time. As a part of the uniform, Singh gets latex-free breathable masks, which filter 95 per cent of the PM 2.5 particles, but many officers don't wear it regularly./The free health care checkups they get under the Central Government Health Scheme is a benefit that Singh and his colleagues can't do without. ""I get a medical check-up done every two to three months and drink warm milk and eat jaggery every day to clear my throat,"" Singh said./Apart from masks, health checkups and home remedies, Singh hopes that the odd-even drive from November 13-17 will bring some respite./""It will make my job easier because there will be fewer vehicles. This will definitely help, but not much. A major problem in Delhi is lack of green cover. Earlier, trees and plants used to filter out pollutants. In Azad Market, there isn't a single tree in sight, and construction is on. The dust isn't going to go anywhere,"" he said./""Our uniforms are white when we start the day, but when we go home and wash these clothes, they bleed dirt,"" adds his boss Babu Lal, the traffic inspector, in charge of the Sadar Bazaar traffic circle./As told to A Mariyam Alavi./METEOROLOGIST/""This is just like a gas chamber""/Mahesh Palawat, 52, Chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather Services, Noida/When Mahesh Palawat, 52, a meteorologist by training, quit the Indian Air Force after two decades of service, his role changed from debriefing pilots on weather conditions to informing media, policy makers and people on the causes of air pollution./In 2006, he joined Skymet, a major private weather services information agency, that had started only three years old. Many of his former Air Force colleagues now work with him at the Noida-based organisation./Palawat, a Faridabad resident, has been living in Delhi-NCR since 2006, but he is not new to Delhi. He doesn't recall pollution levels being this bad when he was studying geography at Jamia Millia Islamia university in 1984-86 before joining the IAF. ""There were not as many cars on the road then,"" Palawat recalled, ""though some areas in Old Delhi, where diesel cars were running, did have a pollution problem.""/Palawat's father was in the armed forces, as is his sister who is an army doctor. Now, his elder daughter also wants to join the army. ""I have travelled from North to South,"" said Palawat who was born in Jalandhar in Punjab. ""North India, particularly, Delhi is the worst (in terms of air pollution) because normally in the southern parts there is no fog. So, even when there is pollution , the quantum of pollution is not as much,"" he said./Palawat is concerned about his two daughters, 23 and 19, who have trained as boxers. ""They are even better than boys,"" said Palawat, who is himself a boxer. But the meteorologist recognises that even the fittest of people suffer when pollution levels are so high./""I am worried for everyone. It (pollution level) is just like a gas chamber,"" he said. So, he is doing what he does best: pouring over maps on his computer screen, crunching numbers and keeping an eye on them. ""We work to find the causes, it's now up to the government to act on that information,"" he said./As told to Malavika Vyawahare./FARMER/""We don't want to cough, but who'll pay (to uproot stubble)?""/Bhinder Singh, 35, Paddy farmer, Gobindpura village, Bhatinda/Bhinder Singh refused to get photographed with paddy stubble burning in his fields in the outskirts of Bathinda out of the fear of being fined by the administration./He understands that burning adds to pollution, but says he has no other option. ""Who will pay the expenses (of uprooting stubble and making logs of it)? And where is the machinery or technology?"" he said. ""We don't want to cough, nor do we want accidents (due to poor visibility), but it is just a matter of few days,"" said Singh, who grows paddy in the kharif season on his eight-acre farm in Gobindpura village, around 8km from Bathinda city./The smog, he says, does not bother him as the village settlement is 2km away from his fields. ""It (the smog) does not bother us, as it is the questions of our (economic) survival,"" he said./He has never fallen ill, or visited a doctor. ""There is unnecessary hype created by those ruling in Delhi and the media, the smoke vanishes in a week's time,"" he said./The field smolders for a day after the stubble is set on fire, mostly in the afternoon. ""Those who say the stubble is set on fire at night are wrong as the stubble is not dry enough to burn at night,"" he said./As far as he knows, no farmer in his village has ever been fined for burning stubble. ""The chief minister has already stated that nobody would be fined,"" Singh said. He said farmers like him have little choice as the ""wheat crop season has started"". Hiring a baler machine to roll the uprooted stubble costs Rs 2,200 per acre, which means coughing up close to Rs 18,000 to clear his 8-acre farm./Singh suggests solutions, such as government subsidies or making more machines available through village cooperatives. ""Our village does not have a single baler and those who have the machine ask for a huge rent,"" said Singh. ""A baler costs around Rs 12.5 lakh and if cooperatives can buy and rent out the machine at nominal charges, it would stop farmers from torching their field,"" he said./""As of now, there is no solution. The government has no alternatives and no logistics support like subsidy to increase the number of balers available to farmers in Punjab,"" he added./As told to Prabhjit Singh./CPCB SCIENTIST/""If we can teach children, the future will fine""/RC Srivastava, 55, Scientist, Central Pollution Control Board/Winter is the busiest time of the year for RC Srivastava, a 55-year-old scientist at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) who has been monitoring Delhi's air quality since he moved to Delhi from Dhanbad in 1988./He is part of a lab that analyses samples that are collected from seven manual monitoring stations at Pitampura, Siri Fort, Janakpuri, Nizamuddin, Shahdara, Shahzada Bagh, and ITO. Even though these stations existed before Srivastava joined CPCB, work load has increased substantially over the past two years./""There is a lot more awareness about air pollution since we launched the Air Quality Index (in April 2015), so we get more complaints from people. The NGT (National Green Tribunal) gives a lot more directives, which we need to comply with. We also need to monitor the quality of industrial emissions from time to time,"" he said./When he moved to Delhi, the city was very different. ""Not many people were aware of the issues and hazards of bad air then, let alone being aware of the CPCB,"" he said. At that time, CPCB's air monitoring was based on three parameters - SO2, NO2, and suspended particulate matter up to the size of 100 microns - but in 1994, measuring PM10, carbon monoxide and lead was introduced. ""This was revised again in 1998, when we started measuring the level of ammonia as well,"" he said./""The latest parameters that measure 12 different pollutants, including the PM 2.5 and PM 10, were introduced in 2009. Even when AQI was launched in 2015, there were 10 stations in Delhi attached to it, now there are around 76,"" Srivastava said./""But that is what I like about my job. With the updates, the job continues to be challenging and refreshing. Also, I want to be able to work for the country and for environment,"" he said./Over the years, said Srivastava, air quality has deteriorated due to multiple factors such as rising population, increase in the number of vehicles with no proportional increase in road length, leading to higher congestion./He, however, sees a promising trend that makes him hopeful for the future. ""Children are aware about the environment, probably because they are taught about it from a very young age. I have seen children pick up random trash and throw it in dustbins. This is a good trend,"" he said./""Adults may not change their ways, but if we can teach kids, then the future will fine. If we can change the current generation, the situation may change in the future,"" said Srivastava./As told to A Mariyam Alavi./ACTIVIST/""Pollution is bad but there's momentum (for change). There's hope.""/Sunil Dahiya, 27, Lead campaigner, Clean Air nation campaign, Greenpeace/Sunil Dahiya, 27, born in Bhatgaon Dungran village 10km from Sonipat in Haryana, is a small-town geek-turned- campaigner whose understated style is at odds with the caricature of Greenpeace activists being loud and in your face./An alumnus of Ramjas College in Delhi University and TERI University, Dahiya counters arguments not with slogans but data and research. Initially he was interested in learning all about thermal power plants, when he did it, became clear what a health hazard they could be./Thermal power plants are a major contributor to pollution in Delhi NCR. As part of the graded action plan to clean Delhi's air, the heavily polluting Badarpur power plant is shut down when air quality in Delhi drop./""I was deep in research,"" he said, but ""I wanted to know what it was like on the other side,"" is how Dahiya describes his decision to join Greenpeace initially./Three months into the job, Dahiya volunteered to go to Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh as part of the Mahan campaign against coal mining. He was disturbed by the lack of information and awareness among the tribals. ""For coal that would last 14 years, they were destroying the livelihoods of these people forever."" It left a deep impact./""I don't remember the situation then being as bad as today,"" he said of Delhi's pollution in 2007 when he moved to the city. Delhi residents echo the lack of awareness he saw among forest-dependent communities.

"Traffic cop, child with asthma, green crusader: Meet the people who fight, survive pollution everyday in Delhi","India, Nov. 12 -- From green crusader Bhure Lal to little Rehaan Chhabra, who has never lit a firecracker, or farmer Bhinder Singh who says he has no option but to burn stubble, HT meets people who aren't just talking about pollution, but living and battling it daily/GREEN?CRUSADER/""I keep coming... Exercise (in foul air) can't be bad for health""/Bhure Lal, 75, Chairman, Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority/Bhure Lal begins his day on a yoga mat in a corner of Lodhi Garden come rain or smog. On the chilly, foggy Thursday morning, there was little to show that Lal, who heads the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA), the Supreme Court-appointed panel entrusted with implementing the Graded Response Action Plan against pollution, is the man of the moment as Delhi faces toxic air yet again as winter approaches./""It (air quality) seems to be better than yesterday. Hopefully, the smoggy conditions will clear out by tomorrow. What we witnessed in the past two days is an unusual phenomenon for this time of the year. The dirty hazy air we see is not only confined to Delhi-NCR but I've been told similar conditions are prevailing in places like Mughal Sarai and Lahore,"" Lal said, amid a confirmatory roll of murmur from his fellow walkers at the park in central Delhi./Does it make sense to exercise when pollution levels are the highest early in the day? Lal doesn't care. ""I keep coming, every morning and almost every evening. Exercise and walking can't be bad for one's health. This is a space to re-energise myself. I interact with people about things other than what I do as part of EPCA.""/In this green corner, 100-odd metre away from Muhammad Shah Sayyid's tomb, many regulars haven't been turning up in the past couple of days. Lal is flooded with phone calls both at home and work from people asking what they should do./""Things were very bad on Tuesday and Wednesday. There was a need more proactive action on the part of the authorities. We, as part of the EPCA, passed the directions regarding tougher measures the day the air quality got worse. The agencies dragged their feet. We can't go to them with a gun in the hand. We will report to the Supreme Court. Let it decide. I don't know why they were resisting . Maybe (it is) political pressure,"" Lal, known for introducing the cleaner CNG fuel in Delhi, said./Hectic work schedule is bound to take a toll but this 75-year-old is relentless. ""I have been travelling all over Delhi-NCR to visit pollution hot spots and meet officials. For more than a month, I have been going to the borders of Delhi at night to survey trucks. I speak to people there to understand their problems. I go as a layman and observe,"" he said./And how will it all end? ""The agencies will give me technical solutions that will take care of all these hot spots,"" said an upbeat Lal, before resuming his yoga asanas./As told to Ritam Haldar./DOCTOR/""Asthma cases have more than tripled over two decades""/Dr Rajesh Chawla, 59 Respiratory medicine consultant, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals/Dr Rajesh Chawla is a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist, but he cannot recall when he last slept through the night over the past fortnight./""I keep getting calls at odd hours from people with pollution-related symptoms. Last night, the gentleman who called at 2am had been to an outdoor dinner party and had developed severe breathlessness on his way back. Fortunately, he was not a Delhi resident and recovered when left for his home town the next morning,"" said Dr Chawla, senior consultant, critical care, pulmonary and sleep disorders at the Indrapastha Apollo Hospitals./""This is a bad time to organise outdoor events. We breathe 15 times in a minute, 900 times in an hour. Imagine what our system is going through,"" he said./He has lost count of phone calls and messages he gets in a day. ""When pollution is this high, not only are people with history of lung diseases affected but also those who are healthy. Almost everyone is complaining of throat pain or irritation, blocked nose and burning or dry eyes,"" he said./His 'by appointment' clinic has turned into a 'walk-in', with patients showing up in panic with complaints of breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing through the day. ""It is a sort of an emergency and we, as doctors, must respond. I even get calls from people asking which masks to buy,"" said Chawla, who has been practising chest medicine for three decades./""My clinical experience indicates asthma cases have more than tripled over the past two decades, with symptoms becoming more severe and people taking longer to respond to prescription medicines. Now I see more people with chronic cough that doesn't respond to treatment,"" he said./The numbers of people with chronic lung diseases have also shot up over two decades. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) was common only in smokers two decades ago, nowadays, I see non-smokers with the disease,"" he said./And the numbers will keep growing. ""The problem is that many of the most deadly effects of pollution appear over time, leading to heart disease, lung diseases and cancers, among others.""/As told to Rhythma Kaul./CHILD WITH ASTHMA/""I ask for firecrackers, but never get any""/Rehaan Chhabra, 9 Class 4 student, Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute/Delhi's high air pollution drives 9-year-old Rehaan Chhabra out of the city every winter. As the temperature dips and the level of pollution increases, his chronic asthma and respiratory allergies get aggravated with symptoms like wheezing, coughing and breathlessness./His parents take him out of town on short trips through the winter to give his lungs a break from air toxins. On days when the air quality is bad, he is not allowed to step out of home./""I really like cycling, I really do. I usually go to my friend's house and then we go out together. We had made plans to go cycling and play badminton yesterday because we had no school, but mom said I could not go out because the air pollution was terrible,"" Rehaan said. ""I sat at home all day.""/""I like to play badminton but my friends from the karate class mostly play cricket. Sometimes, I miss them and wish I could join them, but I can't ,"" said Rehaan./Strenuous activities like sports, especially when the air is highly polluted, leave Rehaan tired and breathless. ""By now, he knows what he can and cannot do, but some restrictions - like not being able to run around too much or avoiding sports like football and cricket - bother him,"" said his father Harinder Singh Chhabra, a banker who lives in Janakpuri in west Delhi./His parents first noticed that he had breathing difficulty when he was just one-year-old. With age, his immune system has become stronger and the symptoms have become more manageable, but medicines and nebulisers are not enough to help him light a firecracker during Diwali./""I am not allowed to burst firecrackers, but all the kids in the nearby houses burst bombs during Diwali. My parents said no, so I ask my grandparents to get some for me, but they said no too,"" said Rehaan./The Supreme Court ban on the sale of firecrackers this year helped improve air quality, feels his father. ""But crop burning, traffic. everything goes up during this time. Pollution is an annual nightmare and if it wasn't for my wife's and my job and our home, we would have moved to a different city,"" said Chhabra./As told to Anonna Dutt./TRAFFIC COP/""We don't have good days, it's always dusty""/Bijender Singh, 55, Delhi Police sub-inspector/Delhi Police sub-inspector Bijender Singh, 55, directs traffic with four other traffic cops and an incharge at Azad Market Chowk in north Delhi. For 8 hours he is surrounded by dusty haze from heavy traffic and construction work of the Rani Jhansi grade separator./""I have worked as a traffic cop at Patel Nagar, Civil Lines and Ashok Vihar, but pollution is definitely the worst at Azad Market. We do not have 'good days' in terms of pollution, it is always dusty. It used to be even worse, but our new sir, Babu Lal sir, has got people to sprinkle water here and fixed roads a little, which helps,"" said the father of two, whose mask has turned a murky shade of brown over 15 days./Singh is one of the 5,700 traffic police personnel in Delhi, of which around 5,000 are on duty on roads at any given time. As a part of the uniform, Singh gets latex-free breathable masks, which filter 95 per cent of the PM 2.5 particles, but many officers don't wear it regularly./The free health care checkups they get under the Central Government Health Scheme is a benefit that Singh and his colleagues can't do without. ""I get a medical check-up done every two to three months and drink warm milk and eat jaggery every day to clear my throat,"" Singh said./Apart from masks, health checkups and home remedies, Singh hopes that the odd-even drive from November 13-17 will bring some respite./""It will make my job easier because there will be fewer vehicles. This will definitely help, but not much. A major problem in Delhi is lack of green cover. Earlier, trees and plants used to filter out pollutants. In Azad Market, there isn't a single tree in sight, and construction is on. The dust isn't going to go anywhere,"" he said./""Our uniforms are white when we start the day, but when we go home and wash these clothes, they bleed dirt,"" adds his boss Babu Lal, the traffic inspector, in charge of the Sadar Bazaar traffic circle./As told to A Mariyam Alavi./METEOROLOGIST/""This is just like a gas chamber""/Mahesh Palawat, 52, Chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather Services, Noida/When Mahesh Palawat, 52, a meteorologist by training, quit the Indian Air Force after two decades of service, his role changed from debriefing pilots on weather conditions to informing media, policy makers and people on the causes of air pollution./In 2006, he joined Skymet, a major private weather services information agency, that had started only three years old. Many of his former Air Force colleagues now work with him at the Noida-based organisation./Palawat, a Faridabad resident, has been living in Delhi-NCR since 2006, but he is not new to Delhi. He doesn't recall pollution levels being this bad when he was studying geography at Jamia Millia Islamia university in 1984-86 before joining the IAF. ""There were not as many cars on the road then,"" Palawat recalled, ""though some areas in Old Delhi, where diesel cars were running, did have a pollution problem.""/Palawat's father was in the armed forces, as is his sister who is an army doctor. Now, his elder daughter also wants to join the army. ""I have travelled from North to South,"" said Palawat who was born in Jalandhar in Punjab. ""North India, particularly, Delhi is the worst (in terms of air pollution) because normally in the southern parts there is no fog. So, even when there is pollution , the quantum of pollution is not as much,"" he said./Palawat is concerned about his two daughters, 23 and 19, who have trained as boxers. ""They are even better than boys,"" said Palawat, who is himself a boxer. But the meteorologist recognises that even the fittest of people suffer when pollution levels are so high./""I am worried for everyone. It (pollution level) is just like a gas chamber,"" he said. So, he is doing what he does best: pouring over maps on his computer screen, crunching numbers and keeping an eye on them. ""We work to find the causes, it's now up to the government to act on that information,"" he said./As told to Malavika Vyawahare./FARMER/""We don't want to cough, but who'll pay (to uproot stubble)?""/Bhinder Singh, 35, Paddy farmer, Gobindpura village, Bhatinda/Bhinder Singh refused to get photographed with paddy stubble burning in his fields in the outskirts of Bathinda out of the fear of being fined by the administration./He understands that burning adds to pollution, but says he has no other option. ""Who will pay the expenses (of uprooting stubble and making logs of it)? And where is the machinery or technology?"" he said. ""We don't want to cough, nor do we want accidents (due to poor visibility), but it is just a matter of few days,"" said Singh, who grows paddy in the kharif season on his eight-acre farm in Gobindpura village, around 8km from Bathinda city./The smog, he says, does not bother him as the village settlement is 2km away from his fields. ""It (the smog) does not bother us, as it is the questions of our (economic) survival,"" he said./He has never fallen ill, or visited a doctor. ""There is unnecessary hype created by those ruling in Delhi and the media, the smoke vanishes in a week's time,"" he said./The field smolders for a day after the stubble is set on fire, mostly in the afternoon. ""Those who say the stubble is set on fire at night are wrong as the stubble is not dry enough to burn at night,"" he said./As far as he knows, no farmer in his village has ever been fined for burning stubble. ""The chief minister has already stated that nobody would be fined,"" Singh said. He said farmers like him have little choice as the ""wheat crop season has started"". Hiring a baler machine to roll the uprooted stubble costs Rs 2,200 per acre, which means coughing up close to Rs 18,000 to clear his 8-acre farm./Singh suggests solutions, such as government subsidies or making more machines available through village cooperatives. ""Our village does not have a single baler and those who have the machine ask for a huge rent,"" said Singh. ""A baler costs around Rs 12.5 lakh and if cooperatives can buy and rent out the machine at nominal charges, it would stop farmers from torching their field,"" he said./""As of now, there is no solution. The government has no alternatives and no logistics support like subsidy to increase the number of balers available to farmers in Punjab,"" he added./As told to Prabhjit Singh./CPCB SCIENTIST/""If we can teach children, the future will fine""/RC Srivastava, 55, Scientist, Central Pollution Control Board/Winter is the busiest time of the year for RC Srivastava, a 55-year-old scientist at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) who has been monitoring Delhi's air quality since he moved to Delhi from Dhanbad in 1988./He is part of a lab that analyses samples that are collected from seven manual monitoring stations at Pitampura, Siri Fort, Janakpuri, Nizamuddin, Shahdara, Shahzada Bagh, and ITO. Even though these stations existed before Srivastava joined CPCB, work load has increased substantially over the past two years./""There is a lot more awareness about air pollution since we launched the Air Quality Index (in April 2015), so we get more complaints from people. The NGT (National Green Tribunal) gives a lot more directives, which we need to comply with. We also need to monitor the quality of industrial emissions from time to time,"" he said./When he moved to Delhi, the city was very different. ""Not many people were aware of the issues and hazards of bad air then, let alone being aware of the CPCB,"" he said. At that time, CPCB's air monitoring was based on three parameters - SO2, NO2, and suspended particulate matter up to the size of 100 microns - but in 1994, measuring PM10, carbon monoxide and lead was introduced. ""This was revised again in 1998, when we started measuring the level of ammonia as well,"" he said./""The latest parameters that measure 12 different pollutants, including the PM 2.5 and PM 10, were introduced in 2009. Even when AQI was launched in 2015, there were 10 stations in Delhi attached to it, now there are around 76,"" Srivastava said./""But that is what I like about my job. With the updates, the job continues to be challenging and refreshing. Also, I want to be able to work for the country and for environment,"" he said./Over the years, said Srivastava, air quality has deteriorated due to multiple factors such as rising population, increase in the number of vehicles with no proportional increase in road length, leading to higher congestion./He, however, sees a promising trend that makes him hopeful for the future. ""Children are aware about the environment, probably because they are taught about it from a very young age. I have seen children pick up random trash and throw it in dustbins. This is a good trend,"" he said./""Adults may not change their ways, but if we can teach kids, then the future will fine. If we can change the current generation, the situation may change in the future,"" said Srivastava./As told to A Mariyam Alavi./ACTIVIST/""Pollution is bad but there's momentum (for change). There's hope.""/Sunil Dahiya, 27, Lead campaigner, Clean Air nation campaign, Greenpeace/Sunil Dahiya, 27, born in Bhatgaon Dungran village 10km from Sonipat in Haryana, is a small-town geek-turned- campaigner whose understated style is at odds with the caricature of Greenpeace activists being loud and in your face./An alumnus of Ramjas College in Delhi University and TERI University, Dahiya counters arguments not with slogans but data and research. Initially he was interested in learning all about thermal power plants, when he did it, became clear what a health hazard they could be./Thermal power plants are a major contributor to pollution in Delhi NCR. As part of the graded action plan to clean Delhi's air, the heavily polluting Badarpur power plant is shut down when air quality in Delhi drop./""I was deep in research,"" he said, but ""I wanted to know what it was like on the other side,"" is how Dahiya describes his decision to join Greenpeace initially./Three months into the job, Dahiya volunteered to go to Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh as part of the Mahan campaign against coal mining. He was disturbed by the lack of information and awareness among the tribals. ""For coal that would last 14 years, they were destroying the livelihoods of these people forever."" It left a deep impact./""I don't remember the situation then being as bad as today,"" he said of Delhi's pollution in 2007 when he moved to the city. Delhi residents echo the lack of awareness he saw among forest-dependent communities. ""Being educated does not mean the same thing as being aware,"" said Dahiya, whose parents were teachers./""People in Delhi see the fog but they do not readily see the sources behind the pollution, other than the obvious ones like vehicles,"" said Dahiya. A thermal power plant even 300 km upwind from Delhi can affect air quality in the region./Last year, when one of the worst air pollution episodes happened in Delhi and momentum was building for a massive public campaign, demonetisation struck.

""A baler costs around Rs 12.5 lakh and if cooperatives can buy and rent out the machine at nominal charges, it would stop farmers from torching their field,"" he said./""As of now, there is no solution. The government has no alternatives and no logistics support like subsidy to increase the number of balers available to farmers in Punjab,"" he added./As told to Prabhjit Singh./CPCB SCIENTIST/""If we can teach children, the future will fine""/RC Srivastava, 55, Scientist, Central Pollution Control Board/Winter is the busiest time of the year for RC Srivastava, a 55-year-old scientist at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) who has been monitoring Delhi's air quality since he moved to Delhi from Dhanbad in 1988./He is part of a lab that analyses samples that are collected from seven manual monitoring stations at Pitampura, Siri Fort, Janakpuri, Nizamuddin, Shahdara, Shahzada Bagh, and ITO. Even though these stations existed before Srivastava joined CPCB, work load has increased substantially over the past two years./""There is a lot more awareness about air pollution since we launched the Air Quality Index (in April 2015), so we get more complaints from people. The NGT (National Green Tribunal) gives a lot more directives, which we need to comply with. We also need to monitor the quality of industrial emissions from time to time,"" he said./When he moved to Delhi, the city was very different. ""Not many people were aware of the issues and hazards of bad air then, let alone being aware of the CPCB,"" he said. At that time, CPCB's air monitoring was based on three parameters - SO2, NO2, and suspended particulate matter up to the size of 100 microns - but in 1994, measuring PM10, carbon monoxide and lead was introduced. ""This was revised again in 1998, when we started measuring the level of ammonia as well,"" he said./""The latest parameters that measure 12 different pollutants, including the PM 2.5 and PM 10, were introduced in 2009. Even when AQI was launched in 2015, there were 10 stations in Delhi attached to it, now there are around 76,"" Srivastava said./""But that is what I like about my job. With the updates, the job continues to be challenging and refreshing. Also, I want to be able to work for the country and for environment,"" he said./Over the years, said Srivastava, air quality has deteriorated due to multiple factors such as rising population, increase in the number of vehicles with no proportional increase in road length, leading to higher congestion./He, however, sees a promising trend that makes him hopeful for the future. ""Children are aware about the environment, probably because they are taught about it from a very young age. I have seen children pick up random trash and throw it in dustbins. This is a good trend,"" he said./""Adults may not change their ways, but if we can teach kids, then the future will fine. If we can change the current generation, the situation may change in the future,"" said Srivastava./As told to A Mariyam Alavi./ACTIVIST/""Pollution is bad but there's momentum (for change). There's hope.""/Sunil Dahiya, 27, Lead campaigner, Clean Air nation campaign, Greenpeace/Sunil Dahiya, 27, born in Bhatgaon Dungran village 10km from Sonipat in Haryana, is a small-town geek-turned- campaigner whose understated style is at odds with the caricature of Greenpeace activists being loud and in your face./An alumnus of Ramjas College in Delhi University and TERI University, Dahiya counters arguments not with slogans but data and research. Initially he was interested in learning all about thermal power plants, when he did it, became clear what a health hazard they could be./Thermal power plants are a major contributor to pollution in Delhi NCR. As part of the graded action plan to clean Delhi's air, the heavily polluting Badarpur power plant is shut down when air quality in Delhi drop./""I was deep in research,"" he said, but ""I wanted to know what it was like on the other side,"" is how Dahiya describes his decision to join Greenpeace initially./Three months into the job, Dahiya volunteered to go to Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh as part of the Mahan campaign against coal mining. He was disturbed by the lack of information and awareness among the tribals. ""For coal that would last 14 years, they were destroying the livelihoods of these people forever."" It left a deep impact./""I don't remember the situation then being as bad as today,"" he said of Delhi's pollution in 2007 when he moved to the city. Delhi residents echo the lack of awareness he saw among forest-dependent communities. ""Being educated does not mean the same thing as being aware,"" said Dahiya, whose parents were teachers./""People in Delhi see the fog but they do not readily see the sources behind the pollution, other than the obvious ones like vehicles,"" said Dahiya. A thermal power plant even 300 km upwind from Delhi can affect air quality in the region./Last year, when one of the worst air pollution episodes happened in Delhi and momentum was building for a massive public campaign, demonetisation struck. Dahiya remembers being in a TV studio waiting for a studio discussion on air pollution to start. It was Nov 8, 2016. Modi started speaking and as the news hit, an editor entered the studio and the agenda was no longer air pollution but demonetisation./""This year, the pollution is almost as bad but there's momentum (for change),"" he says.

"How the pollution fight unites Delhi, Beijing and Zabol","Beijing, Nov. 13 -- Several meteorological factors combine with man-made emissions to aggravate Delhi's pollution problem every winter, a phenomenon that experts say is common to some of the world's most polluted cities, Beijing in China and Zabol in Iran./Delhi's air quality index (AQI), which measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter in the air, hit the ""severe"" level on November 7 and has stayed in this dangerous zone since then. The AQI hit a peak of 486 on November 9, and even breached the maximum reading of 500 at some monitoring stations. Anything above 100 is considered unhealthy./Though the levels of deadly particulate matter dropped on Friday, they started shooting up again from Saturday afternoon./The thick haze of smoke that has enveloped the national capital has been attributed primarily to burning of crop residue in Punjab and Haryana and vehicular pollution in a city of 17 million people. Experts say that dust from West Asian countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq, has also contributed./""The pollutants were transported to Delhi and other parts of northwest India by strong-velocity high-altitude winds coming from west Asia. These, along with pollutants from stubble burning regions of Punjab and Haryana, pushed up the pollution levels in Delhi,"" said Gufran Beig, project director of the System of Air Quality And Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a government agency linked with the ministry of earth sciences./But, beyond the man-made, Delhi's pollution is also the result of a quirk of nature - something that the residents of Beijing and Zabol know a thing or two about./Every year, ahead of the onset of winter, Delhi's air quality worsens because cooler surface air traps pollutants closer to the ground. In the absence of ground winds, these pollutants from construction activities fail to disperse into the atmosphere, a phenomenon known as inversion./When high altitude winds bring in clouds of smoke from burning stubble farms in Punjab and Haryana, the entire city is trapped in a bubble of noxious air./""While emissions from various sources had already pushed up the national Capital's pollution level to the 'very poor' category since October, unfavourable meteorological conditions aggravated the situation,"" A Sudhakar, member secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board, said. ""This has resulted in a drastic rise in pollution levels as the city has become like a chamber with almost no outlets.""/This is a problem that the residents of Zabol, an eastern Iranian city, face every year. During summer, dust storms rage, bringing in pollutants from neighbouring Afghanistan and Pakistan. The city can experience up to 80 dust storms in a year that bring in loads of dust from neighbouring countries. The only way to fight back is to distribute anti-pollution masks to all its residents./Beijing also suffers from similar problems. What crop-burning is to Delhi, the so-called ""industrial rust belt"" is to Beijing. There are thousands of factories around the Chinese capital and in its six neighbouring provinces and regions Tianjin, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong and Inner Mongolia./""Wind patterns or air mass movements are an important reason (for pollution accumulation.) The current Delhi pollution is happening because of transfer of pollution from crop burning areas. Beijing pollution is from industrial rust belt areas,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, a Beijing-based energy analyst with environmental advocacy group Greenpeace./In 2016, the World Health Organisation named Zabol the world's most polluted city based on the level of PM2.5 - the ultrafine particles which sticks deep inside the lungs and takes the heaviest toll on human health. While Delhi ranked 11th, Beijing ranked 57th on the list./While crop burning and weak winds make Delhi's air bad in the colder months, the city's topography contributes to particulate aerosol in summers that are marked by strong winds./""Delhi has a variety of soil. The soil has degraded in several areas because of construction and development. They become loose, and get blown by wind easily. This adds to air pollution,"" said CR Babu who heads the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems at University of Delhi ./In summer, dust is also brought in to Delhi by storms from the north-west. These winds, western disturbances as they are called, pick up dust in large amounts from the desertlike north-western India and even west Asian and sub-Saharan countries./To counter pollution, China and India have various measures in place. China has introduced a four-tier colour-coded system for air pollution, with red being the most serious, followed by orange, yellow and blue./Delhi has woken up late but now has its Graded Response Action Plan - an emergency measure based on various categories of pollution, which is being implemented for the first time./In China, the number of heavy pollution days (when the AQI is higher than 100) has dropped from 58 days in 2013 to 39 days in 2016. In Delhi, proper implementation will be needed to reverse the trend./But the only long-term solution, experts say, is to cut down on burning fossil fuels. In China, for example, progress on air pollution control stalled in the region after a stimulus push started by the government in early 2016, leading to a temporary increase in output and prices of steel, cement and other products from highly polluting industries./The plan now is to gradually curb polluting industries to begin with. It's also said to be considering curbing the use of vehicles that use fossil fuels to amplify the fight against weather conditions by controlling man-made sources./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Polluted air is our primary public health challenge,"Mumbai, Nov. 13 -- A recent study released by The Lancet's Commission on Pollution and Health throws up some alarming figures for India. According to the study, pollution resulted in 2.5 million deaths in India in 2015 - the highest in the world. It underlines the need to address this mounting public health challenge./Experts at the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health at IIHMR Delhi emphasise that with the rising pollution-related death toll, India can no longer afford to lose time in tackling the problem. There is an urgent need to identify the main sources of air pollution through specialised research, and address the problem through innovative and targeted approaches./While solutions such as shutting down power plants, introducing traffic restrictions like the 'odd-even' scheme and the cracker ban on Diwali appear well intentioned, India's battle against pollution needs much more than such temporary, knee-jerk reactions./There is no denying that air pollution is a major cause of preventable diseases and deaths in India. Gauging its precise impact on health needs intensive research, on how air pollution affects not just the lungs, but different organs of the body. The sources of air pollution are varied: industry and brick kilns, transport vehicles, diesel generators, domestic fuel, road dust, crop burning among others. The government has installed air-quality monitors that offer indicators on both particulate matter constituents like PM10, PM2.5 and lead as well as gaseous components such as ozone, ammonia, NO2, SO2 and CO. These determine the National Air Quality Index, a system of air quality assessment that enables comparison across sites and time possible./The 2.5 micron size and smaller particles can permeate the lining of the lungs and lead not only to asthma but also increase problems of heart attacks, dementia, diabetes and possibly even depression. Air pollution also makes children prone to obesity and cognition deficits. It can adversely affect pregnant women too, resulting in low birth weight and premature births which are already high and a leading cause of high infant mortality in India./As the urgency for putting in place effective solutions gathers momentum, it is critical to prioritise options in the local context, particularly since resources are always limited./Delhi's Graded Response Action Plan is a step in the right direction but needs to be finetuned. Crop burning needs to be replaced with measures which are affordable and can benefit small farmers too. Pollution from industry and brick kilns both within the NCR and outside need to be tackled./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi air pollution: Light rainfall predicted over next 2 days, might clear smog","India, Nov. 13 -- After choking in a deadly haze that has gripped Delhi for a week, residents of the Capital can hope for some relief as the Met department on Monday predicted rainfall over the next three days which is expected to clear the smog./""Light rainfall is likely in states surrounding Delhi and in Delhi over the next three days, and this could result in a change in wind pattern in the region,"" Charan Singh, a scientist at the India Meteorological Department, told Reuters. ""Smog will start to abate starting tomorrow (Tuesday).""/But Skymet, India's only private weather forecaster, said dense smog would continue over Delhi and the surrounding area for at least the next two days./On Monday, air quality deteriorated in Delhi even as the schools reopened after being shut for four days due to pollution. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 468, up from 460 average on Sunday./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said the decline was because of fall in temperature, increased cloud cover, lower wind speed at ground level, and inflow of pollutants from Punjab and Haryana through higher altitude winds./For almost a week now, air quality has remained in the ""severe"" zone across the National Capital Region, prompting to the Indian Medical Association to declare a health emergency./The Supreme Court is due to hear a petition filed by a New Delhi lawyer to direct government authorities to tackle the ""intolerable and unbearable air pollution""./In Chandigarh, the Met department has predicted a cloudy and rainy week with light rainfall on November 14-15 (Tuesday, Wednesday) that could see a dip in temperature as well./""The weather will turn cloudy from Monday evening onwards and there are chances of light rain on Tuesday and Wednesday. Light rain showers will further bring a dip in the day's temperature by 2-3degC,"" said Surender Paul, director, India Meteorological Department, Chandigarh./He added the showers will clean the environment and bring down pollution level./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"'Couldn't buy enough buses': Delhi govt says women, two-wheelers can be included in odd-even after one year","New Delhi, Nov. 13 -- Delhi government on Monday filed a plea in National Green Tribunal seeking permission to exempt women drivers and two-wheeler users in the next odd-even road rationing scheme, admitting that it is not prepared to accommodate them in the existing public transport system. In the petition, the government has said it will be able to include women and two-wheelers in the scheme only next year after more buses are bought./Having not bought a single bus for the DTC since the Commonwealth Games in 2010, the government said in its petition on Monday that it would require 2500 more buses to accommodate 25 lakh extra passengers if two-wheelers are taken off the roads for odd-even scheme./After a week-long haze, Delhi government had decided to bring back the odd-even scheme, under which odd- and even-numbered vehicles ply on alternate days, from Monday. However, NGT rebuked the government while questioning the impact of the odd-even scheme on air pollution and asked that women and two-wheeler users be made to follow road rationing too./""In case of inclusion of two-wheelers in odd-even scheme, approximately 34 lakh two-wheelers will be off road each day. By taking a minimum conservative estimate, at least 25 lakh two wheeler owners will have to use other modes of public transport on a particular day... the government will require at least 2500 extra buses for successful implementation of Odd-Even Scheme (sic..),"" read the petition, of which Hindustan Times has a copy./The petition also stated that if women are not exempted, ""there is a likelihood that they may not feel comfortable travelling in heavily crowded buses"". The government blamed lack of availability of land to park the buses for not buying them./""This government was not able to procure sufficient number of buses because of non-availability of land for construction of bus depots. The problem of shortage of buses will be largely addressed within one year after which two wheelers and women drivers can be included in non-exempted category,"" the government said in the petition./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Civil Hospital distributes 1,000 N95 masks to patients","Gurgaon, Nov. 14 -- More than 1,000 N95 masks were distributed to patients battling respiratory, lung diseases and other high-risk ailments at the Gurgaon Civil Hospital on Monday./The move is part of an ongoing health care campaign being carried out in partnership with Blue Air. According to officials of the health department, the campaign is aimed at raising public awareness on rising pollution levels in the city and the precautionary measures advised to stay safe./With pollution soaring to alarming levels, the city's air quality has continued to be marked as 'severe' since November 8. With pollution in spate, city hospitals have reported a surge in the number of patients suffering from respiratory problems./""At our OPD, there's been a 25% increase in the footfall of patients exhibiting various symptoms of respiratory stress, asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The situation is grim, as the disease is more protracted owing to the severity of air quality. This is leading to a longer recovery period and higher dependency on steroids, antibiotics and inhalers. The situation will continue until the pollution levels are brought under control,"" Dr Vivek Nangia, a pulmonary specialist associated with a private hospital, said./""For patients diagnosed with lung and heart diseases, their condition could get progressively worse if the existing level of air pollution level persists. It could even prove to be life-threatening. Hence, we are distributing N 95 masks to minimise the risks from the toxic air,"" BK Rajora, the chief medical officer, Gurgaon Civil Hospital, said./Rajora added that apart from filtering out pollutants, N 95 masks can prevent allergic reactions to air pollution as well as reduce asthma flare-ups./Chemists reported a surge of 25-30 % in the sale of air masks in October.

How did Delhi air become so bad? Authorities need to answer these 15 questions,"India, Nov. 14 -- The smog of November 2016 brought Delhi face-to-face with the dangers of air pollution like never before. Smoke filled the air not just outdoors but breathing became difficult in the comforts of one's home too./""It's deadly,"" people were often heard saying in drawing room conversations about the air that could now be seen and smelt. The only solace was that the authorities were at least aware of the source of smog - stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, weather conditions, vehicular pollution, construction dust, emissions from industries in the NCR./Sadly, the lesson has gone unlearnt. A year on, Delhi is living through a similar pollution crisis and experts say it might just get worse than 2016./Who is to be blamed?/Here are 15 questions that authorities need to answer:/The Delhi government/1. Why weren't real-time AQI, health advisories publicised with hoardings, ads, dos and don'ts?/2. Why wasn't bus fleet augmented?/3. Why weren't polluting vehicles checked?/4. Why weren't measures - sprinkling on roads, banning construction activities and entry of trucks - taken sooner?/5. Why wasn't meeting sought sooner with Union environment minister to escalate issue?/Civic bodies/1. Why have radio frequency identification smart tags not been installed at toll collection booths to reduce congestion?/2. Why have waste burning and fire at dumping sites not been curbed?/3. Why did it take two days to enforce hiked parking fees as per GRAP?/4. Why weren't roads vacuum-cleaned regularly?/5. Why was water sprinkling not undertaken on time?/The Centre/1. Why wasn't there coordination with northern states on stubble burning?/2. Why has Centre not been able to enforce tighter emission norms for coal-fired power plants?/3. Why hasn't NHAI completed Peripheral Expressway to decongest Delhi and NCR?/4. Why is there no advance pollution warning system?/5.

But that suspect too has said that he was forced to implicate himself./""The Gurgaon Police investigations were on and they too would have come to the same conclusions if the case had not been handed over the CBI. No charge-sheet was filed yet. So, where does the failure part come?"" Khattar told Hindustan Times in an interview./Khattar had turned the investigation over to the federal agency after parents of the victim, Pradyuman, insisted./The bus conductor, Ashok Kumar, has said that he will sue the Haryana police for their investigation framing him. Kumar is currently in prison./""There is one more unknown person in the CCTV footage. All these angles were being probed by the police,"" the CM said./""The family and the people wanted the case to be probed by the CBI. There was intense pressure from media as well.

Earth's atmosphere contains aerosols of various types like dust and smoke which hinder visibility./Smog, also an aerosol, has become a major problem in Delhi and adjoining areas in the National Capital Region. Low visibility has resulted in accidents and delay in trains and flights./Dr Tripathi said the sensors would also analyse the type of pollutants in the air./""Record of air pollution will be updated on the website in real time which will be helpful in alerting the people and in devising a strategy to check spread of pollutants. Sensors will be put up at short distances to help people know the level of air pollution in the area they want to visit,"" he said./Dr Tripathi said sensors would also be useful for asthma patients as they would be able to know the level of air pollution before moving out./""These sensors will operate with solar energy. Once charged, the sensors will work for about 40 hours. It will completely alleviate manual recording of pollution-related data, a practice the State Pollution Control Board follows,"" he said./""The menace of smog cannot be controlled any one state.

During episodes of severe pollution, the PM 2.5 level tends to shoot up multiple times above the permissible limit./With every 10 additional micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic metre, the risk for people with non O blood type increases by 25%, while for people with O blood it goes up by 10%./The scientists had already reported two years ago that PM 2.5 levels above 25 microgrammes per cubic meter are dangerous for people with all blood types./The ABO gene which is found only in A, B and AB blood types is linked to elevated risk of heart attack./However, scientists clarified, that people will not suffer an actual heart attack unless they already have a coronary artery disease./""You need to have other characteristics for coronary disease to get a heart attack. The association between heart attacks and pollution in patients with non-O blood is not something to panic over, but it is something to be aware of,"" Horne said./Staying indoors, exercising indoors, and taking your heart medication may help reduce risks, the researchers said./BOX:/Blood type at lower risk: O/Blood types at higher risk: A, B, AB (both positive and negative)/(Source: New Study)/Percentage of population with O blood group in India: 37.12%)/Blood group B: 32.26%/Blood group A: 22.88%/Blood group AB: 7.74%./Source: /<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140055/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140055/</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Civic bodies prepare plan for river revamp,"Kalyan, Nov. 16 -- The Supreme Court' s order on the restoration of two rivers has given hope to residents and environmentalists who have been fighting for its rejuvenation for a long time./On Tuesday, the court directed the state to release Rs100 crore to restore the polluted Ulhas and Waldhuni rivers./""The problem of pollution in Ulhas river is a long pending one and we have been highlighting it for the past 20 years. It is major relief for the residents of Kalyan and Dombivli as it will help reduce pollution,"" said Raju Nalawade, an activist from Dombivli./The Ulhas river, which was a major source of drinking water, has died over a period of time as untreated industrial and domestic effluents are being dumped into it./The state will allot Rs50 crore by December and the rest in January. The money will be used to set up a sewage network and effluent treatment plants to treat domestic and industrial waste before it is discharged into the river./""The sewage network in the cities is very poor. The capacity of treating the effluents discharged is not up to the mark,"" added Nalawade./A Right to Information query filed by Nalawade in 2016 shows that none of the civic bodies - Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), Ambernath Municipal Council (AMC), Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council (KBMC) - has proper sewage treatment in its jurisdiction./The sewage flows into the Ulhas and Waldhuni rivers./Untreated or partially treated effluents of six Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP) from Dombivli, Ambernath, and Badlapur are discharged into the Ulhas creek via Khambapada and Bhopar nullah in Dombivli, Waldhuni river in Ambernath and Badlapur./""The basic source of pollution is the industrial and domestic wastes discharged into the nullahs that meet the Ulhas river. The SC decision will bring a change in next five years. The STPs that will be set up should have the capacity to deal with the waste generated till 2050,"" said Ashwin Aghor, project officer, Save Ulhas river, NGO Vanshakti./He said the civic officials should be penalised for causing damage to the river./The civic bodies said it is ready to treat waste and improve the sewer network in its jurisdiction. ""We have a plan ready which will be implemented as per the guidance of the state,"" said P Velarasu, KDMC commissioner./The KDMC has prepared a plan worth Rs1,200 crore two months ago which includes widening of all bridges over the Ulhas river and the restoration of the rivers./""Due to lack of funds the civic body could not start the work. Once the amount is sanctioned, we will make sure all directions are followed,"" added Velarasu./Alarmed by rampant pollution of the Ulhas river due to release of partially and untreated industrial effluents as well as domestic sewage into the river, Vanashakti had moved the Western Zone bench of National Green Tribunal, Pune, in 2012./In the application, Vanashakti had sought directions to the state government to take stern actions against the polluters./After the restoration, the river water will be clean. The aquatic life will be survive. Air pollution will decrease and water-borne diseases among residents will reduce./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Rent-a-roof policy can give residential solar energy the push it requires,"India, Nov. 17 -- The Centre is planning a rent-a-roof policy to support its ambitious plan to generate 40 gigawatts (GW) of power from solar rooftop projects by 2022, MINT reported this week . The government's solar power target is 100 GW; of this 60 GW is expected to come from ground-mounted, grid-connected projects. If the new policy comes through, solar developers - these companies provide end-to-end service to those interested in installing solar systems - can rent rooftop space, fit it with solar panels, and feed the power to the grid . If the policy takes off, householders will not have to bother themselves any more with the time-consuming, bureaucratic nitty-gritty that precedes the installation of panels./India offers a big opportunity for solar energy. Its 750GW potential is driven by roughly 300 sunny days a year, with an average solar radiation range of 4-7 kilowatt-hours per square metre. Despite this, and attractive fiscal incentives, households haven't exactly taken to solar power. As a result, financial incentives are not being utilised and consumers are not availing significant potential savings on their electricity bills, even as the burden on electricity distribution companies to meet power demand from the grid is growing. A Greenpeace analysis shows that all the major metros are far from meeting rooftop solar targets as laid down by state governments and the ministry of new and renewable energy. This is despite a significant national incentive in the form of a 30% capital subsidy, and a range of state incentives and schemes./The success of the rooftop solar is critical for India which is faced with the challenge of decarbonising its electricity sector and tackling air pollution, some part of which is caused by coal-fired power plants generating electricity. A Global Burden of Diseases report says air pollution accounts for 1.2 million deaths every year, and costs India 3% of its GDP ./Large solar plants require land, lots of it. Therefore, it is important that policies support rooftop and decentralised solar power generation, both off grid and on. The proposed policy could empower the solar energy industry to focus on households; it also gives every home a chance to be energy independent. However, it cannot magically transform the sector unless other issues are addressed./For one, people must be better apprised of the benefits of solar power (for instance, the government must give solar the same push it gives to Swachch Bharat Abhiyan); and the perceptions that households will have to make a huge upfront investment or that solar installations will make rooftop space unusable have to be removed. These may sound like small issues, but can work as deterrents when households take that leap of faith./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air pollution worst in Haridwar during summers, reveals study","DEHRADUN, Nov. 18 -- Delhi's air quality typically worsens before the onset of winter every year due to pollution from industrial emissions and farmers burning the stubble, a similar situation emerges in Haridwar but in summers for different reasons, a study has revealed./Summers in the holy town pose major respiratory hazards as the Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 micron metre and PM 10 micron metre increases manifold, found the study by Pollution Control Research Institute (PCRI). PM10 and PM2.5 are the two deadliest components of air pollution./Haridwar has even defeated some of the populated cities like Dehradun, showed the study that was conducted at seven places around 10 km area around the town./PM 2.5 -- the sum of solid and liquid particles suspended in air -- is linked to higher rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and lung disease./The shocking figures of PM 10, however, are a cause of concern which have increased 2-3 times against the standards of 100 micron metre./""The actual cause of increasing air pollution which is reported highest during summer season in Haridwar is vehicular emission. The tourist influx in the city leads to excessive movement of vehicles,"" Ambrish Gupta, additional general manager of PCRI, told Hindustan Times./Contrarily, PM 10 in cities like Dedhradun are recorded above average but below 200 micron metre./The study was conducted during three seasons -- summer, post monsoon and winter. And the statistics reported are variable./During post monsoon, the PM is flushed out due to rainfall. In winters, the matter too does not suspends because of severity of climate and comparatively less vehicular emission. It's the summers that are highly dangerous./""There are few recommendations like phasing out vehicles that have completed 15 years cycle, restricting public transport with only four-stroke engines, modification of engines and others,"" said SP Subuddhi, member secretary of the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB)./The study's recommendations will be submitted to the state government for action./Haridwar, which is about 223 km from national capital Delhi, reports tourist influx round the year. But, during summer, the influx increases manifold./Presence of PM 2.5 and 10 could pose serious implications on the health of people, claimed experts. ""If PM 2.5 and 10 increases manifold, then it will lead to disastrous situations choking respiratory tract and causing asthma,"" said Dr KK Tamta, medical superintendent of Doon District Hospital./Notably, Delhi has become the epicentre of the country's pollution crisis as toxic smog hovering over densely populated northern regions for the past few days, prompting health experts to declare a public health emergency in the national capital and its adjourning areas./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"We, the elite, must be blamed for our cities","NEW DELHI, Nov. 18 -- Just as surely as the seasons change, our angst at the state of our cities will pass. The capital's toxic air will cede to other crises. Again. In Chennai and Mumbai, the annual rite of monsoon flooding will hold sway, then the rains will cease and we'll move on. Again./Every season, we reignite the same debates, ask the same questions and read the same analyses. Take the zeitgeist, air pollution and its unwavering script: Children and seniors advised to remain indoors; schools shut, construction stopped, traffic rationed. Relax, says our environment minister, this isn't the Bhopal gas tragedy. How reassuring. When the weather changes, the haze will lift and all will be forgotten./An article in The Washington Post notes that pollution levels are usually lower in (a) democracies, (b) rich and affluent areas and (c) countries in line with international agreements, as India is with the Paris Agreement./But India's affluent class with its wasteful weddings and ostentatious shows of wealth is resolutely anti-green./Thus, the recent Supreme Court decision to ban fire-crackers at Diwali was seen not so much as a desperately needed step but as interference in the 'right' to burn crackers. A Delhi BJP spokesman even swore to distribute firecrackers to kids in slums - though whether he followed this up with masks is uncertain./India's elite - of which I am admittedly a member - has insulated itself from noxious fumes and created its own alternative infrastructure. Delhi's well-off function as independent city-states with their own security, water filtration and supply, power back-ups and, now, air purifiers./Our kids don't study in government schools, we don't use public transport, we don't seek treatment at government hospitals. With no stake in public services, we don't demand better quality or, for that matter, any quality at all./No nationalist feelings are hurt when our cities figure at the bottom of annual quality-of-living ratings charts./Air pollution is one parameter, albeit a life-and-death one. But our metros fall short on so many markers of any civilised city, leave alone a great one: Safety, green areas, pavements, public transport, cleanliness, inclusiveness, and civility./Why are we not more demanding of governments? The lack of an uprising and not just seasonal grumbling is inexplicable./We know who are the usual suspects - state governments who let stubble crop burn, a central government that hasn't invoked emergency measures, a Delhi government that is high on promise, low on deliverance, and neighbouring chief ministers who squabble on social media./None of this will matter a few weeks from now./In our hurry to build smart cities, we have forgotten to first build liveable ones. We have forgotten because we as citizens don't demand a higher standard./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Health benefits of the humble turmeric,"India, Nov. 18 -- We are all so used to turmeric (haldi), that by now we've taken it for granted. Yet, haldi has such tremendous medicinal value, that this narrowly escaped being patented outside India./Turmeric is a root that is as popular as ginger in Ayurveda. Many of its beneficial aspects are due to its active compound, curcumin. Curcumin has a profoundly anti-inflammatory effect on the body, and provides a good defence system against diseases./Inflammation is the body's reaction to toxic elements in our environment, such as water with heavy chlorine, air pollution, unhealthy oil (trans fats), stress, lack of sleep, and overuse of chemical aromas, deodorants, cleaning agents, etc./This reaction can damage the skin and blood vessels, causing liver problems, arthritis, cholesterol blocks and various other issues. Haldi, therefore, makes a good preventive medicine. Here's how:/For a healthy liver: A decoction of crushed and boiled turmeric and ginger root manages fatty liver, poor liver function and gall stones. Also, take milk thistle capsules twice a day for one month./For arthritis: Rheumatic knee pain responds best to a vegetable soup with added haldi at dinner time. Also fast intermittently, taking only haldi-based vegetable soups at dinner. Avoid processed cheese, pickles and fermented and packaged foods./Also use a topical paste made of haldi in a few drops of til oil, plus eucalyptus oil, with a pinch each of sendha namak and camphor. Apply on the joint and leave on for a few hours./For your skin: To the age-old haldi and chandan paste, add a teaspoon of gram powder and a capsule of sea buckthorn oil./For general well-being: A glass of haldi cooked in hot milk taken every night will take care of internal infections and inflammations./NOTE: For true therapeutic benefits, only use organic turmeric root, and grind or crush it at home./From HT Brunch, November 19, 2017/Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch/Connect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'SMOKING EVENTUALLY CAUGHT UP WITH HIM',"NEW DELHI, Nov. 19 -- Seven years ago, Rajendar Kumar Mahna, 71, was rushed to a hospital emergency room with breathlessness, and ended up on a ventilator. Doctors told the family that he had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which had decreased his lung capacity. ""His condition was so bad, we didn't think he would survive. He was bedridden for a long time and developed bed sores,"" says his wife Sharda, 70, a homemaker. ""Even now, he can go to the washroom, but answering the door leaves him out of breath. He cannot even speak much.""/The Delhi winters, with their pollution and smog, are especially difficult for him./""Initially, when his symptoms were not well managed, we ended up in Emergency again and again. In fact, one year, we had three hospital visits in January alone,"" Sharda says./Every Diwali, Rajendar has to add steroids to his list of medications to boost his respiratory system. Mahna's case is a classic example of pollution and smoking - the two main causes of COPD - coming together in a lethal cocktail./All his life, Mahna kept fit. He walked and did yoga every morning. ""But his smoking, one or two packs a day since he was 16, eventually caught up with him,"" Sharda says./COPD is an umbrella term used to describe progressive inflammatory lung diseases that gradually block air flow and make breathing difficult./Across urban India, the number of COPD cases is growing, and the average age at diagnosis dipping./Mumbai may think it's better off, but there are invisible pollutants here all year round, and rising COPD numbers to prove it. ""We can't see as much pollution in Mumbai as in Delhi because our temperature is not as cold, so the smog is not so dense,"" says Dr Arvind Kate, pulmonologist and chest physician at the city's Zen multispecialty hospital./In addition to the smog, there is a quintessentially Mumbai aspect to air pollution - construction activity./""The construction boom and the rise in vehicular traffic have increased the incidence of COPD in Mumbai,"" says Dr Suresh V Rang, senior consultant chest physician at the city's Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre. ""Cement dust from construction activity and fumes from vehicles contribute heavily to pollution, as does biomass/burning."" n Rajendar Kumar Mahna, 71, kept fit all his life. He walked and did yoga every morning. But his smoking, one or two packs a day since he was 16, eventually caught up with him, says his wife Sharda. n He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) seven years ago and is largely bound to his bed. He can go to the washroom, but answering the door leaves him out of breath. n The Delhi winters, with their pollution and smog, are especially difficult for him and he has to take steroids to boost his respiratory system. n New medical devices like the BiPAP machine allow him to live at home with the help of non-invasive ventilation and oxygen support./As a result, doctors are seeing a rise in the number of non-smokers diagnosed with COPD. ""On average, one or two in every 10 COPD cases in my practice are nonsmokers,"" says Dr Rohan Aurangabadwalla, pulmonologist at Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai./The average COPD patient is also getting younger. ""Over the last ten years, more patients closer to 40 are being diagnosed with COPD,"" says Amit Agarwal, research scientist and head of the molecular biology department at the Chest Research Foundation, Pune./""Where earlier 1% or 2% of patients were around 40, this number is now 4% to 8%.

Diagnosed with COPD, Khawnekar was admitted to the ICU, where she was given oxygen support, steroids and bronchodilators via a nebuliser, to stabilise her condition./She returns for regular checks every three months. ""I also do some breathing exercises and blow up a balloon every morning,"" Khawnekar says./Deep inhalation and deep exhalation for 10-15 minutes daily, combined with the regular exercises over the past year, have helped improve her lung capacity, Dr Kesarwani says. Not every bout of cough and breathlessness should cause alarm, though. If routine medication does not help and they persist for ten days, you should consult a specialist. The Pulmonary Function Test (PFT), along with the X-ray, are main tests to check for obstruction in the airways./""Based on factors such as age, gender, smoking habits and the patient's family medical history, it could either be chronic bronchitis or emphysema which are the two main types of COPD, or asthma,"" says Dr VA Sajit Babu, consultant pulmonologist at Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai. If you want to help keep your respiratory system healthy, first up, stop smoking./WHAT YOU CAN DO/""If a patient quits smoking, it arrests decline in lung function almost immediately,"" says Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonary medicine at Fortis Hospital, Delhi./""Sadly, even after being diagnosed, many people do not quit smoking as they are addicted.""/In a country that ranks fourth worldwide in number of deaths caused by smoking (11%), cigarette smoke remains a major pollutant too, particularly indoors./Also, check the ventilation in your home, especially the kitchen. Indian cuisine involves a lot of extensive frying, and fumes combined with oil adhere to surfaces and cause indoor pollution./""One must always use extractors when frying, or an exhaust, so that the smoke does not circulate in the home,"" says Dr Kesarwani./""Exercises help, but it is important to do them in clean environments like parks, or indoors, as long as the home is pollutionfree,"" says Dr Babu./""If you live around a construction site, or see smog during the day time, wear a mask with a fine net, which will filter most of the particulate matter.""/It takes 15 to 20 years for COPD to manifest, and prolonged exposure to its chief causes - smoking and pollution - accelerates it./""Typically, if a patient has two to three months of cough and breathlessness per year, for a period of two years or more, he should get himself tested for chronic lung diseases,"" Dr Rang says./In a bit of good news, treatment options have progressed considerably over the past decade./Ten years ago, a patient like Manha would have been sent home to bide their time, says Dr Maurya, who finally brought the Delhi senior's condition under control./""Now medical devices like Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) can help support the patient's breathing and even at his age, he can live in his house with the help of non-invasive ventilation and oxygen support.""/Of course, it shouldn't come to that.

Indian cuisine involves a lot of extensive frying, and fumes combined with oil adhere to surfaces and cause indoor pollution./""One must always use extractors when frying, or an exhaust, so that the smoke does not circulate in the home,"" says Dr Kesarwani./""Exercises help, but it is important to do them in clean environments like parks, or indoors, as long as the home is pollutionfree,"" says Dr Babu./""If you live around a construction site, or see smog during the day time, wear a mask with a fine net, which will filter most of the particulate matter.""/It takes 15 to 20 years for COPD to manifest, and prolonged exposure to its chief causes - smoking and pollution - accelerates it./""Typically, if a patient has two to three months of cough and breathlessness per year, for a period of two years or more, he should get himself tested for chronic lung diseases,"" Dr Rang says./In a bit of good news, treatment options have progressed considerably over the past decade./Ten years ago, a patient like Manha would have been sent home to bide their time, says Dr Maurya, who finally brought the Delhi senior's condition under control./""Now medical devices like Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) can help support the patient's breathing and even at his age, he can live in his house with the help of non-invasive ventilation and oxygen support.""/Of course, it shouldn't come to that. So take World COPD Day (November 15) as your reminder; if you're still coughing three weeks after you started, check in to see if your lungs need some help./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi air pollution: CPCB asks weatherman to set up smog alert system,"New Delhi, Nov. 20 -- The country's top pollution-monitoring body wants a smog alert system in place for Delhi, where air quality has just begun to improve after almost two weeks of toxic haze./The central pollution control board (CPCB) wants the Indian meteorological department (IMD) to warn Delhi in advance about the dust storms in west Asia and also cyclones brewing in the Bay of Bengal, both of which have a bearing on the city's air./""We have requested the IMD to develop an early warning system. If we get some prior intimation of what's coming in from across the borders, we can take necessary precautions,"" CPCB's member secretary A Sudhakar told Hindustan Times on Sunday./Delhi's recent smog nightmare was triggered, in large parts, by dust storms in Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia and not so much by stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, as was thought earlier./Moisture-laden winds, pushed by the cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, were the other culprits. Moisture traps tiny air-borne dust particles and hamper their dispersal, forming a heavy layer of pollutants./Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI), a measure of particulate matter in the air, hit 486 and the levels stayed in severe category for seven days, forcing closure of schools, ban on entry of trucks and construction activity./According to officials, the dust from the Gulf storms takes at least three to four days to hit Delhi. An early warning system will give authorities the headroom to minimise the impact of foul air./For instance, the government can boost transport system before rolling out the road-rationing plan, which couldn't take off this time, to minimise vehicular emissions./The CPCB didn't have a system to monitor the dust storms or tropical cyclones and their impact on Delhi, said D Saha, who head the pollution authority's air quality laboratory./The IMD gives weather updates and forecasts, the government-run SAFAR, alerts about particulate matter, one of the key pollutants in Delhi./The need for a warning system was also felt during a recent meeting of the CPCB task force that was also attended by the officials of pollution control boards of the national capital region and IMD./""As these activities (dust storms) are beyond our control, in order to be better prepared for minimising exposure, an early warning system (smog alert) may be developed by IMD,"" said the minutes of the meeting, a copy of which is with HT./The Supreme Court-appointed environment pollution (prevention and control) authority (EPCA), too, has asked the IMD to share updates of the cyclones./""Tropical cyclones and other bad weather conditions over the sea have a vital role in deciding air quality of Delhi,"" EPCA member Sunita Narain had said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

We are facing a polluted apocalypse,"Mumbai, Nov. 20 -- On the way to Delhi from Noida, I was crossing the Yamuna as I do on most days. But today, somehow, this richa from the Atharva Veda inadvertently began playing in my mind: Prithivi Sh antirant a rik sham Shantirdyouh Shantirapah Shantiroshdhayah Sh ant irv ana spa t ayah Shantirvishwe Me Devaah Shantih Sarve Me Devaah Shantih Shantih Shantih Shantibhih (May there be well-being on Earth. May there be welfare in the universe. May there be wellbeing in the heavens, in the water, in the world of medicine, in the world of flora and fauna. May there be well-being in the world of gods through divinity.)/Sadness gripped me even before I could finish the richa. The Yamuna riverbed was never very wide in Delhi. But the river was so deep that at one time Mirza Ghalib began his river journey to Kolkata from here. Isn't it unfortunate that this river of eternity has turned into the Capital's largest drain? On top of it we have the noxious air and the smog that impairs our vision./This is the state of affairs in a nation of nature-worshippers!/No wonder the Supreme Court, the National Green Tribunal and a number of social organisations are crying in unison that India is facing a climate emergency, to no avail. Instead of evolving a consensus, leaders of the Centre and states are busy lobbing the ball in each other's court. Don't they realise that if this continues for another few years, nature won't spare any of us? In nature's eyes, the king and the commoner are alike. These questions are bound to be asked in such a scenario: Why doesn't pollution ever become an election issue in India? Until when will we continue to invite devastation in the name of development?/It has become crucial to address these questions because the conditions have deteriorated so much. Last Wednesday, 15,000 scientists from 184 countries warned in one voice that unless urgent steps were taken, planet Earth will be damaged beyond repair. These scientists have put their signatures on an article in the journal BioScience titled: 'World scientists' warning to humanity: A second notice'. The scientists say the first warning was sounded 25 years ago but since it was ignored, crucial steps were not taken to prevent cutting of trees, dealing with holes in the ozone layer and climate change. Things went from bad to worse. As a result, the quantity of water decreased by 26% and three million acres of jungles disappeared. In a quarter of a century, the decrease in mammals and birds was to the tune of 20%./The importance of water, animals and forests for humans can't be overemphasised. According to the World Health Organization, 1.25 crore people perish every year owing to environmental causes. Of these, 65 lakh die owing to air pollution alone. This number is 11.6% of the worldwide deaths. It is important to realise that 92% of the world's population is breathing in areas where the air is no longer safe for them. That is why about one million people in China died of pollution-related diseases in 2012. The India statistic was 600,000./Those upset by the poisonous air in the national capital region should know that gas chambers have sprung up around them. Last year those Indian cities that were considered the world's most polluted included Gwalior, Allahabad, Patna, Raipur, Delhi, Ludhiana, Kanpur, Khanna, Firozabad and Lucknow. In other words, half of the worst polluted cities are located in north India./How would you describe it, if not call it nature's emergency? That is why everybody from the country's courts, to the man on street is waiting in anticipation. But is the ground reality changing?/The chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab have been busy fighting Twitter wars for a long time. Many days later, when the CMs of Delhi and Haryana finally met, Punjab's Amarinder Singh played truant. Are political differences and selfish interests more important for these politicians than the lives of those who have voted them into office?/Hitler had built gas chambers for the Jews, whom he hated the most. But our rulers have turned our cities and villages, where there voters live, into gas chambers./Let's not forget this. We are the descendants of those who sought well-being in the elements of nature. Today those very elements are looking towards us for their own well-being. Obviously, we exist because of them and not the other way round. Keeping them safe will ensure our own safety./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

As per a recent report of the CEED, transport sector contributes to around 20% of the total pollution in Bihar./""Solid fuel is one of the key factors contributing to air pollution. People of Patna need to stop using solid fuel such as wood, cow dung cakes, etc, for cooking. Also, farmers should be advised not to burn the crop residue, which causes smog during winters and has badly affected Delhi air,"" Kumar added./Besides, there is need to ensure that vehicles are kept in good condition so that they do not emit smoke, water should be sprinkled regularly on roads in rural and urban areas to settle the dust particles, construction works should be done carefully and sand, bricks kept covered while being transported to keep air pollution in check, he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Lucknow: Citizens gather at Rumi Darwaza to demand clean air,"LUCKNOW, Nov. 23 -- To raise awareness on the health risks posed by the alarming air pollution levels in Lucknow, several bodies representing the civil society of Uttar Pradesh collaborated with the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) to conduct an outreach programme at the Rumi Darwaza on Tuesday./The citizen-centric initiative was a part of CEED's ongoing '100% Uttar Pradesh' campaign, which aims at creating a sustainable environment. It urges the state government to formulate a 'Clean Air Action Plan' that includes practical and indigenous solutions for checking the pollution levels both in the state and in the city./The air quality data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that Lucknow's air was most polluted among that of all the cities in the country on November 14, 2017. The air quality index was 'severe' -- worse that Delhi's.The concentration of the finer particulate matter (PM2.5) in the city was seven times the safety level of 60 ug/m3. Officials said it could be attributed to high vehicular emission and the movement of air pollutants due to crop stubble burning in the western part of the country./High PM2.5 levels can aggravate respiratory and lung diseases, cause eye and throat irritation, and worsen asthma, bronchitis, hypertension and breathlessness. Long-term exposure to this particulate matter can also cause lung cancer./Stressing on the need for immediate action, Munna Jha, head, political advocacy at CEED, said, ""It's not Delhi alone. The air of the whole Gangetic plain is now polluted and filled with toxic gases and finer particles hazardous to human health. We cannot afford to live in denial anymore. Air pollution is the key factor behind 20% mortality in the country. It is imperative for us to join hands and work collectively.""/Shedding light on the '100% Uttar Pradesh' campaign, Jha said, ""The campaign is supported by a large number of people from all walks of life. We have demanded formulation of a 'Clean Air Action Plan' with a timebound enforcement. We also aim to educate the masses about the ill-effects of air pollution.""/Lending his support to this citizens' initiative is Ajay Sharma, secretary, AMALTAS.

"Citizens gather at Rumi Darwaza, demand clean air","Lucknow, Nov. 23 -- To raise awareness on the health risks posed by the alarming air pollution levels in the city, several bodies representing the civil society of the state collaborated with the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) to conduct an outreach programme at the Rumi Darwaza on Tuesday./The citizen-centric initiative was a part of CEED's ongoing '100% Uttar Pradesh' campaign, which aims at creating a sustainable environment. It urges the state government to formulate a 'Clean Air Action Plan' that includes practical and indigenous solutions for checking the pollution levels both in the state and in the city./The air quality data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that Lucknow's air was most polluted among that of all the cities in the country on November 14, 2017. The air quality index was 'severe' -- worse that Delhi's. The concentration of the finer particulate matter (PM2.5) in the city was seven times the safety level of 60 ug/m3. Officials said it could be attributed to high vehicular emission and the movement of air pollutants due to crop stubble burning in the western part of the country./High PM2.5 levels can aggravate respiratory and lung diseases, cause eye and throat irritation, and worsen asthma, bronchitis, hypertension and breathlessness. Long-term exposure to this particulate matter can also cause lung cancer./Stressing on the need for immediate action, Munna Jha, head, political advocacy at CEED, said, ""It's not Delhi alone. The air of the whole Gangetic plain is now polluted and filled with toxic gases and finer particles hazardous to human health. We cannot afford to live in denial anymore. Air pollution is the key factor behind 20% mortality in the country. It is imperative for us to join hands and work collectively.""/Shedding light on the '100% Uttar Pradesh' campaign, Jha said, ""The campaign is supported by a large number of people from all walks of life. We have demanded formulation of a 'Clean Air Action Plan' with a timebound enforcement. We also aim to educate the masses about the ill-effects of air pollution.""/Lending his support to this citizens' initiative is Ajay Sharma, secretary, AMALTAS. ""Through today's activity (at Rumi Darwaza), we wish to send out a clear message to the government to take steps to reduce the rising levels of air pollution in our city. We must act now to stop Lucknow from turning into a gas chamber.

Four busy junctions have worst air quality,"Thane, Nov. 23 -- With traffic congestion comes an added problem at some of the busiest junctions in the city./The annual air pollution report for 2016-17 has revealed that the pollution levels at four junctions in the city are alarming./Teen Hath Naka, Kalwa, Gaondevi and Kapurbawdi junctions recorded Air Pollution Index (air quality) between 80 and 110 per cent as opposed to the permissible level of 50 per cent./The Thane Municipal Corporation did a survey at 16 prime junctions in the city, including Teen Hath Naka. It set up an air pollution monitoring station at the Teen Hath Naka junction a year ago to monitor and create awareness to reduce the pollution level. But, there has been no change./A civic official requesting anonymity said, ""The average air pollution index (API) at Teen Hath Naka throughout the year is 109 per cent. The API during winter is as high as 158 per cent, which means that the air at the junction is extremely polluted. We have found that the level of sulphur dioxide in the air is within the permissible limit. But, the level of nitrous oxide and Repairable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) is higher than the normal levels at the junction.""/RSPM includes pollen, mold spores, settling dust, cement dust, fly ash and heavy dust./""The pollution level at Kalwa Junction is 103 per cent, followed by Gaondevi at 85 per cent and Kapurbawdi at 81 per cent. Apart from Gaondevi, which is an internal city junction, the other three junctions witness a heavy load of heavy vehicles. The junctions connect several national highways and roads going towards Mumbai and Navi Mumbai,"" the official added./The municipal corporation also measured the volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as carbon monoxide and Benzene at junctions including SATIS, Malhar theatre, Saket junction, Cadbury junction and Teen Petrol Pump among others./The official added, ""We have found that the level VOCs is high in Chintamani Jeweller Chowk, Nitin Company junction, Malhar Cinema and MH High School Chowk. Carbon monoxide causes respiratory ailments such as asthama, lung diseases while Benzene on the other hand is a carcinogen and can also lead to asthama.""/The increasing vehicular traffic and the ongoing road repair works are the prime reason for this increase in pollution claims the pollution control department. EXPERTS SPEAK The dust at the flyover is the main reason of pollution. Vehicles stopping at the junction increase the CO emission along with particulate matter from adulteration in fuel. The amount of CO and other pollutants can be decreased by asking driver to switch off the engine while they are waiting. The waiting time should be reduced by efficient traffic and signal management system. Whenever a vehicle tries to cut lane, it blocks and slows down other vehicles behind, leading to congestion and consequently increase in emissions. Lane-cutting should be fined. Fitting of dust absorbers on the flyover can also help decrease particulate pollutants, said Vidhyadhar Walavalkar, environmentalist/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution control panel urges Met officials to improve forecast period to a week,"India, Nov. 25 -- A top pollution prevention panel has urged the Indian meteorological department to give out at least a week's forecast for weather, saying the current two-day prediction was not sufficient to implement the emergency response plan that could have avoided the pollution crisis that gripped Delhi earlier this month./""Beijing and other cities across the world have 15 days pollution forecast, which helps them strategise better. We need at least seven days' forecasts, can't have a two-day alert. There is an immediate need for better, long-term pollution forecasts. Give us a chance to be prepared and take action,"" EPCA member Sunita Narain told MeT department officials in a meeting on Friday./The EPCA - Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) - is a Supreme Court-appointed committee and holds the power to implement the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), a protocol that will put restrictions on factories and vehicles to pre-empt pollution./The National Capital Region went through an unprecedented pollution crisis when the air became unfit to breathe for a week, staying in ""severe"" category between November 7 and 14. The worst was on November 9, when the Air Quality Index hit 486./According to EPCA, the most advanced prediction it had before November 7 was of November 6./""It said winds will come from Punjab. But it did not provide any warning of the kind of anti-cyclonic weather disturbance that was happening in the upper circulatory system and the impending problems that it would bring. In the future, we have to ensure that there is no episode like this,"" Narain said./The anti-cyclonic disturbance was later identified as the main reason for the smog crisis, contributing slightly more than the crop burning in agrarian states surrounding the NCR zone./The weather system brought in dust from West Asian nations, and the smoke from crop burning in Haryana and Punjab. These combined with a separate air circulation system bringing in moisture from the east, combining to create a blanket of toxic haze that would not disperse since there was no wind, the EPCA said in a report to the top court./According to the report, EPCA is provided no advance warning for sudden change in weather patterns, but only has information about current state of pollution through real-time monitoring of the AQI./""But across the world, where such smog alert systems are in place, a robust and reliable weather forecasting system is essential for action,"" it said./REGULAR ALERTS FROM NOW/In Friday's meeting, the EPCA decided that alerts will be sent out when the air quality is in ""very poor"", ""severe"" and ""severe plus"" levels. In Delhi, according to Delhi Pollution Control Committee officials, the health department was already doing it./The EPCA urged representatives of several states to make sure the alerts are frequent. Some state officials said they will do it once in a fortnight, to which Narain suggested it be done daily./""There is a need to have wider dissemination of this information to the general public, through apps or other means. EPCA will discuss this with MoEF & CC, CPCB and state governments to see how such a system can be put in place,"" the panel earlier said in the report to SC./A possible example for Delhi to follow could be that of Beijing, which introduced a four-tier colour-coded system to combat air pollution after the city faced heavy smog in 2013. The Chinese capital sends out alerts on social media, television, radio and mobile apps. The information is also circulated through government accounts on Weibo (China's equivalent of Twitter) and WeChat./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pune citizens voice opinions on civic issues,"India, Nov. 25 -- Reducing number of vehicles on streets, increasing the green cover, protecting hills and creating more open spaces could help prevent deterioration of the air quality in Pune, said Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials, environment experts and doctors./On Friday, experts, citizens and PMC officials had assembled at the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to discuss measures which could prevent Pune from experiencing Delhi-like situation in the future./Recently, pollution levels in Delhi had spiked to serious levels with the air quality index, a measure of the level of pollutants in the air, shooting past 400 at many places in Delhi./The discussion was initiated by 'Alert' which was started by MP Vandana Chavan in 2007 to sensitise and create awareness on implementing good governance and participatory governance at grass root level./Present for the discussionwere Mangesh Dighe, PMC's environment officer, Dr Maj Monica Barne (Retd), head of training programmes, division, Chest Research Foundation, Pune, Amarnath Karan, programme officer, Centre for Environment Education, Sujit Patwardhan, founder of the NGO Parisar, Anita Benninger, town planner and Sulakshana Mahajan, consultant, urban planner, among others./Speaking on the occasion, Chavan said, ""Delhi was in news recently for being the most polluted city in the world. Even today, the air quality in Delhi is not at all good and has become a health hazard for its citizens.""/Chavan added that Delhi has been facing this problem of hazardous air quality consecutively for three to four years during the winter season, but once it recedes, people forget about it and no measures are taken to prevent its recurrence./""The government, administration and the citizens must come together and find out ways to ensure that Pune does not follow Delhi in being recognised as one of the most polluted cities. Even today, the particulate matter in the air in Pune is above the standard and hence, efforts must be taken to ensure that in the future the air quality does not deteriorate further,"" said Chavan./On the occasion, experts stated that one of the major reasons for the deteriorating air quality in Pune has been the rise in number of vehicles. To stop this growth of vehicles, strengthening the public transport system in the city was considered to be one of the major solutions./Experts also emphasised on protecting the hills, the green cover in the city, the river bed and creating more open spaces as part of town planning./On the occasion Dr Monica Barne stated that air pollution is becoming a major cause for rise in obesity, lung cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthama and dementia among other things./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

It's high time we took Delhi to a more livable state,"India, Nov. 25 -- Why is Delhi a state? That isn't a facile question. It is also a question that merits repeating. Why is Delhi a state?/India's capital was a beautiful city (before it became a beautiful-but-unlivable city-state) in the 1970s and part of the 1980s. The traffic was still manageable (the tricked-out-Maruti-800 revolution was a few years away), as was the population. It was still safe, although city-historians would later point to the horrific Sanjay and Geeta Chopra murders in 1978 as a tipping point. It had wide tree-lined avenues, beautiful parks, and a certain old-world feel. Gurugram and Ghaziabad were yet to become the heaving satellite-towns they would become, and NOIDA was a small and immaculately planned suburb./Truth is, you can get nostalgic about almost any Indian city. Bengaluru in the 1970s, 1980s, even part of the 1990s, was one of the best places to live in India. Mumbai, almost till the late 1990s, was still a perfectly functioning metropolis. Kolkata was an important cultural and business centre in the 1980s. Of the lot, only Chennai (Madras in the old days), which received and still gets a bad rap for weather, has managed to keep some bit of its old self alive, although, like Kolkata, it has become a city of parents. Still, Delhi's case is particularly unique and not the least because it is a city-state that is home to the central government./Part of this has to perhaps do with its success. Even in the 1980s and 1990s, Mumbai was the country's commercial capital and Delhi, its political capital. That has changed. Today, the centre of gravity of business in India hovers somewhere between Mumbai and Delhi and Bengaluru (although it is still slightly polarised towards the first). Today, Delhi and its environs, called the National Capital Region, and including bits of Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad, are home to as many, if not more, multinational corporations, than Mumbai or Bengaluru. Gurugram is the largest automobile manufacturing hub in the country. This has also changed the profile of the region's population./That success has translated into a greater demand on the city's and the region's hard and soft infrastructure. For instance, Delhi is woefully short of power and dependant on power from other regions. It also has its water piped in from elsewhere. Its roads are unable to cope with its huge volume of traffic, the result of it having more vehicles than Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata combined. It has become unsafe for women. Every year, it has at least one major outbreak of dengue, or chikungunya, or some other disease. It has a perennial garbage problem. And, over the past few years, every winter, it has the worst air quality in the country./These are the kind of issues that would tax even the most efficient administrations. Only, in Delhi, it isn't clear who is in charge. The city itself is divided into three local bodies, the New Delhi Municipal Corporation that comes under the central government; the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (which is divided into three corporations, each elected); and the Delhi Cantonment Board which falls under the union defence ministry. On top of these are Delhi's elected government or the Lieutenant Governor, an appointee of the union government. Then there are satellites such as Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida, and Ghaziabad. The first two fall under the Haryana government and the last two under Uttar Pradesh./The number of bodies and individuals and governments responsible for Delhi puts the city-state in a uniquely piquant position. One, people do not know who is accountable for what. Indeed, ahead of this year's election to the three corporations that make up the MCD, the Bharatiya Janata Party fought at least part of its campaign on the platform of change despite having been in charge of all three corporations for the past 10 years. Two, it is easy for the people in charge to pass the buck. Indeed, this is the standard response of Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government./This was evident during the recent air pollution crisis that the city-state experienced. Despite this being an annual affair, the state government seemed entirely unprepared for it. It had not implemented many of the measures it promised to last year. Worse, it had not bought more buses despite sitting on a green fund that had more than enough money. When this was pointed out, it pointed a finger at the Delhi Development Authority, which reports to the Lieutenant Governor, saying the agency had not given it enough land to park the buses it wanted to buy./To be fair to the Delhi state government, there are areas such as law and order, for instance, where it can do little because the Delhi Police doesn't report to it. But there are several areas where it can do a lot. In some, such as education (schools), it has achieved a lot. In others, it hasn't, and the reason for this underachievement and underperformance isn't always its limited powers, although it is a good excuse for the same./There is an ideal solution. As India's capital, the location of the central government, the most important vertex in the Delhi-Agra-Jaipur golden triangle in tourism, and an important cultural and commercial hub, the city-state deserves better. If this means carving out a larger region (the satellite towns and suburbs, for instance), and putting an administrative authority reporting to the union government in charge, then so be it. For one, this would immediately clarify who is in charge. For another, it would remove centre-state relations from the equation. And it would create an authority responsible for a geographical area that is already contiguous in all aspects except governance./Sure, it would help to have such a body. Just as it would help if Delhi's state government had more powers, or had better relations with the union government. But there is also a more pragmatic and simple solution: there is much the AAP government in Delhi could have done and can still do to make the city more livable./The average Delhiite puts up with a lot: unsafe roads; harassment and rape; traffic jams; disease outbreaks; bad air; and, also helplessness arising sometimes from not knowing who to hold responsible for all this. It is time to put an end to this. It is time for the state government to step up (however limited it may feel its powers are)./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

What Lko will vote for today,"Lucknow, Nov. 26 -- This year election for Lucknow's mayor, reserved for women, is in itself the beginning of a change. Some may vote for development, some for reduction of air pollution, while others may vote for a city without filth and garbage./Young women voters are upbeat over the fact that they will vote for a woman./HT spoke to cross section of voters as to what they are voting for. Here are the excerpts:/""I will vote for a candidate who promises to check the increasing crime, not only against women, but against people in general. Also, I am rooting for a candidate who strives to curb the rising pollution in the city,"" said Fariah Zaidi (19), a student./Her friend Anupama Shukla (18) said: ""This time I will vote for someone who can work for cleanliness of the city as one can see garbage littered on roadsides and stray cattle all around. Residents have decided now to elect a candidate who can assure to rid them of the filth menace.""/Entrepreneur Kiron Chopra said this time with mayoral seat reserved for women, a lot of votes may go to the candidate and not the party, though how two ideologically different parties will co-exist should there be a candidate elected from a party other than the ruling dispensation, is something time will tell./""This, however, is not a new situation but the push and pull between the civic authorities and state agencies is a bane for the common citizen. What comes across strongly though, and is heartening, is that most of women candidates are capable and determined for a change. I hope municipal reforms finally happen,"" Chopra said./Madhu Banerjee of Gomti Nagar said the mayor is a decorative post with little powers in the general belief. Therefore, voting for either the mayor or the corporator is a futile exercise./Piyush Raj Verma of Care About People Foundation, said: ""Sunday is yet another day where Lucknow will come out to exercise its democratic right to elect local government. Lucknow will vote for development, where basic amenities reach the citizens. Lucknow will also vote for an accountable system,"" he said./Aadarsh Mishra, a research associate, said poor facilities in water supply, filth and garbage continue to thrive thereby causing several diseases. It is time for voters to hold their representatives' work into account./If you want to make a difference, vote on Sunday, is the advice from these Lucknowites./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Increase in vehicle count rings pollution alarm bells,"Thane, Nov. 26 -- The vehicle population in Thane city is almost equal to the population./As per the pollution control report, the number of vehicles in the city is more than 19 lakh./The RTO record states that the number of private vehicles plying in the city is 15.36 lakhs. The total number of vehicles plying in the city is 19.27 lakh. The census report of 2011 says Thane's population is 18 lakhs./A civic official said, ""In our pollution report, we have studied the vehicle population submitted by the RTO. The number of vehicles in the city last year was 18.21 lakh which increased by over one lakh this year. Twowheelers form the major chunk of vehicle population. The city has more than 10 lakh twowheelers, almost four to five lakh four-wheelers. The number of private vehicles in the city is over 15 lakhs, most of which ply on the city roads during peak hours.""/The vehicular population increases by seven to eight percent every year./The Thane municipal Corporation record states that the vehicle density in Thane is 479 vehicles per 1,000 people which is more than Delhi. This ratio was 280 per 1,000 people in 2001 and 417 per 1,000 people in 2005./From 1981 to 2001, the vehicle population in the six metropolis in India has gone up by 7.75 times./Thane has developed rapidly in areas such as Ghodbunder Road and Kolshet./However, areas in the heart of the city such as Naupada, Ambedkar Road or Khopat are still lagging in road infrastructure./Environmentalist Nagesh Tekale said, ""The roads are bad. Most areas of the roads is occupied by illegal parking and the footpaths are pathetic due to which the commuters walk on roads. All these obstructions reduce the speed of the vehicles. This increases the emission of sulphur and carbon monoxide, which increases air pollution.""/Potholes or bad quality roads lead to increase in friction between the tyres and the road releasing more lead in the air, he added./""Lead slows the brain development of children. It also leads to skin allergies. CO inhaled causes respiratory ailments like asthama, breathing or lung diseases,"" he said./""The situation might someday be like Delhi if the number of vehicles continues to increase at the same pace. Widening of roads, strengthening the public transport system, car pooling and opting for fleet or shuttle services can ease the pollution in the long run,"" Tekale added./The pollution control officer said people should start using battery-operated vehicles./""The municipal corporation is coming up with electronic buses, a green mode of transport. The biggest problems are two-wheelers, as there are over 10 lakh twowheelers in the city. Instead of bikes, people should opt for nonmotorised means of public transport like bicycle. We have also proposed to start the rent a cycle initiative for residents,"" said Manisha Pradhan, pollution control officer./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Time to breathe a sigh of relief!,"New Delhi, Nov. 27 -- As usual, the air quality in the National Capital has plunged to dangerous level, raising serious health concerns. /And as air pollution levels rise, many people turn to air cleaners for relief. This is important because the air that circulates inside your house is not cleaner than the one outside as you might have presumed. Actually, indoor air can be more polluted than the air outside, putting you at risk for a number of health conditions, including allergies, asthma, and other respiratory problems. Air purifiers are devices which help in removing viruses, bacteria, and various matter particulates present in air. These products are different from air cleaners in their size, cost, area of purification and application. Air purifiers are now being viewed as a necessity, instead of a luxury product, due to increasing air pollution across towns and cities. Residential as well as commercial users are progressively adopting air purifiers for upholding a cleaner, less-polluted environment. ""People should adopt new technologies for a healthy lifestyle. Daikin revolution for curbing indoor air pollution with the use of latest technology is a great move. I feel with our range of air purifiers we will be able to serve the wellbeing of people, ""says Kanwal Jeet Jawa, MD and CEO, Daikin India. Daikin air purifier is partner for HT Leadership Summit, 2017. The major drivers of the global air purifiers market are increasing air pollution anxieties, rising usage of HEPA technology, growing respiratory diseases, growing consumer expenditure on lifestyle products./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

KEEP CALM AND BREATHE EASY,"New Delhi, Dec. 3 -- Waking up to a clear blue sky and breathing fresh air is what one dreams of. But if you're living in the Capital, this might be a farfetched vision. But does it mean we should compromise on our well-being by staying indoors? Well, little do we know that it's not just the polluted air outside which is harmful but the air indoors too, that is unhealthy. This is caused by various indoor activities such as, smoke caused during cooking, dirty furniture and musty carpets, that also contribute to poor air quality. So, here are a few things you can do that will not only improve the air quality in your homes but also improve your wellness quotient:/LET THE AIR OUT/Cooking at home 2-3 times a day produces a lot of smoke and pollutes the air indoors. If there's no exhaust fan in the kitchen, then leave your windows open for a while. Samarth Trehan, an architect, shares, ""One must create spaces to promote healthier lifestyle. Provide proper ventilation in the kitchen to prevent odour and smoke build up. Also, choose better door and windows for increased dust control so that it doesn't contribute to indoor air pollution.""/GOING GREEN/Keep indoor plants such as ubiquitous money plant, peace lily and the areca palm that not only add beauty to the house, but also help in improving the air quality./THROWS FOR YOUR COUCH/A stylish element that can enhance the look of the living room and at the same time keep dirt particles away is a throw. The dust particles tends to settle deep into your sofas and cushions that can lead to dust allergies, but throws will help you combat this./WATCH THOSE DECOR DRAPES/Maximum amount of dust from outdoors easily gets settled on the fabrics of window and door curtains, which is why, washing them regularly is recommended. Trehan, adds, ""You can also go healthy by taking your shoes off before entering the house, regular cleaning and maintaining surfaces.""/USING A STEAMER/Air fresheners only mask the odour in the house, but worsen the indoor air quality. So why not take out the steam machine and use it to add a dose of breeziness indoors? Put organic scented oils to the water and get enchanted by the divine fragrances./DEEP BREATHING EXERCISES/You can also combat indoor air pollution with yoga. Divya Verma, a yoga trainer, says, ""Practicing deep breathing post yoga helps calm one's mind, heart and increases oxygen content in our body, helping in overall well-being.""/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Kotla Test pollution woes: BCCI's poor scheduling puts players' health at risk,"New Delhi, Dec. 3 -- Pollution levels in Delhi hit alarming levels in November for the second year in a row and threatened to disrupt all outdoor activities, leave alone sports. Yet, the Indian cricket board scheduled the Test against Sri Lanka in the Capital for early December. Surprisingly, the schedule was made only in October./On Sunday, top BCCI officials were left red-faced after the second day's play was halted briefly during the post-lunch session as many Sri Lankan players felt the effects of the haze and smoke that blocked the sun altogether for a while./At one point, it appeared the Sri Lanka camp was reluctant to continue playing, before India skipper Virat Kohli's declaration salvaged the situation and allowed the Test to continue. The series that has been sharply criticised by Kohli for burdening the players could easily have been tweaked to allot the final Test to another venue./Instead, it has exposed players from both sides to health issues. Health experts had warned against outdoor activities during last month, when the air pollution was acute and even threatened the Delhi Half Marathon on November 19. Conditions improved but have dipped again in the last few days./Four Sri Lanka players reportedly vomitted, causing concern in the visitors' dressing room. The ICC match referee, David Boon, consulted a doctor before Sri Lanka were persuaded to continue playing./Brushing aside/BCCI acting president, CK Khanna, though blamed the Sri Lankan team for making it an issue./""A crowd of 18,000 people is there. Virat batted all along without a mask. All the spectators are there without wearing any mask. Most Indian cricketers and commentators are from places outside Delhi, but they are not wearing masks. I think Sri Lanka cricketers should focus on cricket,"" he told Hindustan Times./However, sports medicine specialist Dr Rajat Chauhan said, ""It is not safe and not a good idea to host matches at this time. There should be no public events like cricket, golf and marathon. It is not just about 22 players but about the thousands who come to watch cricket. I think BCCI should ensure conditions are safe for play and schedule accordingly. There should have been no match in Delhi.""/Ranji matches affected/The BCCI could have learnt from the experience last year when two Ranji Trophy matches in November had to be abandoned without a ball bowled due to acute smog in the Capital. The ties between Hyderabad and Tripura and Bengal and Gujarat - the second match was scheduled at the Kotla - were cancelled./""Our eyes were hurting the moment we'd go to the wicket. Medical advice was to not go out,"" Vijay Patel, Gujarat coach, told Hindustan Times./The Delhi Half-Marathon went ahead despite dire health warnings and after the organisers had watered the course to allow the dust to settle./The alarm bells rang first when Sri Lanka pacer Lahiru Gamage pulled up clutching his chest, complaining he had problems breathing. Several Sri Lanka players were already wearing masks by then. At that time, around 12.30 pm, the AQI pollution readings at the nearby ITO junction indicated they were in the ""very unhealthy"" bracket./Though play resumed and Sri Lanka removed R Ashwin and Virat Kohli, the second pacer, Suranga Lakmal also walked off not feeling well. Umpires Nigel Llong and Joel Wilson spoke to the captains. Later, Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas as well as India's Ravi Shastri walked into the field to talk to the umpires./Two Sri Lanka support staff members had changed into whites and were ready to come in when Virat Kohli declared to help out./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi air pollution interrupts play in India vs Sri Lanka Test, visitors wear masks on field","India, Dec. 3 -- Acute air pollution in the Capital halted the third Test between India and Sri Lanka for over 15 minutes at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground on Sunday after smog saw visibility dip following the lunch interval. (IND v SL 3rd Test UPDATES | SCORECARD)/As the Sri Lankan fielders trooped out with India skipper Virat Kohli and R Ashwin, the sun had all but disappeared due to heavy smog and several visiting team members wore face masks. The reading at the ITO junction, a few hundred feet away from the ground, indicated ""unhealthy"" conditions while it was ""hazardous"" in many other places in Delhi./Play stopped after Sri Lanka pace bowler Lahiru Gamage doubled up in discomfort after sending down a delivery. The visiting players got into a huddle while Virat Kohli, waiting impatiently after reaching a career-best 240, lay on the ground and stretched, with his home crowd cheering and hoping for a re-start./However, the umpires spoke to the Indian batsmen and the Sri Lanka fielders. Although Gamage resumed and dismissed Ashwin off the very first ball, he walked off the field after a while, helped by a support staff members./The break in play also affected Kohli's focus as he was out for 243, dashing hopes that the India skipper would go on to get his maiden Test triple century./With almost all Sri Lanka players wearing face masks, play was again halted for around five minutes. India coach Ravi Shastri also walked into the field to have a word with the umpires, Nigel Llong and Neol Wilson, before play got under way./It was then the turn of Sri Lanka coach, Nic Pothas, as it appeared the visiting side wanted a break in play till conditions improved. There was no immediate official word./Pollution was at its worse in the second half of November, raising doubts whether the Delhi Half Marathon would go ahead on November 19. Despite repeated health warnings, it was eventually held with the organisers sprinkling water along the race route to help the dust settle./Pollution levels had improved in the last several days, but it dipped on Sunday./Cricket website Espncricinfo reported that the ICC Match Referee David Boon had consulted a doctor during the longer initial break in play./Test matches, usually held during winter months in Delhi, have been halted in the past due to poor light and smog, but pollution seems to have affected an international game for the first time./Two Ranji matches were called off last year due to acute smog and smoke./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Walls that stand up to indoor pollution,"New Delhi, Dec. 3 -- Our walls occupy an important part of our homes. They reflect one of the most important parts of a home's personality as everything from a favourite piece of art work to a photographic piece or pieces of memories are hung on to them. Being the most visible spot of the house also means it has to be always the most spotless part. How can walls help us fight in the uphill struggle against indoor pollution? While we do so many things around our homes to keep it odour free and away from the grip of pollutants, the walls of our homes need to be the starting point in this exercise. Royale Atmos, a revolutionary product from Asian Paints, combines the insights of years of research and a pressing need for our cities to fight the battle against pollution that keeps getting larger with each passing year. It is touted to be the first-of-its-kind product in the Indian market to help the Indian consumer in having cleaner air inside their home. Royale Atmos neutralises and reduces the hazardous pollutant - Formaldehyde. Asian Paints Royale Atmos paint not only helps in fighting with the indoor air pollutants but also in removing foul smell and keeping the air clean./NO MORE FORMALITIES WITH INDOOR POLLUTANTS/The most powerful property of Royale Atmos is that it gets rid of one of the most persuasive and persistent indoor air pollutants, Formaldehyde. Furniture is the skeleton of your house and adds a touch of personal class and character. However in our efforts to sculpt our dream furnishings, we also bring in sources which emit formaldehyde such as plywood, MDF, adhesives etc. The resins used in the manufacture of adhesives degrade and emit formaldehyde. It is present not only in pressed wood products but also in other combustion appliances in your homes. Excess level of Formaldehyde in the air can cause adverse effects such as watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, wheezing, nausea and skin irritation. With its Activated Carbon Technology, Atmos creates the first line of defense against Formaldehyde by snatching its molecules out of the air and neutralising it. When a molecule of the pollutant hits a normal paint, it bounces back, and pollutes the air. However, with Royale Atmos on your walls, this pollutant molecule is destroyed by breaking it down into harmless molecules. This means that the overall formaldehyde level within your home is drastically reduced./RED CARD TO FOUL SMELLS/No matter how clean and tidy you keep your house, foul smells and mal-odours can degrade the indoor air and embarrass you in front of guests when you host a party. Foul smells tend to stick around in your house longer than unwanted guests. These bad odours linger and act as air irritants. Equipped with Activated Carbon Technology, Royale Atmos gives freedom from the shackles of offensive odors within your home and helps to keep the air smelling fresher. Any unpleasant odour in the home like rotten eggs, ammonia, smoke and garlic that act as air irritants and degrade the air quality within the home, can be absorbed by the molecules of the paint; making the air cleaner./AWESOME PAINT, AWESOME PARENT/When you have children in the house, the walls are their canvas to express creativity and scribble their vivid imaginations. As such a paint with excellent washability becomes paramount. Armed with Teflon surface protector, Royale Atmos imparts first-rate scrub and stain resistance. Even the toughest of the stains are easy to clean, which ensures that the little Picasso in house can continue with his art and your beautiful colourful walls remain good-looking for years./VIBRANT COLOURS, YET GREEN AND HEALTHY/No matter which colour you choose to paint your wall with, Royale Atmos assures that it will be green! The Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) present in most paints can cause a variety of harmful effects on people who are exposed to it, depending on exposure. These effects can be mild, like minor irritation in the eyes, throat, nose or skin, or could cause a major burning sensation. Royale Atmos comes with a ""Green Assure Seal"" which means that it is not only environment friendly but also VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) safer. Thus, making it safer for not only pregnant women and children but also anybody with a compromised immune system. Royale Atmos is claimed to be the first Asian Paints product to have a fragrance, instead of the normal chemical smell of paints. The quality of air across Indian cities is deteriorating with time. Amit Syngle, President-Sales, Marketing, Technology and Head-Home Improvement of Asian Paints Ltd. said, ""According to a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO), out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, 13 of them are in India. People recognise that air pollution has a detrimental effect on their health. In such an alarming situation, we present a solution to our consumers by launching Asian Paints Royale Atmos. This is a first of its kind product which will not only beautify the home but also fight indoor air pollution."" The problem may be severe and in the fight against the enemies within your home, you might have your back against the wall. So makes sure your ""wall"" with Royale Atmos has your back in this fight./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi on the verge of severe pollution levels once again,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 4 -- Delhi is on the brink again. The city is plunging into severe levels of air pollution once again, more than a fortnight after it was engulfed by a week-long haze in November./Monday's average Air Quality Index of Delhi shot up to 390 from 351 on Sunday. An AQI value above 400 on the scale of 500 is considered as severe pollution. Such high levels of pollution were last seen on November 14 when the city had just come out of the week-long haze./""Even though the average AQI is yet to hit severe levels, several monitoring stations in the city such as Shadipur, RK Puram, Anand Vihar, Siri Fort and CRRI had already entered the severe zone,"" said a senior official of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee./The levels of particulate matter - the dominant and one of the most dangerous pollutants - also shot up to alarming levels. At around 7 pm on Monday, the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 had already shot up around 4.5 times the safe standards./While PM concentration had touched 448ug/m3 around 7 pm, the level of PM2.5 had soared to 272ug/m3./According to the Graded Response Action Plan, if the level of PM10 and PM2.5 hits the 500 and 300-mark respectively and stays there for at least two days, emergency measures such as road rationing, shutting down of schools and ban on construction activities would be introduced./Experts said that it is because of the adverse meteorological conditions that pollution levels have spiked again./""The low wind speed and high moisture levels in the air have pushed up pollution levels. While on one hand the moisture is trapping the pollutants in the air, the calm winds are not being able to flush out the pollutants. Pollutants are accumulating,"" said D Saha, head of the air quality laboratory at CPCB./The regional weather forecasting centre at New Delhi has forecast that there could be light rain on Wednesday. Monday's partially cloudy sky was a prelude to the coming rains./""An outflow of the cyclone has reached northwest India. This is likely to trigger some light rain or drizzle on Wednesday. There could be some thunder on Tuesday evening. On Thursday we are expecting some shallow fog after which the sky could clear up as winds could pick up speed again,"" said Kuldeep Srivasatava, a scientist with the regional weather forecast department./SAFAR, India's official pollution forecasting system under the union ministry of earth sciences, has forecast that pollution levels could rise till Thursday./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How's that Indian cricket? The choke is on us,"India, Dec. 4 -- It's like trying to bowl in a gas chamber. The National Green Tribunal has slammed the organisers for holding the final Test match between India and Sri Lanka at Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla in the face of hazardous air quality. It has reason to be upset. In a first-ever incident of its kind in the 140-year-history of the gentleman's game, an international cricket team wore anti-pollution masks while fielding and had to be persuaded to play on./But it isn't the first time questions have been raised over the fitness of Delhi's air for athletes. In November 2016, two Ranji Trophy matches slated to be played in Delhi - Gujarat against Bengal at the Feroz Shah Kotla, and Hyderabad versus Tripura at the Karnail Singh Stadium - were called off. Last month, when the air pollution was severe, doctors had warned against outdoor activities and participating in the Delhi Half Marathon. On Sunday, Javier Ceppi, tournament director of the FIFA U17 World Cup held recently in India, said athletes' health is being compromised. ""You can't host sport events in Delhi from Diwali till end of Feb, at least. It is a fact. We had to accommodate our whole schedule to avoid it and others should also think about athletes' health first #DelhiSmog,"" he tweeted./Sporting activity leads to inhalation of greater volumes of fine pollutants of Particulate Matter 10 and Particulate Matter 2.5 that can collect in the lungs and cause irreversible injury to the tissue, leading to chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema and even lung cancer. The Central Pollution Control Board has admitted as much. Our credibility as a sporting venue is dented. With an air quality index (AQI) measure of 368 on Sunday - deemed to be 'very poor' by the pollution control board - such incidents are likely to hit India's dreams of hosting big ticket events such as the Olympics and the football World Cup. With the deterioration in air quality, it is unlikely the International Olympic Committee or FIFA will imperil the health of athletes from around the world./The green panel tore into the Delhi government on its inaction . ""The next stage is emergency levels. Tell us one thing that the government, corporations, state pollution control boards have done in the last four days. Look at the people abandoning the match."" More people die of pollution in India than anywhere else in the world. According to the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, 2.5 million Indians succumbed to pollution-related health problems in 2015 alone. Health ministry data suggests 10 people died of respiratory issues every day in the national capital region. Last month, when the AQI levels went higher than 200, declaring that Delhi was in the grip of a health emergency, the Indian Medical Association warned schools to refrain from giving permissions to cricket matches and marathons. What makes the Board of Control for Cricket in India think it can get away with exposing cricketers and thousands of spectators to noxious pollution? What is the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority for the national capital region (EPA) doing? Whatever happened to the city's much vaunted Graded Response Action Plan? The Centre and the AAP government seem to be playing a game of pass the buck. Do we need drastic interventions such as the Supreme Court's ban on crackers? For the sake of the city, every stakeholder affected by pollution - whether it is the State, residents and non-profits - need to forget their differences to adopt cleaner practices and technologies and display the political will to take on air pollution. We cannot continue to choke our way through as usual./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Angelo Mathews hits ton after two years, Sri Lanka fightback against sloppy India","India, Dec. 4 -- Angelo Mathews cashed in on India's sloppy catching to hit his first century for over two years to lead Sri Lanka's fightback on the third day of the final Test at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground on Monday.

Substitute fielder Vijay Shankar then palmed one over his head at deep mid-off off left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja when Mathews was on 104 to extend India's pain on the field./R Ashwin, bowled sparingly as Kohli used the pacers with Jadeja, finally got Mathews to edge coming around the wicket. He hit 14 fours and two sixes in his 268-ball knock./On 192 for three at lunch, adding just 61 runs in the morning, Mathews and Chandimal were marginally more enterprising, adding 78 runs in the middle session./However, India's slip catching remained a growing concern with the South Africa tour looming as the constant switch in personnel didn't help matters./Mathews, whose last Test century was against India at Colombo in August, 2015 had gone 19 matches without one. But he cashed in after two reprievals, bringing up his century with a single to square leg off Ishant Sharma, two balls after the second drop./After pollution stoppages marred the second day's play post lunch, there were no interruptions on Monday. However, a thick haze hung over the ground and the floodlights were switched on at around 1pm./A few Sri Lankan players sat on the dressing room balcony and may have been vindicated after the National Green Tribunal criticised the Delhi government for allowing the match despite severe air pollution./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
