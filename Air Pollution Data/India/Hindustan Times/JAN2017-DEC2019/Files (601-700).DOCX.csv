4 mn kids get asthma every year due to vehicular pollution: Report,"NEWDELHI, April 12 -- Noxious fumes from traffic cause four million new cases of childhood asthma every year, of which 350,000 occur in India, according to the first global study that makes a case for tougher air pollution laws worldwide to protect children./Traffic pollution-attributable childhood asthma was low in India, which ranked 58th among 194 countries./South Korea was the worst affected, with 31% children affected by noxious vehicular emissions, with China ranking 19, the United Kingdom/24, and the United States 25, found a health impact assessment of children in 194 countries and 125 major cities worldwide, published in The Lancet Planetary Health./Eight of 10 cities with the highest proportion of cases/were in China, along with Moscow in Russia, and Seoul in South Korea./There was huge variation in the proportion of cases attributable to traffic emissions across cities./The variation ranged from 6% in Orlu, Nigeria, to 48% in Shanghai, China./The study uses nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as an indicator of traffic pollution. In most urban centres, road traffic accounts for up to 80% of ambient NO2, which is produced largely by diesel vehicles. It accounts for 13% of childhood asthma linked to traffic pollution./With 92% of cases emerging in areas that have traffic pollution levels below WHO guidelines of 40ug/m3 (21 parts per billion), the study authors suggest that this limit be reviewed./""NO2 levels may not be high all the time but during winter at high traffic zones and around power plants, it occasionally breaches the standard.

"DELHI IS AT THE FOREFRONT, OTHERS ARE IN DENIAL: DIA","New Delhi, April 27 -- Every day, for me, is Earth Day,"" iterates actor Dia Mirza, when we caught up with her on Earth Day (April 22). The UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador is a nature lover and has been raising her voice for eco-friendly causes for a long time now. ""It is important to recognise why the world needs to collectively acknowledge that we coinhabit this incredible planet,"" explains the actor, adding, ""Our lives, our well-being is completely interdependent with wildlife and nature. And above all, this is the day to consciously acknowledge that Earth is our only home.""/Currently shooting in Himachal Pradesh for a web series, the Sanju (2018) actor has a deep connection with the Capital. The actor's inlaws stay here and she shares that she constantly worry about their health in light of Delhi's deteriorating air quality. ""14 of the most polluted cities in the world are in India. While Delhi has been at the forefront of demanding solutions for air pollution, what is deeply worrying is that fact that all the other cities seem to be served by governments that are in abject denial. Mumbai has been suffering from severely hazardous air quality as well. My mother has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), my in-laws live in Delhi and it is worrying to know how deeply the poor air quality affects their lives... This also fuels my purpose to ensure I make more people aware and demand measures that will improve the quality of air in our cities.""/Not everyone stands up for environmental causes. But Mirza does and recently she even joined Healing Himalayas, the NGO and its young team to clean the hillsides. Talking about her inspiration, she says, ""I am inspired by my love for nature and compelled by the suffering of all those who are affected by climate crises, air pollution and environmental degradation. It is always the most marginalised, women and children that endure the harshest realities of climate change.""/Asked is a celebrity presence enough to bring a change? ""I do believe that each one of us has the power to impact positive change.

World's worst air pollution finally emerges as an election issue in India,"India, April 29 -- Promises to fight the world's most toxic air have made it to the manifestos of major political parties for the first time in Indian elections./Major political parties such as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, the opposition Indian National Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have pledged to combat the crisis by taking measures ranging from setting deadlines, introducing new emission standards to promoting electric vehicles in a bid to fight toxic air. That is a change from the 2014 elections when none of the party manifestos had any mention of clean air or pollution./India, home to world's top ten cities with the worst air quality, has been struggling to contain a deadly haze that killed an estimated 1.24 million citizens in 2017. In the past, governments have pledged millions of dollars and deployed extra teams to enforce existing environmental laws that include banning farmers from burning their fields. But the sheer scale of India's toxic skies has made progress difficult./Air pollution on the agenda:/It is a ''good sign'' that political parties haven't ignored air pollution, according to Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research at advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment. ""The intent and the purpose have to get much clearer and sharper through strong political mandate for real action afterwards,"" she said in a phone interview./A recent study by The Lancet found 77 percent of India's 1.4 billion people exposed to air far dirtier than recommended limits. The poor are the worst hit by pollution, according to The Lancet./The bigger political parties' focus on pollution should eventually trickle down to manifestos and agendas of regional parties, according to Hem Himanshu Dholakia, senior research associate at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water. ""Air pollution can be solved through action by both the center and states in terms of tackling local sources, for example, waste burning, which will require more action from local bodies,"" Dholakia said./The South Asian nation's deadly air, especially in winter, is caused due to a combination of farm stubble burning, firecrackers, vehicular emissions and weather conditions./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"In poll season, officials fail to act against farmers burning stubble in Punjab","CHANDIGARH, May 10 -- Despite a ban by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on stubble burning and the Supreme Court order on its strict compliance, a large number of farmers in Punjab, particularly in the Malwa region, are resorting to burning of wheat crop residue leading to air pollution./With the Lok Sabha elections around the corner and campaigning in full swing, the state machinery, particularly the agriculture department, and the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) are turning a blind eye to this malpractice./During a visit to various areas in the Patiala, Sangrur, Bathinda and Faridkot districts, an HT team found that farmers were indulging in burning of stubble and to cover it up, they were seen irrigating and ploughing the fields immediately after the stubble got burnt completely./The scale of smoke emitted by burning wheat stubble is not huge as compared to the paddy stubble because farmers are setting fields on fire after storing a major portion of the stubble for dry fodder after harvest./""We are not setting on fire the entire stubble as in case of paddy. We burn only the leftover after making dry fodder from the chaff after harvest,"" said a farmer in Upli village of Sangrur district./As per figures given by the Punjab state remote-sensing department, 150 cases of stubble burning have been reported in Malwa region. Most of these cases were reported in the current week. No case has been registered against the defaulters so far./'Making farmers aware':?Agri director/""We are making farmers aware but still there are some who resort to the malpractice,"" said director, agriculture, Sutantar Kumar Airi./He added that due to delay in wheat harvesting, farmers have got a very short time for cotton sowing for which 10-15 days are the best-suited period./According to Airi, the agriculture department is also making efforts to increase the area under cotton cultivation from the last year's 2.74 hectares to 4 lakh hectares this season./The practice of paddy stubble burning in the state is rampant. After the end of paddy harvesting last year, 43,000 cases of stubble burning were reported. The Punjab government, in a report sent to the Centre, had said the state can't do much in checking the stubble burning, as the machines supplied were only for covering 30% of 74.5 lakh acres under paddy cultivation. The state hopes a visible change next year, despite the fact that 25,922 subsidised machines to manage straw were rolled out in state farms./A PPCB official, seeking anonymity, accepted that farmers are indulging in wheat stubble burning, but it was going unnoticed because of dry weather conditions, helping smoke to spread out unlike during the onset of winters when burning of paddy stubble leads to a thick layer of smog. He added that no action has been initiated against the farmers./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"In 15 years, under-5 child deaths in India halved: Lancet study","New Delhi, May 16 -- India has more than halved the annual deaths among children under five years, from 2.5 million in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2015, but wide disparities remain between states, a Lancet study has found./Assam's under-5 death rate is close to eight times that in Goa, which reported 9.7 such deaths per 1,000 live births compared to Assam's 73.1, found researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health after analysing government health survey data on the causes of under-5 deaths from 2000-2015./India has the world's biggest birth cohort, with 26 million babies born every year, and the largest number of child deaths./The top causes of under-5 deaths are pre-term birth complications, preventable infectious diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea, followed by injuries, meningitis, measles and malaria, according to the study published in The Lancet Global Health./""We were surprised and impressed with the rapid decrease in under-5 deaths, which was the result of better access to care, improved health services and appropriate treatment, and reduction in risk factors, such as under-nutrition, indoor air pollution and improved immunisation coverage in some states,"" said study co-author Dr Brian Wahl, assistant scientist and faculty at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US./Despite progress across India, disparities widened within states over 15 years, with the ratio between the highest regional mortality rate (northeast region) versus the lowest (southern region) increasing from 1.4 in 2000 to 2.1 in 2015, the study found./""Even in the states doing well, there are intra-district variations. The government has taken impressive steps. Ayushman Bharat and strengthening public health infrastructure, including training mid-level providers and setting up 150,000 health and wellness centres, will further improve access, affordability and quality of care, but these gains take at least half a decade or one decade to show results,"" said Raj Panda, additional professor, maternal and child health, Public Health Foundation of India./""We know what works. Deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea are largely vaccine preventable... Increasing access to these interventions and investing in strengthening health systems can help address these challenges,"" said Wahl./To accelerate reductions in deaths, the study recommends universal immunisation and promoting standard care strategies for newborns. ""India can accelerate its reduction of under-five mortality rates by scaling up vaccine coverage, improving neonatal care,"" said lead author Li Liu, assistant professor at the Bloomberg School./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Industries playing a choke on Mumbai,"India, June 5 -- Emission from industries, power plants and biofuel emission and open burning in the city accounted for 63% of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 sources in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in 2018./Ahead of this year's World Environment Day (June 5), data released by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Union earth sciences ministry, calculated source apportionment for PM 2.5 pollutant and PM10 in 2018 (see box)./""Air pollution sources in cities like Delhi and Pune are mainly from vehicular emissions. However, in Mumbai, the main problem is slum areas that use biofuel (black carbon for cooking) or burn waste openly,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. ""Combined with this, emission from industries was responsible for almost two-thirds of PM2.5 share in Mumbai's air last year.""/According to the state, Mumbai's slums occupy 12% of its geographical area while industries are spread across a little over 3%. ""If the Centre's policy of providing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to below poverty line families under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) is implemented properly across slum areas, it will help reduce a large proportion of particulate pollution. Secondly, stricter emission norms are needed for industrial emissions and for thermal power plants across MMR.""/SAFAR also released annual and seasonal data for PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 (smallest and deadliest PM) that witnessed an overall increase from 2017 to 2018. The PM levels were much above safe limits during all seasons except monsoon. Even the annual average of PM levels was above the safe limit. (see box)/The share of PM1 in winter in Mumbai in 2017 and 2018 was as high as 43 and 44 microgrammes per cubic metre, which was at par with levels in Delhi, and much above levels in Pune and Ahmedabad, said Beig. ""PM1 is an ultrafine invisible killer pollutant. The share of PM1 in PM2.5 mainly comes from vehicular emission and fossil fuel burning. It is extremely hazardous for our respiratory system,"" he said./While SAFAR suggested recommendations to improve air quality, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said that MMR's five-year air pollution action will tackle every emission source raised by SAFAR (see interview). ""The situation in Mumbai is still under control as the city has a distinct advantage of sea breeze throughout disperses pollutants generated from man-made sources,"" said Beig./Owing to air pollution, city-based doctors said children were at twice the risk of adults to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis; hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asthma during post-monsoon and winter months. ""Research suggests that continuous exposure to noxious particles weakens children's lungs,"" said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist, department of chest medicine, Lilavati Hospital in Bandra./Independent researchers said a multisector time-bound clean air action plan needs to be executed./""The power sector has to adopt new standards notified by the Centre this year. The PMUY scheme can address the major biofuel emission concern, but it needs to be leveraged so that it actually reaches every nook and corner of the city,"" said Anumita Roy Choudhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Stop your morning walks, pollution in Noida 7 times national level","India, June 12 -- According to experts, the accumulation of both fine and coarse particles in the morning air could be attributed to dust and garbage burning and illegal industries such as scrapping, if operational in the region./On Tuesday, the values of PM2.5 and PM10 (particles with a diameter over 2.5 and 10 microns) were well above five times the safe or permissible limit according to Indian standards./As per data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), PM2.5 ranged from 300ug/m3 to/373ug/m3 between 5am and 8am on Tuesday. PM2.5 further worsened to 404ug/m3 by 10am. Meanwhile, the value of PM10 during the hours mostly preferred by fitness enthusiasts was 500ug/m3 (between 5am and 11am)./While Tuesday morning saw heavy winds causing dust pollution and creating a haze in the city, the pollution levels of the city were well above standard on Sunday and Monday. On both days, the PM2.5 value soared to/461ug/m3 by 7am, which was seven times more than the national standard, and 14 times higher as per standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO)./The permissible limit for PM2.5 is 60ug/m3 as per Indian standards, while for the WHO it is 25 ug/m3. For PM10, the safe limit is 100ug/m3 as per Indian standards, while the WHO considers/60ug/m3 as a safe limit. ""Pollution definitely makes its presence known, especially in the morning when I'm running or jogging. It happens mostly in winters, but my friends and I are feeling it now as well,"" says Rajiva Singh, a Noida-based triathlete who never misses a morning run or cycling session./Experts pointed out that multiple sources generate pollutants which congregate during morning hours due to relatively lower temperatures, low winds, and lower mixing height./""These figures are abnormal. The reason why the pollution level is higher during morning hours today is mostly because there were violations during evening hours yesterday. Garbage burning, illegal industrial activities, uncovered construction sites, road repair works are major reasons,"" Shambhavi Shukla, senior research associate and an expert on air pollution, Centre for Science and Environment, said./According to activists, the city sees multiple violations in terms of open garbage burning during the evening, while many builders' allegedly irresponsible behaviour leads to dust pollution./""Garbage is often burned towards evening and early morning hours at several places across the city and remains undetected due to the timings. This is a common sight in most places such as Sector 140A and other places,"" says Noida based environment activist Amit Gupta./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

All fellow countrymen are familiar with the atmosphere prevailing in the country before 2014. In order to take the country out of a sense of gloom and instability, the people elected a Government with absolute majority after three decades. Giving the highest regard to that mandate, my Government started to march forward without any discrimination with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas', to create a New India./9. on January 31stthis year, in this very Central Hall, I had said that my Government from the very first day was dedicated to the goal ofimproving the lives of all citizens, addressing their problems arising out of mis-governance and providing all basic amenities to the last person standing at the margins of society./10. During the last five years, the countrymen have come to believe that the Government is always with them, working to improve their lives and to enhance their Ease of Living. Based on this wealth of people's trust, a fresh mandate was sought./Also Read |?Masood Azhar's terrorist tag shows world stands with India: President Kovind/11. People of the country have long waited for the basic amenities of life. But now the conditions are changing. My Government wants to make the people conscious, capable, well-provided and unfettered to such an extent that that they do not feel the ""Burden, Force, or Absence"" of the Government in their daily life. Empowering every person in the country is the main goal of my Government./Honourable Members,/12. My Government is committed to that very idea of nation-building, the foundation for which was laid in 2014. While fulfilling the basic needs of the countrymen, now the Government is moving forward towards realising their aspirations of building a Strong, Safe, Prosperous and All-inclusive India. This journey is inspired by the basic spirit of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas'./This New India's vision is motivated by the noble thoughts of/Shri Narayana Guru Kerala's great spiritual figure, social reformer and poet:/""Jaati-Bhedam Mat-Dwesham AdumIlladey Sarvrum/Sodar-tvain Vaadunn Matrukasthan Maanit""/That is, an ideal place is one where people live like brothers free from the discrimination of caste and religion./13. Three weeks ago, on 30thMay, immediately after swearing-in the Government has started working towards building a New India. A New India:/- Where equal opportunities to progress are available to every person;/- Where life of every person becomes better and their self-esteem is enhanced;/- Where brotherhood and harmony bind the people with each other;/- Where the foundation built on our ideals and values becomes stronger; and/- Where the benefits of development reach every region and the last person standing in the queue./This New India, will move forward towards that ideal state envisioned by Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore, where the mind of the people is without fear and the head is held high with self-esteem. In Gurudev's words:/""Chitto Jetha Bhay-Shunno, Uchcho Jetha Shir.""/Honourable Members,/14. It is a matter of pride for every Indian that when our country completes 75 years of independence in 2022, we would have achieved many national goals for building a New India. To pave the way for the golden future of New India, my Government has resolved:/* On this path of a New India, the rural India will be strong and urban India will also be empowered;/* On this path of a New India, the entrepreneurial India will attain new heights and the dreams of young India will also be fulfilled;/* On this path of a New India, all systems will be transparent and the prestige of honest countrymen will increase further;/* On this path of a New India, infrastructure for the 21stcentury will be built and all resources for creation of a powerful India will be mobilised./In the light of these resolutions, in a short period of 21 days, my Government has taken many decisions aimed at the welfare of farmers, soldiers, students, entrepreneurs, women and other sections of society and have also started implementing them. Initiatives have also been taken to enact several new laws./15. A decision has been taken to increase the income support to farmers who are our Annadaata, by extending the coverage under 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi', to every farmer in the country. To enable the farmer brothers and sisters who work day and night in their fields to lead a respectable life after attaining the age of 60 years, a 'Pension Scheme' for them has also been approved./16. Livestock is invaluable for farmers. They have to spend a lot of money for treatment of cattle-related diseases. To reduce this expenditure, my Government has also decided to start a special scheme with an allocation of Rs 13,000 crore./17. For the first time, a Government has taken note of the economic security of small shopkeepers. In the very first meeting of the Cabinet, a separate 'Pension Scheme' has been approved for small shopkeepers and retail traders. About 3 crore small shopkeepers in the country will benefit from this scheme./18. We are all indebted to the soldiers who dedicate themselves to protect the countrymen by sacrificing every joy, every pleasure and every festive occasion. It is our duty to secure the future of children of those who guard the border, and ensure peace and security for everyone. Inspired by this sentiment, the amount of scholarship under the 'National Defence Fund' has been increased for the children of our brave soldiers. For the first time, sons and daughters of the State police personnel have also been included in this scholarship./Honourable Members,/19. One of the biggest challenges of the 21stcentury is - the growing water crisis. Over time, the traditional and effective practices of water conservation in our country are disappearing. Houses have come up over ponds and lakes, and the vanishing water sources have accentuated the water crisis for the poor. In view of the growing impact of Climate Change and Global Warming, water crisis is likely to aggravate further. Today, the need of the hour is that the way the country has shown seriousness about 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan', the same seriousness be shown in 'Water Conservation and Management'./20. We must conserve water for our children and future generations. The creation of the new 'Ministry of Jalshakti' is a decisive step in this direction, which will have far-reaching benefits. Through this new Ministry, the systems related to water conservation and management will be made more effective./21. My Government is fully conscious of the crisis in the drought-hit areas and stands by every affected citizen. With the support of State Governments and Sarpanches at the village level, it is being ensured that farmers are assisted and the scarcity of drinking water is tackled./22. Strengthening the system and spirit of Co-operative Federalism, my Government is taking the States along to achieve the national goals. Last week, important developmental issues were discussed with the Chief Ministers and a decision was taken to constitute a Committee of Chief Ministers to look into Structural Reforms in the field of agriculture./Honourable Members,/23. Only on the foundation of a strong rural economy, it is possible to build a strong national economy. Our farmers are the pillars of rural economy. All possible efforts are being made by the Central Government to provide adequate assistance to the States for agricultural development./24. Large scale investments have been made to strengthen rural India. In order to enhance agriculture productivity, an investment of Rs. 25 lakh crore will be made in the coming years./25. To double the income of farmers by 2022, several steps have been taken in the last 5 years. Be it the decision to increase the MSP, or approval for 100 percent FDI in food processing; be it completion of the irrigation projects pending for decades or extension of 'Crop Insurance Scheme'; be it the 'Soil Health Card'or 100% Neem coating of urea; my Government has taken many decisions, appreciating such numerous small and big needs of the farmers. The Government has made the agriculture policy both production-centric as well as income-centric./26. An important link in these efforts is 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi'. Through this, an amount of more than Rs. 12,000 crore has been disbursed to the farmers in just three months. An estimated expenditure of Rs. 90,000 crore is likely to be incurred annually on this scheme since every farmer has now been brought in its ambit./27. With the provision of storage for farm produce, the economic security of the farmers is strengthened. Now the storage facility will be provided to the farmers near their village through the 'Grameen Bhandaran Yojana'./28. The benefit of cooperatives in the agriculture sector is being availed by the farmers in the dairy business. In other areas of agriculture also, the target is to create 10,000 new 'Farmer Producer Organisations' to benefit the farmers./29. Today, India is second in the world in fish production. Our country has the potential to attain the first place. There is immense potential for increasing the income of farmers through marine fish industry and inland fisheries. That is why the Government is committed to 'Neeli Kranti' which means 'Blue Revolution'. A separate Department has been constituted for integrated development of fisheries. Similarly, a special fund has been created to develop infrastructure related to fishing industry./Honourable Members,/30. We can achieve our constitutional objectives only by liberating the poor families of the country from poverty. During the last five years, the schemes implemented in the country for the welfare of farmers, labourers, divyangjan, tribals and women have achieved wide spread success. Only by empowering the poor can they be rescued from the vicious cycle of poverty. That is why the Government has adopted an approach to empower the poor, deprived and weaker sections through provision of housing, healthcare, essential amenities of life, financial inclusion, education, skill and self-employment. This is in harmony with Deen Dayal Upadhyaya's concept of Antyodaya./31. Comprehensive work is underway for the development of/112 'Aspirational Districts' in the country. 1 lakh 15 thousand most backward villages of the country are in these districts. With the development of education and healthcare facilities and infrastructure in these villages, there will be a positive impact on the lives of crores of poor families./32. After the success of the world's largest financial inclusion campaign, in the form of 'Jan-Dhan Yojana', my Government is also working to bring the banking services to the doorsteps of the people. In order to ensure that banking services are readily available in every village of the country and in the inaccessible areas of North East, work is being done at a fast pace. About 1.5 lakh post offices in the country are being prepared to provide banking services through 'India Post Payment Bank'. Our goal is to utilise the postman as a mobile bank to bring banking services to every doorstep./Honourable Members,/33. Cost of medical treatment pushes the poor families into financial crisis. In order to protect them from this crisis, world's biggest healthcare scheme 'Ayushman Bharat Yojana'has been implemented, providing 'Health-Protection-Cover' to 50 crore poor people. Under this, so far about 26 lakh poor patients have availed treatment in hospitals. In order to provide medicines at affordable rates, 5,300 'Jan Aushadhi Kendras' have also been opened. It is our endeavour to provide medicines at affordable rates to people residing in far-flung areas through these Jan Aushadhi Kendras./34. The objective is to set up about 1.5 lakh 'Health and Wellness Centres' in all rural areas by 2022. So far, about 18,000 such Centres have already been operationalised./35. Our countrymen can learn a lot from tribal communities. Our tribal brothers and sisters live in harmony with the environment and nature and maintain a beautiful balance between development and tradition. In New India, every effort will be made to create an inclusive and sensitive system in the interest of tribal communities. Many schemes have been implemented for all-round development of tribal areas. Work is in progress to provide 'Learning to Earning' facilities to the youth residing in the forest areas. In tribal dominated areas, 'Eklavya Model Residential Schools' are being set up for children. The thrust is on value addition and marketing of forest produce through Van Dhan Kendras./Honourable Members,/36. Women Empowerment is one of the top priorities of my Government. Empowerment of women and their effective involvement in society and economy is the touchstone of a developed society. The Government's thinking promotes not only women's development but also women-led development. According the highest priority to women's security, several effective steps have been initiated with the cooperation of the States. Penalties for crimes against women have been made harsher and the new penal provisions are being strictly enforced. The 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao'campaign has brought down female foeticide and improved the sex ratio in many districts of the country./37. Rural women are the biggest beneficiaries of freedom from smoke through 'Ujjwala Yojana', vaccination through 'Mission Indradhanush' and free electricity connections under 'Saubhagya' Yojana. Women are also being given priority in the registration of houses built under 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana'in the rural areas. Under this scheme, nearly 2 crore new houses will be built in the villages during the next three years./38. Facilities for the women workers in the unorganized sector are also being augmented. Self-employment opportunities are being made available to rural women through 'Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rashtriya Aajivika Mission. Under the 'Rashtriya Aajivika Mission', loans amounting to more than Rs 2 lakh crore have been disbursed so far to 3 crore women in rural areas./39. My Government is committed to make women equal stakeholders in the country's development and prosperity. Efforts will be made in collaboration with industry and corporate sector to provide better employment opportunities to women. In addition, in Government procurement, priority will be given to those enterprises where women's participation in the workforce is more than the prescribed limit./40. To secure equal rights for every sister and daughter in the country, eradication of social evils like 'Triple Talaq' and 'Nikah-Halala' is imperative. I would urge all the members to cooperate in these efforts to make the lives of our sisters and daughters better and dignified./Honourable Members,/41. Our young generation must have a meaningful participation in the building of New India. In the last five years, attempts have been made for developing the skills of the youth, providing them financial support for start-ups and self-employment, and making available adequate number of seats for higher education. The amount of scholarship has also been increased by 25 per cent./42. The Government has made provision of 10 per cent reservation for youth from economically weaker section of the general category. This will enable them to get more opportunities in employment and education./43. To enable the youth of all strata of society to fulfil their dreams, timely provision of financial resources is being emphasised. The impact of 'Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna'has been felt on a big scale. Under this scheme, about 19 crore loans have been disbursed for self-employment. An effort will now be made to cover 30 crore people by expanding this scheme. A facility for entrepreneurs to avail loan up to Rs. 50 lakh without any guarantee will also be introduced. Apart from this, new employment opportunities will be generated through appropriate policies in sectors which have the potential to accelerate the economy./44. Today India has joined the league of countries with most number of start-ups in the world. To improve the start-up ecosystem, the Government is simplifying the rules. This campaign will be further expedited. Our goal is to establish 50,000 start-ups in the country by 2024./45. Research is being encouraged in higher educational institutions. To further strengthen this effort, it is proposed to establish a 'National Research Foundation'. This proposed foundation will work as a bridge between different Departments of the Central Government, science laboratories, higher educational institutions and industrial institutions./46. To enable various higher educational institutions of India to find a place in the top 500 educational institutions of the world, they are being encouraged through grant of autonomy and financial assistance./47. My Government is striving to increase the number of seats in the country's Higher Education System by one-and-a-half times by 2024. With this initiative, 2 crore additional seats would be available for the youth in higher educational institutions./Honourable Members,/48. It is our responsibility to provide appropriate opportunities, environment and quality education to enhance the talent of children. In this regard, the 'Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme' will be started./49. In order to attract children early enough, at the school level, towards technology, suitable infrastructure is being created. Through the 'Atal Innovation Mission', the work of establishing 'Atal Tinkering Labs' in about 9,000 schools across the country, is progressing rapidly. Similarly, 'Atal Incubation Centres' are being set up in 102 universities and other institutions./50. Impressive performance in sports competitions at the world level, enhances the pride of the country as well as increases the interest of children and youth in sports. It also strengthens the culture of according primacy to health in life. To make India a global sports powerhouse, it is important that talented players living in far-flung areas of the country are identified and their selection process is made transparent. To identify the players at the state and district level, it has been decided to widen the 'Khelo-India Programme'. Under this, 2,500 talented players have been selected, and are being trained. Now this facility will be provided to 2,500 new players every year./51. The sports infrastructure in the country will be modernised as well as expanded. A new system is being evolved to make available modern infrastructure and facilities to the players. It is our endeavour that our players win high accolades in the sports world and enhance the prestige of our country./Honourable Members,/52.

Inflation is low, fiscal deficit is under control, foreign exchange reserves are growing and the impact of Make In India is clearly visible./53. India is now on the way to become the world's 5thlargest economy in terms of GDP. To maintain the high growth rate, reform process will continue.

In this sequence, necessary amendments are also being brought in the Companies Law./55. Taxation regime plays an important role in accelerating economic development. Along with continuous reform, simplification of taxation system is also being emphasised. Exemption to persons earning up to Rs. 5 lakh from payment of income tax is an important step in this direction./56. Similarly, indirect tax system is also being made simple and effective. With the implementation of GST, the concept of 'One country, One tax, One market' has become a reality. Efforts to further simplify the GST will continue./57. Keeping in view the interests of small traders, my Government has launched a New Pension Scheme for them.

The 'Fugitive and Economic Offenders Act' has proved effective in controlling fugitive economic offenders. Now we are receiving information in this regard from 146 countries, including Switzerland. Of these, we have concluded agreements with 80 countries for automatic exchange of information. We are now receiving information about all those who have stashed black money abroad./63. The impact of 'Real Estate Regulation Act' or RERA is clearly visible in curbing black money transactions in real estate sector and protecting the interests of the customers; providing huge relief to the middle class families./64. 'Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code' is among the biggest and most impactful economic reforms undertaken in the country. With the coming into force of this Code, banks and other financial institutions have been able to settle directly or indirectly an amount of more than Rs. 3 lakh 50 thousand crore. This Code has also curbed the tendency of wilfully defaulting on loans taken from banks and other financial institutions./65. Under the 'Direct Benefit Transfer', funds from more than/400 schemes are being directly credited into the accounts of beneficiaries. During the last five years, Rs. 7 lakh 30 thousand crore have been transferred through DBT. So far, not only has DBT prevented Rs. 1 lakh 41 thousand crore from falling into wrong hands, but it has also enabled deletion of names of about 8 crore ineligible beneficiaries. DBT will be further expanded in the coming days. I would urge the State Governments to use DBT in more and more schemes./Honourable Members,/66.

My Government's ""Neighborhood First"" policy is an evidence of our approach of according priority to South Asia and countries in the adjoining region. India will play a crucial role in the progress of this region. Accordingly, trade, connectivity and people-to-people contact are being encouraged in this region.

India had to pass through a long period of subjugation. But throughout this period, Indians kept fighting for independence in different parts of the country. The longing for freedom and willingness to make sacrifices to achieve freedom had never waned. This desire for independence culminated into the 'Quit India Movement' in 1942, when the entire nation was determined to achieve independence and even to sacrifice their lives in this cause. Contributing to the freedom struggle was the only thought behind all the actions of our countrymen. We achieved our independence in 1947 on the strength of this collective spirit./100. Today, all of us are again at a juncture of creating history. We are striving to launch a new movement for ushering in a new era. Our resolve today will determine the shape of the India of 2047 when we celebrate the centenary of our independence./101. Today, our country is enriched with the experiences of a 72-year journey since independence. The nation is moving ahead only by learning from these experiences. All of us have to move ahead with the resolve to realise the idea of New India by the year 2022 when we celebrate the 75thanniversary of India's independence. Thus, in the New India in the 75thyear of its independence:/- Farmers' income will be doubled;/- Every poor will have a pucca roof over his head;/- Every poor will have access to clean fuel;/- Every poor will have electricity connection;/- No poor will be compelled to defecate in the open;/- Every poor will have access to medical facilities;/- Every village in the country will be connected by roads;/- River Ganga will flow uninterrupted, and pollution free;/- In collaboration with States, India will be close to becoming a $ 5 trillion economy;/- We will be progressing towards joining world's three largest economies;/- An Indian will unfurl the tri-colour in space, entirely on the strength of indigenous resources; and/- We will provide leadership to global development with a new zeal and confidence./Honourable Members,/102. If the gap between the public and the Government is reduced, and public partnership is ensured, our countrymen can transform Government schemes and programmes into mass movements. This is the way forward to achieve transformative national goals. Adopting this approach, programmes like the 'Beti-Bachao, Beti-Padhao', and 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' evolved into mass movements. On the strength of people's participation, we will also achieve the objective of a New India./Honourable Members,/103. It is the belief of my Government that political parties, States and 130 crore countrymen are all committed to India's integrated and accelerated development. Our vibrant democracy has also matured adequately.During the last few decades, due to frequent elections being held in some part of the country or the other, the pace and continuity of development programmes have been impacted. Our countrymen have demonstrated their wisdom by delivering a clear verdict both at State and National issues. 'One Nation - Simultaneous Elections' is the need of the hour, which would facilitate accelerated development, thereby benefitting our countrymen. With such a system in place, all political parties, according to their respective ideologies, will be able to better utilise their energy towards development and public welfare. Therefore, I urge all Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over this development oriented proposal of 'One Nation - Simultaneous Elections'./Honourable Members,/104. This year also marks 70 years of adoption of the Indian Constitution. As a Member of Parliament, all of you have undertaken the oath or affirmation to discharge your duties with true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India. The Constitution is paramount to all of us. The chief architect of our Constitution, Babasaheb/Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar had said that 'we must hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives'./105. Our Constitution provides guidance for ensuring social, economic and political justice as well as securing liberty and equality for all citizens; and promote fraternity among all, assuring the dignity of the individual./106. I believe that you all Members of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, as parliamentarians, will make invaluable contributions in achieving the ideals of the Constitution while discharging your duties. In this way, you will contribute effectively in ushering in a New India./107. All of us will have to accord priority to our duties as public representatives and as citizens of the country. Only then will we be able to inspire countrymen to discharge their duties as citizens./108. My advice to all MPs is that you should always remember the fundamental mantra of Gandhiji. He had said that every decision of ours should be guided by its impact on the poorest and the weakest person in the society. You must also remember the voter who setting aside all his work and overcoming his difficulties went to the polling station to cast his vote and discharge his responsibilities towards the nation. Your priority should be to fulfil his aspirations./109. I urge you all to dedicate yourselves in the task of building a New India and to discharge your duties with utmost sincerity over the next five years. I once again wish the very best to all of you./Jai Hind!/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

1 in 3 traffic cops on city roads suffers lung ailments: Study,"New Delhi, July 8 -- At least 33% of Delhi traffic police officials, deployed on the city's roads, were detected with breathing ailments while around 23% were diagnosed with stress and hypertension, findings of health checkups conducted for traffic policemen revealed./The results of a six-month-long health camp organised for traffic officials revealed that around 33% traffic policemen in the national Capital showed signs of asthma, lung congestion, throat irritation and thick sputum. The report also found that 23% officials were experiencing high stress levels and hypertension while some even suffered from low bone density and joint aches./Police officials from each traffic circle were sent for health checkups at two city hospitals. ""These are occupational hazards that come with standing for long hours in the middle of heavy traffic zones. A large number of officials were not even aware of their deteriorating health conditions, their answers to the preliminary questionnaire showed,"" the report by Saroj Super Speciality Hospital read./The traffic department has tied up with other hospitals as well to conduct such checkups regularly. Prolonged exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur oxide (SOx), the primary toxic gases released through vehicular fumes, is a primary cause of lung-related ailments among traffic officials./The rising vehicular population in the city - over 1 crore - adds to the rising levels of air pollution as well./A study detailing the impact of the environment on traffic police officials, published in January 2017, had also showed similar results. The study, conducted by TERI University and the University of Surrey, had suggested that traffic officials have significantly worserespiratoryandcardiovascular health than other office-goers./The study, which compared 523 traffic officials to 150 regular office goers with similar socioeconomic backgrounds and age groups, found that 59% of the surveyed traffic officials reported having thick sputum, as compared to 15% of office-goers. Similarly, 45% more traffic officials reported pain in joints and 39% more reported shortness of breath, compared to office workers. While no office-goers reported coughing with blood, 26% of the surveyed traffic officials reported the symptom./After the study's findings were released, the department had started distributing pollution control masks to all traffic officials. ""We do organise regular health checkups and give our officials safety gear to protect them from the constant exposure to pollution. If any policeman complaints of poor health, we considered transfers as well,"" Taj Hassan, special commissioner of police (traffic), said./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at Centre for Science and Environment, said constant exposure to Delhi's deteriorating air quality not only impacts health but also reduces quality of life in the longer run./""If the average Delhiite is dying 10 years before than those in other cities then these men, who are forced to stay out throughout the day, are dying at a pace two times faster. Unless government comes out with a comprehensive plan for reducing pollution, residents will continue to fall victims to deadly lifestyle diseases,"" Roychowdhury said./Former traffic chief Maxwell Pereira said along with respiratory ailments, officials are under constant stress as they have to deal with instances such as road rage and arguments by motorists./""The stress level is certainly high but that is a part and parcel of the job,"" he said./Experts suggested intervention by providing safety gear and ensuring regular transfers of officials from high traffic zones so that they are not exposed to hazardous conditions for long periods. ""Monetary benefits could also be provided to officials who are stationed at high traffic areas to compensate for the health risks that come with their postings,"" Roychowdhury added./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"NGT asks Punjab, Haryana and UP to submit plan to curb stubble burning","New Delhi, July 10 -- The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to submit their plan for tackling crop residue burning this year, which is a major contributor to air pollution in neighbouring Delhi./The green tribunal has asked the states concerned to file their respective progress reports, including the ""strategies and proposed action plan"" they intend to implement to curb the problem in the current year./Crop residue burning takes place during winter, which is also the time for peak air pollution./A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted that according to news reports, 25-30% of air pollution in the national capital region was caused due to crop burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP. The green court said that the use of drones and satellite imagery to map hot spots, as done in case of forest fires, may also be explored by the states concerned./A study by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) University of Washington estimated that eliminating crop residue burning could add 14.9 million life years in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi that would otherwise be lost to disability and disease. The economic life years lost is estimated to be at least $150 billion over five years according to the IFPRI study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mother's exposure to pollution may lead to shorter babies: Study,"New Delhi, July 15 -- Newborn babies and foetuses of women in their third trimester, who are exposed to high levels of air pollution, are at a higher risk of being shorter for their age or stunted in later life, a study conducted by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, has revealed./The study, of at least 200,000 children born between February 2010 and December 2015, noted the highest decline in height in children born between November and January, when the pollution levels in the country are at the peak./The study was published in the journal, Environmental Health, on last Tuesday./An increase of 100 ug/m3 in the ambient PM2.5 levels during the birth month was associated with a decrease of 0.05 in the heightfor-age, the study found. The study used population data from the Demographic and Health Survey 2015-16 and compared it to satellite-based district level PM 2.5 concentrations during the birth month of the children./A five-year-old girl would be 0.24 cm shorter than average, said study authors. ""It may seem like a small change, especially when compared to the effects of other factors such as nutrition and sanitation, but the effect of ambient air pollution is experienced everywhere in the country and affects 30 million births every year,"" said Sagnik Dey, one of the authors of the study and associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Science at IIT-D, which collaborated with University of Texas and Indian Statistical Institute for the study./""This study adds to the evidence that air pollution also affects the health and development of the next generation. The study accounted for compounding factors like the height of the mother and whether the child is born in a rural or urban setting, but the decrease in the height of children with increase pollution levels was noted across board,"" said Dey./While taller mothers had taller children, a decline in height was noted with an increase in the pollution levels during the birth month. A loss in height was noted in both rural and urban children, although rural children were on average shorter than their urban counterparts./""Other factors like malnutrition and open defecation also play a role in rural areas, but programmes to address air pollution are largely urban centric; even the National Clean Air Programme focuses on the non-attainment cities. The effects of high air pollution are felt in the rural areas, where household pollution is higher due to the use of solid fuels,"" said Dey./Stunting delays cognitive development, lowers school performance and raises morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension in later life./In 2017, 12.5% of all the deaths and 8.1% of all the life years lost due to premature death or disability could be attributed to air pollution, according to the statelevel disease burden study published in The Lancet in 2018./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Goal is to make India a global model for 'Health for All': Harsh Vardhan,"India, July 16 -- Dr Harsh Vardhan began his second term as minister in the National Democratic Alliance - II government by cycling from home to the health and family welfare ministry in Vigyan Bhavan to highlight the importance of physical activity for health and green transport for the environment. He had not even hopped off his bicycle when his staff informed him about a Nipah case being confirmed in Kerala, which was followed a week later by nationwide protests and strikes by doctors and health professionals after two junior doctors were assaulted at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College in Kolkata. Dr Harsh Vardhan speaks to Sanchita Sharma on the firefighting his ministry has done over seven weeks and its plans for the next five years. Edited excerpts:/Q. Your taking charge was immediately followed by one of India's biggest doctors' strikes. How can hospitals be made safer for doctors?/Doctors often work under stressful and difficult conditions and I strongly condemn assault against them. The violence in Kolkata that led to doctors' strikes across the country gravely affected healthcare services. The health ministry has set up a 10-member committee on violence against doctors with representation from the ministry, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Federation of Resident Doctors Association, Medical Council of India, AIIMS, and the Union ministry of home affairs and the law department. The first meeting was on July 10th, during which the home and law ministries concurred on the need for a central legislation. It was decided to have the first draft of the proposed Act readied within a week./I wrote to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, urging her provide a secure working environment to doctors. I also requested all chief ministers to consider establishing specific state legislation or bring amendments in existing state legislative acts to ensure doctors and clinical establishments function without fear of violence./Q. What is the long-term solution to end violence against doctors?/Ensuring a safe environment for doctors and patients and involves multiple stakeholders. Apart from taking all possible preventive and deterrent measures, state governments need to investigate all cases of violence promptly and ensure that the criminals get prosecuted under the legal provisions available. The IMA's draft act, called The Protection of Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss of Property) Act, 2017, which includes clauses on penalty and recovery in case of loss or damage to property, has now been shared with the states for their consideration./Q. Nipah was confirmed in Kerala the day you took charge even as Muzaffarpur was struggling to contain child deaths from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Kerala contained Nipah, but Bihar floundered. How can the Centre ensure containment and treatment protocols are followed across states?/You see, health is a state subject. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) does surveillance to quickly detect and respond to disease outbreaks, providing additional manpower, training rapid response teams to investigate outbreaks, strengthening laboratories, strengthening ICT equipment for data entry, analysis and data transfer, and providing funds for operationalisation./The Centre also supports states in implementing communicable disease programmes, such as National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme that covers six vector-borne diseases, including Japanese encephalitis and AES, which is of unknown etiology./Q. So, what is causing the AES deaths in Muzaffarpur?/AES describes a disease with symptoms of fever and altered consciousness and has a very complex etiology. Studies were done on the possible association with litchi toxins in Muzaffarpur during 2013-14, but no definitive evidence linking AES to litchi toxins was conclusively established./In the present outbreak, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has done research studies covering various aspects of the disease and I am hopeful we will arrive at substantial findings soon./Q. Soon after taking charge, you requested all states that haven't joined the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) to launch the scheme. Rajasthan has announced merging the state healthcare scheme with AB-PMJAY. Did you hear from Delhi, Telangana, Odisha or West Bengal?/The implementation of AB-PMJAY across the country is undoubtedly the top priority. The scheme is going to be rolled out in Rajasthan and Punjab very soon. As a follow-up action, CEO, National Health Agency (NHA), visited Odisha and the state is positive about implementing AB-PMJAY. The NHA is working on the convergence plan. I expect other states to get on board sooner than later./Q. How many people have been treated under AB-PMJAY? Which are the best and worst performing states?/The budget for Ayushman Bharat went up 154.87% this year. Under the health protection scheme, there have been 32,07,000 hospitalisations and 8.9 crore cards issued till July 12./It is difficult to rate states as there are different parameters for performance, such as access, quality etc. Some states that are doing better are Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Jammu &#38; Kashmir, Daman and Diu, Gujarat, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh etc. The NHA continually monitors performance of all states on different parameters and issues guidelines to improve performance./Q. How is primary health care, which can treat 80-90% illnesses, being strengthened?/As you know, delivering Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) through health and wellness centres (HWCs) is a key component of Ayushman Bharat, which is the fulcrum programme being implemented to achieve the proposed goal of universal health care./Our vision is to transform 150,000 sub-health centres (SHC) and primary health centres into AB-HWCs in a phased manner. The target for 2018-19 was 15,000, and the cumulative target for 2019-20 is 40,000 and so on, till we achieve our goal by 2022. We are on track and have at least 19,000 operational AB-HWCs./In addition to investments made through NHM and other programmes to strengthen PHCs/SHCs, central funds are being galvanised. An outlay of Rs 1,200 crore was made as central share for 2018-19, and another Rs 1,600 crore for FY 2019-20. Till now, approvals for more than 52,000 AB-HWCs have been provided to states/Union territories./Q. What about building human resources and technical capacity in resource-deficit regions?/Investments made by the Centre are intended to support creation of IT, upgradation of infrastructure, creating primary health care teams at sub-health centres, posting new cadre of non-physician health workers called community health officers, capacity building, and expanding the range of medicines and diagnostics so that HWC become the first port of call for primary health care./There is a provision of primary health care services related to maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition and some communicable diseases. AB-HWCs will also provide care for acute simple illnesses, screening, prevention and management of chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, mental health, and care for chronic communicable diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy, and elderly and palliative care. All these additions are, of course, incremental and the phasing will depend upon the states./Artificial intelligence (AI) is also being in public health, such as setting up an imaging bio-bank of cancer-related radiology and pathology images of more than 20,000 profiles of cancer patients with focus on the major cancers prevalent in India. AI is also being used for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, which is a side effect of uncontrolled diabetes that can cause blindness./As health minister, which steps will you prioritise to ensure clean air?/This is a subject that involves different ministries and cooperation from various stakeholders, including state governments. During my tenure in the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, we launched the National Clean Air Programme to reduce air pollution through various measures. Cooperation from all stakeholders was sought to lower vehicular emissions, stop stubble burning etc., which adds to air pollution./Under the health ministry, the NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control) is collecting data on acute respiratory illnesses reporting to Emergency departments of six central government hospitals in Delhi. The data is being analysed monthly to track how spikes in AQI (air quality index) is linked with increasing hospitalisations./The ICMR is also conducting a study on 'Health impact assessment in 20 most-polluted cities' in the country to provide an invaluable link between air pollution and health problems./Q. What are your two biggest priorities as health minister?/Preventing all illnesses and ensuring the population has the tools to stay healthy is a priority. One of the key priorities is stopping tuberculosis, which claims more lives than any other infectious disease, by 2025./Moving towards universal health care for each and every citizen of India is the prime minister's dream and we will work hard to make it a reality.

Opinion: Plan required to tackle monsoon problems,"India, July 28 -- It's truly tragic that the Delhi high court had to intervene and remind the Delhi government's Public Works Department about one of its fundamental duties - of preventing waterlogging during monsoon and ensuring the safety of pedestrians as well as motorists./Expressing concern over the traffic snarls as well as the hazards posed by flooding of roads and pavements, resulting in pedestrians falling into open drains and manholes, the high court urged the government to think out of the box and take immediate measures to ensure that rains did not pose any problem or risk to the citizens./Ironically, during the last monsoon too, the Delhi high court had taken suo motu notice of news reports of rain water inundating roads and pavements and reminded the civic authorities of the consequences of its inaction - traffic congestion leading to loss of man hours , burning of additional fuel by idling vehicles causing increased air pollution, spread of water borne and vector-borne diseases. But obviously, the court's directions did not have the desired effect because again this year, citizens are facing the same problem that they do year after year and the high court is again forced to take up the issue./Of course, it is not just in Delhi that the civic authorities remain impervious to the problem of water inundation - one can see that in every major city, year after year. And the toll from people falling into open manholes and drains continue unabated, so also electrocutions caused by snapped power lines./Last month, even as the monsoon set in, two children - Tushar Jha (11) and Rushab Tiwari(10), out to enjoy the rain in Mumbai, died when they touched a staircase that had got charged due to a bunch of electric wires passing by it. Falling trees have also resulted in the snapping of power lines and both Nagesh Nirange (46) and Solanki (22) died (at different places) in Thane district last month from such monsoon-related accidents. Snapped power cables were responsible for deaths in Delhi too. Saleem Saifi (29) died on a flooded street in Fatehpuri Beri this week when an overhead wire fell on him while he was riding a motorbike. Hoshiar Singh(54) , a passerby, also died in an effort to save him./Seems like there is no end to the monsoon woes, thanks to the callous negligence of civic authorities. In Cuttack last month, a combination of rain and absence of street lighting resulted in five-year-old Dibyanshu Behera falling into an open manhole and receiving critical injuries while walking home with his mother./In Goregaon's Ambedkar Nagar in Mumbai, a three-year-old child fell into an uncovered manhole./One can quote any number of such instances from different cities to highlight the incompetence of the civic authorities. Surely, it is not such a difficult job to ensure that the rain water flows smoothly into the storm water drains without flooding the roads, all open manholes, ditches and cuts are properly covered, electricity lines are secured and trees that are weak are replaced before the onset of monsoon?/The problem lies in the absence of accountability; and in the lack of transparency in the working of civic authorities. Today, in this digital age, it should become mandatory for every state government/local body to draw up a plan of action before the monsoon, set a time frame for completion and name all those responsible for execution of the work. There should be an appraisal of this work by independent experts as well as citizens and should form the basis for promotion, demotion and dismissal of those put in charge of the work./Without such measures, one cannot enjoy the monsoon without the accompanying risks./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

And the toll from people falling into open manholes and drains continue unabated, so also electrocutions caused by snapped power lines./Last month, even as the monsoon set in, two children - Tushar Jha (11) and Rushab Tiwari(10), out to enjoy the rain in Mumbai, died when they touched a staircase that had got charged due to a bunch of electric wires passing by it. Falling trees have also resulted in the snapping of power lines and both Nagesh Nirange (46) and Solanki (22) died (at different places) in Thane district last month from such monsoon-related accidents. Snapped power cables were responsible for deaths in Delhi too. Saleem Saifi (29) died on a flooded street in Fatehpuri Beri this week when an overhead wire fell on him while he was riding a motorbike. Hoshiar Singh(54), a passerby, also died in an effort to save him./Seems like there is no end to the monsoon woes, thanks to the callous negligence of civic authorities. In Cuttack last month, a combination of rain and absence of street lighting resulted in five-year-old Dibyanshu Behera falling into an open manhole and receiving critical injuries while walking home with his mother./In Goregaon's Ambedkar Nagar in Mumbai, a three-yearold child fell into an uncovered manhole./One can quote any number of such instances from different cities to highlight the incompetence of the civic authorities. Surely, it is not such a difficult job to ensure that the rain water flows smoothly into the storm water drains without flooding the roads, all open manholes, ditches and cuts are properly covered, electricity lines are secured and trees that are weak are replaced before the onset of monsoon?/The problem lies in the absence of accountability; and in the lack of transparency in the working of civic authorities. Today, in this digital age, it should become mandatory for every state government/local body to draw up a plan of action before the monsoon, set a time frame for completion and name all those responsible for execution of the work. There should be an appraisal of this work by independent experts as well as citizens and should form the basis for promotion, demotion and dismissal of those put in charge of the work./Without such measures, one cannot enjoy the monsoon without the accompanying risks./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Premature deaths a serious issue but not directly related to pollution: Prakash Javadekar,"India, Aug. 4 -- Union minister of information &#38; broadcasting and environment &#38; forests Prakash Javadekar spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran and Jayashree Nandi on a range of issues, including environmental clearances, the Indian Forest Act, and situation in Jammu and Kashmir, mob violence, and criticism from the Opposition that the government was pushing legislations through Parliament without enough discussion. Edited excerpts:/There is speculation and concern about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. A lot of people are of the view that the government has not been able to clear the air on what's happening -- travel advisories in place, pilgrims have been asked to leave./I think the government has made it very clear that there is a perceptible threat perception, and we don't want a terror attack; we want to foil it. Therefore, the governor has made it very clear to not only the delegation of political leaders, but to the people, by giving interviews and holding a press conference that people should not worry, nothing is going to happen dramatically. These are all precautionary measures. I think that suffices the purpose, nothing more should be added at this juncture./Prime Minister Modi spelt out the Kashmir policy when he said ""na gaali se, na goli se...Kashmir samasya suljhe gi gale lagane se"" (not with abuses or bullets, the Kashmir problem will be solved through warm embraces). Has the government been able to do so?/The Kashmir success story is one of the most important achievements of the Modi government. We talk straight to the people, not to the separatists and that has resulted in holding of panchayat elections in 40,000-odd villages with 75% voting, and peacefully./In a reply to a Lok Sabha question, you said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/ disease exclusively due to air pollution. But there is an Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) study, which said 1.24 million premature deaths in 2017 were due to exposure to air pollution./Premature deaths are a serious issue. It is not happening only in Delhi, but in non-polluted areas also. Therefore, there is no direct correlation. But because of air pollution, there is a problem of pulmonary functions, lungs, throat infection. It definitely impacts these. Therefore, we have taken major action. Don't you feel good in Delhi today? The good air days have increased, and bad days have reduced. A fair amount of this is a result of what we have done in the last five years./The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) targets are not legally binding on states or cities.

That is why the time lag [for environmental clearances] which was 680 days during Jairam Ramesh and Jayanthi Natarajan [former environment ministers] has come down to 108 days, and I want to bring it down to 70-80 days./There is much criticism of the zero draft on amending the Indian Forest Act on the grounds that it undermines the role of gram sabhas and gives draconian powers to the forest officials./There is no amendment.

"Mechanised options to crop-burning raise farmers' profits, cut pollution: Research","NEW DELHI, Aug. 8 -- Farmers who stop burning rice straw and adopt no-till practices to grow wheat in north India could increase profits and lower greenhouse gas emissions from on-farm activities by 78%, according to a new study, which provides evidence that scaling up mechanisation to manage crop residues lowers air pollution and raises farmers' agricultural earnings./The direct seeding of wheat into unploughed soil and shredded rice residues raised farmers' profits through higher yields and savings in labour, fuel and machinery costs, concludes the study after comparing the costs and benefits of 10 distinct land-preparation and sowing practices in rice-wheat cropping rotations done in at least 4 million hectares of farmland in northern India. The multidisciplinary study, done by agriculturalists, economists and environmentalists, has been published in the journal Science./Around 1*24 million deaths (12.5% of total deaths) in India in 2017 were attributable to air pollution, which leads to lung infections, chronic obstructive lung disease, heart attacks, stroke, diabetes and lung cancer, according to an analysis of state-wise data published in The Lancet Planetary Health last year./The bi-annual burning of crop stubble after harvest in north India is a major contributor to air pollution in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana, taking the mean values of PM 2.5 micrometres (particles one-400th of a millimetre) greater than 125 g/m. The WHO puts the PM 2.cut off at 10g/m, while the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of India safe limit is a higher 40g/m./""Farmers in India burn around 23 million tonnes of straw to quickly and cheaply clear their field of crop stubble after rice harvest and prepare it to sow wheat.

""Compared to burning straw and tilling, direct-seeding using a happy seeder brings a profit of Rs 11,000 per hectare on average by reducing production and increasing productivity.

"Sharing wall with industrial unit, staff, students at Sangrur school wear masks to breathe","India, Aug. 10 -- Pollution that has blackened the walls, trees and floor of the building and students and teachers wearing masks to breathe. This is the daily lesson that one gets, for free, at Government Senior Secondary School Jitwal Kalan, 46km from district headquarters, in Ahmedgarh sub-division (near Malerkotla) for years now./The school authorities hold an industrial unit making tyres, Ralson Goodluck Carbon, responsible for the state of affairs. The unit, here since the 1980s, shares the boundary wall of the school and its chimneys spew out smoke and ash with alarming regularity, impinging on the health of over 200 students and 12 teachers. The school admits students in Classes 6-12 and wards come in from eight surrounding villages. The school authorities also claim that they have not seen a blue sky for as long as they can remember, with darkness enveloping the area even during the day; pollution is to be blamed, they claim./TEACHERS SEEK TRANSFERS/Teachers are better-off than students as they can afford to wear masks every day. Most students, who are from the middle and the poor sections, make do by just using their handkerchiefs and dupattas. The situation is so grave that teachers are seeking transfer from the school on the grounds of air pollution./""It is difficult to breath in the air, but we have no other option. The smoke and ash are destroying our lives. However, the authorities do not even dare to think about closing the unit, as it is owned by influential people,'' said Sohail Khan, who has been studying at the school for the past four years. Another student Amandeep Kaur, of Class 10, said, ""It is like a gas chamber. We are unable to breathe in here and conditions are miserable.""/A teacher said on condition of anonymity, ""It is a political matter and political parties are not ready to resolve it. Our job is to teach students and we are doing our duty. Most teachers are seeking transfer.""/Before Parliamentary elections, locals had apprised Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann of the issue, yet nothing has moved. Mann could not be contacted for this report./SDM IS HEARING THE ISSUE/Locals have approached the SDM and filed a complaint. Ahmedgarh SDM has been holding hearings on the complaint and had summoned officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) as well as the industrial unit./""I am concerned about the health of students and locals due to environment degradation. Officials of the company and the PPCB are regularly attending hearings. The issue will be resolved soon,"" said SDM Vikramjeet Singh Panthey./Ralson Goodluck Carbon has denied all allegations. ""The company has not polluted the environment. We are installing new infrastructure of our factory; this will take some time,"" said Pawan Kumar, the representative of the company, who attends hearings at the SDM office./PPCB district officials could not be contacted despite several attempts. PPCB chairman Satwinder Singh Marwaha said he 'would revert soon'. Later, neither did he call nor did he respond to messages on his mobile./Education minister Vijay Inder Singla, ""I will talk to PPCB officials and a team will be sent for inspection of the environment near the school,"" said Singla./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Indirapuram residents approach NGT against use of diesel sets and loud music systems,"India, Aug. 14 -- Residents of Indirapuram have moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the Indirapuram Habitat Centre and a nearby school, which are allegedly using generator sets that are generating smoke and causing health issues for people./The petitioners contended that the use of heavy sound systems at the Habiat Centre was allegedly causing noise pollution and disturbing the sleep of residents of nearby high-rises./The tribunal, during a hearing on August 13, directed agencies concerned to submit a factual and action taken report within one month and posted the matter for hearing on October 22./""With a view to examine the allegation, it will be appropriate to require a factual and action taken report from the Ghaziabad development authority and the UP State pollution control board. The nodal agency will be the state pollution control board for compliance and coordination,"" the tribunal said in its order./Utsav Sharma, the regional manager of the UP pollution board, said he was yet to receive a copy of the notice./""Regarding the school, it had used DG sets and they were earlier sealed by GDA on a complaint. After this, they raised the height of their chimneys and took steps to control emission. After this, the premises was desealed. We are yet to get the notice regarding the petition and will take necessary compliance as directed regarding the school and the Habitat Centre,"" he added./The petition said the noise and air pollution were troubling residents of nearby highrises. It said heavy sound systems were used at the Habitat Centre daily from 7pm to 00.30am beyond permissible limits ./""All our generator sets are in the basement. We will check the issue of loud noise as alleged. We will take corrective action and comply with directions.

Reliable air-quality data essential to end air pollution,"India, Aug. 24 -- The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) certification of all instruments and equipment that monitor emissions and ambient air quality will help standardise measurements and bring down the cost of monitors by boosting manufacturing in the country. The NPL is the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research's national measurement standards lab that calibrates the national standards of weights and measures and maintains standards of the International System of Units, which is the world's most widely-used measurement system./In the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate's notification dated August 22 under Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, NPL has been authorised to certify instruments and develop testing and certification facilities conforming to ISO standards for both automatic and manual samplers used to monitor air quality./The NPL has already established certification of manual-monitoring systems for PM2.5 and PM10, which will now be extended to Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) that are used to track grossly polluting industries to ensure they comply with regulatory norms. It will begin by certifying the AQI monitors being used by the Central and state pollution control boards to track ambient and source-based emissions, and then move to certify instruments used in homes./PM 2.5 and PM 10 are dust and pollution particles 2.5 microns and 10 microns or less in diameter, respectively, which are inhaled and get lodged in the airways and lungs.

Reliable air-quality data essential to end pollution,"New Delhi, Aug. 25 -- The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) certification of all instruments and equipment that monitor emissions and ambient air quality will help standardise measurements and bring down the cost of monitors by boosting manufacturing in the country./The NPL is the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research's national measurement standards lab that calibrates the national standards of weights and measures and maintains standards of the International System of Units, which is the world's most widely-used measurement system./In the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate's notification dated August 22 under Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, NPL has been authorised to certify instruments and develop testing and certification facilities conforming to ISO standards for both automatic and manual samplers used to monitor air quality./The NPL has already established certification of manual-monitoring systems for PM2.5 and PM10, which will now be extended to Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) that are used to track grossly polluting industries to ensure they comply with regulatory norms. It will begin by certifying the AQI monitors being used by the Central and state pollution control boards to track ambient and source-based emissions, and then move to certify instruments used in homes./PM 2.5 and PM 10 are dust and pollution particles 2.5 microns and 10 microns or less in diameter, respectively, which are inhaled and get lodged in the airways and lungs.

"People with diabetes, hypertension are Vitamin D deficit: Study","India, Aug. 28 -- A pan-India study has linked Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency to type-2 diabetes and hypertension, making it about more than just bone health./Vitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin that is produced by the skin on exposure to sunlight, is a critical micronutrient that helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the body that are required to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy./The study shows that 84.2% of type 2 diabetes patients and 82.6% of hypertension patients were Vitamin D deficient, contributing further to the body of research that links Vitamin D deficiency to chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs)./The overall prevalence of patients with low Vitamin D levels (deficiency and insufficiency) was 83.7%, of which 82% were newly diagnosed cases./""Our aim was to look at the levels of vitamin D in patients suffering from type-2 diabetes and hypertension to establish a link. We are not saying the deficiency has caused the disease but that those who with the disease may be vitamin D deficient,"" said Dr PG Talwalkar of Talwalkar Diabetes Clinic, principal investigator of the study./""The next step will be to see how improving vitamin D levels in these patients will impact the treatment outcome, since we are always looking for any additional pathways that will further reduce complications in patients with diabetes and hypertension,"" he added./Correcting vitamin D deficiency should not be the top priority for managing diabetes and hypertension./""If you are looking from the public health point of view, then vitamin D deficiency will not be on my list of top 5 things to handle diabetes and hypertension. One needs to prioritise. However, if looking at musculoskeletal disorders (pertaining to joints, muscles, nerves etc.) than vitamin D deficiency will be a priority. Having said that, I don't mean there should be no research around it,"" said Dr Nikhil Tandon, head of the department of endocrinology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi./The causes of vitamin D deficiency in India are manifold. Most people do not receive adequate exposure to sunlight, as modernized lifestyles have resulted in less time spent outdoors for work or leisure. High levels of air pollution further hamper the transmission of ultraviolet B (UVB) rays needed to synthesize Vitamin D in the skin./A social fetish for fair complexion also leads many to avoid exposure to sunlight, especially during noon hours when it is most beneficial./The study tracked 1,501 adults above 18 years with diagnoed type-2 diabetes, hypertension, or both, across 29 sites between June to September, 2017. The results were published in the Indian Journal of Diabetes and Endocrinology on Wednesday./Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D levels 21-29 ng/ml and ?20 ng/ml, respectively./""These findings highlight the need for routine screening to ensure early diagnosis and effective management of Vitamin D deficiency to help reduce the burden and risks associated with non-communicable disease,"" said Dr Talwalkar./Apart from exposure to sunshine for about 45 minutes, the dietary sources of Vitamin D include cod liver oil, salmon fish, mackerel, sardines, tuna, egg yolk and mushrooms exposed to sunlight./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

A measure of development of a country is how well we treat pedestrians and those using active transport, active living is essential to improve population health. It is rare to find an intervention that has such powerful and far-reaching benefits across so many spheres,"" said Goenka./Progressive interventions, especially those targeting women, are needed to create safe space for women. ""The excuses are the same across states.

"Public transport, parks make you more active","New Delhi, Sept. 1 -- Calling physical activity and sports a ""zero investment, unlimited returns"" scheme that will take the country towards a healthier future, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Fit India Movement on Thursday to urge people to make physical activity a part of their daily lives./Physical activity brings down the risk of several diseases that are the leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, breast and colon cancers, among others. It also builds muscle, bone and lung health, prevents obesity and falls, and protects against depression./The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate- to intense-activity (brisk walking at a speed of 5-6 km/hour) or 75 minutes of intense activity (running, walking uphill, playing active sports like football, badminton, tennis) every week. Health benefits keep increasing up to 750 minutes of activity per week, after which they begin to plateau./But becoming more physically active is easier said than done./Apart from sheer laziness that holds many people back, the biggest deterrent is an unfavourable environment that makes activity undesirable, inaccessible or unsafe. Overcrowded cities, unplanned towns, chaotic transportation, encroached pavements, air pollution, and high temperature conspire to keep many people indoors and make it near impossible to meet the recommended goal of taking 8,000-10,000 steps a day./Along with motivation provided by Prime Minister Modi, some key scientifically-validated measures that help people become more active are mass media campaigns, playing sports, active public transport, and making green spaces and pavements central to urban design./Good public transport/High quality public transport and pedestrian safety encourages people to switch from using personal vehicles to public transport, which results in more people walking. Opting for mass transit over driving creates opportunities for exercise that may otherwise not exist, says Shifalika Goenka, professor, Public Health Foundation of India, who was the co-author from India for the Lancet Series on Physical Activity 2012 and 2016./Instead of just stepping out of home to get into a car or a scooter, public transport forces people to walk from home to a metro station or bus stop, and then again from their stop to their final destination. A single percentage-point increase in mass transit ridership is associated with a 0.473 percentage-point lower obesity rate, found an analysis of data of counties across the United States from 2001 and 2009, published in the journal Transportation Research in January 2019./Pavements/Wide, encroachment-free pavements are critical to encourage people to walk. In countries with good public transport, the width of the pavements should be as much as the road, which should not be more than car lanes to encourage people to use more energy efficient and less polluting mass transport, according to Goenka./Zebra crossings must be frequent with adequate signal time for children and older persons to cross the road with ease even when modes of transportation are mixed. Roads must be lined with green shady trees that help bring down the ambient temperature and also help combat air pollution./School Activity/Habits form young and all children must be encouraged to play./Playing outdoors even on days when air pollution is high brings more health benefits than sitting indoors. Students must play sports at school and have mandatory dance, gymnastics and yoga classes, which are crucial to build muscle, bone and lung strength during adolescence and teenage years./Apart from physical benefits, including a healthy weight, students who play sports have better problem-solving skills, higher self-esteem, social competence and better vision from constantly focusing on near and far objects outdoors, unlike while reading or looking at a screen./Green spaces/Persons living more than one km from green spaces have higher odds of being obese (BMI 30) than those living less than 300 m from green spaces, with people who live within a 0.5 km radius of an open space most likely go out for physical activity, according to a study in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health./Building design/Buildings, both commercial and residential, should be planned with parks and open spaces around them./Offices and shopping complexes must be designed with stairs as centre points rather than escalators to encourage people to take the stairs if they have to go up a couple of flights./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Odd-even rule back in Delhi post Diwali, from November 4-15, says CM Arvind Kejriwal","India, Sept. 13 -- The Odd-Even vehicle rationing plan will be back in Delhi between November 4 and 15 to tackle pollution during winter, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Friday./""The move is part of a seven-point action plan aimed at combating high levels of air pollution in winters starting at a point when crop burning starts in neighbouring states,"" the chief minister said./Kejriwal, however, did not give any details of exemptions planned under the scheme this time saying, """"We will take into consideration all findings from the previous Odd-Even experience."" Exemptions under earlier Odd-Even stints had generated a lot of controversy with VIPs, women drivers, two wheelers, CNG vehicles and disabled kept out of the purview of the scheme./The action plan also includes distribution of anti-pollution masks, a tree plantation drive and mechanised sweeping of roads, Kejriwal said./New Delhi is the world's most polluted capital city, according to several studies, with vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites, and smoke from the burning of rubbish and crop residue in nearby fields./The government announcement comes a day after environment experts recommended the rationing and use of face masks as ""short term measures"" to fight pollution during the winter months when the air quality in Delhi dips to alarming levels, the state government said in a statement on Thursday./Kejriwal had met environment and sustainability experts to formulate winter air pollution action plan so that the city is prepared to tackle the pollution levels./Delhi has earlier also experimented with Odd-Even plan, that allows private cars and motorbikes will only be allowed to use roads on alternate daysthough opinion is divided on the gains, if any, from the rationing system./In 2017, a joint study conducted by atmospheric scientists of IITs and IIM had revealed that in the first phase of odd-even scheme the levels of pollution declined only by 2%-3%. Only three areas in Delhi-Najafgarh, Shalimar Bagh and Greater Kailash-witnessed 8%-10% drop in pollution due to the odd-even scheme, the study showed./Experts also said that the use of pollution masks could be beneficial as an effective risk-mitigation measure. ""In a study done by EPIC India across 3,500 slum residents of Delhi in winter of 2018, it was found that take-up of masks was the highest when it was distributed free,"" the statement said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Capital's odd-even plan will return in November,"New Delhi, Sept. 14 -- Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government will enforce the odd-even road rationing scheme between November 4 and 15 to tackle air pollution exacerbated by stubble burning in neighbouring northern states during the winter, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday./The move is part of a seven-point Parali Pradushan (stubble burning) action plan aimed at combating high levels of air pollution, Kejriwal said. The plan will include measures such as extensive tree plantation, mechanised sweeping of roads and sprinkling of water, mass distribution of anti-pollution masks and improving the air quality at 12 hotspots./""The first measure of our action plan is the odd-even road rationing scheme, which will start right after Diwali,which is on October 27. It will start from November 4, a Monday, and continue till November 15. The studies that have been done on odd-even suggest that the drive results in 10-13% reduction in pollution levels,"" Kejriwal, whose party faces assembly elections early next year, told journalists./Private vehicles with licence plates ending in odd and even numbers will be allowed on alternate days on the streets of the capital, whose air quality has been ranked by global surveys as among the world's dirtiest, when the campaign is underway. Vehicular emissions are one of the chief contributors to pollution, which worsens in the winters because of stubble burning in northern states such as Punjab and Haryana./During the 12-day road rationing, vehicles with registration numbers ending in an odd digit (1,3,5,7,9) will be allowed on the five odd days. Those with licence plates ending in an even digit (0,2,4,6,8) will be permitted to ply on the five even days. During the weekend (November 9-10), all vehicles will be allowed on the city's roads./In the previous two experiments in January and April in 2016, a fine of ~2,000 was specified for violators of the rule./Kejriwal said details such as exemptions and fines on violators are yet to be decided. ""We will take into consideration all findings from the previous odd-even experience,"" he said. Government officials said that over the next few weeks, stakeholderssuch as experts, traffic police and transport department will be consulted to decide on the exemptions./Exemptions under earlier odd-even stints had generated controversy, with VIPs, woman drivers, vehicles running on compressed natural gas and the disabled kept out of the ambit of the road rationing exercise. Two-wheelers, which number over 7.3 million of the 11.09 million registered vehicles in Delhi, were also exempted from the last two drives./The number of registered four-wheelers in the city stands at around 3.3 million./Explaining the rationale behind the timing of the scheme, the chief minister said the odd-even drive is always an ""emergency measure""./""Because the smoke from stubble burning peaks during this time (November), we will be implementing the road rationing drive as an emergency measure,"" he said./The odd-even drive is a measure prescribed under the Supreme Court-mandated Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) when the air quality index of Delhi enters the severe+ zone for 48 hours or more. The severe+ category is when PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels breach the value of 300 and 500ug/m3./PM 10 and 2.5 are solid and liquid pollutants of less than 10 and 2.5 microns in size respectively and are suspended in air. These particles can enter the respiratory system and cause health complications./""The action plan, comprising of experts from meteorological department and others, is notified by the central government for all NCR {National Capital Region} states,"" Bhure Lal, chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), which is the enforcing authority for GRAP, said,/""Emergency measures under it have to be rolled out after consultation from these experts, as meteorological conditions play an important role in the pollution levels during the winter. If the situation doesn't warrant it, there will be no need to implement odd-even scheme,"" said Lal./He also questioned the Delhi government on the poor state of public transport in the city, which has only 5,454 buses against a requirement of 10,000 buses ./""Also, during odd-even, it's important to take diesel vehicles, which are most polluting, off the roads. But even after SC {Supreme Court} directions, the Delhi government has not implemented the sticker scheme for identifying diesel, petrol and other vehicles,"" Lal said./Studies on the last two road rationing schemes that were rolled out in a span of three months in 2016 have differed on the impact of the exercise. The government said that according to a study done by the University of Chicago and Harvard University, Delhi's air pollution had reduced by around 14%-16% during the first odd-even experiment in January 2016./But studies done by Indian scientists revealed that the road rationing scheme didn't deliver the desired results. One study done by a team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi, IIT-Kanpur, IITM-Pune, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and the Energy and Resources Institute found that pollution dropped by 2% - 3%. Experts from the Centre for Science and Environment said that it actually helped lower pollution levels and should be implemented as a short-term measure./Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari questioned the need for the scheme. ""It is up to the Delhi government to implement the scheme. But I don't think it is necessary. We have made a new Ring Road, and with that Delhi's pollution has come down a lot. And in my estimate in two years... ~50,000 crore has been provided by my department, and the Yamuna Clean Water and Clean Air Scheme are going on, and with that in two years, Delhi will be pollution-free,"" he said./However, he later added that the Delhi government has the right to take its decision on combating pollution. ""The Delhi government has the right to take its decisions. We have no problem,"" he said./The Delhi Congress said it was a ""ploy"" to divert the attention of the people from the ""real issues"" plaguing the national capital and the local unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) termed it a ""populist measure"" and a ""political stunt""./Delhi unit president of the BJP, Manoj Tiwari, said Kejriwal comes up with such schemes every now and then as an election stunt. ""This is a political stunt. If he knows that in November the remains of crops are burnt, then why didn't he implement the odd-even scheme every year in the month of November. Why is he doing this on the verge of 2020 when the elections are due,"" he asked./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"LPG most commonly used slum fuel in Mumbai, reveals study","Mumbai, Sept. 16 -- In an encouraging sign in the fight against air pollution in the city, a study indicated that biofuel emissions - one of the top sources of particulate matter - are on a steady decline. The study on fuel-usage pattern has shown that 19 out of every 20 slum settlements in Mumbai prefer liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, over other fuels such as kerosene, coal or wood./The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) sampled 71,546 urban slum households across 20 locations in Mumbai and found only Mankhurd (with a sample size of 3,148) was more dependent on kerosene than LPG. Slums in Borivli and Kurla also had high kerosene usage, but LPG consumption was marginally higher./Seventeen settlements were found using wood, the study revealed. Kurla and Dharavi (with a sample size of 472 and 5,943 people) were the only two areas still dependent on coal for cooking. SAFAR said the study was released earlier this year, but was carried out between 2015 and 2016 when the impact of the Centre's scheme of providing LPG to below poverty line women under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) had just started across slums./""After analysing the data, we found that awareness and the ability to afford LPG connections was much higher across Mumbai slums than in other cities where SAFAR monitors air quality, such as Delhi, Pune and Ahmedabad. This was even before the Ujjwala scheme was implemented properly,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR./Experts said increased LPG use was an encouraging trend. ""The lack of access to clean fuels for slums is a major air pollution issue in India. Clean-energy transition in low-income neighbourhoods is a vital step to reduce overall emissions and increase health security,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment. ""Now, we need to aim for 100% coverage with a more aggressive strategy.""/According to the 2011 census, Mumbai has the most slum households for any metro city with a million-plus population./SAFAR identified that biofuel emission was one of the top emission sources for particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) at 14% and 27%; carbon monoxide at 60%; black carbon at 46% and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) at 55% in Mumbai, between 2015 and 2017. ""While the availability of wood is low in Mumbai, the use of kerosene still remains high, leading to an overall rise in biofuel emissions,"" said Beig. ""Combined with kerosene, open-waste burning, emission from bakeries, landfills as well as minimal use of wood and coal keep biofuel emission sources high, in spite of LPG usage being the highest.""/LPG is the most suitable fuel for human health, said doctors. ""Coal, kerosene, and wood - all three have a strong possibility of causing damage to lungs over time, owing to excess smoke production. Kerosene is most harmful, followed by wood and then coal,"" said Dr Arun Kumar Sharma, University College of Medical Sciences in Delhi. ""In lower socio-economic communities, ventilation is poor so the chances of respiratory ailments are very high.""/SAFAR will be carrying out a similar survey in 2020-21, comparing the 2015-16 data. ""We expect a possibility of 100% LPG use across Mumbai slums (for cooking), as a result of the Ujjwala scheme,"" said Beig./The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said recommendations to address residential biofuel emission by introducing cleaner fuels (especially for slums) using Ujjwala had been incorporated into air-pollution action plans for all 18 cities in Maharashtra. ""Availability and affordability is favourable for LPG as against any other fuel sources. The state's emphasis to provide such connections is high to ensure this sector's contribution to air pollution falls to zero in the near future,"" said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

HC restrains state from moving PAP to polluted Mahul,"Mumbai, Sept. 24 -- Taking note of the high level of air pollution in Mahul, the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday restrained the state government from shifting any slumdwellers or project-affected people (PAP) to Eversmile Complex, the PAP colony in the locality./A division bench of chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog and justice Bharati Dangre also directed the government to offer permanent alternative accommodation to around 5,500 families, who are ""compelled"" to live in the highly polluted industrial area./The court directed that upon filing an application to move out of Mahul, the government should pay each family Rs.15,000 a month towards rent and an additional amount of Rs.45,000 towards a security deposit, till the time the accommodation becomes available. The PAP had challenged their rehabilitation at Mahul on the grounds that the area was highly polluted and posed a high risk to their health./They complained the air was highly polluted owing to the presence of heavy industries./The court was hearing three petitions./One of the petitions was filed by a group of PAP, who lived close to pipelines supplying water to the city and who had been offered accommodation at Eversmile Complex, which has 17,205 tenements in 72 buildings./A second petition was filed by a group of people already living in the PAP colony, whereas the third petition was filed by the state government, challenging a 2015 order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), issuing certain directions, regarding the PAP colony./They also complained that the PAP colony was bereft of hygienic conditions and basic amenities, including schools and medical facilities, and pointed out that the presence of residents in the near vicinity of the refineries is seen as threat to the safety of the industrial units. In support of their contentions, they relied on the NGT judgement of December 18, 2015, holding that there was a perceptible threat to the health of the residents of the area owing to the prevailing poor air./The state government opposed their plea and contended that the NGT should not have generalised the condition prevailing for a certain period and claimed that the situation had later improved./The HC, however, refused to believe in the state's claim in view of the reports of the central and state pollution boards, the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay./Judges noted that the IIT-B report was self-explanatory and portrayed an irrefutable picture of the locality.

"Fire has started: Farm stubble burning, Delhi may get the choke soon","New Delhi/Chandigarh, Sept. 25 -- Hundreds of instances of farm fires have been recorded in Punjab and Haryana, forcing officials in the national capital as well as in the adjoining states to consider measures such as staggered office timings and impounding of old harvesting machines in a bid to stave off an air quality crisis that has become an annual phenomenon in the region./The first of the farm fires come less than a week after the Punjab and Haryana high court ruled that the two states cannot fine farmers for burning crop residue, a practice that is common in the autumn season when fields need to be quickly cleared of summer harvests to make way for winter crop sowing./""Discussed measures to reduce air pollution and congestion in Delhi. Requested to explore amongst other measures, option of staggered opening/closing hours of offices and other establishments to reduce congestion and resultant air pollution,"" Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal said in a tweet on Wednesday after a meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to discuss plans to tackle pollution./""Delhi will be facing a challenge to maintain its air quality due to crop stubble burning from neighbouring states and bursting of firecrackers during Diwali. Delhi has taken several steps to reduce pollution during this time including the odd-even scheme. The government will definitely implement his suggestion on staggered working hours,"" Kejriwal said in a tweet later./The Odd-Even rule, which allows cars with odd or even number plates to be driven only on alternating days, will be in force between November 4 and 15./Delhi's air quality index (AQI) on Wednesday was a ""satisfactory"" 90, but officials warned that this may change soon if wind patterns - at present blowing in from the east - were to flip and sweep in the smoke from the farm fires./""At this time of the year, easterly and south-easterly winds blow in Delhi. But, by October 15, the wind directions change. Westerly and north-westerly winds that blow from Punjab and Haryana are not strong enough to blow away the pollution particles,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre./In 2018, the AQI peaked at 449 -- a level of air pollution that is considered a public health emergency. People are advised to avoid exposure to outside air once AQI crosses 400, with strenuous exercises being particularly harmful. Studies have also shown that living with such levels of air pollution also drastically reduced life expectancy./In the last three days, at least 148 farm fires have been reported in Punjab, according to officials and satellite monitoring data. Satellite sensing also showed fires in Haryana, though officials said they were not aware of any particular incident./Attempts to combat crop residue burning are likely to be more complicated this year since officials will not be able to fine farmers who defy the law and burn crop residue to clear their fields. ""We will impound harvester machines functioning without a straw management system,"" said Punjab agriculture secretary KS Pannu./Cases of farm fires reported at present are believed to be of limited varieties of paddy that are harvested sooner than the common type. Most paddy harvest begins in the second week of October, leaving little time for farmers to clear the field for sowing winter crops that needs to be completed by mid-November./""Generally, the harvest for early varieties begins by mid-September. It will start in full swing by October 5,"" said Harinder Singh Lokhowal, general secretary Bharti Kisan Union (BKU)./Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh also intervened in the issue on Wednesday, asking the Union government to provide financial help for farmers to dispose of crop residue./A sum of ~100 per quintal of paddy should be given to farmers so that they can arrange to manage the stubble without resorting to its open burning by using the compensation money to meet the paddy straw management cost, the chief minister said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi./The farmers in the state will face the challenge of managing nearly 20 million tonnes of paddy straw once again this season, he added./Some officials and experts expressed hope that the situation may not be as bad as least year./""This year we started monitoring early because some varieties of paddy were sown sooner and hence harvested early. Every year it usually starts around 24-25 September. We hope the instances come down this year because of the alternatives provided by the government last year,"" said Krunesh Garg, member secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"After Bombay HC order on 'dangerously polluted' Mahul, MPCB?says the air is now safer","MUMBAI, Sept. 27 -- Air quality stations belonging to Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) have found air pollution levels in Mahul-Trombay were largely within safe limits between April and September this year, despite the presence of refineries and thermal power plants. This is a drastic improvement compared to the readings submitted before the Bombay high court (HC) and National Green Tribunal (NGT) by research bodies./On Tuesday, MPCB published air quality data from April to September 2019 for a list of nine pollutants in areas such as Anikgaon, Ambapada, Mahul, Gavanpada in Vishnu Nagar. ""The data published is from a combination of air quality stations belonging to MPCB and all plants. We are yet to analyse the trend and issue further directions to industries,"" said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB. While pollutants like particulate matter, ammonia, and nitrogen dioxide were found to be within safe limits across all refineries and power plants in Mahul, the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene and toluene, and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were exceptionally high on certain days at select plants. MPCB's readings were still significantly lower than data recorded by research bodies in 2018. The MPCB's readings for the past six months show benzene concentration at a maximum of 250.94 microgrammes per cubic metre (ug/m3) on August 1 around the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) refinery. In NEERI's report, submitted to MPCB and referenced in an HC order issued earlier this week, benzene was at a maximum 1,182 ?g/m3 in February 2018 at the sites of Aegis Logistics, Sea Lord Containers, and BPCL Trombay./There are no air quality standards available from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for any VOC except benzene, which means any presence of compounds like toluene and xylene may be considered hazardous. Both these VOCs have been recorded in Mahul. An MPCB official said, ""We have not been able to identify the exact source for VOC concentration yet but sources from surrounding areas also keep levels high. There has been a reduction in concentration for all other pollutants based on directions by NGT and research bodies. As per current mitigation measures, VOC levels are expected to reduce soon.""/On September 23, the HC had described Mahul as ""dangerously polluted"" on the basis of reports submitted by Indian Institute of Technology, MPCB, CPCB and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). The HC directed the state to move out 5,500 families staying at Mahul and said no more families should be relocated there. It ruled the state pay transit rent of Rs.15,000 per month with a security deposit of Rs.45,000 to each family, within 12 weeks./While the difference between the previous data and MPCB's recent data remains unexplained, Mahul residents continue to suffer because of the pollutants in their neighbourhood. ""Minor fluctuations in pollution data do not change the fact that people have suffered skin diseases, lung problems and even cancer as this zone continues to pose a serious health threat for citizens,"" said activist Bilal Khan. While HPCL and BPCL refused to comment on the matter, a spokesperson from Aegis Pvt Ltd said, ""The matter is sub judice and it is only right if MPCB assess the trend in air pollution."" Tata Power issued a statement pointing out ambient air quality is also affected by ""surrounding activities"". ""Values between September 1 and 4, 2019 were high for a brief duration due to the impact of Ganpati festivals/procession/heavy rains in nearby vicinity,"" said Tata Power in its statement./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

All school students to get anti-pollution masks,"New Delhi, Oct. 1 -- The Delhi government has drafted a proposal to distribute anti-pollution masks for free to children in both government and private schools before Diwali, senior government officials said on Monday./Delhi has 1,030 government-run schools, 215 government-aided schools and 1,352 private schools. The government estimates it will need five million N95 anti-pollution masks to be distributed in the schools under the initiative as of now, officials said./N95 masks are those that are capable of blocking at least 95% of PM 2.5 - particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres, which is nearly 3% the diameter of a human hair strand. Such particulate matter can cause severe heart and lung diseases./""So far, the government has estimated that 5 million masks will be needed to carry out the initiative. Zonal officers in the education department have been entrusted with the task of submitting more accurate figures by October 1. And on October 3, the government has planned to open bids for the tenders. Diwali is on October 27, so the distribution has to be completed by October 22,"" said a government official./The anti-pollution masks will be distributed in schools zone-wise. For administration of government schools, the city is divided into 29 zones, officials said. Initially, the proposal was to cover only government school students and their parents but the plan was changed last week./The budget is yet to be estimated and it has become a difficult task because the price range of N95 masks is very wide and the government does not have much time to evaluate, government officials said. ""We have to wait for the quotations,"" the official said./With time, the government is open to the possibility of extending the scheme for students of primary schools run by the municipal corporations, sanitation workers and construction workers, officials said./The anti-pollution mask distribution initiative is a part of the government's seven-point winter action plan to fight air pollution, which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced earlier this month. Other steps include the odd-even car rationing scheme, ensuring control of dust pollution by investing in water sprinklers./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"App cuts crop burning, but problem stays","New Delhi, Oct. 10 -- An Uber-like business model, which allows cultivators to rent subsidised harvest equipment on an android app, is helping curtail polluting fires set by farmers to clear their fields of harvested paddy, official data shows./Northern India is bracing for another season of air pollution this month, caused by agricultural fires in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and rural Delhi. In 2016, thick smog covered the capital from smoke blown in from these states. Air quality remained hazardous for weeks./Authorities say the incidence of farm fires came down 41% in 2018 over 2016 because of cheaper, order-on-app farm equipment to deal with leftover straw on the back of a 1151.80-crore subsidy programme launched by the Union government in 2018./On September 6, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal claimed that air pollution in the capital came down a quarter per cent over four years due to multiple measures. Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said on October 7 that the farm-equipment subsidy will result in cleaner air this year./Rising winter air pollution across northern India owing to farm fires prompted the Union government to introduce this subsidy on farm equipment that eliminates stubble burning./The custom hiring centres, usually operated by rural entrepreneurs, are at the heart of the model that rents out farm machinery to farmers, aided by a state-developed app farmers are using to hire these tools. To be sure, the problem of farm fires still persists and the practice hasn't stopped altogether./Burning of paddy stubble is a relatively recent phenomenon in Punjab and Haryana. Farmers have increasingly adopted efficient machines called combine harvesters that cut the grainy part of paddy and not the plant itself, prompting farmers to burn the leftover straw. It works out cheaper than employing costly labour to remove them./The solution is rather simple. A fixture called straw management system, a machine attached to the harvester, manages the straw without the need for cultivators to burn it. Another machine called the ""happy seeder"" enables wheat, the next crop, to be sown on a bed of straw. Farmers tend to skip using these equipment because they entail higher costs./Over 4,500 villages in Haryana and Punjab have been declared ""zero stubble burning villages"", according to Trilochan Mohapatra, the secretary of the department of agricultural research and education under the Union farm ministry, who cited satellite data to support his claim./The National Green Tribunal, in its order passed on December 10, 2015, banned straw burning in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana./""Fines on farmers are hard to implement, but cheaper rentals of farm machinery has been more effective (at curbing stubble burning),"" an official said on condition of anonymity. On September 18, the Punjab and Haryana high court stayed fines imposed on farmers for setting fires to clear paddy residue. Last year, Punjab fixed Rs 2,500 as penalty for every instance of stubble burning./The subsidy lowers the cost of farm machines rural entrepreneurs buy, who then pass on the discount to farmers renting these machines. For instance, in Punjab, the scheme grants 80% subsidy on an investment of 10 lakh./""The subsidy on farm residue management tools has increased access of these machines for farmers by lowering hiring costs,"" said Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Punjab's agriculture commissioner./A structural issue has been that Punjab has more tractors than needed, but not enough equipment for environmentally-sound harvesting. Banks tend to finance more ""stand-alone equipment"" leading to ""tractorisation"", according to a 2016 report, ""Farm Mechanization in India: The Custom Hiring Perspective""./For Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and UP, the subsidy to curb fires stood at 1,151 crore, latest data showed./In 2018-19, Punjab got 167 crore, up 25% over 2017-18. Haryana got 61.72 crore, a rise of 17% from the previous year, while UP got 28.60 crore. For 2019-20, Punjab, Haryana, UP have been allocated 269 crore, 175 crore and 97 crore respectively, the data revealed./""How soon we eliminate stubble burning will depends on the scale and nature of farm mechanisation. Adoption of low-cost machines is needed at both the ends, that is sowing and harvest,"" said Dr Amrender Bhullar, a former professor of Punjab Agricultural University./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Post-Dussehra pollution in Delhi lowest in 5 years,"India, Oct. 10 -- People in the national capital breathed the cleanest air in five years for a day that falls immediately after Dussehra, environment monitoring officials said on Wednesday, but warned that the situation is likely to deteriorate in less than a week./The celebration of Dussehra includes the burning of towering effigies and fireworks, and has been followed by a spike in air pollution at a time when meteorological factors and farm fires in neighbouring states usually turn Delhi's air unfit for breathing./Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that on Wednesday, the city's overall air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 173 compared to 326 last year (see box)./To be sure, when Dussehra falls is also linked to how polluted the air gets since the months of October and November is the period when temperature dips and farm fires peak. It has been celebrated three times in the first half of October in the last five years - among these, 2019's AQI was the lowest./Scientists of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the easterly winds and a prolonged monsoon had a major part to play in keeping pollutants in check. But that may change after October 12./""The monsoon withdrawal has begun. It has started withdrawing in Punjab, western Haryana and northern Rajasthan, and in the next three to four days monsoon will withdraw from Delhi. After this, the wind direction will also change and pollution levels are likely to increase,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's regional weather forecasting in Delhi./Experts and organisers of Dussehra celebrations said a conscious decision by many to cut back on fireworks and effigy burning may have also contributed to the improved air quality./""Looking at the rising pollution levels, we decided not to burn any crackers and still maintain the festivity of the day,"" said Yogesh Pahuja, president of C-Block Lajpat Nagar-II residents welfare association, which did not burn an effigy this year and instead organised a laser show for the ""Ravana dahan"" ritual. ""A lot of stress has been put on the use of green crackers this time, while bringing residents on board to come up with eco-friendly alternatives. All this, along with favourable weather conditions, has helped Delhi this time,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment./Experts also noted another change in trend this year in the pollution pattern, which showed a bigger spike in PM10 particles (usually associated with road dust) than PM2.5, finer particles that are emitted during any sort of combustion. ""Usually after Dussehra and Diwali, where firecrackers are burnt, the dominant pollutant in the air is PM 2.5 which is more harmful to health. But this time it is PM 10,"" said Gufran Beig, programme director of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar)./Delhi's air pollution is a toxic mix of vehicular exhaust gases, smoke from burning crops in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana, road dust, and billowing sand from thousands of construction sites. The pollution is intensified by winter weather patterns and hemmed in by the towering Himalayas to the north./After several years of the situation turning severe, authorities drew up an emergency action mechanism Graded Response Action Plan. The Environment Pollution (prevention and control) Authority - the committee responsible for implementing it- announced this year that some pre-emptive measures will be taken before the air worsens./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

How the humble LPG cylinder is changing lives of rural women,"India, Oct. 10 -- Recently I was in the Baramulla district in north Kashmir as part of the NITI Aayog's Aspirational Districts Programme for evaluating the implementation of developmental schemes. During my interaction with the beneficiaries of the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programme, I was realised the reach of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme in the remote villages of Uri block of the district. During several interactions, people of the block told us about how the programme has benefitted their lives./After hearing their views, I visited households of the Ujjwala scheme beneficiaries. I randomly chose a household, and to visit that house, we had to climb a hillock for around 15 minutes. It was a small single-bedroom house. A middle-aged woman took me to her kitchen for tea, which was made using LPG. While making tea, she told us that she doesn't have to spend her time and energy to gather firewood to make her food. In fact, she has now started extra money from knitting during her spare time./Within poorer households, women often face a 'triple burden' - market work, housework and family care. As families grow bigger, this burden increases as women are expected to participate both in low-paying jobs and also function as the main caregiver of the household. Estimates suggest that Indian rural women spend 374 hours a year collecting firewood. Over four million people die prematurely because of illnesses arising from open and polluting cooking fire sources. Women are the most significant sufferers of unclean fuel sources and are susceptible to heart diseases, lung cancer, are at the risk of contracting tuberculosis and cataract. Studies show that by shifting to LPG, women and girls may save up to 1.5 hours a day, allowing them time for education, self-employment and participation in the community activities. Studies from Africa also suggest that shifting to cleaner alternatives increase women's labour force participation by upto 9%./Even as efforts have been strong to implement the scheme, certain roadblocks still exist. While those who availed the scheme expressed great satisfaction, poorer families face challenges when it came to refilling the cylinders. Taking cognisance of these hindrances, the government subsidised refilling of cylinder by directly transferring the subsidy amount into the account of the woman head of household. This scheme coupled with the 'GiveItUp' campaign, has been encouraging the general population to give up their LPG subsidy in favour of those in need. As a result, LPG coverage has increased from 56% in 2015 to 95% in 2019. Even then supply chain management and beneficiary identification continue to be a cause of concern. Addressing these concerns KM Mahesh, director, ministry of petroleum said: ""Efforts are underway to make beneficiaries adopt LPG on a sustainable basis. Greater push is being given to promote 5 kg refills and to promote adoption through 'change management' by conducting LPG Panchayats and safety clinics for beneficiaries""./While efforts to increase usage beyond first time installation are underway, the international community has been lauding government efforts. Through this scheme, India has been making progress on Sustainable Development Goals. It is promoting gender equality, giving women opportunities for self-development by creating additional employment opportunities(Goal 5); promoting good health (Goal 3); providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (Goal 7); and, combating air pollution (Goal 13 and Goal 15)./In a nutshell, the Ujjwala scheme is heralding ""The Blue Flame Revolution"". It is impacting the lives of poor rural women by empowering and allowing them leisure time which they rightfully deserve./Vijayashree Yellappa is a consultant with NITI Aayog./The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Spurt in stubble burning in Pakistan raises heat in Punjab,"Ludhiana, Oct. 11 -- The Punjab government is working on war footing to curb farm fires ahead of the celebrations of 550 birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, but rising incidents of stubble burning in Pakistan, particularly near border areas of Punjab, have raised concern among scientists at Punjab remote sensing center (PRSC) and Punjab agricultural university (PAU)./In satellite images captured on October 8 and 9, the PRSC which is monitoring fire incidents in Punjab fields, has spotted many field fires emerging near bordering areas of Lahore, Basirpur, Havali Lakha area and Bahawal Nagar in Pakistan./Senior scientist of PRSC Anil Sood said the number of farm fires is far higher as compared to early trends of stubble burning emerging from Majha area of Punjab. Beside Pakistan, paddy straw burning incidents have begun to emerge from area surrounding Kaithal, Pehowa and Ambala of poll-bound Haryana./Sood said the trajectory of wind also plays an important role. Met department officials confirmed that the wind direction at present is north-westerly, which comes from Pakistan to India./Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head of department, climate change and agricultural meteorology, said ""In October, wind blows from North-West and there is a strong possibility that smoke particles could travel and pollute Indian cities including Delhi, where air quality is already on the decline."" She also said that as the month progresses, calm conditions may prevail wherein the smoke settles and is not disbursed properly, which result in smoky conditions that have been witnessed in previous years./Sutantar Kumar Airi, director, agriculture Punjab, said that Pakistan has been repeatedly urged to curb farm fires, but it has evoked no response. ""While the state is celebrating 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the neighbouring country is increasingly jeopardising the occasion,"" said Airi./PAU experts said burning of stubble leads to an alarming rise in the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) which is of serious concern for cities such as Amritsar, Ludhiana and Chandigarh. The situation could be alarming in New Delhi with average levels occasionally exceeding 700 micrograms (?g) to milligrams (mg)./Experts from Cornell and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in a recent study 'Tradeoffs Between Groundwater Conservation and Air Pollution From Agricultural Fires in Northwest India' stated that pollution, particularly caused by stubble burning, leads to an estimated 16,000 premature deaths caused every year in New Delhi capital region, with an aggregate reduction in life expectancy of 6 years./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi's air quality slips to 'poor' category, could worsen","India, Oct. 11 -- The quality of air in Delhi slipped further in the 'poor' category on Friday as authorities recorded the Air Quality Index (AQI) 228 at 1am./The concentration of particulate matter - PM 2.5 and PM 10 - levels in the Capital air saw a spike over the past 24 hours./According to officials, the dip was mainly because of the withdrawal of monsoon from the National Capital Region and change in wind pattern combined with effects of crop stubble burning in neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab./The national capital's air quality fell into 'poor' category on Thursday for the first time after nearly a three-month-long spell of good air with AQI recorded as 211 at 4pm./The air quality further deteriorated to 223 by 10pm, as pollutants accumulated over the night, a level not seen since July 14 when it was 235./Also read | Post-Dussehra pollution in Delhi lowest in 5 years/System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality forecasting system under the Union ministry of earth sciences, had predicted on Thursday that the pollution levels could rise over the next 48 hours./The air quality before Dussehra on Tuesday, October 8, was in 'satisfactory and 'moderate' category. It took a hit after effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkarana and Meghnad were burnt along with the firecrackers during the festival./However, environment monitoring officials had said residents of Delhi breathed the cleanest air in five years for a day that falls immediately after Dussehra./Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that on Wednesday, the city's overall air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 173 compared to 326 last year./AQI in the range of 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'./Delhi's air pollution is a toxic mix of vehicular exhaust gases, smoke from burning crops in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana, road dust, and billowing sand from thousands of construction sites./The pollution is intensified by winter weather patterns and hemmed in by the towering Himalayas to the north./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi model: Good environment policies also make good politics,"India, Oct. 12 -- This week, I joined city leaders from 94 of world's greatest metropolises around the globe at the C40 Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen to take bold action to address the issues of climate change and air pollution. Since I couldn't be there in person, I joined them throught videoconferencing./Representing over 700 million citizens and a quarter of the global economy, these cities, of which Delhi is a member, have come together to form a global coalition to deliver a healthier and sustainable future to their citizens. While speaking at this summit, I was reminded of the words used by the young climate activist from Sweden, Greta Thunberg, at the United Nations Climate Summit. She said, ""You all come to us, young people, for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. People are suffering, people are dying, entire eco-systems are collapsing.""/While some may disagree with Thunberg's methods, the issues of climate change and pollution that she is raising are finding increasing support from people across the globe, especially those who have the biggest stake in our planet's future - the youth. Yet, world leaders seem to have lagged behind in fully understanding the gravity of the situation. Political leadership has to provide direction to safeguard the lives of our future generations./During our first year in office, with the onset of the winter of 2015, the air quality in Delhi started deteriorating. Due to temperature inversion, a thick blanket of smog engulfed the city and its surroundings. The Delhi High Court termed Delhi a gas chamber. There were two major reasons behind this alarming situation - the smoke coming to Delhi from neighbouring states due to crop residue burning, and the smoke from firecrackers burnt during Diwali./This was an extraordinary situation, and it required an extraordinary response. As the chief minister of Delhi, I had to take a call on what to do. After a lot of deliberation, our government decided to introduce the experiment of reducing vehicles drastically on Delhi roads for a fortnight, which was unheard of in our country till then - the odd-even scheme./This was not easy. We were warned that the odd-even scheme had failed wherever it was implemented in any city across the world because people didn't cooperate. I was aware of the fact that what we were venturing into was asking the residents of my city to change their way of living. We were asking them to give up their comfort for the collective good of the city. I was apprehensive about how people would respond to the government's decision./But we chose to trust Delhiites and undertook a massive awareness campaign through both the media and personal outreach, which was supported by flawless implementation by different government agencies. People followed odd-even beyond our wildest imagination and it was a huge success./This support from the people gave us tremendous encouragement and strength to, one by one, introduce several more measures to reduce pollution. The use of diesel vehicles was restricted; measures were taken to control levels of dust pollution at construction sites; all coal-based power plants were closed; the Supreme Court-mandated emergency action plan (Grap) was strictly enforced; all industrial units in Delhi were made to switch to clean fuels; and a large-scale afforestation drive was initiated across Delhi./Today, after four years, the pollution levels in Delhi have stopped increasing. In fact, it has reduced by 25%. Delhi has today become a model for other Indian cities battling extreme levels of air pollution - seven of the world's 10 most polluted cities are in India - in showing that with a clear and bold plan of action, it is possible to reduce pollution. But it is imperative to carry people along./But we are not satisfied with just a 25% reduction. There is a long way to traverse, and we need to persist till we can guarantee clean air to our citizens 365 days a year as a human right./To ensure this, I joined city leaders of 35 global cities at the C40 Copenhagen Summit in signing the Clean Air Cities Declaration. Cities across the world are battling similar issues and there is a lot that we can learn from each other. London has been a pioneer in introducing low-emission transport zones, Shenzen is leading the charge on clean public transport by transitioning to a 100% electric bus fleet. And Copenhagen has shown how to mainstream biking as a preferred mode of urban transport./As part of Delhi's Clean Air Declaration, we have made a commitment to undertake a large-scale expansion in public transport by doubling our city bus fleet, inducting at least 1,000 fully electric buses, and encouraging the adoption of e-vehicles. We have also committed to greenscaping over 500 kilometre of our roads and undertaking mechanised sweeping at a fixed frequency to drastically reduce dust pollution./It was said earlier that issues like education and healthcare cannot dominate Indian politics. The Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi has shown that this tired, old narrative can be changed./Similarly, based on how the people of Delhi have supported all our efforts to reduce pollution in the last five years, I can confidently say that good environmental policies also make good politics./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"AQI deteriorates further as crop burning, low wind speed trap pollutants","New Delhi, Oct. 12 -- Air quality in the national capital deteriorated further into the ""poor"" category on Saturday as effects of crop stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab and low speed surface winds trapped pollutants./According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), air quality index (AQI) till 4 pm was 222, up from Friday's 216. The levels are within the ""poor"" category./The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a unit of the Union ministry of earth sciences, has forecast that the effect of stubble burning in neighbouring states in Delhi is expected to rise by 6% by October 15, which may result in further deterioration of air quality in the 'very poor' category./""So far the effect from burning of stubble in Punjab and Haryana in Delhi is just around 2%. But, it is expected to rise to 6% by October 15 with the increase in the number of farm fires. However, the dip in air quality will be determined by weather conditions such as wind speed and upper wind direction,"" said a statement issued by Safar on Saturday./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)-taskforce met with stakeholders to review the status of air quality in Delhi./""About 10-20 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5 in overall air quality of Delhi is attributable to stubble burning. Due to monsoon withdrawal, winds are calm leading to low dispersion of pollutants while wind direction has also changed to northwest, which is bringing smoke pollutants from burning to Delhi,"" said V K Soni, senior scientist, IMD, as per a statement issued by the CPCB on Saturday./The pollution watchdog has asked all agencies to step up patrolling and crackdown on violations such as dumping and burning of waste, open storage of construction material, dumping of debris and other demolition waste, use of dirty fuels and other such dust-control norms./""Air quality is likely to remain poor during the next two-three days. All agencies have been asked to step up vigil and comply with all the measures to chat pollution,"" said a senior CPCB official./The AQI for this time of the year is still better in comparison to past few years, partly due to enough widespread moisture due to extended monsoon, it said./On Thursday, Delhi's air quality had for the first time slipped into the 'poor' category -- AQI of 211 --- this season, after the city breathing in three-months of good air./Thursday's pollution spike came a day after Delhi saw its cleanest post-Dussehra air in five years. Previously, Delhi had experienced poor levels of air pollution on July 14 when the AQI was recorded at 235./AQI in the range of 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'./The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had also predicted a rise in the pollution levels in the city from October 12, and ordered the GRAP --- set of emergency measures to combat 'very poor' and 'severe' levels of pollution --- will come into force from October 15./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

We are taking these preventive measures in order to stop the air quality from slipping further,"" Sunita Narain, Epca member, said./""While crop residue burning is an episodic activity and does contribute to air pollution in Delhi, at least 80% of the pollution is from local sources, which need to be cut down,"" she said./Until last year, the ban on DG sets was applicable only in Delhi since NCR towns face frequent power cuts that impact essential utilities such as elevators in high-rises./This year, it will be applicable to the vicinity towns of Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonepat, Panipat and Bahadurgarh as well./The ban comes with exemptions on emergency services such as running elevators during power outages in housing societies and medical facilities, among others./The Epca had asked NCR towns to draw up a plan to ensure 24x7 power supply during this period. When asked, Haryana officials, however, said it was difficult to enforce the ban in their cities as some sectors in Gurugram (sectors 1-58) are not connected to the power grid and are completely dependent on diesel generator sets for their power supply./The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had last week issued directions regarding a ban on generator sets run on diesel, kerosene or petrol. It had issued a list of exemptions that included emergency and essential services./Besides these measures, agencies have been asked to step up night patrolling and monitoring of 13 identified pollution hotspots to prevent burning of waste or the use of unapproved fuels./""While incidents of garbage burning have come down in hotspots such as Bawana, Narela and Mundka, new hotspots - Mandoli in Delhi and others in NCR- are emerging. Constant efforts are needed to check these activities,"" Bhure Lal, chairperson, Epca, said./According to the central pollution wathcdog data, the 24-hour average AQI of Delhi, till 4pm Monday, was 252, in the poor category on a scale of 0 to 500, with 0 being the least polluted and 500 the most severe. This is slightly better than Sunday's AQI of 270./The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a unit under Union ministry of earth sciences, in a statement issued on Monday said, ""So far, the impact of stubble burning on the overall air quality in Delhi has been around 8%. Air quality is likely to deteriorate from the fourth week of October, when the temperature will dip and that, coupled with calm winds, will not allow the dispersion of pollutants.""/On Stubble burning/Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday urged neighbouring state governments to take steps to prevent crop stubble burning, saying smoke from outside is leading to spike in pollution levels in Delhi./""In the last four months, Delhi's air quality has been in 'good' category, which is unprecedented. The smoke coming from outside is increasing pollution levels again. I request all state governments and institutions to intervene,"" he said during a press conference./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Both the governments (Delhi and Centre) can work together to reduce pollution levels in Delhi.""/On Tuesday, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the governments of UP, Haryana and Punjab to make daily reports on air pollution caused by crop residue burning. The green court ordered the state governments to sensitise farmers on the effects of such mass burning in the winter season./The NGT expressed concern over harvesting equipment, which can be an alternative to burning stubble, not reaching farmers. ""The fact remains that there is an adverse impact of burning of such residue on air quality causing air pollution-related diseases,"" the bench said./The bench added, ""Every year in October and November, the problem of air pollution is acute in and around Delhi, threatening the health of people, especially infants and senior citizens.""/It said 25% to 30% air pollution in Delhi-NCR is caused by stubble burning in October and November every year./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

FARM FIRES: NGT rejects Punjab's plea to direct Centre to pay incentive to farmers,"CHANDIGARH, Oct. 17 -- The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has rejected the Punjab government's plea to issue directions to the Centre to give an incentive of Rs.100 per quintal to paddy growers of the state for not burning straw, saying it could pay them on its own if it wanted to./The tribunal in its order on Tuesday pointed that it was an unhappy situation because in the last five years the state government failed to share with farmers the techniques of sowing wheat without burning residue of paddy./""If an incentive is to be given it is for the state to decide and provide the same,"" the bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed./Also, taking cognisance of the worsening air quality that is causing fatal diseases to people in the Delhi-NCR, the tribunal asked three paddy-growing states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to depute a person each to report daily on air pollution due to stubble burning./Saying that crop burning shoots up carbon dioxide levels in the air by 70%, the tribunal asked the three states to sensitise farmers on pollution caused by burning of crop residue./Punjab secretary (agriculture) KS Pannu, who represented the state government in a hearing on Tuesday, said the three states are demanding incentives for farmers for not burning stubble as it was a better option than providing them with subsidised machines./Secretary-level officials from the two states also represented their governments. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has recently written to the Centre for cash incentives for farmers./In the order, the tribunal said the central funds given under different schemes, particularly for in-situ management of stubble, were not utilised fully. It brought on record that against targets for the current year, the three states achieved 30%, 70% and 32% only./In a two-year scheme that started in 2018, the Centre has given Rs.1,150 crore to the three paddy-growing states for in-situ management of paddy stubble by using machines. Of the total outlay, Punjab received Rs.665 crore. These machines are given 50% (individual farmers) and 80% (groups) subsidy. But the impact is not visible as 750 cases have been reported in the current kharif harvest season, with the last year's number pegged at 50,500./Every year, 200 lakh tone tonne straw is produced in the state and only 50 lakh tonne of it is used ex-situ as fodder and in biomass plants while the rest is set on fire. Farmer unions in the state had announced to resort to burning of stubble./Last year, 28,500 machines like happy seeder, super straw management system, straw shredder and bailer machines were given to the state farmers for in-situ management of paddy stubble while the target is 28,000 this year./Even as 14,600 machines have been distributed so far, the state government says it will meet the target by October 31./""It is clear that steps taken are inadequate and do not provide for ground checking and vigilance,"" said the tribunal, directing the state government to make efforts to check farm fires./It asked the Centre and the state government place on their websites the data of fire incidents, fix responsibility of the officers responsible for the area in which fires take place on a daily basis and take action for non-compliance./The tribunal asked state to submit a status report on November 15./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Real-time air data from next year: CM,"New Delhi, Oct. 18 -- Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that from April next year, Delhi will be able to provide real-time air pollution data and ascertain contribution of each source./Kejriwal while talking about the city's air quality, which improved marginally on Thursday, also reiterated that it is wrong to blame Delhiites alone for the city's poor air./At present, there is no agency in the national Capital for real-time source apportionment of air pollution. ""We have tied up with Washington University for this and a centre has been set up near India Gate. From April, 2020, we'll be able to provide the details of air pollution and its sources in intervals of four hours,"" he said during a press conference./""The machine has already been installed. But, for specific outcome, one year base-level study is required. So since March, we have been collecting samples on a daily basis to prepare the base data of a year of Delhi's air pollution,"" Kejriwal said./When asked about pollution monitoring agencies attributing Delhi's pollution to local factors rather than stubble burning in neighbouring states, Kejriwal said the opinions expressed by various experts are correct, but are coming with different perspectives./""Today I read an expert opinion, which was actually based on a June 2015 report by IIT-Kanpur. We can't take a policy decision on the basis of data/findings from four years ago... Pollution in Delhi is caused by both internal and external sources. It is not right to blame the people of Delhi only for pollution. No other city has reduced pollution by 25%. Delhi has done it. People of Delhi deserve appreciation,"" he said./The chief minister added that unless there are efforts to tackle the smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states, Delhi's problems will continue./Dipankar Saha, former additional director of the Central Pollution Control Board, said the need of the hour is investment on a forecasting system. ""Real-time analysis can generate awareness among masses. But one has to understand that air is a dynamic concept and highly dependent on meteorological behaviours. A good forecasting system will help people ascertain what preventive measures to take and how can they contribute in lessening the pollution problem,"" he said./A debate erupted between the Delhi government and experts after SAFAR, the ministry of earth science's air quality and weather forecast service, that had earlier this week said the share of stubble burning in PM 2.5 concentration in Delhi has remained less than 10% so far. On Wednesday, Kejriwal had refuted the claim saying the attribution was ""misleading"". PM 2.5 are ultra fine particles of pollutants that are most hazardous to human health./Kejriwal cited a report prepared by ARAI-TERI in 2018 which was based on 2016-17 data and said local sources were responsible for 36% air pollution in Delhi during winters, while in summers the same sources contributed only 26%./""The degree of pollution in the Delhi's air due to different sources cannot be determined by any agency at present because the technique for real time source apportionment of pollution is not available. Last week, one agency stated stubble burning contributed only 1% to Delhi's air pollution, whereas another agency claimed it was 10%. If these studies are being carried out using scientific method then how can there be such a wide variation?"" the chief minister questioned./Sumit Sharma, director TERI, said that real-time air pollution analysis is a welcome move./""On a seasonal average basis, agriculture burning cause 5% of air pollution in Delhi between November 1 and February 28. However, in the peak crop burning period, it can go up to 40-50%. This is where daily variation analysis plays an important role,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Diwali: Another test for Delhi's right to breathe,"New Delhi, Oct. 21 -- Come festival season, residents of Delhi and its suburban towns look forward to a nip in the air and festivities. But this is also that time of the year when they stare at a boding evil - a heavy dose of air pollution./The air is already thick with emissions and dust generated locally and smoke from the crop residue burning in the neighbouring states makes it worse. The drop in temperature and slow wind-speed traps the toxic air, turning Delhi and National Capital Region into what is often described as a ""gas chamber""./Then, thanks to unabated burning of firecrackers on the Diwali night, the city's air quality plunges to dangerous lows, choking the city for days, if not weeks, to follow. This year, though, the residents can make a real difference if they show some resolve./Following the ban imposed by the Supreme Court last year on the sale and use of conventional fireworks, which are the worst possible cocktail of toxins, the government is now offering green crackers with at least 30% reduction in emissions. These crackers, developed in government labs led by scientists from the Council of Scientific &#38; Industrial Research's National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI), are still scant in supply./This is good news if Delhi restricts the fireworks to the legally available limited stock. Green crackers also pollute and there is every sense in limiting their use. And there is no enterprise in compensating for the short supply of green crackers by illegally procuring the banned firecrackers unless one is on a suicide mission./Last Diwali, the ban imposed by Supreme Court on burning conventional firecrackers was flouted, draping the city with unrelenting smog. Living in a polluted city, the fascination for firecrackers is an indulgence Delhi residents simply cannot afford./The argument that bursting firecrackers on the Diwali night is a tradition we must continue with does not hold water. In fact, Diwali has traditionally been the festival of light. Fireworks, in any case, are a borrowed craze. Gunpowder was invented in China more than a thousand years ago. The Chinese believe that the loud sound from firecrackers drives away evil spirits and burning them during the Lunar New Year is an ancient Chinese tradition. But that did not come in the way of the proud inventor restricting the use of firecrackers to fight air pollution. Today, over 400 Chinese cities have banned fireworks or restricted the time and place to set them off./But we need not necessarily learn from China how to break away from this ""tradition"" for the sake of a cleaner environment. We have already shown that it is possible in Delhi. This year, the ban on idol immersions into the Yamuna during Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja was successfully enforced after organisers broke from the past and culminated the festivals by conducting visarjan (immersion) in artificial tanks instead./For years, these idols - mostly made of plaster of Paris that takes years to fully dissolve in water, and coloured in paints containing heavy metals - had been poisoning the already toxic waters of the Yamuna./A study conducted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee showed that because of the ban on idol immersion in the river this Ganesh Chaturthi, the Yamuna's water was less polluted as compared to the post-immersion phase last year. The report for Durga Puja is awaited, but the authorities are hoping to get encouraging results./On October 9, Delhi saw the cleanest post-Dusshera day in five years. While some organisers did limit the use of firecrackers with digital visualisation for effigy burning, what really helped were favourable meteorological conditions such as the prolonged monsoon and high wind speeds, said experts./If some efforts were indeed made to reduce air pollution on Dusshera evening, we need to scale them up for Diwali night because Delhi cannot bet its air quality on good fortune alone or expect to get second time lucky./Ultimately, ensuring a healthier Diwali cannot become a compliance issue. Unless the residents of Delhi themselves commit to cleaner air, no court or government can make it breathable. While the debate to single out emission, construction or stubble burning for air pollution will continue, let's resolve to keep at least our celebrations out of that blame game./<a href=""mailto:shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com"">shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com</a>/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi can drive the country's energy transition,"India, Oct. 21 -- With limited electricity-generating capacity, Delhi imports most of its electricity from neighbouring states. But these states have a high share of coal and gas power plants. Moreover, these power plants are polluting and worsen Delhi's air pollution crisis. With band-aid fixes such as the odd-even scheme, ban on crackers, only the symptoms are treated, and not the disease. Delhi, though, has the potential to transition to 100% renewables. Over the next couple of months, a Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT)?team will look at Delhi's hourly demand to map a 100% renewable energy transition pathway./The recent United Nations Global Sustainable Development report finds that the current development model is not sustainable, and the progress made in the last two decades is in danger of being reversed through potentially irreversible declines in the natural environment driven by climate change and worsening social inequalities./A consensus among scientists and other stakeholders is that a far more optimistic future is still attainable, but only by drastically changing current development practices, policies and incentives. This implies an acceleration in the transition of the global energy system towards sustainable renewable energy technologies. The report by REN21 suggests that cities around the world are at the forefront of the global energy transition with 55% of the population living in cities that account for 65% of the energy demand and emit nearly 75% of carbon dioxide emissions./India has been among the progressive countries, pursuing ambitious renewable energy targets, in recent times the capacity has crossed the 80 GW mark, and is on course to meet its target of 175 GW of renewables by 2022. While, Delhi still receives most of its electricity from coal and gas power plants that make up 86% of the installed capacity mix./The Sustainable Cities Index 2015 that judged 50 major world cities based on social, economic and environmental factors ranked Delhi among the worst cities. While local sources like transport, household cooking, waste burning and construction dust make for 60% of pollution in the city, the remaining 40% comes from outside city borders like coal-fired power plants, industrial emissions, brick kilns and agricultural waste burning. As political leaders start campaigning for elections in Delhi during the upcoming smoggy winter months, the issue has taken centre stage with Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal's seven-point plan to tackle air pollution. It is clear that the problem has got political attention, but effective solutions remain to be found./There have been some initiatives from the Delhi government with its solar policy targeting 294 MW by 2020. On the other hand, the Delhi government is exploring options to promote electric vehicles. According to a draft policy, the Delhi government wants 25% of all new vehicles to be electric. These efforts seem futile, lack a clear and coherent pathway, and need an ambitious vision to drive the changes required at all levels./Cities around the world have a vital role to play in mitigating climate change and transforming energy systems, not only by individual actions of city dwellers in the form of PV prosumers but also influence the policies of the country. PV prosumers are expected to play a vital role in the Indian energy transition as shown in a study by LUT. According to a report by Greenpeace and Bridge to India, Delhi could produce around 2,557MW, which is more than 40% of its peak electricity demand by tapping only around 4% of the available rooftop area. Nearly half of this potential comes from residential buildings. With a comprehensive plan for the entire energy sector, Delhi can pursue a carbon neutral pathway. Several regions across the world are already generating reliably with 100% of their annual electricity from renewables: for example, two north German states, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and the Danish island of Samsoe./Decision-makers require energy transition analyses with high spatial and temporal resolutions, not only on the global scale but also at national, regional and city levels. In this context, analyses conducted on full hourly resolution can demonstrate in considerable detail the technical viability, as well as the economic feasibility of 100% renewables based energy systems./One such recent research conducted by LUT and Energy Watch Group generated results for a 100% renewables based global energy system at hourly resolution for a long-term perspective until 2050. The results demonstrate successfully that a 100% renewables-based energy system can contribute significantly to the utmost relevant societal desideratum, which is achieving a net zero emission global energy sector by 2050 and most importantly, in an affordable manner./Therefore, there is a pressing need for energy transition plans at the city level and especially for political capitals such as Delhi, which can have tremendous impacts on the countries policies and drive the country's transition towards a sustainable future./Manish Ram is a doctoral researcher at Lappeenranta University of Technology/The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"On fire for last 24 hrs, Bhalswa landfill spewing toxic fumes","New Delhi, Oct. 21 -- Even as the national capital is reeling under ' poor' air quality and is gearing to implement the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme to control air pollution, a major fire broke out in the Bhalswa landfill in north Delhi on Saturday night. Till late Sunday night, fire personnel were at the spot trying to douse the fire./On Sunday, dense smoke could be seen for several kilometres even as fire fighters struggled to access the burning region of the garbage dumpyard. There were five fire tenders at the spot late Sunday night./The Delhi Fire Services (DFS) said that the fire began around 11.45 pm on Saturday. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) air monitoring system stopped giving data from 6pm that day./On Monday, BJP Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari and West Delhi MP Hans Raj Hans are scheduled to inaugurate a trommel machines that would help separate garbage particles by size./North Delhi Municipal Corporation officials said that this was the first big fire at the landfill since a massiv blaze last October. ""We kept releasing the gases by regularly upturning the garbage and aerating the surface of the landfill. Despite high temperatures having the potential of causing regular fires, this summer we did not witness any major blazes,"" said a North MCD official./Vipin Kental, DFS director, said that the height of the landfill was making it difficult for the fire tenders to climb the garbage hill and douse the flames. ""One of our fire tenders slipped while climbing,"" said Kental./Describing the situation on the ground, Kental said that much of the fire is along the edges of the landfill. ""We cannot send our water pipes from below. The fire tenders cannot reach the edges. We cannot use our high rise apparatus as there is no space to position them safely,"" said Kental. ""Much of our focus has been limited to preventing the fire from spreading any further.""/The director said that the only practical solution is to bury the burning garbage using sand in order to smother the flames, but he wasn't sure how it could be done. He added that the blaze was ""fierce"" due to the emission of methane amid the highly combustible materials in the landfill/North MCD officers, however, said it was ""not a big fire"". ""From what we know, it was spread only over 10m out of the 1,800 m of the total landfill mass. Such fires are either created by burning beedis and cigarettes dropped by ragpickers, or methane flare-ups from inside the landfill, which has garbage putrefying,"" said the official./Landfill sites are prone to spontaneous fires because of methane emissions. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that the fumes released from the burning of all types of waste at the landfill are toxic in nature./""These fumes contribute to higher pollution levels in the area, particularly this time of the year. The authorities need to scale up measures such as reducing and recycling of waste and greening the slopes for reducing such emissions. The focus has to be on reducing the waste being dumped at the landfill sites,"" said Roychowdhury./The Bhalswa landfill which is spread over 52 acres and is 62 metres tall was created in 1984. It contains 70 lakh metric tonnes of waste./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

This is the most critical window. We need to avoid this by bringing in pre-emptive measures because reacting after-the-fact will be nearly futile,"" said Mukesh Sharma, a professor of civil engineering from IIT Kanpur./The analysis, based on the last three years, has been sent to government agencies and pollution watchdogs for action and it comes at a time when satellite image analysis has shown a sharp rise in fires spotted in Punjab and Haryana./According to data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (Nasa) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), the number of incidents observed in the last two days was 177% higher than the average number over the seven days before that. In all, nearly 1,000 fires were spotted on Sunday alone./The findings of the IIT Kanpur team are similar to a separate study done by researchers from IIT Delhi, University of California, University of Illinois, and other research organisations in 2018: They found pollution in Delhi at an all-time high between October 29 and November 4./In the fortnight period identified by the IIT Kanpur team, pollution levels usually remain in the severe category with air quality index (AQI) varying between 400 and 500. The level of PM2.5 and PM10 particles reaches at least five to six times above the safe limits of 60?g/m3 and 100?g/m3./PM2.5 are ultrafine particles which stick deep inside the lungs and take the heaviest toll on human health./This year, the Delhi government has announced that the ""odd-even"" road rationing plan will be in force between November 4 and November 15, prohibiting the use of some private cars based on the date and the number in which their registrations end./The study has also suggested that Delhi's air quality is mainly dependent on pollution sources within a radius of 75km around the national capital./""It can even be seen [from data of three previous years] that wind speed drops sharply during this period. The other factor is vertical mixing height, which also drops during this period,"" the IIT Kanpur study said./According to researchers from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology under the ministry of earth sciences, Delhi needs a minimum wind speed of 10km per hour for pollutants to be dispersed.

"Stubble or no stubble, Delhi's air pollution will continue to pinch | Opinion","India, Oct. 23 -- Delhi assembly election is just four months away and air pollution is a poll issue, though not raging./The period between October 29 and November 12 will be the most critical. Scientists from IIT-Kanpur have said that pollution spikes in the national capital in this period. In 2018, IIT-Delhi researchers too had said that October 29 to November 4 is the period when pollution levels shoot up in Delhi./The pollution levels so far this year are slightly lower than the previous years, thanks to favourable weather conditions./The air pollution levels in Delhi go up in the winter as particulate matter gets trapped at the ambient level due to negligible wind speed for dispersal, coupled with some contribution by farm fires in the northern plains of India./The reason is simple-if there is no wind speed in Delhi to disperse particulates causing temperature inversion, how can there be wind bringing smoke pollutants from the northern plains. In such a scenario, the air pollution gets locally trapped even in the farm fire zones, which has high concentration of pollutants. Sadly, there is not much scientific data on the air pollution levels in the farm fire zones./Some scientists argue that due to its geological positioning Delhi sees witnesses an air islanding impact. But, if that had to happen than towns in the foothills of the Himalayas such as Chandigarh and Dehradun should also have higher air pollution impact as they face higher islanding impact than Delhi and are closer to farm fire areas in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh./The Central Pollution Control Board's real-time air data from October 1 to October 18, 2019, of Delhi and towns in the farm fire regions of northern India does not support that argument that stubble burning causes major spike in the national capital's air pollution./During this period, the stubble burning cases in Punjab and Haryana this year were almost same as in 2018, meaning that farms of Punjab and Haryana emitted same amount of smoke. But, the impact on Delhi was much less./The reason could be found in the CPCB air pollution data./On national highway-1 (GT Karnal road), the average particulate matter (PM 2.5) air pollution level in Ambala between October 1 and 18 was 72.5 micrograms in cubic meter of air. At Karnal, the next major town on the highway, it increased to 96.24 and was 102.56 in Panipat. In south of Delhi in Haryana, the pollution levels at Ballabgarh was 122.5 and on the eastern side, in Bahadurgarh, it was 103.25 micrograms in cubic meter of air./At the major stubble burning areas in Haryana in districts of Karnal, Kaithal, Jind and Rohtak, the PM 2.5 level was much less. In Kaithal, the average for the period was about 47.32 micrograms in cubic meter of air and in Jind it was 54.5. In the paddy growing areas of Punjab such as Patiala, Jalandhar and Amritsar districts, the PM 2.5 level during this period ranged between 43.22 micrograms in cubic meter of air to 81.88./Data provided by the Punjab and Haryana governments show that there is not much increase in stubble burning cases this year as compared to 2018./In Punjab, till October 17, the government booked 1,198 cases against farmers for stubble burning as compared to 1,631 in 2018 and 2,927 in 2017. In Haryana's Panipat, Sonipat and Karnal districts, till October 18, 2019, about 1,200 cases have been registered against farmers as compared to 1,224 for the same period in 2018 and 1,788 in 2017./If the stubble burning was the real cause for Delhi's rise in air pollution, its impact should have been visible in the outskirts of the national capital, from where the smoke laden air from Haryana and Punjab would descend./The CPCB data shows that the pollution levels are higher in congested central parts of Delhi such as Punjabi Bagh, ITO and Kashmere Gate as compared to outskirts such as Narela in north, Mundka in west and Karni Singh Stadium in south Delhi./For instance, PM 2.5 level in Narela between October 1 and October 18 was 142.5 micrograms in cubic meter of air, in Mundka it was 118.3 and in Karni Singh Stadium 114.5 whereas in Lajpat Nagar the average for the period was 210.4 and in Kashmere Gate 221.9./This data clearly shows that vehicular congestion is a major reason for spike in pollution levels during this season when dispersal of pollutants is poor and experts also agree./""Two factors are major contributors for air pollution in Delhi. Rising vehicular traffic and poor dust management,"" said Sunita Narain, director general of Centre for Science and Environment. ""Air pollution rises during this period as dispersal of pollution is very low because of almost zero wind speed.""/Narain said that during festival season, there are more vehicles on the road, which leads to increase in local generation of air pollutants./""Poor management of dust and no landscaping around roads leads to further circulation of dust in ambient air leading to higher pollution levels. But, this also shows the bad state of our civic authorities,"" she said./The argument is not that Punjab and Haryana should not scientifically deal with the paddy stubble. It should to improve air quality in rural parts of the two agrarian states. Also, scientific management of stubble burning can add to the earning of farmers as several bio-renewable products can be produced from paddy stubble./But Delhi must not blame its inefficiency on someone else and refuse to deal with the in-house problem. Close to 80% of the capital's air pollutants are produced locally and the administration needs to implement several plans in place to deal with it./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Stubble burning: CPCB asks Punjab to be extra vigilant in districts close to Delhi,"India, Oct. 23 -- Chandigarh The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked Punjab to be extra vigilant in checking stubble burning cases in districts that are close to Delhi. ""There are more chances that the smoke from the burning of stubble in districts of Punjab on the borders of Haryana will contribute to smog over the national capital. This leads to the formation of a thick-jacket in Delhi post-Diwali, so we were told to be more vigilant in these districts,"" said Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary Krunesh Garg who attended the meeting./CPCB chairman SPS Parihaar chaired the meeting that officials of the state pollution control boards of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh attended./Garg added that Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala, Mansa, Bathinda, Mohali and Fatehgarh Sahib districts had reported the highest number of cases last year. ""In Sangrur, for instance, only one village refrained from stubble burning. If fires can be controlled in Mansa, Sangrur, Patiala and Bathinda there would be a visible difference in the number of cases,"" he added. Last year, the total number of cases from these districts was 19,554./Overall, in the 2018 kharif season, 50,479 cases were reported. This was an increase over the corresponding period in 2017; the area, however, had fallen 10% over the previous year./Last week, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had asked Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to depute a person each to report daily on air pollution due to stubble burning. Saying that stubble burning raises carbon dioxide levels in the air by 70%, the tribunal had also asked these states to sensitise farmers./Garg added that after the orders, senior officers of the rank of administrative secretaries were made in-charge of each district. It was also made mandatory to install super straw management machines in all harvest machines for in-situ management of paddy stubble./'DELIVERY OF MACHINES TO PICK UP FROM OCT 25'/Speaking on slow pace of delivery of machines to farmers Manmohan Kalia, a nodal officer for crop residue management, told HT, ""The pace of delivery of machines will pick up once wheat sowing begins in the state, from October 25 to November 1."" He added that the Punjab government had sought an extension in deadline for delivering these subsidised machines for management for paddy stubble to farmers to November 15./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi's air quality back in 'very poor' zone, days after Diwali may be worse","India, Oct. 25 -- The air quality fell to ""very poor"" levels on Thursday and is likely to worsen over the next few days, weather officials said, warning of a deterioration in conditions in the coming days - particularly after Diwali./The daily air quality index (AQI) - calculated as a 24-hour average till 4pm - was at 311 on Thursday, a level last seen on October 16 before a pick-up in wind speeds helped keep air pollution down./According to a Delhi environment department official, easterly winds will cease from Sunday - the day of Diwali - and will be replaced by northwesterly winds, which could bring in pollutants from farm fires in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana./The change in wind direction will also cause a drop in temperature, and, along with residual moisture, could create fog./""This could turn matters worse, as the calm winds, fog and dip in temperature could help trap the smoke from stubble burning, firecrackers and other local emissions,"" this official added, asking not to be named./The warning prompted the task-force headed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to recommend a slew of pre-emptive measures such as banning construction activity between 6pm and 6am, and shutting down coal-powered industries (except power plants) from October 26 to October 30 in Delhi and neighbouring satellite towns./A final call would be taken by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority. ""We will take the call as soon as we receive the recommendations,"" said Sunita Narain, member of EPCA./""The next few days will be challenging and in addition to intense action by agencies, additional preventive measures may be required to check the deteriorating air quality,"" said Prashant Gargava, member secretary of CPCB, who headed the task-force meeting./By 7pm on Thursday, the concentration of PM10 (the coarser dust particles) was already three times the permissible limit of 100ug/m3. The concentration of PM2.5 - ultra fine particles that can reach deep within lungs - was more than twice the safe limits of 60ug/m3./The minimum temperature, which was hovering at 17.7degC on Thursday, is predicted to drop to around 15degC on Diwali and post-Diwali day. The maximum temperature on Thursday was 32.1 degrees Celsius./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

High alert sounded on Diwali pollution,"India, Oct. 26 -- Authorities ordered on Friday a ban on overnight construction work in the National Capital Region (NCR) and called for closer scrutiny to check farm fires in neighbouring states, sounding a ""high alert"" on air pollution that is predicted to get worse over the coming days./The moves come at a time when farm fires appeared to have been raging at the same frequency as last year, according to an analysis of data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) satellites, and weather conditions are expected to exacerbate local pollution./""All implementing agencies in Delhi-NCR to be on high alert and strictly enforce law for controlling pollution activities including actions for checking stubble burning in the states of Punjab and Haryana,"" the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) said in its directions sent to the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh./According to an analysis of data from Nasa's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), there were 5,414 fires spotted in Punjab and Haryana between October 18 and 24 - slightly higher than the 5,228 seen in the same period last year./Farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh are common during a 30-day window that begins in mid-October. Farmers set fire to stubble left behind after harvesting paddy in order to clear fields before sowing winter crops./On Friday, the Prime Minister's Office asked Punjab and Haryana ""to use every resource available so that stubble burning could be brought down""./Epca, appointed by the Supreme Court, also said that no construction activity will be allowed between 6pm and 6am, and coal-based industries will have to shut down till Wednesday in NCR./The traffic police have been directed to deploy additional personnel to ensure smooth traffic, which is usually high around this time of the year due to festivities. Government agencies have also been directed to strictly impose the Supreme Court's ban on conventional crackers./The directions, which the Delhi government also ordered to be implemented, came a day after a task force headed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) issued a series of recommendations following a warning by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) of a possible spike in pollution levels the morning after Diwali when it is also expected to be foggy./On Thursday, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) encountered its second 'very poor' air quality day since October 15. The AQI improved marginally on Friday to 284 from 311, entering the 'poor' category./Meteorologists said that northwesterly winds, which usually brings with them smoke from stubble burning regions, would start blowing over the weekend./""Because of these factors, smoke and the pollutants in the air could easily get trapped and air quality could deteriorate from Diwali onwards. The morning after Diwali could be particularly bad if fire crackers are burnt,"" said a senior official of the Delhi environment department./SAFAR, the Union government's pollution forecasting agency, said on Friday that the highest impact of fire cracker emissions is expected early on Monday morning - between 1 am and 6 am. But this year the effect from fireworks is expected to be less than what it was in 2018, the agency said./""If there is no extra emission from fireworks, then air quality would remain in the very poor zone during Diwali and on the post-Diwali day. However, if 50% of the total load of fire crackers (as compared to average of Diwali-2017 and 2018) is burnt, the AQI may plunge into severe category for a short period,"" it explained in its release./""At least 13 districts have been identified in Punjab and Haryana based on satellite monitoring where stubble burning is maximum. They are all located along the Punjab-Haryana border. The Prime Minister's Office reviewed the air quality situation in Delhi and NCR and has instructed the two states to use every resource available so that stubble burning could be brought down in these districts to the extent possible,"" said CK Mishra, Union environment secretary./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"We did start the fire, but no choice: Two states' farmers","Amritsar, Oct. 26 -- In Punjab's Tarn Taran district, 67-year-old Gurnam Singh stepped onto his two-acre field that had tufts of dry shoots, remnants of the paddy (rice crop) that he had harvested earlier in the month./It was nearing midday and the morning dew had evaporated./It's already a bit late. I have to sow wheat now to harvest in April, said Singh as he set his field on fire./The green and gold fields ripe for harvest on either side of the national highway-54 that bordered Singh's field was turning black from the soot./Singh's field is one that he took on rent to grow his crops. He spends almost Rs.1 lakh a year to earn just Rs.20,000 in profits a year./He knew there was a ban on burning the crop residue. He knew too that the government had subsidised equipment to help farmers deal with the stubble without burning them./I had applied for the equipment in September that the government said would help clear the stubble, he said. ""I was asked to come back a few days later as the machine was already rented by another farmer. But when I did, I got the same response: 'come back in a few days, another farmer has it'. I couldn't go on like this. I can't delay sowing the next crop. Hence, I had to put this fire.""/Only those with some clout and owning big farms were able to get the machine first, said Singh./The machine he is talking about has two parts: the Straw Management System (SMS) that levels the field by flattening the stubble shoots, and the ""Happy Seeder"" that sows wheat into the soil./In the market, the two systems cost over Rs.6 lakh./To promote the machines and alleviate the burden on the farmers, the Centre had provided Rs.1,151.80 crore to farmers in Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan under a centrally sponsored scheme, the Agricultural Mechanisation for in-situ Management of Crop Residues./The scheme allows individual farmers 50% subsidy and farmers' cooperatives, self-help groups, registered societies and other entrepreneurs looking to set up a custom hiring centres (CHC) 80% subsidy on the purchase of these machines./Rattan Singh Mann, from Haryana's Bharatiya Kisan Union (BHU), said farmers can rent the Happy Seeder and the SMS at a cost of Rs.3,400 per acre. ""If there is a cheap and effective alternative to burning stubble why will farmers not adopt that? The problem is that the subsidies are not reaching small farmers,"" Mann said./Most other farmers in villages across Punjab and Haryana, that Hindustan Times spoke to, said the machines to remove the stubble were accessible only to a group of ""well-off""./Harcharan Singh, who owns an acre in Shivpuri Village, talks about another problem: the Happy Seeders require tall tractors to be mounted on./Most farmers like me don't own such tractors. Hiring them will eat up into our profits, Singh said. ""Farming itself is a dying profession. We don't get the desired return for our hard work. Setting the field on fire is the easiest and cheapest option for us. And why is the government after poor farmers, what about the polluting vehicles and the industrial fumes?""/Rasal Singh, 45, of Baila Manjpur village in Amritsar, said, ""The rent for the Happy Seeder is around Rs.3,400 per acre. I have only two acres. After all the toil and expenses I'm able to save only around Rs.3,000 -4,000. I can't afford to hire the equipment.""/A senior official from the Punjab agricultural department said, ""We have formed cooperatives and asked village heads to ensure everyone gets the machine. One set of equipment is given per cooperative. Also, we keep organising awareness programmes, but it will take some time for things to change. There are many who have stopped the stubble burning practice altogether.""/So, without the equipment, farmers have no choice but to resort to burning the stubble./Punjab/In Punjab, between September 25 and October 17 this year, there were 1,631 incidents of crop stubble burning in comparison to 1,198 between September 25 and October 17 in 2018, according to data from the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB). Tarn Taran, along with Amritsar and Patiala, account for the highest number of crop residue burning incidents this year in Punjab, according to officials from PPCB./The dates vary every year for satellite monitoring, which depend on the harvest of paddy varieties. This year, some of the Basmati varieties were sown earlier and hence the early harvest./At present, it seems there is a spurt in the number of paddy stubble burning cases in the Majha region comprising districts such as Amritsar and Tarn Taran, which have so far reported highest incidents of burning. But the peak harvest season between October 15 and November 1 is yet to be seen to assess the trend and draw any comparison with past years, said a senior PPCB official on the condition of anonymity./Haryana/The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) noted that this year, there has been a spike in number of cases of crop stubble burning./Satellite monitoring showed that between September 25 and October 17, 1,571 such cases were spotted./Last year, 1,346 crop residue burning instances were reported in the same period./S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana SPCB said that Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal and Jind districts are on top of the list in crop stubble burning cases./We have been monitoring the farmlands very closely. It is also important to note that even though the numbers are higher, the burnt area has reduced. Even last year, there was a 25% reduction in burnt area, he said./Officials from the Haryana government said that the situation was likely to deteriorate in the coming days. Only 82 FIRs had been registered against erring farmers till October 17. This has been attributed to some extent to the recently concluded election season in the state./There is definitely the case that the government officials as well as the police were busy with election duties, but there is also political pressure. Farmers account for a large vote share here. Stubble burning cases are likely to get worse towards the end of October, said a senior Haryana government official, requesting anonymity./Sohanlal, a farmer from Assandh Village in Haryana, said that compared to last year, inspections on the ground were less visible./Last year, the inspections were very strict. Many farmers from this area were fined between Rs.3,000 to Rs.15,000 for burning stubble in their fields. This time, there seems to be some leniency. That could also be because the harvest season has just begun. The people who have to find a way to get things done, they do, he said./How it affects Delhi/Smoke from the burning of biomass in Punjab and Haryana has been known to contribute to a spike in pollution levels in Delhi during this time of the year, as winds blow from the northwest. That and the near absence of any surface winds results in trapping the fine particulate matter within the highly urbanised capital city./According to an analysis by a team of scientists at IIT-Delhi's Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA), at least 10 districts of Punjab and five of Haryana contribute 62% of the total stubble burning emissions, which reach Delhi depending on the meteorological conditions./The districts in Punjab contribute around 44% of total residue burning emissions while those in Haryana account for approximately 17%, said the analysis presented by Sagnik Dey, associate professor, of IIT-Delhi's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences during a recent conference./The analysis is based on satellite data, latest emission inventory and available scientific knowledge./Also, we have identified top 500 villages each in Punjab and Haryana based on the data in 2017 and 2018 to facilitate action on ground, said Dey./It is recommended to prioritise technological and other resources in these districts and particularly the villages to curtail stubble burning emissions in this upcoming season in 2019 rather than uniformly distributing resources in all the districts./Prioritising action in these regions would lead to maximum benefit in terms of reduction in the contribution of stubble burning to air pollution level in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, the analysis said./Pollution in winter in Delhi comes in two episodes -the first peak between October and November and the second episode is between December and January. Even without crop burning, the pollution levels during the two episodes is alarmingly high because of local emissions./The analysis shows that the difference in PM2.5 during the first pollution episode in Delhi increases with a rise in peak fire count in the upwind regions of Haryana and Punjab./This implies that larger is the fire count (i.e. higher open burning), larger is the first pollution episode in Delhi because the only major difference in the factors between the first and second episodes is the contribution of open burning of the crop stubble in Punjab and Haryana, said Dey, adding ""Over the past week NASA images have shown, Amritsar has been the top district in terms of crop burning.""/How it affects farmers/Farmers said they are not able to sell paddy on the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs.1,835 per quintal (100 kg) fixed by the government./We are suffering losses on the produce itself. There are so many brokers and middlemen, who either reject the produce on some ground or the other and we are forced to sell it for around Rs.1,300-Rs.1,400, much below the MSP. If we don't sell, it will go waste. We lose out on at least Rs.400 per quintal; in which case it's just not possible to spend another few thousands on hiring farm equipment, said Harpal Singh, who owns four acres in the same village./Others said that even when they go to the custom hiring centres (CHC) that provides the equipment on subsidised rent, most times they are turned away citing there were no drivers to run the tractor to which the machines are attached./Experts said that while enforcement is an important part of controlling incidents of crop burning, effective solutions will only come if steps are taken to ensure disbursement of subsidies for the purchase of the Happy Seeders and the SMS./Other alternatives/Senior officials of the agriculture department in the Haryana government explained that an alternative to control increasing cases of crop residue is to adopt paddy varieties that will allow for earlier harvest. This in turn will allow farmers more time to prepare for the sowing of wheat crop./Short duration paddy takes around 120 to 130 days to mature and the yield is also higher than the long duration varieties that take 155 to 160 days. The short duration paddy can be harvested in first week of October, giving farmers 25 to 30 days to manage the paddy stubble./R S Randhawa, general secretary, Border Area Sangharsh Committee, Punjab, said the problem will persist unless farmers are given monetary benefits by bringing in industries to buy the stubble from them such as paper mills for making pulp, for generating electricity and other such alternatives./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Very poor': Capital flouts cracker rules,"New Delhi, Oct. 29 -- Thousands of people in the national capital violated time restrictions and burst banned firecrackers, defying appeals from health experts, political leaders, and the Supreme Court, who urged, coaxed and ordered them to celebrate an eco-friendly Diwali in the wake of Delhi's annual air pollution crisis./By midnight on Sunday, the noxious fumes pushed the level of PM2.5 ultra-fine particles, which take the heaviest toll on human health among all air pollutants, to almost 18 times of what is considered safe to breathe./The pollution, while an improvement from last year's Diwali - when the peak PM2.5 concentration was 26 times the safe level - could be correlated with firecracker use, according to experts and data analysed by HT, suggesting the problem may have been avoided by observing the festival of lights responsibly./""Firecrackers were the sole reason for pushing Delhi's air quality to 'severe' levels this year. Government agencies had all pre-emptive measures so that we could avoid this day. Every other source was controlled; it was all in the hands of people,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment./""Only two varieties of green crackers - anar and phuljhari - were available this time. But they don't produce sound. So whatever cracker-related noise Delhi heard last night was illegal,"" said a senior official of the Delhi environment department, asking not to be named./The violation was also of the two-hour window - 8pm to 10pm - set by the Supreme Court for when people could set off fireworks./The police, however, received just 940 complaints, registered a mere 315 cases, and arrested only 166 people from across the city on Sunday night, when people across the city reported hearing firecrackers well into the early hours of the next day./""We were acting only in cases where we were receiving complaints, rather than acting on a suo motu basis. In several cases, by the time we reached the spot, we could not identify the violators,"" a senior police officer said, asking not to be named./According to an analysis of data from government-deployed air quality monitoring stations across the city, the average hourly PM2.5 concentration was the lowest at 4pm on Sunday but started rising steadily after sunset, with a significant spike coming around 9pm when it jumped from 195 ug/m3 to 335 ug/m3./The hourly average peaked at midnight, when the concentration topped out at 581.8 ug/m3. During this time, according to figures released by the government, the peak concentration was recorded at 1,070 ug/m3./Slightly larger PM10 particles rose in tandem, going from 185ug/m3 around 5pm to around 1,391 ug/m3 by midnight - roughly 14 times the safe level./On Monday, the AQI in Delhi was 368, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin. It had risen to 399 by 11pm. The figure was 372 for Gurugram and 397 in Noida./Data analysed by HT also showed that pollution was much higher in Delhi's residential neighbourhoods in comparison to industrial areas. A few colonies such as Aya Nagar, Ashok Vihar and Dilshad Garden registered levels that were at least 14-15 times higher than the safe limit./The Delhi government, which made significant attempts to encourage people to refrain from banned crackers, said that the situation was better than previous years./""Delhi has come through again. While I agree pollution is still high and needs to be further brought down, the efforts by Delhiites in last few years has led to significant reduction,"" said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, whose administration organised a laser-light show in Connaught Place to mark Diwali celebrations without fireworks./""If the people are resolute, we can make the impossible possible,"" he said, referring to the fight against pollution./Other indicators too suggested firecracker use was lower this year. Four major government hospitals designated for treating severe burn injuries had nearly 50% fewer burn-related hospital admissions on Sunday./Experts said weather conditions may have helped disperse pollution this year quicker than it had last year. ""The dispersion of pollutants was as fast as the build-up. This is because of the stronger winds this time compared to 2018 Diwali when it took much longer for pollutants to disperse,"" said Roychowdhury./But as the levels began to taper off on Monday, weather officials warned the situation may deteriorate. ""Wind speeds are expected to be low and there is a forecast of shallow fog tomorrow (Tuesday) morning. There is a possibility of the daily AQI hitting the 'severe' category,"" said a senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, asking not to be named./Even in 2018, while the AQI had hit 390 on the day after Diwali, it had risen to 423 the following day./The coming fortnight has been identified as the period when the pollution problem becomes acute, according to an analysis by scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur./It is in this period, the scientists said, that smoke from farm fires in nearby states drifts into the National Capital Region (NCR), while the air becomes still and heavy as the weather turns colder - creating a toxic mix in an already polluted environment./Exposure to high levels of PM2.5 has been linked to conditions such as asthma in the short-term and diabetes, cancer and cardiac issues over a longer duration. A World Health Organization report in 2018 estimated that Indians would have lived 4.3 years longer if the 2016 air quality met global standards./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The choke is on Delhi: Pollution turns severe,"India, Oct. 30 -- A thick, smoky haze smothered the national capital on Tuesday as air pollution breached ""severe"" levels for the first time this season, a sharp deterioration caused by a double whammy of toxic fumes left over from illegal Diwali fireworks and a big spike in farm fires in neighbouring states./Two days after thousands in the national capital defied restrictions to use banned firecrackers, Delhi's overall air quality index (AQI) was 400 in the daily 4pm bulletin by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), up from Monday's 368. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe""./By 11pm, the AQI climbed to 421 as lower temperatures led heavy pollutants to sink closer to the ground./Pollution levels in Ghaziabad (446), Noida (439) and Greater Noida (428) were much worse. Gurugram and Faridabad were in the ""very poor"" category at 368 and 387 respectively, as per the four 4pm bulletin./On Diwali night, several people across the National Capital Region (NCR) flouted the Supreme Court-enforced two-hour limit for bursting crackers. The apex court had also ordered that only green firecrackers, which cause 30% less pollution, be sold. But a large number of illegal crackers could be heard going off across the region, almost non-stop from about 8pm till late into the night./Experts said that the post-Diwali air on Monday was the cleanest in four years but the pollution remained in the ""very poor"" category, with the PM2.5 level rising to 18 times the safe limit./According to scientists at pollution forecasting agencies, the air is likely to worsen over the coming days since a north-westerly wind is bringing with it smoke from Punjab and Haryana, where crop stubble burning is at its peak this week./Satellites picked up at least 2,200 instances of fires in Punjab and Haryana on Monday, most of them cases of stubble burning. On Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the figure stood at 1,602 just for Punjab, the most recorded on a single day this season. Experts have previously predicted that more crop residues are burnt around the time of Diwali since farmers can show them as incidental fires. They use the method to quickly and cheaply ready their fields for the next round of sowing./IMD scientists said ""smoke"" reduced visibility in the national capital and in its neighbouring cities on Tuesday. The wind speed was low at about 7-8 kmph, not enough to disperse the pollution left behind by Diwali celebrations. ""The pollution from Diwali is still accumulated near the ground. Wind direction is westerly and north-westerly. The high pollution level in Delhi is because of the smoke from stubble burning,"" said Kuldeep Shrivastava, director, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre./VK Soni, a senior scientist at IMD, said: ""What you are seeing outside is smoke; because there is no moisture in the air, there is no chance of mist. The wind direction is also westerly so it seems like smoke from stubble burning is impacting air quality.""/Soni added that wind speeds are likely to pick up slightly once clouds caused by cyclonic system Kyarr clear up over the next couple of days. But that will result in only a marginal improvement. ""In all the Indo-Gangetic plain cities, low wind speed has caused an accumulation of pollution.""/Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed ""with folded hands"" to Punjab and Haryana to take steps against stubble burning to prevent the national capital from becoming a ""gas chamber"". ""At our level, we are making all possible efforts and will continue to do so,"" he tweeted./The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government later said in a statement that latest Nasa images showed a drastic spurt in crop residue burning in the neighbouring states. ""The effective stubble fire counts of Haryana and Punjab have increased from 1,654 to 2,577 during the past 24 hours, which is a matter of extreme concern for the residents of Delhi,"" it said./Farm fires and emissions from firecrackers result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 ultrafine particles in the air, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs./While Delhi-NCR has a Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) that is enforced by the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (Epca), the Centre's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is also in place for a year./With Delhi's air quality plunging to the ""severe"" category on Tuesday evening, the task force headed by CPCB will on Wednesday review whether additional pre-emptive measures listed under Grap will be needed to stop the situation from deteriorating further./According to Grap, if the air quality continues to be in the ""severe"" category for 48 hours, measures such as traffic rationing and a ban on the entry of trucks is brought into force. Industries running on coal are also asked to cease operations./In previous years, schools in NCR have been forced to be closed due to dramatic rise in air pollution, with people, especially the elderly and young children, being asked not to go out./Officials at IMD said a significant increase in the wind speed is unlikely over the next two days and similar conditions are expected to prevail. The AQI takes into account five chief pollutants - particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres (PM10), PM2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO)./The spiking pollution levels in Delhi have resulted in many joggers and cyclists complaining of difficulty in breathing, itchy throat, and watery eyes. Doctors said there was an increase in the number of patients coming in with asthma and other respiratory allergies./At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the doctors saw an increase of about 15% in patients coming in with such complaints. ""We see this spike every year. People come in with their symptoms worsening as the pollution levels increase. However, what is more concerning is healthy people coming in with upper respiratory tract allergies and allergic coughing that refuses to heal. We have to treat it just like asthma,"" said Dr Karan Madan, assistant professor of pulmonary medicine at the premier institute./The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution is a major cause of death and disease globally. Particulate matter is capable of penetrating deep into lung passageways and entering the bloodstream causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory impacts, it says./""When we are addressing a broader geography like the Indo-Gangetic plains, we need a regional focus. NCAP has to figure how to take a regional approach to air quality. Currently, the focus is on hundreds of small municipalities across the country without addressing the challenges of the larger air-shed. That's where we now need to focus and at the same time scale up localised action,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director at Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

But a large number of illegal crackers could be heard going off across the region, almost non-stop from about 8pm till late into the night./Experts said that the post-Diwali air on Monday was the cleanest in four years but the pollution remained in the ""very poor"" category, with the PM2.5 level rising to 18 times the safe limit./According to scientists at pollution forecasting agencies, the air is likely to worsen over the coming days since a north-westerly wind is bringing with it smoke from Punjab and Haryana, where crop stubble burning is at its peak this week./Satellites picked up at least 2,200 instances of fires in Punjab and Haryana on Monday, most of them cases of stubble burning. On Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the figure stood at 1,602 just for Punjab, the most recorded on a single day this season. Experts have previously predicted that more crop residues are burnt around the time of Diwali since farmers can show them as incidental fires. They use the method to quickly and cheaply ready their fields for the next round of sowing./IMD scientists said ""smoke"" reduced visibility in the national capital and in its neighbouring cities on Tuesday. The wind speed was low at about 7-8 kmph, not enough to disperse the pollution left behind by Diwali celebrations. ""The pollution from Diwali is still accumulated near the ground. Wind direction is westerly and north-westerly. The high pollution level in Delhi is because of the smoke from stubble burning,"" said Kuldeep Shrivastava, director, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre./VK Soni, a senior scientist at IMD, said: ""What you are seeing outside is smoke; because there is no moisture in the air, there is no chance of mist. The wind direction is also westerly so it seems like smoke from stubble burning is impacting air quality.""/Soni added that wind speeds are likely to pick up slightly once clouds caused by cyclonic system Kyarr clear up over the next couple of days. But that will result in only a marginal improvement. ""In all the Indo-Gangetic plain cities, low wind speed has caused an accumulation of pollution.""/Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed ""with folded hands"" to Punjab and Haryana to take steps against stubble burning to prevent the national capital from becoming a ""gas chamber"". ""At our level, we are making all possible efforts and will continue to do so,"" he tweeted./The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government later said in a statement that latest Nasa images showed a drastic spurt in crop residue burning in the neighbouring states. ""The effective stubble fire counts of Haryana and Punjab have increased from 1,654 to 2,577 during the past 24 hours, which is a matter of extreme concern for the residents of Delhi,"" it said./Farm fires and emissions from firecrackers result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 ultrafine particles in the air, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs./While Delhi-NCR has a Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) that is enforced by the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (Epca), the Centre's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is also in place for a year./With Delhi's air quality plunging to the ""severe"" category on Tuesday evening, the task force headed by CPCB will on Wednesday review whether additional pre-emptive measures listed under Grap will be needed to stop the situation from deteriorating further./According to Grap, if the air quality continues to be in the ""severe"" category for 48 hours, measures such as traffic rationing and a ban on the entry of trucks is brought into force. Industries running on coal are also asked to cease operations./In previous years, schools in NCR have been forced to be closed due to dramatic rise in air pollution, with people, especially the elderly and young children, being asked not to go out./Officials at IMD said a significant increase in the wind speed is unlikely over the next two days and similar conditions are expected to prevail. The AQI takes into account five chief pollutants - particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres (PM10), PM2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO)./The spiking pollution levels in Delhi have resulted in many joggers and cyclists complaining of difficulty in breathing, itchy throat, and watery eyes. Doctors said there was an increase in the number of patients coming in with asthma and other respiratory allergies./At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the doctors saw an increase of about 15% in patients coming in with such complaints. ""We see this spike every year. People come in with their symptoms worsening as the pollution levels increase. However, what is more concerning is healthy people coming in with upper respiratory tract allergies and allergic coughing that refuses to heal. We have to treat it just like asthma,"" said Dr Karan Madan, assistant professor of pulmonary medicine at the premier institute./The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution is a major cause of death and disease globally. Particulate matter is capable of penetrating deep into lung passageways and entering the bloodstream causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory impacts, it says./""When we are addressing a broader geography like the Indo-Gangetic plains, we need a regional focus. NCAP has to figure how to take a regional approach to air quality. Currently, the focus is on hundreds of small municipalities across the country without addressing the challenges of the larger air-shed. That's where we now need to focus and at the same time scale up localised action,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director at Centre for Science and Environment./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Face to face: 'Masks, air purifiers offer more reassurance than real protection against air pollution, not real solution'","New Delhi, Oct. 31 -- As Delhi battles severe pollution levels, Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, speaks to Sanchita Sharma about the health effects of bad air, how we can keep ourselves safe and if masks and air purifiers work./How does air pollution affect health?/Air pollution mainly affects the lungs but more and more data shows it affects the entire body. We have poor quality air for most days of the year in Delhi or the Indo-Gangetic belt. So what happens to people who are breathing poor quality air for more than 10 years? Apart from lung cancer, it causes inflammation in the blood vessels running through the lungs and the rest of the body. It leads to atherosclerosis or the hardening of the arteries, which predisposes people to heart attacks and stroke. Cardiac associations now say living in areas with higher levels of air pollution is as much a risk of heart attack as is smoking. All of us who have been living in Delhi for long are adding to our risk of heart attack and heart disease./The short-term effects of air pollution are predominantly seen in people at high risk. Inhaling toxic substances - it could be oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter - causes worsening of underlying bronchitis, asthma and heart disease, leading on to heart failure or respiratory failure, which leads to emergency visits, more medication need, and overall higher morbidity and mortality./Do more patients get admitted to hospitals?/Yes. In a recent study, we looked at hospital emergency room visits both in the paediatric and adult age group throughout the year and found a direct correlation in a spike in patients with cardiac and respiratory problems in the 72 hours following air quality deterioration./Does air pollution raise the risk of infections such as tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia?/Yes. There is some data that suggests chances of infection also go up./Should parents keep children indoors ?/Very often, we get letters from school principals, asking whether they should stop outdoor activities during winter. You have to balance things out as outdoor activities are good for children but unhealthy air is not. When you have high levels of air pollution, outdoor physical activity should be restricted. You should wait for the sun come out and to at least for the pollutants rise up. But is a big challenge- should you move to indoor activity? Should you use air purifiers? Those are the type of things schools ask./The solution lies in a permanent sustainable way out so that air quality improves throughout the year and continues to do so over the years. We should consider what should we do to encourage people to use public transport, become more eco-friendly, walk if they can rather than taking a vehicle, children use car pooling or school bus to go to school rather than everyone using individual cars. One study showed AQI is very bad around most school entrances when school starts and when it gets over because many vehicles are parked out there with their engines running. Children who come out or go to school at that time are actually breathing in very toxic air./Do masks and respirators work?/Masks are something we don't routinely recommend. If high-risk patients want to use one, we ask them to use a three-layered surgical mask or an N-95 mask worn tightly around the nose and mouth. If it's loosely worn, you create a negative pressure when you inhale and air gets sucked in from the side instead of the filter. Then the mask is of no use. You have to have a mask that is tightly fitted, which causes discomfort. Among other things are nasal filters, but these are useful for people who are at high risk or going to areas where pollution level is very high. There is not enough data to say it helps in the long run . It gives a little bit of reassurance but it does it really decrease exposure and does it protect you? I think for that we need a larger policy and a bigger plan rather than just wearing a mask./Do you recommend air purifiers? Do they work?/Most of the data for air purifiers looked at a room that is properly sealed and the person is in that room for most of the day. Most of our rooms are not properly sealed, with air and dust entering from the windows and doors. Air purifiers are not that effective, and you're going in and out (of the room with the air purifier). Again, like masks, it may give you a little bit of reassurance but overall, I don't think it is not a solution./Dr Randeep Guleria is a professor and the head of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and one of the world's foremost experts on lung health )/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

So it will cause problems in later life, it may not cause that much of a problem in the younger age group./Should people exercise when the air quality is severe or very severe?/Not aggressive exercise, not outdoor exercise. Not early in the morning, but maybe around lunch time when the sun is out. You should continue to exercise -- the benefits of exercise are much more -- but in an environment that is not as bad as what you are saying./(Dr Randeep Guleria is a professor and the head of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and one of the world's foremost experts on lung health )/Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

CM calls stubble burning a disease ailing Delhi's air; govt to distribute N-95 masks,"New Delhi, Oct. 31 -- Tagging stubble burning as a 'disease', which is taking a toll on Delhi's air quality, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged people to build pressure on the BJP and Congress governments of neighbouring states to bring down incidents of crop residue burning./Hitting back, chief minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh dismissed Kejriwal's claim as a political stunt./To take the CM's call forward, the Aam Aadmi Party would organise a demonstration outside Haryana Bhawan and Punjab Bhawan in New Delhi over the alleged inaction by the two states in controlling stubble burning./The protest, which will be led by AAP's Delhi convener Gopal Rai, is likely to be attended by Kejriwal too, senior party functionaries said./""The air quality was in moderate category till October 15 this year. The sudden deterioration in pollution levels after October 15 was due to stubble burning. If we don't contain the causes of a disease, it is pointless to treat for mere symptoms. All of us must build pressure of the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh,"" Kejriwal said./Government agencies said that on Wednesday, smoke from the stubble-burning regions of Punjab and Haryana contributed around 35% to the city's PM2.5 levels./""Delhi is choking because of the stubble burning in the neighbouring states. I want to request the BJP and Congress to pressure the governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to provide facilities and equipment to farmers to stop them from burning stubble. Bringing down incidents of stubble burning will improve Delhi's air drastically,"" he added./""Kejriwal's claim that stubble burning in neighbouring states was responsible for the horrendous situation in Delhi was absolutely ludicrous, especially considering that the number of farm fires in Punjab had actually been the same as last year,"" said Captain Amarinder Singh, chief minister of Punjab, adding that the statements issued by the Delhi chief minister was more of a political stunt./Member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board, S Narayanan, said it was possible that stubble burning contributed to Delhi's high air pollution levels but there was no concrete scientific evidence. ""We had asked IIT, Delhi, last year, to conduct a study the exact impact in the context. We are told IIT will submit its report shortly,"" he said./For the first time this year, the Delhi government launched a four-day laser show to dissuade people from bursting crackers. Saying it proved to be a success, Kejriwal said his government would organise the show on a bigger scale next year./The government will also distribute around 50 lakh N-95 anti-pollution masks from Friday in both government and private schools. The decision on staggered office timings would be announced within a day or two, the chief minister said./""Delhi is doing its bit starting from laser show, distributing pollution masks, odd-even among others. But we need to stop pollution coming from outside the city too,"" he said./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

People in North India may lose 7 years of life due to air pollution: Study,"India, Oct. 31 -- People living in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region are expected to lose 7 years of their life because of severe air pollution, a new analysis released on Thursday has said./The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), shows there has been a 72% increase in pollution from 1998 to 2016 in the region which accounts for 40% of India's population. In 1998, the impact on people's lives from dirty air would have been 3.7 years of life expectancy./The analysis also states that citizens in the IGP region which includes Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal are exposed to far higher levels of air pollution and hence have shorter lives./In 1998, citizens living outside of the IGP region lost 1.2 years of life relative to what it would have been if air quality met the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. In 2016, citizens in non-IGP states lost about 2.6 years of life compared to 7 years in IGP region./During the release of the analysis, Dr Arvind Kumar, chest surgeon from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, raised an alarm about the health cost of air pollution. ""It's a public health emergency in Delhi. Half a decade of concentrated focus on air pollution with zero results. I am seeing 28-year-old non-smokers with stage 4 lung cancer. It's a very painful experience for me. I am very angry because I am losing young patients to air pollution.""/He showed images of lungs of a 14-year-old with black pollution induced spots. Kumar said that in 1988 when he joined AIIMS, 90% of lung cancer cases were in smokers but now 50% of such cases are being seen in non-smokers. ""Air pollution is a group 1 carcinogen. The contents of polluted air is similar to cigarette smoke,"" Kumar added./EPIC had released a similar study for Delhi earlier this year which stated residents in Delhi could extend their life by 3.35 years if the National Clean Air Programme is implemented. NCAP has a target of 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) and PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) concentration in 102 non-attainment cities (cities that did not meet the annual PM 10 national standard from 2011 to 2015) by 2024 under the NCAP over 2017 levels./How is AQLI calculated?/The AQLI estimates the relationship between air pollution and life expectancy based on findings from a research study in China./In China, areas in the north have traditionally experienced higher levels of pollution because of a government policy initiated during (1950 to 1980) that gave those living north of the Huai River, where it is colder, free coal to power boilers for heating./While the policy's purpose was to provide warmth in the winter, it resulted in a high and differential reliance on coal north of the Huai River. Combined, these two policies created a unique demarcation line where the researchers were able to study the impact of high levels of pollution over a long period of time and to isolate that impact from other factors that affect life expectancy./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The day before, it was 400. Air quality is considered 'good' when AQI is lower than 50./Ghaziabad, at 478, recorded the worst AQI of the 102 cities mapped by CPCB. The AQI in Noida was 450, Greater Noida 438, Faridabad 404, and Gurugram 365./On Wednesday, as calls grew for authorities to take more measures, the Delhi and Noida administrations issued advisories asking schools to suspend all outdoor activities till the air clears up and CPCB recommended that curbs announced earlier this month - such as banning overnight construction work - will be extended till Saturday./The curbs are part of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) that lays down sets of restrictions when AQI crosses certain thresholds - the most serious of these include a ban on trucks, odd-even road restrictions, an embargo on construction work, and an advisory to governments to shut schools./But these don't come into force unless the threshold has been breached for 48 consecutive hours - a rule that is now under scrutiny. ""A proposal has already been submitted to Epca to re-evaluate Grap. We need to have a re-look at what preventive measures should be enforced at what time, and how much Grap measures are helping - a quantitative analysis. The proposal was sent by IIT Madras and NEERI. So far nothing has been done,"" said Mukesh Khare, a member of Epca, which enforces Grap, and a professor of civil engineering at IIT Delhi./Delhi's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he will meet the head of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) to discuss what additional measures can be taken. ""We will implement every measure that is mentioned in the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). I am going to meet the chairman on Friday and discuss what other measures we can take,"" he said on Wednesday./Top medical experts said steps must be taken to restrict exposure to pollution, particularly of vulnerable people such as the elderly and children./""Air pollution mainly affects the lungs, but more and more data shows it affects the entire body. For people who are breathing poor quality air for more than 10 years, apart from lung cancer, it causes inflammation in blood vessels running through the lungs and the rest of the body. It leads to atherosclerosis or the hardening of the arteries, which predisposes people to heart attacks and stroke,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS./He added that out outdoor physical activity should be restricted for children. ""You should wait for the sun to come out and to at least for the pollutants to rise up,"" he said./For the entirety of Wednesday and most of Tuesday, the sun was hardly visible./Sunlight helps break a crucial meteorological phenomenon that exacerbates pollution. Typically, as the weather changes from monsoon to winter, winds start blowing in from the northwest - the region where farmers are usually setting crop residue spread over acres of acres land on fire during this time of the year./As the smoke channels in towards NCR and much of the Indo-Gangetic plains, the cooling of the air drags it down - blanketing towns and cities in a choking haze that is also made up of local emissions. It is in such circumstances that strong sunlight, if it can penetrate the haze, helps warms the air and disperse the pollutants./According to an analysis of data from Nasa's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), there were 18,162 fires spotted in Punjab and Haryana between October 20 and 30 - significantly higher than the 14,897 seen in the same period last year./The Punjab Remote Sensing Centre said 3,135 crop burning incidents were recorded on Wednesday - the highest for a single day ever recorded. The previous was 2,975 incidents in 2017./""The main reason for so many fires this year is because farmers haven't gotten equipment to manage crop residue. Some farmer societies were formed and they received government funds and bought the equipment, but the number is very small,"" said Rattan Mann, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). He added that the problem is worse this year because of a delayed harvest - which has forced farmers to prefer burning the residue that takes less time./A senior environment ministry official too said the effort to wean farmers off the harmful practice had not paid off. ""The subsidy scheme seems to have failed. We had transferred the money and the state governments assured that equipment will be distributed,"" this official said, asking not to be named./In one Punjab district, Sangrur, the district magistrate said 144 fines totalling Rs.3.6 lakh were collected from farmers caught burning crop residue. The fine of Rs.2,500 per is often lower than what a farmer would spend on renting a harvesting machine with the stubble management device on a mid-to-large sized farm./Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
