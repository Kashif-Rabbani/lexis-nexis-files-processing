"Despite green court order, waste goes up in smoke","Faridabad, May 16 -- Despite the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) order of April 28, banning burning of dry leaves and other waste in the open, the burning of such waste is a common sight in different parts of this industrial township with no serious effort from the implementing agencies./Though, the NGT order clearly specifies the 'authorities' responsible to deal with any violation of its order in their jurisdiction, some officials have said they are 'yet to receive the order'./""Garbage burning has been taking place in our campus. Even after the NGT order, this has been continuing,"" said Goldie Srivastava, a resident of the YMCA university residential campus, Faridabad./""We were expecting the NGT orders will be followed to effectively check air pollution, but burning of leaves and other waste material continues to date,"" Srivastava added./""The tribunal order is aimed at the well being of people who breathe the polluted air. This is the reason we, as common citizens, want the appropriate authorities to take this order seriously and not allow burning of waste in the open,"" said another resident./""I have not received the green court's order yet,"" said Mahinder Singh, the SHO at Sector 7 under which the YMCA falls./NGT, in its order, said deputy commissioners, the director of horticulture, area SHOs, assistant commissioners and sanitary officers would be held responsible if there was any violation of its order./Burning waste at Neighbourhood Four (NH4), a central government residential area, is a common sight. The concerned SHO seemed to be ignorant of the NGT order on being asked what action he takes when such reports reach him./Safai karamcharis say burning is the easiest way to get rid of garbage they collect from the residential campus. ""What's strange is there seems no change in their attitude. We believe their bosses have not made them aware of the new order,"" said a resident of the NH4 residential area./""I have not received any complaint about burning of leaves or garbage. If we see it or any one comes with a complaint, we will take action,"" said SHO SGM Nagar under which the NH4 residential area falls./Meanwhile, municipal authorities are of the firm belief their awareness campaign about the NGT order would yield results in the days to come. ""I have asked health officers to launch awareness campaigns about the NGT order and if anyone does not follow the NGT order, action will be slapped against defaulters,"" said Ashok Shar ma, commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF)./As part of its efforts to check air pollution in Delhi and NCR, the tribunal on April 28 banned the burning of waste in open. The tribunal also announced a fine of ' 5,000 on any one who is caught burning dry leaves, plastic, rubber or other waste material in NCR. The bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Swatanter Kumar made it clear that all authorities are duty bound to oblige with the tribunal's orders./The bench said it had data to support the view that waste burning is responsible for a major portion of emissions in the city. Nearly 29.4% of PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) are from waste burning, the bench had said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Indore's Devguradiya trenching ground plays dirty games with locals,"India, May 19 -- For Suman Goswami and thousands who live in Devguradiya - a hamlet on the outskirts of Indore best known for its age-old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva - every change of season is marked by the emergence of new allergies or illnesses./The ailments are not due to any industrial emissions, but because of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste generated by residents of Indore that have been lying unprocessed at a dumping ground for the past four decades./Spread over 40 acres, the Indore Municipal Corporation's trenching ground in Devguradiya has suppressed the fame of the 900-year-old Shiva temple, its stench and thick smoke spreading over more than two kilometres in all directions./Goswami, an inhabitant of Devguradiya, says people are at the mercy of winds bearing highly toxic particulate matter from the garbage dump on the edge of their hamlet./""Winters bring with them respiratory problems and severe chest congestion caused by alarming levels of toxicity in the air. The rainy season comes with an upsurge in the number of houseflies and insects, accompanied with a powerful stench. And in summers, it's life shut indoors, bereft of air coolers or fans,"" she told Hindustan Times./""Every day of the year is difficult for us. The smoke and stench which comes from the trenching ground makes life completely miserable for us.""/Kishore Kodwani, an Indore-based social activist, said about 900 metric tonnes (MT) of garbage is dumped at the Devguradiya trenching ground every day. ""Only about 250 MT of waste is processed every day, leaving the rest 650 MT to pile up in the area every day,"" he said./According to the Indore Municipal Corporation and the state pollution control board, about 4 lakh MT of garbage has accumulated at the site over four decades. The wastes have taken the shape of a small hillock that is always emitting smoke./It is not just original residents of Devguradiya like Goswami who face problems because of the pollution. City dwellers who bought villas and flats within a three-kilometre radius of the garbage dump are equally troubled./""Respiratory problems, allergies and skin diseases are extremely common here,"" said a resident of Kalindi Township./""Almost every second person in our township has lung problems, asthama or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Those who survive respiratory problems face other problems like skin allergies, premature graying of hair or other diseases,"" said Chitra Mathur, a housewife and a resident of the same colony./Dr AN Jaiswal, an orthopaedic surgeon living in the area, said almost everyone who attended a recent health camp had some health problems./""These were people who are very young, in the age bracket of 25 to 40. Moreover, when we took the reports of the water and air to health experts, all of them, from a gynaecologist to an oncologist, said we are in deep water,"" he said./The regional office of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) in Indore has already warned people from using groundwater in Devguradiya as it has reached a ""critical"" state and is unfit for drinking without adequate treatment./A recent analysis of water collected from a tube well near the Devguradiya trenching ground revealed that various factors determining the quality of groundwater had worsened in the past two years./Dr DK Wagela, head of the MPPCB's local laboratory, said, ""The Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) present in groundwater near the trenching site is a major cause of worry. The TDS level has touched the maximum permissible mark.""/He added, ""Tonnes of garbage lying dumped in the trenching ground is the major contributor in polluting groundwater and rising air pollution levels in the area.""/But the two lakh residents of this area are almost completely dependent on groundwater as they get no piped water from the municipal body. Only a lucky few purify the water with special equipment installed in posh colonies but others have no choice but to drink the polluted water./'Breathing toxic air can give one bronchial infection'/The levels of toxicity are alarmingly high in the area, feel pulmonologists./""If a person continuously inhales air with a toxic level of 300 to 400 rcpm, he has high chances of getting bronchial infection, COPD and severe congestion,"" Dr Sanjay Londhe, chest physician says./The situation gets worse among children, who continuously face the problem of throat infection./At a place like Devguradiya, the situation is more harmful as the level of toxicity increases depending on the trash and garbage burned here./It is very difficult to identify what harmful substances are causing this kind of increase in the toxic levels in the air./But in the long term, it could damage the lungs immensely./As the particles get settled in lungs, they stop blood flow to the organ and make it more susceptible to other diseases./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

India to join WHO effort to curb air pollution,"New Delhi, May 28 -- With several cities reeling under increasing air pollution, India has agreed to be part of a global effort to put a check on increasing toxicity in the air at the general assembly of the World Health Organisation (WHO)./This comes at a time when Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows an increase in air pollution - especially increased levels of ozone - in most cities, including Delhi./The Air Quality Index in 11 cities in India shows a high level of particulate matter pollution in most cities despite the fact that high temperatures, evident almost all over India now, is said to improve the dispersal of particulate matter, unlike in the winter./This summer, air pollution levels are higher than in previous years. Places like Dwarka and Anand Vihar in Delhi are worst off with particulate matter pollution measuring thrice the national standard on Wednesday. The figure was twice the standard figure for Faridabad, Kanpur and Chennai on the same day./As per the WHO, air pollution was responsible for over seven million premature deaths in 2012, one million more than tobacco. Of these, around 88% occur in low to middle income countries, a WHO report released in April said./As air pollution is a global problem, the WHO assembly of over 150 countries including India resolved to fight it through collaboration. The countries agreed to initiate joint scientific collaboration and monitoring to improve awareness and implement effective ways to reduce air pollution./""The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,"" says Dr Maria Neira, Director of WHO's De par tment for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health.

Noida chokes on dust pollution as developers dump waste in open,"Noida, June 2 -- Residents and commuters complained of pathetic air quality here as a result of developers not following construction norms in the bulk of construction activities happening in the city, leading to several pulmonary diseases./Commuters said that all roads were full of dust and construction debris. ""We can't open windshields of car for fresh air because all roads are full of dust. The quality of air is deteriorating with each passing day. Dumpers laden with sand never follow norms and sand flies of the dumper during motion./It causes eye and skin irritation to two-wheeler commuters,"" said Pankaj Tandon, a motorist./According to the Noida authority, they kept tab on construction sites and monitored the activities so that guidelines of NGT should be followed.

Pollution continues to haunt Delhi's children even when indoors,"New Delhi, June 5 -- The risk of air pollution does not end for kids in the Capital even after they move indoors, medical experts on respiratory ailments in New Delhi say. In most homes air is, in fact, almost as polluted as it is outside, often triggering trouble for children with respiratory troubles and allergies./""Rising air pollution poses serious health risks for everyone, but, it is most worrying for children because their bodies are still developing and are not physiologically mature to deal with the toxins in the air,"" says Dr Raj Kumar, head of respiratory allergy and applied immunology department at the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute in Delhi./A survey conducted across Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Bengaluru last month, suggests that children in Delhi are most vulnerable to respiratory troubles, with more than 40% school-going children suffering from weak lungs./With more people moving to poorly ventilated high-rise apartments, kids, in the Capital, are particularly at risk with toxins emitted from cooking fumes, smoking, suspended particulate matter, mould, dust-mites and scruff from pets./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Even Kejriwal not safe from ozone pollution: CSE,"New Delhi, June 5 -- Even Delhi's high and mighty, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, are not safe from the deadly ozone pollution, says the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./Analysis of real-time air quality data from key monitoring locations of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) during April-May shows that the neighbourhoods of the rich and the powerful are highly vulnerable./The ozone level in Civil Lines - where chief minister Kejriwal lives - is more than twice the standards, has fared the worst in terms of number of days exceeding the standard, and falls in the ""poor"" category of the National Air Quality Index (NAQI)./""Heat waves and sunshine have increased the frequency of days with unhealthy levels of o zone with serious public health consequences. Also known as bad ozone, it is formed when oxides of nitrogen and other volatile gases, especially from vehicles, are exposed to each other in sunlight Warm and stagnant air increases ozone formation This could have been worse this summer if intermittent rains had not cooled down the weather occasionally,"" a CSE release said./""The high ozone level has made the cocktail of toxic pollutants deadly. Without a timebound implementation strategy and preventive action, this can deepen into a serious public health crisis. It will spare neither the rich nor the poor,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, head of CSE's air pollution programme./The safe standard of ozone is 100 microgramme/cubic metre.

"Air pollution down this year, but still too high","LUCKNOW, June 6 -- Indira Nagar, considered to be the most planned area of the state capital, now has a dubious distinction-air pollution has been found to be higher here than in any other residential locality of Lucknow./Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) has been recorded at 197.5 microgram/cubic metre in Indira Nagar, nearly four times from the World Health Organisation's safe limit of 50 microgram/cubic metre and almost double the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 100 microgram/ cubic metre./And following Indira Nagar closely is the posh Gomti Nagar area, with 183.2 microgram/ cubic metre, according to a premonsoon report on Lucknow's air pollution released by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research on Thursday./While t he good news i s that all areas registered a fall in RSPM levels compared to last year, pollution is still high and damaging. The fall, which experts say might be the result of control in construction activity, is not much of a relief, though monsoon showers may bring down visible air pollution further over the next few weeks/""RSPM are of size 4 to 5 micron that settle inside human organs such as lungs,"" said Dr AA Mahdi, head of KGMU's biochemistry department./Dr Rajendra Prasad, former director of Delhi's Vallabh Bhai Patel Chest Institute, warned, ""Air pollution can be directly linked to diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and other respiratory distress. Higher RSPM is known to damage sensitive body organs. It causes severe irritability in the eyes too.""/For past several years, Lucknowites have been inhali ng deadly par t i cles with almost every breath in the open, living with higher pollution levels than considered safe by NAAQS./Among commercial areas, Charbagh recorded the highest levels of RSPM at 240.9 microgram/cubic metre while Chowk recorded 209.1 microgram/cubic metre, Alambagh 224.8 microgram/cubic metre and Aminabad 174.7 microgram/cubic metre./Amausi is the only industrial area where equipment has been set up to record pollution levels.

Residents take a vow to stop use of plastic,"Noida, June 6 -- On the occasion of World Environment Day, the federation of Noida RWA and the pollution department joined hands and appealed to the Noida residents to stop using polythene bags. The officials also urged residents to use jute bags instead. The move comes amid alarming reports of rising levels of air pollution in the city, causing health problems, including respiratory diseases./The FONRWA said that inappropriate dumping of plastic waste increases pollution./Sanitation workers often burn plastic waste that releases harmful gases or dump it in the drains that choke them./NP Singh, president of FONRWA said, ""We request residents to avoid using plastic bags since they are harmful to the eco system. We should properly dump plastic waste otherwise they choke the drains. If we pledge not to use polythene bags, the supply will automatically fall. Though burning of plastic waste is completely ban in sectors, it is still rampant."" He added that burning of plastic waste and municipal solid adds a great deal towards environmental pollution by reducing ambient air quality./The pollution department said that they are continuously in touch with various NGOs and resident bodies to promote usage of cloth or jute bags. ""We are witnessing a downfall in usage of polythene bags because a section of people have decided not to use them. We keep organizing awareness programmes in the localities to educate people and save the eco system,"" said Atulesh Yadav, regional officer with the Pollution Control Board./Smoke from burned plastic waste contains hazardous chemicals such as carbon monoxide and other harmful gases, which can severely affect the health of people coming in contact with it./T h e N a t i o n a l G r e e n Tribunal (NGT) had recently directed authorities in the NCR to impose a fine of '5,000 on anyone caught burning waste - garbage, leaves, plastic, rubber or other items - in open areas./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"'Don't ban old diesel vehicles, fit filters in them to check pollution'","Noida, June 6 -- While the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has banned 10-year-old diesel vehicles, a former member of the Central Pollution Control Board says that instead of banning the vehicles, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) can be fitted in the vehicle to decrease emissions and hence decrease air pollution./A diesel particulate filter is a device designed to remove diesel particulate matter or soot from the exhaust gas of a diesel engine ./Dr B Sengupta, environmental scientist and former member of the Central Pollution Control Board speaking at Amity University said, ""Rather than phasing out diesel vehicles in Delhi and NCR, DPFs could be fitted into older vehicles to reduce emissions, but this is possible only if less than 50 parts per million (ppm) sulfur fuel is available."" He further added, ""Power availability in Delhi and NCR has to be improved by providing grid supply, new commercial DG sets in Noida and Delhi should be based on CNG and existing DG sets should be retrofitted with requisite pollution control system to reduce nitrogen oxides and soot particles."" Dr Sengupta said, ""The most harmful pollutant in the air is PM2.5 and the major contributors of PM 2.5 in the environment are combustion sources like vehicles, coal, biomass, garbage combustion."" ""The levels of benzene and PM2.5 are very high in Noida which is a matter of grave concern since an average adult inhales 12,000-15,0000 litres of air everyday and PM2.5 easily enters into respiratory track and blood. Continuous and excessive inhaling of PM2.5 could cause dire problems such as premature deaths, lung cancer, heart attacks and development of chronic lung diseases,"" said Sengupta./Meanwhile on Friday, Noida MLA Vimla Bathm speaking at Marwah studios on World Environment Day said, ""Natural calamities are a cause of environmental imbalances caused by man. Water harvesting systems should be installed in all buildings so as to increase the water table. All residents have to contribute to make the environment pollution free.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Construction activities add to pollution mess,"New Delhi, June 6 -- Construction activities in the Capital add huge amounts of noxious waste to Delhi's already polluted air./The construction of new buildings, the extension of existing structures or a new building replacing an old structure are adding high amounts of pollutants to the air every day, enough to harm you and your young ones beyond comprehension./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the rising number of construction activities in nooks and corners of the city needs to be looked into immediately if pollution is to be curbed./""There is a need to adopt good construction practices and control measures to reduce dust generation. Step by step demolition, covering the site while demolition is on, sprinkling water and other dust reduction technologies are some of the methods that are adopted across the world,"" Roychowdhury told Hindustan Times. She said the Delhi government should ensure these measures are in place in the Capital and implemented./The CSE expert warned of the impact of construction and demolition waste - the debris generated when houses or buildings are constructed or demolished. As much as 4,000 tonnes of debris is generated in Delhi every day./Jamia Millia Islamia and the Central Pollution Control Board released a study last year on 19 construction sites in Delhi and found that areas where the air pollution index for PM10 was higher, there were more people suffering from respiratory diseases./Construction dust affects the respiratory system and damages lung tissues. Construction workers are at risk of developing silicosis if they breathe high quantities of concrete and rock dust. Demolition sites may release dust from asbestos which is known to cause Mesothelioma cancer and is banned in more than 50 countries. So what can we do? After renovation work at home, make sure that the debris is dumped in designated community bins and not pavements and roads. Institutions and builders should attempt to re-use as much inert waste as possible. If recycling starts, damage can be contained. Municipal laws to fine those who dump debris on public land need to be invoked. There also needs to be monitoring of construction sites to check pollution./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Lack of public transport leads to congested roads, pollution","Gurgaon, June 9 -- Due to poor connectivity of the public transport system between the Huda city center metro station and the Gurgaon railway station, commuters depend on private vehicles or auto rickshaws./This further adds to the already high levels of air pollution and lines of traffic in the city./Gurgaon's pollution levels are very high - above 100 of coarse particulate matter (PM), and fine Particulate Matter also above safe levels, 50. This is also severely adding to the shoot up in the cases of respiratory diseases among the residents./The intra- city bus service provides a 10 kilometer route from Gurgaon railway station to Mahavir Chowk, Signature tower, Huda city center metro station and a return route too, but various problems such as over-crowding, less buses and non-arrival at regular intervals forces commuters to opt for privately-owned vehicles./""It is not possible for me to travel in a city bus as it is fairly crowded and there is no proper clarity of their arrival time. It is best for me to use car or autorickshaws in order to reach the railway station even if it takes more time, though it is more expensive,"" says 30-year old Rishi Raj, who was travelling from Huda metro station to railway station./Earlier this year, a local MLA office proposed a plan for connecting Huda city center to parts of old Gurgaon to Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda).

"BURNING HILL OF GARBAGE CHOKES EAST DELHI, GZB","New Delhi, June 12 -- Long an eyesore and the source of a major stink, the mountain of garbage that is the Ghazipur landfill in east Delhi is now ""on fire"", leaving over two lakh residents breathing poison./They say garbage dumped at the site is burnt in the open - in violation of a National Green Tribunal ban - and this is leading to serious breathing ailments especially among the elderly and children. Residents say it's been going on for a month though officials deny it, claiming the 'smoke' is methane fumes emanated by the trash./Ghazipur is one of four landfills in Delhi, all saturated to capacity. Garbage shouldn't even be dumped there, let alone burnt, as there have been several such orders./YS Mann, spokesperson for the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, admitted as much but said lack of alternative spots left the civic bodies with no other option. ""Where do we dump the daily waste load of the city? We have no option till DDA gives us other sites.""/However, Mann denied garbage was being burnt at Ghazipur, saying, ""If someone is burning waste, which I don't think is happening, we will look into it and take remedial steps.""/But residents don't buy this version. ""Ghazipur is on fire and making our lives miserable,"" Rahul Chawla, an east Delhi resident, wrote in an email to HT. ""Over the past month, landfill authorities are burning waste in the open overlooking the NGT decision. Residents of nearby localities are suffering because of the smoke and stench.""/""Problems like asthma, cough, chest congestion, shortness of breath are common among people in my colony as clean air is a luxury we don't have.

Forum seeks CM's intervention to check pollution,"Ghaziabad, July 12 -- The India Rejuvenation Initiative (IRI), a forum, comprising several eminent personalities, has sought the Uttar Pradesh chief minister's intervention in controlling the spread of water and air pollution in nearly 50 villages of the Ghaziabad district./In a written communication to chief minister Akhilesh Yadav an IRI member, prof. HC Pande, listed out the issues faced by residents of 50 villages, including those from villages at Sharifabad Rajput, near Loni and also those located along the catchment areas of river Hindon./The letter to the CM has laid emphasis on the health condition of villagers which was of some concern as found out during an inspection by a team of 'Bharat Punrothan Abhiyan' members./The villagers told the team members about the damage done to their agricultural fields due to the flow of water from Tronica City area into the canal. The total dissolved solid levels in villages along river Hindon, at Garhi, Sirora, Bhoopkheri, Bhanera, Farrukhnagar Asalatpur had gone up by alarming levels./The letter said that there had been an increase of 50% in the numbers of patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Besides, diseases related to cancer, heart attacks, and kidneys and perpetual fever also persisted among villagers./It also added that nearly 70% of villagers were dependent on some form of medical treatment./The communication also called on the UP CM to intervene and direct the district administration, UP State Industrial Development Corporation and regional pollution control board for resolution of the issue./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Noida & Ghaziabad.

"Government lacks right equipment, vehicles pass pollution test","New Delhi, July 23 -- Most vehicles in the Capital pass the pollution-under-control test only because the transport department doesn't have the right equipment to assess many parameters./At an inspection on Monday, where 97 of the 112 trucks were overloaded - a staggering 87% - only eight failed the pollution test. The checking was held on an order of the National Green Tribunal./That may be because the test takes into account just the opacity of smoke, levels of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon in the exhaust fumes, leaving out crucial pollutants such as particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur/""We are just given this equipment and use it to check the said parameters. If the equipment does not check other parameters, we can't really help it. If tomorrow, the equipment is changed, we will start using that,"" said a senior transport department official./Questioning the methods of the transport department and Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the National Green Tribunal said, ""How is it possible that only eight vehicles were found to be violating pollution standards when 97 are overloaded? Which parameters were measured? Did you measure particulate matter 2.5? Are your officers not supposed to know what they are testing?"" the bench asked./According to standards for heavy diesel vehicles set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), parameters include levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter./The CPCB even refused to sign off on the report submitted by Delhi government saying they were included in the inspection./Meanwhile, transport officials also said testing overloaded vehicles accurately was impossible./""When we check vehicles, they are stationary. We just ask the drivers to rev up the engine. While we know that overloaded vehicles pollute more, there is no way to check how much more since revving alone can't replicate the pollution caused when on the move,"" said the transport department official./Read also: NGT slams Delhi govt for air pollution from diesel trucks/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi govt directs DDA to check crop stubble burning along Yamuna,"New Delhi, Oct. 2 -- With winters approaching, the city government has asked the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to check the burning of crop stubble by farmers on the banks of Yamuna to avoid a repeat of last year when thick smog enveloped the national Capital, sending air pollution to alarmingly high levels./In stubble burning, farmers set fire to crop remains after harvesting wheat and other grains. Despite being banned, the practice - one of the biggest contributors to air pollution - is carried out in Punjab, Haryana and along the Yamuna river./""We have seen that crop burning is prevalent along the length of the river's west bank, parallel to the Vikas Marg flyover on the east bank and near Akshardham. We have written to the DDA to stop this practice,"" said environment minister Asim Ahmed Khan./In January this year, air pollution levels in Delhi - world's most polluted city according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) - zoomed to alarming levels of 500 for eight days. Air quality usually starts to deteriorate during long dry spells in winter./Crop burning is punishable by a fine of ' 5,000, but the move is not aimed at penalising farmers, Khan said. ""We want farmers to be informed about the ill-effects of the practice. The idea is not to prosecute but to increase awareness,"" he said./In a report, the Union ministry of earth sciences had last year blamed smoke from Punjab and Haryana for the thick smog cover that blankets the capital a fortnight before the winter./""T he smoke caused by burning of crop stubble in the harvesting season of kharif moved towards Delhi due to favourable northerly winds.

City records 'unhealthy' air quality levels,"umbai, Oct. 2 -- If you have been experiencing breathlessness or any other respiratory problems, this could be because Mumbai recorded 'moderate' air quality levels in the last two days of September. The air quality index (AQI) - a pollution-measuring indicator recorded 132 micrograms a cubic metre (ug/m3) and 136ug/ m3 on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively, calculated by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. Moderate air quality levels as defined by the MPCB could lead to breathing discomfort in children and senior citizens suffering from lung and heart ailments. ""Now that the monsoon season has died down, roads and other surfaces have become dry. The dust remains suspended for a longer time in the air and there is no rain to wash it down. Moisture levels have also dropped because of a shift in wind patterns from westerly to easterly that carries hot air./This has led to a rise in AQI levels,"" said Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). On Thursday, AQI according to the United States Consulate General Mumbai at Bandra, measured 152ug/m3, which falls in the 'unhealthy' category with a precautionary statement saying, 'people with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion, while everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion'. After the city recorded an alltime high day temperature at 37.4 degrees Celsius for September on Wednesday, scientists said an increase in temperature could be attributed to depleting green spaces and an increase in concrete structures, especially glass buildings in Mumbai. ""Heat is generated because of solar insulation and the more concrete space you have, the more heat will be accumulated./Reflection from glass buildings and a large number of concrete structures do not allow this heat to escape,"" said Kumar. Stating that man-made actions are causing continued erosion, disappearance and threats to Mumbai's green spaces, Philip Earis, scientist and resident of Bandra, said, ""A densely concrete city causes higher local temperatures. This exacerbates the existing major air pollution problem, which we are all suffering from.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

But, yes all efforts are being made to ensure people do not burn waste in compliance with the NGT order,"" Prajapati said./Though the NGT order clearly specifies that the 'authorities' are responsible for any violation of its order in their jurisdiction, there is still confusion with some officials who claim that they are yet to receive the order./""The garbage burning has been continuing in our area even after NGT order,"" said a resident of NH4 area. We were expecting that the orders will be followed in letter and spirit to effectively check air pollution, but burning of leaves, other waste continues.""/""The burning of dry leaves, other waste has been going on for years but we were expecting that the concerned government agencies would enforce this strictly,"" said another resident./""After all, the NGT order is aimed at the well-being of the people who breathe polluted air due to burning of waste. That is why, we, as common citizens, want the authorities to take this order seriously and not allow burning of waste in the open,"" said another resident./""Pollution is a source for many diseases and instead of burning the leaves which cause air pollution, household waste and leaves should be processed for manure,"" said Dr Pankaj Zutshi, a senior consultant with QRG Central Hospital, Faridabad./It may be mentioned that NGT, in its order, said deputy commissioners, director of horticulture, area SHOs, assistant commissioners and sanitary officers of the area would be held responsible if there was any violation of its order. The safai karamcharis take burning as the easiest way to get rid of the garbage they collect from the residential areas./Also, as part of its efforts to check air pollution in Delhi and National Capital Re gion, National Green Tribunal on April 28 banned burning of waste in the open. The Tribunal also announced a fine of ' Rs 5,000 on anyone who is caught burning dry leaves, plastic, rubber or any other waste material in NCR./The bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar made it clear that all authorities are duty-bound to oblige with the tribunal's orders. ""We make it clear that the orders of the NGT are to be complied with as a decree or order of the civil court,"" the order said./The bench said it had data to support the view that waste burning is responsible for a major portion of emissions in the city. Nearly 29.4% of the total PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) are from waste burning, the bench had said./""We direct that for every incident of burning of such material, the person who is actually found burning or responsible for burning would be liable to pay compensation in terms of Section 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, under the principle of polluter pays,"" the bench had said adding that the money collected would be used for restoration of environment./The green panel said that in case an offender refuses to comply with the orders, the officerin-charge would be at liberty to serve show-cause notice to him for appearing before the tribunal and explain why he shall not pay compensation./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"SC, Centre for 'pollution tax' on trucks to clear Delhi air","New Delhi, Oct. 6 -- The Supreme Court Monday asked for a ""quick positive response"" from the Centre and Delhi government on the possibility of a pollution tax on commercial vehicles passing through the Capital, which has the dirtiest air in the world./The Union government, during the hearing, indicated it was not averse to a levy of ' 600 being imposed on light vehicles and ' 1,200 on heavy vehicles./A bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu gave the two governments time till Wednesday to spell out their stand and fixed October 8 to hear senior advocate Harish Salve's plea./Salve, who has been assisting the court in environment-related issues, said with the winter round the corner, air pollution levels - vehicular emission form a large part of them - would rise further./Delhi's winter is particularly harsh on elderly, children and those with respiratory diseases as polluted air aggravates symptoms of chest infections such as asthma, bronchitis, respiratory distress syndrome etc. Symptoms tend to worsen when mercury drops as pollutants remain suspended in the air longer./Agreeing with Salve, the CJI said his grandson was wearing a mask to school. ""When I asked him why he wore it, he said his school asked him to wear it. He looks like a Ninja with the mask,"" he told Salve who, in turn, said all his family members had developed asthma./""I have also been diagnosed with asthma and have had to depend on steroids for the first time to keep it under check,"" Salve said. His wife and daughter had developed respiratory problems despite no family history./""This is a serious issue. We will take up this matter on Thursday. We want positive response,"" the court said./The World Health Organisation, which named Delhi as the world's most polluted city, has also declared polluted air a carcinogenic./About 85,000 trucks entered Delhi every day from different parts of the country and passed through the Capital to avoid paying toll tax, Salve told the court./Air pollution was 100 times more than the permissible limits in Delhi, solicitor general Ranjit Kumar said./The government, the Centre's senior-most legal officer said, may not be averse to the idea of a pollution levy, seeking time to send in a response in writing./Noting that diesel was the prime source of air pollution in Capital, the National Green Tribunal said on April 7 diesel vehicles older than 10 years would not be permitted to ply in Delhi and neighbourhood. The green court, however, stayed the ban after it was challenged by a truckers' body. The case now comes up for hearing on October 7./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

An age-old issue: Here's how to look as young as you feel,"India, Oct. 10 -- Everyone ages, some more visibly than others. You don't need school reunions and Facebook posts to notice how some people shrivel at age 40 while others look effortlessly creaseless at 50. It's all in the genes, say experts, which means people with overzealous ageing genes need to work harder at looking as young as they feel./Wrinkling is not just a superficial process but it actually reflects the road map of your overall health and fitness status. You cannot expect to have a radiantly young skin while the rest of you feels too old to get out of bed each morning. What cause wrinkles is a combination of factors: The dermis (inner layer of skin) becomes thinner with age because cell division slows down. The network of elastin (the protein that causes the skin to stretch) and collagen fibres (the structural proteins in the skin) that support the outer layer, also loosen, causing the skin to sag. So with ageing, skin loses its elasticity and its ability to retain moisture, factors that get aggravated by smoking and exposure to sun and air pollution./Testing age/Now there's a genetic test to assess how well or badly your body is ageing to predict when you are likely to die, reports a team at the King's College London in the journal Genome Biology. Saying that ""biological age"" is a more useful predictor of health than how old you are, the test compares the behaviour of 150 genes to identify an ageing signature in cells and identify those at high-risk of ageing faster and developing age-related disorders, such as dementia. The study found that the final diagnosis of how you age can be done by combining biological age and how you live your life./Exotic is not better/For most people, looking and staying healthy takes work. While the more adventurous are experimenting with therapies bordering on the bizarre, such as injecting serum derived from the placentas of aborted babies, choosing vampire ""blood"" facials and blood transfusions using blood of young donors, the conservative majority depend on mundane options such as slathering anti-ageing creams and popping vitamins, minerals and antioxidants./Though many face creams have vitamins established to have potent antioxidant effects, very few can actually stop or reverse ageing on application because the active ingredient -- the stuff that fights ageing -- is present in concentrations so low that they have no effect on the skin./Anti-ageing creams, or any other creams for that matter, prevent the skin from drying up, but traditional oils such as coconut, mustard or olive work just as well, as long as you don't mind smelling like yesterday's leftover lunch./Vitamin boost/Some of the basic components found in most creams are vitamin A derivates and natural acids that peel of the sun- and wind-damaged outermost layer of the skin to fade fine lines, but the effect lasts only till use is continued./The most common vitamin A-derivative in anti-ageing creams is retinal. Retinol's stronger counterpart is tretinoin, which is the active ingredient in retin-A and renova. Anti-ageing creams with Vitamin A-derived tretinoin as an active ingredient smoothens fine wrinkles, minimises brown pigment pockets and improves texture. If your skin is sensitive to the stronger-acting Retin-A, retinol is a good alternative./Alpha-hydroxy acids (glycolic, lactic, tartaric and citric acids) and beta-hydroxy acid (salicylic acid) remove fine lines, irregular and age-related pigmentation but increase sun sensitivity, so using sun protection is a must to prevent redness and itching./Age-busting foods/""Anti-ageing"" diets include fruits (oranges, lemons, etc) and colourful fruits and vegetables such as broccoli, zuccini, spinach, papaya etc. Vitamin E is excellent for the skin when eaten from natural sources such as in vegetable oils such as sunflower oil, grains, oats, nuts, and dairy products but capsules should be taken only on prescription as too much can be toxic./Recent animal studies have found that selenium - a mineral found in whole grain cereals, seafood, garlic and eggs -- is taken orally or through the skin in the form of L-selenomethionine, protects against skin damage and preserves tissue elasticity./High fitness levels helps to make the skin supple as exercise increases oxygen supply to the skin's cells and boosts rejuvenation./Ageing begins at your late 20s and 30s and since it's easier to prevent than reverse skin damage, you should perhaps give more thought to what you eat and how you lead your life./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Children of mothers exposed to indoor pollution have less body wt,"New Delhi, Oct. 11 -- Children born to mothers who spend long hours in traditional wood fire kitchens have low body weight and are more prone to catching pneumonia.

""Cost is another deterrent as most families that use firewood are very poor,"" said a representative of one company that manufactures these stoves./But the government believes scaling up production will result in easy availability and cost reductions, and have an added benefit - it will create employment for rural youth./For quality assurance, it has asked the Bureau of Energy Efficiency to introduce efficiency norms for the stoves just like the ones for ACs and refrigerators./""We will soon have research evidence to show that switching to cleaner cooking options results in saving precious little lives and also empowers women,"" Radha Muthiah, head of the Global Alliance for Clean Cooking Stoves, told HT./""These studies will provide evidence that will allow policy makers to make a clear link between fuel switching, reducing air pollution and public health,"" Dr James Tielsch, chair of the department of global health at George Washington University and lead researcher for the study, said at a seminar in Nepal recently./Long-term studies in South Asia and Africa have already shown ""significant"" improvements in child health in cases of switching to clean cooking options./A study by civil society group Practical Action shows that on average, a rural Indian woman spends 374 hours a year collecting firewood.

AN INVISIBLE THREAT IN THE AIR AROUND US,"New Delhi, Oct. 18 -- Each year, the average adult has two to three bouts of viral infection./Children have more, falling ill in this way between four and six times a year. Symptoms in both young and old range from mild sniffles and sore throat to hacking cough, high fever and acute diarrhoea, all of which appear to be leading to more hospitalisations./Over the past two years, there's also been a palpable increase in the frequency with which viruses and bacteria cause infection even in the healthiest of us./Doing everything right no longer ensures that you will stay infection free, complained a friend who's been fighting frustrating battles against frequent viral fevers despite leading an obsessively clean and healthy life./A typical day in his life is the stuff of most New Year resolutions - a personal trainer, running, organic food, ambiance-controlled home, regular health checks - and yet he battles the same infections as those of us with far more compromised lifestyles./In his case, urban air pollution appears to be the great leveller. The dense smog that hangs low across north India through most of the year does more than choke out the sun and starve our collective lungs of oxygen./It kills 6.2 lakh people prematurely in India, from a wide range of seemingly unrelated diseases that include cardiac conditions, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections and asthma attacks./The death estimate from pollution in India in 2013 has jumped six-fold from the 1 lakh estimate in 2000, said the Global Burden of Disease, 2013, which tracks deaths and illnesses from all causes across the world./Air pollution is the biggest cause of death after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution (mainly from smoking coal and wood stoves), tobacco use, and poor nutrition./But most people don't realise that air pollution also hurts us in more insidious way. It fuels viral and bacterial infections in the winter months and is a major contributor to rising cases of colds, cough and viral fevers, including swine flu caused by the H1N1 influenza virus./Airborne particulate matter are a deadly cocktail of dust, organic carbon, black carbon, nitrates and sulfates found in construction material, vehicular industrial emissions, incinerators, windblown dust, power plants and wood, coal, biomass and agricultural fires./While studies linking air pollution with viral and bacterial infection in India are small and largely anecdotal, representative data from across the world firmly establishes the link./An analysis of 10 European birth cohorts that between them used data from more than 16,000 children, established a link between air pollution and childhood pneumonia, painful middle-ear infection (otitis media) and croup, which is an upper airways infection that leads to children developing a harsh, barking cough because of inflammation around the vocal cords, windpipe and bronchial tubes. The study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives last year, found oxides of nitrogen - byproducts of vehicular emissions, power plants and coal burning - were the most harmful for young children./Viral identification data from positive identification count and outbreak records that included emergency visits for influenza-like illness, severe acute respiratory infection and meteorological factors/air pollution in the city of Porto Alegre in Brazil, from November 2008 to October 2010 showed that 22% of the close to 12,000 hospitalisations were triggered by air pollutants. The data, which was collated using time-series analysis and published in the Journal Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses showed that apart from the mean concentration of pollution, other related environmental factors that played a role were temperature, humidity and the duration of sunshine./It's no safer indoors. A study in the journal Inhalation Toxicology found dampness (marker for dust mites, endotoxins and reduced ventilation) and mould was consistently linked with respiratory symptoms of cough, wheezing, and upper respiratory infections./Researchers at Geohealth Laboratory, University of Canterbury in New Zealand went a step further and used virology prediction tools to predict the numbers of hospital admissions. Writing in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, they used various computational methodologies such as neural networks, theoretical computer algorithms and data mining techniques to study the relationship between air pollution, climate and hospital admissions and plan to predict and prevent potential outbreaks./Cleaning the air is possible with legislation and public participation, as is predicting outbreaks and planning ahead./And the sooner we do it, the healthier we are likely to be./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"As winter approaches, Delhiites can say goodbye to clean air","IndiaSpend, Oct. 19 -- As winter soon descends on Delhi, the city can expect air that is more than twice as polluted than during the spring and summer./Every Delhiite knows that air pollution varies by season. But not every Delhiite knows that it varies in type, by time of day and day of the week. This variation might make a difference to the way the city's residents plan their activities, and it certainly should influence how policymakers design an approach to the problem./The Central Pollution Control Board and Air Quality Index websites are both useful for finding real-time air pollution readings around the city, but they don't track or analyse broad patterns. We examined ambient air pollution data going back to 2012 from the CPCB website and found some interesting results./As you can see in the chart below, one of Delhi's biggest problems is with PM 2.5, particles of soot and other contaminants suspended in the air, 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller, about 30 times finer than a human hair, a size that allows them to be trapped in the lungs. PM 2.5 is the pollutant of greatest concern to public health, as it has been shown to cause lung cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, asthma, and a host of other health problems./On an average day last winter, concentrations of PM 2.5 exceeded 200 milligrams per square meter (mg/nm3), earning a Very Poor rating on the new Air Quality Index (AQI). An average day this spring was about half as polluted, 104 mg/nm3, earning a 'Moderate' rating. Among other pollutants being measured by the AQI, only Nitrogen Dioxide ever crossed below the Good range, and our analysis shows that it was actually higher in spring than in winter./Delhi world's most polluted city: Study/So, why is PM2.5 so high in winter?/One reason is that several major polluting activities increase as winter approaches. People burn more biomass to heat their homes within the city, and the end of the harvest season means that farmers burn the stubble off their fields. NASA has released satellite images of the great plumes of smoke from burning rice paddies in Punjab in October and November./Also, while the Supreme Court banned brick manufacturing in Delhi in 1996, industry responded by shifting production to just outside the city's borders. Today, more than 1000 brick kilns operate inside the National Capital Region and their main production period coincides with Delhi's winter season. One study estimates that 15% of the PM 2.5 affecting Delhi can be attributed to brick kilns, putting kilns on par with truck traffic and power generation as sources of PM 2.5./These seasonal increases collude with meteorological forces. During the winter months, cool air stagnates over the city, keeping pollution close to the ground where people breathe. Delhi's persistent winter fog only worsens the problem./Stagnant air explains why pollution levels vary less widely over the day in winter than in spring, as is evident in the chart above. In spring, warm, rising air moves pollution out, so the average pollution at ground level follows more closely the profile of polluting activities throughout the day. During the afternoon when people are at work, it drops, only to rise again with the evening rush hour. It stays relatively high overnight, likely due to the practice of trucking goods, not only in and out but through Delhi. The Supreme Court has just approved an ""environmental compensation charge"" that will take effect November 1 and make the short cut more costly./In spring, the safest time to go for a run is six in the evening. In winter, sluggish air means that the safest time is seven in the morning - and by a much smaller margin./Stagnant air also explains why, as evident in the chart below, pollutants accumulate throughout over the workweek in winter, and why spring sees more variation within days./The AQI in its current form describes the type of health risks of each pollution level but doesn't provide recommended actions. Also, there is no widespread information dissemination system in place. Many other countries have health alert networks that disseminate information through text messages and TV news tickers when pollution is high. These would make good valuable add-ons to the Index, allowing residents to protect themselves and plan their activities around the worst of Delhi's bad air./(Eric Dodge is Data Analytics Lead with Harvard University's Evidence for Policy Design. Kevin Rowe is a PhD. Student at Harvard University.)/The story first appeared in IndiaSpend, the country's first data journalism initiative./Delhi: Supreme Court's green light to city pollution tax/Out of breath: How air pollution fuels viral infections, fever/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Cooler weather triggers toxicity in air,"New Delhi, Oct. 23 -- Delhi is seeing red when it comes to air quality, quite literally./Between Monday and Wednesday, Delhi had recorded a red warning on the National Air Quality Index (NAQI) which indicates very poor air quality (300 and above)./Thursday's air quality for the entire day was not available./Despite all the hullabaloo over the poor quality of air in the national capital after it topped the World Health Organisation's list of the most polluted cities list last year, very little has changed on the ground./As soon as the temperatures dipped and the wind patterns changed, pollution levels started to rise. Vehicular air pollution, dust from construction sites, agricultural and leaf burning and diesel generator sets, which are among the biggest causes of pollution in the city, continue to pollute unchecked. Low winter temperature traps the emissions in the lower atmosphere, creating a thick smoggy haze./""Gases and other air-pollutants are hanging low when the sky is overcast, which is why during winters we get more asthma-related cases and cases of aggravated symptoms. It is worse for children as they have weaker immune system and their lungs aren't as strong as adults,"" says Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head of department of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./Despite several orders passed by the courts and the National Green Tribunal to reduce the number of trucks entering the city, penalties for open burning and covering construction sites, implementation is spotty, if at all./With farmers in and around Delhi continuing the practice of scrub burning, a real challenge has been handed over to the authorities to control the illegal practice this year./The Delhi government seems to have made a small effort by issuing notifications to penalise open burning strictly. The Capital also saw the first car-free day on Thursday, and environment experts say it had a significant impact in cleaning the Delhi air though the findings have to be weighed in against the fact that car-free day was observed early morning on a national holiday when very few cars are there on the roads./""We monitored the pollution levels on the car-free stretch on Wednesday and Thursday and found about 60% drop in PM 2.5 and 45% drop in PM 10 levels, which is pretty big. We obviously did factor in the fact that Thursday being a public holiday, vehicular movement will be low,"" Anumita Roychowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment's air pollution and clean transportation programme./""However, we still found that if you are able to restrain vehicular movement, it's going to make a huge positive difference to the city's air quality,"" she says/A lot more, however, will have to be done to bring air quality within acceptable limits./""There's a need for taking hard measures like putting direct restrain by way of limiting legal parking area; providing safe infrastructure for walkers and cyclists and to integrate the metro with the bus, autos and cycles,"" Roychowdhury adds./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Open kitchens in eateries add to Delhi's pollution,"New Delhi, Oct. 26 -- Packed markets and a festive buzz in the air are not the only things that announce the arrival of winter in Delhi. A constant haze and poor air quality also come with it and for those of you who love street food, the danger is more pronounced./The open kitchens that are part of every market in the city add toxic pollutants to Delhi's already polluted air./Soot, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitric oxides and sulphur dioxides are the primary pollutants that are released into the air because of the harmful practice of cooking food in the open, especially with coal, firewood and kerosene./It, however, is not just street food vendors that are responsible for the growing problem. Restaurants that have open-air barbeques are also releasing toxic soot and particulate matter in the air./Delhi was declared the most polluted city in the world by the World Health Organisation last year, bringing the issue of poor air quality to the forefront./In 2013, Beijing closed down all barbeques and eateries that cooked food in the open to clamp down on pollution in the city that competed with Delhi for the title of the most polluted city in the world./The dangers of cooking with unclean fuel have gained international attention over the past five years with several research projects running in developing countries to understand the problem and assess the associated damage. The problem, however, is mostly thought of as rural rather than urban./According to environment department officials, firewood and coal burning could be penalised as per the order of the National Green Tribunal's order against open burning.

"No blanket ban on crackers, says SC","New Delhi, Oct. 29 -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to ban firecrackers or direct authorities to allot a designated place during Diwali to prevent people from bursting them everywhere, saying it was not possible to issue orders that couldn't be implemented./The court reiterated its earlier decision to limit the bursting of crackers between 6am and 10pm, amid concerns that crackers could worsen the city's pollution levels, the worst in the world./""If a citizen wants to burst cracker at his home, he can also come up and say I have the right to do so. This sort of direction cannot be given hurriedly,"" said a bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu./The court was hearing a petition by senior counsel Abhishek Singhvi, who requested the court on behalf of three child petitioners for an interim direction restricting the duration of fireworks to three hours and identifying a specific area for bursting them./""This is an unreasonable request. Today we can't be saying, 'go to a maidan to burst crackers',"" the bench told the senior advocate./Official data over the past five years on Diwali shows the level of suspended particulate matter - which causes respiratory and cardiac problems -- often doubles during the time./Statistics show the pollution generally starts surging at around 6 pm on Diwali and peaks between 10 pm and midnight. The air continues to remain filthy till about 6am the next day with thick haze engulfing residential areas after hours of firecracker bursting and respiratory difficulties reported among the elderly and children./Central and state governments have issued guidelines limiting the timing and kind of firecrackers that can be sold but the regulations are often poorly implemented, leading to rising noise pollution levels as well./On October 16, the top court asked the government to publicise the harmful effects of crackers and instruct schools to teach students the same, but expressed its unhappiness when Singhvi told the judges that the administration hadn't taken up any steps so far./The bench told the Centre that advertisements should start appearing from October 30 onwards and continue till November 12./The Centre had also told the court it was not in favour of a blanket ban, saying the bursting of crackers was not the only cause of air pollution./""The causes and mitigation of air pollution is multi-sectoral in nature and air pollution may be prevented, abated and controlled by a multidisciplinary approach through joint efforts of various ministries/ departments,"" it had said./The petition filed through the legal guardians of the children demanded, among other things, a blanket ban on the use of firecrackers during festivals -- and the court will hear it in February 2016./But Hindu organisations countered the petition, saying the bursting of crackers on Diwali was a Hindu tradition for hundreds of years and a complete ban would hurt religious sentiments./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Ban on Chinese crackers to help celebrate a green Diwali,"Ludhiana, Nov. 1 -- With the ban of the central government on import of Chinese crackers this year, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has all reasons to believe that Diwali this year would be less noisy and with less pollution as compared to the past few years./Ludhiana is one of the most polluted cities of the country as the city is dotted with different industrial units that emanate smoke and pollution into the atmosphere. During Diwali days the level of pollutants in the atmosphere rise tremendously adding to the woes of the residents who suffer with several diseases caused due to the pollution./Chinese and sub-standard crackers are the main reason of the significant rise in pollution in the city every year. However, due to the ban on these crackers by the central government last year, the PPCB believes that the level of pollution would go down as compared to last year./Although this is sure that pollution would be caused during the days near Diwali and soon after the festival as even the standard as well as approved crackers produce smoke and cause pollution but the pollution caused by Chinese and sub-standard crackers is much more than these crackers./Official data of noise and air pollution during the days of Diwali accessed by the HT shows that there is a decline in the level of pollution as compared to the past few years. The noise pollution during the past some years has shown considerable decline especially in the residential areas of the city./While the noise pollution level in residential areas in 2009 during Diwali days was 91 decibels that decreased significantly to 75.48 decibels in year 2014. The level of noise pollution in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 was 86, 78.3, 73.1 and 70.86 decibels during Diwaly days respectively./Meanwhile, air pollution has increased during the days of Diwali during the past some years. The Respirable Suspended Particilate matter (RSPM) a day before in residential area in year 2014 was 83 while that on the day of Diwali was 316. In year 2013. RSPM in residential areas before Diwali was 240 while that on the day of festival was 335. RSPM in 2012 on the day before Diwali was 303 while that on the day of festival was 390./Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer of the PPCB, said it is expected that the level of pollution would not rise significantly on the day of Diwali. ""Awareness regarding harmful effects of use of crackers is on rise and we are keeping a close watch on pollution levels during these days"" said Rai./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Farmers play with fire, shun ban","Chandigarh, Nov. 5 -- After a bumper paddy crop, the fields are on fire in Punjab and Haryana, polluting the air with hazardous particles./Strangely, there wasn't much hue and cry till a thick blanket of smog - a mixture of smoke and fog - enveloped Delhi, making city residents breathless. It's the farmers of the two food-bowl states who are being blamed for the sudden deterioration in air quality and smog in the entire northern region over the past week. They are indulging in the banned practice of burning of paddy stubble to clear their fields at no cost for the next crop. If the impact is being felt hundreds of kilometres away in Delhi, one can imagine the havoc air pollution is playing with the health of people of the two states at this time of the year./The situation created by the age-old practice of setting crop residue afire is alarming. A study carried out by the Punjab Remote Sensing Institute, using satellites, shows that the state's farmers burn 76%, roughly 150 lakh tonnes, of their paddy straw every season./According to experts, one tonne of straw, on being burnt, releases about 3 kg of particulate matter, 60 kg of carbon monoxide, 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, 199 kg of ash and 2 kg of sulphur dioxide./""The burning of 130 to 150 lakh tonnes of paddy straw in a span of 20 days generates pollution equal to what the state industry generates in a year,"" said a Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) scientist./The resultant haze and low-hanging clouds of smoke, exacerbated by low temperature and slow wind speed, are a lethal health hazard, posing serious risks to people with breathing troubles, allergies, asthma and other respiratory disorders, particularly those living in proximity to paddy areas. Constant and high exposure to air pollution is known to lead to hospitalisation for asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis and lung diseases, besides increasing the risk of a stroke./BAN REMAINS ON PAPER/Despite the adverse impact of this bi-annual practice on health and environment, thousands of farmers continue to light matchsticks with impunity to burn their wheat and paddy stubble post-harvest over large swathes of land across the two states year after year. And, all the warnings, threats of prosecution, penalties and ""out-of-thebox ideas"" have proved ineffective in curbing the menace./The problem is best illustrated by numbers (see the infographic). In Jalandhar district, where 1.6 lakh hectares were under paddy this season, 80% of the farmers burn their crop residue to free their land for the next crop. The district authorities had issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for a period of two months, but without any effect. Though crop burning is rampant, only three cases have been registered against erring farmers till date./Tarn Taran district agriculture officer Ravel Singh said farmers were burning paddy straw in 55% of the total 1.75 lakh hectares which were under paddy. In Haryana, paddy straw is widely burnt in the farms of Karnal, Kurukshetra and Panipat.

The stubble trouble: Gasping for air as smog reigns,"Chandigarh, Nov. 6 -- Jasveer Singh, a 52-year-old former wrestler, is a familiar face in villages around Phillaur in Jalandhar district. But for two months every year, he not only loses his breath but also his identity./With smoke emanating from blazes in paddy fields across Punjab and Haryana, the one-time grappler finds it hard to breathe. He prefers to stay indoors, keeping his face covered all the time. No wonder nobody recognises him. Jasveer is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. ""I generally avoid going out. In case I have to, I cover my face because the weather during these two months (October and November) does not suit me,"" he says./The reason: a sharp deterioration in air quality and smog - a mixture of smoke and fog - that engulfs the northern region. His doctor, Dr SK Jindal, former head, pulmonary medicine at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, says there are a large number of patients suffering from asthma and COPD who die for want of breath during these two months./Jasveer feels the pain of the uncontrolled burning of paddy residue. ""These days are so bad that I cannot even enjoy Diwali with my family,"" he says. The ailment has changed his life. After giving up wrestling some years ago, he turned to coaching, but has to also stay away from akharas now for these two months./HARROWING ORDEAL/This isn't just his story alone. There are many others for whom breathing becomes an ordeal during this period when the air quality drops. The condition of 66-year-old Geeta Kapoor, a retired government teacher from Kharar, is worse. Last week, she found it difficult to even breathe and had to be rushed to a private super-specialty hospital in SAS Nagar. As her inhaler became ineffective, she was put on nebuliser./Geeta cannot even walk a few steps because she starts losing her breath. Though she has been suffering from asthma for the past 10 years, these few weeks are the worst part of the year for her. The stubble fires and smog have confined her to her house. According to PGIMER doctors, the number of patients suffering from COPD and asthma trebles in October and November every year. The institute runs a chest clinic twice a week where they get 15 to 20 new patients of these two diseases each time. Children and elderly are the worst sufferers./Though no separate record is maintained of patients hospitalised due to pollution caused by stubble burning, doctors say the numbers have been fluctuating in the past one-and-a-half decades. ""There is no separate data available, but we do get patients with asthmatic and bronchitis problems aggravated by burning of paddy straw and the resultant air pollution,"" says Dr Jai Singh, civil surgeon, Amritsar, advocating strict action against cultivators for violating the ban./In Haryana also, the number of patients visiting hospitals with allergic bronchitis, breathlessness, throat infections, eye infections and other pollution-related problems sees a jump after paddy and wheat harvesting. Doctors blame the decline in air quality for the increasing severity of respiration-related health problems. ""Smog affects people having a medical history of respiratory disorder.

The study, carried out at Sidhuwal village of Patiala, evaluated variations in PFTs due to crop residue burning on children between 10 and 13 years and young people between 20 and 35 years. The effects of exposure to smoke due to burning of paddy and wheat stubble on pulmonary functions were evaluated./GOVT'S SLUGGISH IN RESPONSE/Besides failing to douse the farm fires and take any firm action to tackle the problem of rising air pollution, the governments of the two states, whose farmers have aggravated the crisis by burning crop residue twice a year, are still to wake up to the health problems of people with respiratory disorders. When asked whether they have any plan to take up the matter with various departments, the answer of top health officials of Punjab was in the negative. ""No doubt it is a matter of concern, but the health department cannot do much. We can only sensitise people or ask other departments concerned to control the problem,"" is all health secretary Hussan Lal, had to say. The Haryana health authorities, too, have not shown any significant initiative./Choked by smokescreen/How does smog affect breathing?/Smog can cause or aggravate health problems such as breathlessness, asthma, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory disorders, besides eye irritation and reduced resistance to cold and lung infections. ""While inhaling, fog, smog or smoke components enter our lungs. It creates hypersensitivity in those already suffering from asthma bronchospasm, making it even more difficult for them to breathe,"" says Dr Deepak Bhasin, senior consultant, pulmonary medicine and critical care, Max Super Specialty Hospital, SAS Nagar./How alarming are benzene levels?/In 2011, Vinayak Sinha and his team first observed a jump in levels of benzene at Central Analytical Facility, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali. Benzene is a well-established cause of cancer in humans./""There was no previous study of the impact of paddy residue burning. So, we decided to investigate the rise in benzene levels during this time of the year,"" said the assistant professor in the department of earth and environmental sciences./""It came out that the benzene level at the source was around 40 ppb (parts per billion), 80 times of what it was at Mohali (0.5 ppb). So, farmers and the rural population living near the source are exposed to a much higher level of benzene,"" he said. Sinha's team made over 8 lakh measurements over three years - 2012, 2013 and 2014. The results were equally shocking.

Gasping for air as smog reigns,"Chandigarh, Nov. 6 -- Jasveer Singh, a 52-year-old former wrestler, is a familiar face in villages around Phillaur in Jalandhar district. But for two months every year, he not only loses his breath but also his identity./With smoke emanating from blazes in paddy fields across Punjab and Haryana, the one-time grappler finds it hard to breathe. He prefers to stay indoors, keeping his face covered all the time. No wonder nobody recognises him. Jasveer is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. ""I generally avoid going out. In case I have to, I cover my face because the weather during these two months (October and November) does not suit me,"" he says./The reason: a sharp deterioration in air quality and smog - a mixture of smoke and fog - that engulfs the northern region. His doctor, Dr SK Jindal, former head, pulmonary medicine at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, says there are a large number of patients suffering from asthma and COPD who die for want of breath during these two months./Jasveer feels the pain of the uncontrolled burning of paddy residue. ""These days are so bad that I cannot even enjoy Diwali with my family,"" he says. The ailment has changed his life. After giving up wrestling some years ago, he turned to coaching, but has to also stay away from akharas now for these two months./HARROWING ORDEAL/This isn't just his story alone. There are many others for whom breathing becomes an ordeal during this period when the air quality drops. The condition of 66-year-old Geeta Kapoor, a retired government teacher from Kharar, is worse. Last week, she found it difficult to even breathe and had to be rushed to a private super-specialty hospital in SAS Nagar. As her inhaler became ineffective, she was put on nebuliser./Geeta cannot even walk a few steps because she starts losing her breath. Though she has been suffering from asthma for the past 10 years, these few weeks are the worst part of the year for her. The stubble fires and smog have confined her to her house. According to PGIMER doctors, the number of patients suffering from COPD and asthma trebles in October and November every year. The institute runs a chest clinic twice a week where they get 15 to 20 new patients of these two diseases each time. Children and elderly are the worst sufferers./Though no separate record is maintained of patients hospitalised due to pollution caused by stubble burning, doctors say the numbers have been fluctuating in the past one-and-a-half decades. ""There is no separate data available, but we do get patients with asthmatic and bronchitis problems aggravated by burning of paddy straw and the resultant air pollution,"" says Dr Jai Singh, civil surgeon, Amritsar, advocating strict action against cultivators for violating the ban./In Haryana also, the number of patients visiting hospitals with allergic bronchitis, breathlessness, throat infections, eye infections and other pollutionrelated problems sees a jump after paddy and wheat harvesting. Doctors blame the decline in air quality for the increasing severity of respiration-related health problems. ""Smog affects people having a medical history of respiratory disorder. Their number in OPDs (out-patient departments) normally increases by 20 to 30% during October-November,"" according to a doctor at Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College, Karnal./""Though there are not many community-based studies on the quantum of harm paddy stubble burning is causing, there is no doubt that Punjab and Haryana have more cases as compared to other states.

"As temperature falls, city's air quality officially drops to 'poor'","umbai, Nov. 6 -- A layer of pollutantl-aden haze descended on Mumbai on Thursday, raising the city's air quality index (AQI) to 203 and putting it in the 'poor' category - meaning that it poses a risk to people with sensitivity to air pollution - for the first time this year./The AQI was recorded by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) - a pollution monitoring programme developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, t he Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the regional meteorological centre. SAFAR uses AQI to rate air quality at 10 locations across Mumbai./Since the start of the month, the quality of Mumbai's air has been in the ' moderate' range (100 to 200), indicating a sudden increase in pollution levels on Thursday. According to separate data from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Mumbai's AQI levels have been above 100 since November 1. The AQI was 175 on Wednesday, 156 on Tuesday, 111 on Monday and 112 on Sunday. MPCB has issued a health warning for people with lung ailments and heart disease, especially children and seniors./""Temperatures are decreasing. Low temperatures can cause 'inversion' - the trapping of pollutants near the surface in the form of dust. However, the exact reasons will be determined once the data is analysed,"" said Neha S Parkhi, senior programme officer, IITM. She added that air quality is expected to worsen because of falling temperatures and Diwali celebrations./Phlip Earis, a scientist and resident of Bandra, said, ""Air pollution in Mumbai is a serious problem. Diesel vehicles, weak emissions standards, insufficient regulation of construction and industry and lack of green open spaces are all major contributors to air pollution.""/Earis added that while winds and rain during the monsoon season help disperse particulate matter and bring some relief, the air we breathe has serious consequences for our health./Doctors said they have been treating patients with respiratory infections caused by pollution. ""Dust causes many allergic reactions, such as allergic rhinitis (nasal passage inflammation) and allergic pharyngitis (throat inflammation). Extreme levels can cause asthmatic bronchitis, wheezing and coughing,"" said Ashwini Kumar Mehta, ENT specialist at Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri (East)./""Citizens need to be aware of the extent of the problem as it affect everyone's health. The sooner that citizens contact elected representatives to express their concern, the sooner the problem will be addressed. It is a critical problem that we ignore at our peril,"" said Earis./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air gets dirtier, Indira Nagar most polluted in Lucknow","Lucknow, Nov. 6 -- Indira Nagar, the residential hub of the state capital, has the highest air pollution, says a study conducted to assess postmonsoon air pollution levels in Lucknow./As per the report released by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) on Thursday, Indira Nagar has 218.2-microgram/cubic meter of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), a significant indicator of air pollution./Ironically, Indira Nagar had the highest air pollution levels in the pre-monsoon report in June./This year, the study also included assessment of total mass concentration of superfine and ultrafine particles and it was found that they were higher in the commercial as well as in the residential areas./Vikas Nagar is next to Indira Nagar in air pollution and recorded 199.5-microgram/cubic metre of RSPM while Aliganj recorded 182.9-microgram/cubic metre of RSPM./In its conclusion, the IITR team indicated the reasons for this high level of air pollution. Unlimited growth of vehicle population, their technological development and release of invisible tailpipe pollutant emissions were serious debatable issues even for the policy makers./""Use of different types of fuels like petrol, diesel, LPG and CNG make the environment more complex regarding the air quality and their synergistic effects on the human health,"" said the report./Significantly, the report pointed out that the higher level of air pollution in the city was also attributed to construction work including construction of new roads, pavements and their repair/ maintenance, construction of multi-storey buildings, movement of heavy vehicles carrying construction material, garbage dumps and movement of garbage trucks in the city./""RSPM settles inside human organs such as lungs when we breathe in polluted air,"" said Dr AA Mahdi, HoD, biochemistry department at the King George's Medical University. ""Air pollution can be directly linked to diseases such as COPD, asthma and other respiratory distress,"" said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, orthopaedic surgeon and health activist./Though Lucknow is not an industrial town, scattered industries in some areas of the city and small workshops are also adding to the air pollution to some extent, the report said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"City's air quality 'poor' for a second day, may get worse","umbai, Nov. 7 -- Pollution levels in the city stayed high for a second day in a row, a day after Mumbai's air quality dropped to its unhealthiest level for the first time this year./The city's skies were covered in haze, and pollution-monitoring agencies said air quality could get worse over the weekend./On Friday, Mumbai recorded an air quality index (AQI - a pollution-measuring indicator) of 212, which falls under the 'poor' category and posing health risks to people who are sensitive to pollution, according to SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), a joint project by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the BMC and the Regional Meteorological Centre (IMD) Mumbai. With Diwali around the corner, the air quality is expected to get worse. SAFAR has predicted a forecast of a 220 AQI for the weekend. It was 203 on Thursday./""This year, the onset of winter has been delayed across the country. The air quality was relatively better until two weeks ago, and then suddenly, over the past week, there has been a drop in temperatures. Owing to the low temperatures, a process called inversion traps pollutants near the ground in the form of dust, which leads to increased air pollution,"" said Dr Gufran Beig, scientist at IITM, Pune and project director, SAFAR./SAFAR calculates air quality index at 10 locations in Mumbai. On Friday, six of these recorded 'poor' air quality: Malad, Andheri and Mazgaon recorded 252, 225 and 222 respectively, while Chembur, Bhandup and Worli recorded 217, 217 and 206 respectively. AQI above 200 is classified as 'poor'./Beig said dust suspended in the air contains smaller particles like PM2.5 and PM10, which combine with burning of vehicular fuel to increase pollution./""The air quality levels are expected to increase, as hot winds from the land are suspended over the city and are not being absorbed by the ocean. This allows finer pollutant particles to dangle in the air,"" said Beig, adding, ""If winter gets more severe, we can expect an increase in pollution levels.""/HUMID FRIDAY/Humidity levels rose on Friday, with Colaba recording 98% humidity in the day and 70% at night. At Santacruz, humidity was 77% and 56%. Clear skies led to a rise in day temperatures in the suburbs to 36.3 degrees Celsius.

The situation will remain the same till Monday./The particulate matter was, in some places, 10 to 12 times higher than the acceptable limits./The level of Benzene also spiked astronomically in a few places. At Anand Vihar, Benzene was over five times the safe limit at 27.5 microgram per cubic metre while five microgram per cubic metre is the prescribed limit./RK Puram and Civil Lines showed the levels at 11.1 and 22.06 around 2 PM as per the readings of Delhi Pollution Control Committee./Exposure to Benzene can have long term adverse health effects including cancer./Pollution levels increased during the day with a heavy haze settling in. This was a result of a variety of phenomenon such as high humidity, low temperature and crop burning in Punjab and Haryana./""The situation is likely to persist till November 9. On November 10, there is a possibility of western disturbance which will disperse the pollutants to some extent.

"To keep fury ones safe, pet parents want a quiet Diwali","Gurgaon, Nov. 8 -- Last year, members of an animal welfare group in the city found 16 stray dogs run over in DLF Phase 3 on the morning after Diwali./According to doctors, noise during Diwali causes major health issues, including nervous disorders, in animals. Most animals have much stronger senses that make them sensitive to loud noise and smoke. For instance, cats have a hearing rage that is 200 times more than that of human beings./""Milder health concer ns include shock, vomiting, loss of appetite and restlessness. The smaller of the pets tend to suffer more. Birds, rabbits and rats often suffer heart attacks and die on Diwali or on the following few days,"" Dr Ashok Kumar of Centre Point Pet Hospital Pvt Ltd said./Dogs tend to get disturbed and bark incessantly or they start running helter- skelter, and end up getting hit by vehicles./Animal welfare activists have written to the deputy commissioner to issue orders to reduce the intensity of fireworks. They say that while many animals fall sick, several animals also run away from homes looking for more peaceful places./""The nervous system of animals is fragile like those of newborns or the elderly. Cows are not able to produce milk for several days after the festival. We cannot even count the number of pets lost as most such cases are not reported,"" Amita Singh, founder of an animal welfare NGO, Walk for Animals and Habitat, said./She said several g roups were working in Delhi-NCR to build awareness towards the needs of animals. Many animal welfare groups are sharing Diwali greetings asking people to avoid the use of crackers./With Diwali just three days away, pet parents are making arrangements to keep their pets away from the noise and air pollution resulting from fireworks and other celebrations. While some residents have arranged for earplugs and will refrain from bursting crackers, others are using anti-stress medications./""Cats start trembling with fear and remain frightened for a whole next week. The smoke scares them more as they think there is a fire in the vicinity,"" said Vandana, who is a pet parent to five cats, said./Vandana has made an enclosure in her backyard where the cats usually spend their time. However, they got scared during Diwali last year and ran inside the house for shelter, hiding under tables and chairs, she said. She added that she will keep them indoors from a day before the festival and use herbal anti-stress medications to calm them./Pe t p a re n t s a d d e d t h at handling pets during Diwali becomes difficult.

Haze maze: Finding a way forward,"Chandigarh, Nov. 8 -- The smoke, spread over the skies of north India and also threatening the environs of South Asia, is billowing out of agriculture farms in the country's food bowl states - Punjab and Haryana./Though it's not a new phenomenon, its harmful effects on environment, human health and productivity have raised serious concern. The governments of the two states have been trying to curb the illegal bi-annual practice, but their efforts have been dwarfed by the enormity of the problem so far./The reason: The Centre and the state governments spring into action when the seasonal problem surfaces and then lose interest when the smog settles down. There is no long-term strategy to find a solution as farmers continue to put their paddy and wheat crop residue on fire, causing severe air pollution.

It involves an expenditure of '100 crore and active support of Union ministry of environment and forests. Currently, to collect the stubble and use it for economic benefit is a huge challenge,"" says BS Sidhu, Punjab agriculture commissioner. The plan envisages mechanised collection of crop residue from across the state. ""We are working on a mechanism to incentivise farmers so that they feel encouraged to retain stubble for soil improvement and partly collect it for economic gains,"" he said./As per the plan, service providers are to be engaged to manage stubble and support the farmers economically. The state government feels farmers have to be given 100% subsidy without being expected to contribute anything and has conveyed the same to the Union ministry. While the plan has remained on paper so far, its implementation is going to be crucial because other initiatives of the authorities have not generated the anticipated response./The Punjab government gives subsidy on farm implements and machinery such as the 'happy seeder', baler, zero till and chopper-cum-shredder to encourage farmers to stop burning their crop residue. However, not many farmers have opted for such equipment. The reasons are obvious. Reeling under crop failures and dwindling returns, farmers don't have the financial muscle to invest and thus choose the easiest option. ""The prime reason for continued stubble burning is lack of access to new-age machinery. Rural cooperative societies also don't have such equipment in sufficient numbers. The governments need to make these available to farmers,"" said Mahesh Kumar Narang, agricultural engineer, farm machinery./In Haryana too, the response to schemes for subsidy on such advanced implements has been tepid.

Excessive exposure can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular ailments./The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) forecast an estimated air quality index of 203 - this indicates 'poor' air pollution levels - this Diwali, posing health risks to Mumbaiites and especially those predisposed to asthma and bronchitis./Read more: Firecrackers create less noise now, finds report/""The current air quality levels are expected to increase as hot winds coming from the land are suspended over the city and are not being absorbed by the ocean. This is allowing the finer pollutant particles to dangle in the air. This, mixed with pollutants released by firecrackers, will result in 'poor' air quality for Mumbai during Diwali,"" said Gufran Beig, scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune and project director, SAFAR./Pollutants were monitored at 10 locations in Mumbai. ""Pollutants are likely to be generated primarily from firecrackers as meteorological conditions are clear. Gaseous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide released from crackers can pose a threat to people sensitive to air pollution,"" said Neha S Parkhi, senior programme officer, SAFAR and IITM, Pune./""PM2.5 is one of the smallest pollutants and when mixed with chemicals from firecrackers will penetrate deeper into the lungs and is extremely harmful for young children and senior citizens. Diseases like asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis [inflammation of lung tissue], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis are all after-effects of these pollutants,"" Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist (chest specialist), Lilavati Hospital in Bandra./SAFAR calculates location-wise AQI under a system jointly conceived and developed by IITM, BMC and IMD, Mumbai./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

It's time we refuse to end up chokers,"New Delhi, Nov. 9 -- It is that week of the year. Public advisories have been issued. The city government has asked the legislators to persuade their electorate to not burst crackers. The message is loud and clear: Don't turn Delhi into a mass gas chamber on the festival of lights./Every year, authorities make a similar pitch. Every year, it falls on deaf ears. Scanning the Diwali night pollution data for the last five years, Hindustan Times last month wrote that the festival was becoming increasingly polluted. Delhi environment department chief lamented how public appeals made all these years had absolutely no impact. ""The awareness is there but it has not translated into action,"" he told HT./Why do we need so much coaxing and urging to stop doing something we know is bad for us? Delhi's skies are already soot grey. Almost every other child today requires medical help for breathing problems. Many suffering from the seasonal flu - traditionally blamed on the change in weather - are taking longer to recover. Patients have suffered relapses. Doctors say rising levels of air pollution in Delhi are suppressing our immunity, making us vulnerable to lung infections and cancer. Studies collated by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) show that air pollution-related diseases caused more than 3,000 premature deaths every year./The toxic smoke from Delhi's massive fleet of vehicles, roundthe-clock emissions from coalfired power plants, and dust from the city's numerous construction sites are already filling up our lungs. We have to be suicidal to willingly make it worse./In case you didn't know, the fireworks you light up on Diwali are the worst possible cocktail of toxins. It is the gunpowder that fuels them up. Harmful metals add colour to the explosions. The dazzles of whites in the fireworks are created by burning up aluminium that affects the brain and lungs. The blazing red is released from lithium and strontium. High exposure to this can hamper bone growth among infants. Fireworks often contain carcinogenic or hormonedisrupting substances that can get absorbed by soil and water./The onset of winter is anyway a bad time for lungs in Delhi. Just ahead of Diwali, farmers across north India start burning stubble to clear land for cultivation. If it is not windy enough, the fumes from farm fires, coupled with Delhi's vehicular pollution, lace the air with deadly particles fine enough to sit deep in lungs and blood tissues./Many discount Diwali as a temporary one-day phenomenon. But can Delhi, rated one of the world's most polluted capitals, afford the indulgence? No religious excuse can justify environmentally disastrous rituals like clogging and polluting water bodies with idols, or turning the air foul with sulphur and gunpowder smoke./Recently, the Delhi high court has also asked people for restraint. ""Diwali, though called a festival of lights, has religious context only in illuminating the buildings traditionally with diyas (earthen lamps). There is nothing to suggest that bursting of firecrackers is related to any religious tenet,"" the court noted./A binding legal order, however, is unlikely in India. Last month, the Supreme Court refused to ban bursting of crackers during Diwali or direct authorities to earmark designated places for it, saying it was not possible to issue orders that cannot be implemented./For inspiration though, we would not have to look far. Shanghai cut the city's number of authorised firework sellers by 400. Hangzhou, a historic Chinese city near Shanghai, cancelled its annual New Year fireworks display, the Guardian reported last January./The same year, Beijing introduced a regulation requiring people who buy five or more boxes of fireworks to register with an official ID. The city decided it would halt fireworks sales altogether if the pollution rose to dangerous levels, the news report stated./But back home, we are resigned to traditions. In the run-up to Diwali, we were already holding our breath - as much for the Bihar verdict as in anticipation of the fireworks that would inevitably follow./Be it for a cricket match win or an election triumph or Diwali, it is time we refuse to end up chokers./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Have a blast with 'no sound and no smoke' crackers!,"Lucknow, Nov. 9 -- To cash in on the craze for an eco-friendly Diwali, manufacturers have come up with a new range of indoor crackers this season. Named after kids' favourite online networking services - 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'Whatsapp', 'Bluetooth', etc - these crackers are selling like hot cakes./Apart from the names, the 'no sound and no smoke' aspect of these crackers is attracting the customers. Mohd Farid, a dealer in the Rastogi College cracker market, said: ""People are aware about the noise and air pollution aspects of the crackers and thus they are now avoiding regular crackers. In such a case, while the sale of crackers has been affected, such new products are catching the fancy of youngsters.""/The new range of crackers produce mild sound and for the colour & light effect, they produce some colourful paper strips, sparkle etc./Gulsher Azad, a dealer, said, ""This is an era of innovation and thus to sustain in the market, we too have to indulge in creativity. There was a time when people demanded crackers that produced loud sound. But priorities have changed over the years.""/The other merit of the new collection of crackers is also the minimal risk factor involved in its use. ""Unlike the bigger crackers where children need to be accompanied by elders for safety reasons, these crackers are more of poppers and involve minimal risk,"" added Azad./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Patiala needs to hold pole position for least pollution: PPCB,"Patiala, Nov. 10 -- The slump in economy and increased awareness on harmful effects of crackers has made at least one institution happy, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB)./The PPCB, which conducts a survey of five major cities across the state every year on two broad parameters - the air pollution level and the noise pollution - expects a cleaner Diwali, especially in Patiala, as the royal city has a record of being among the less polluted among Patiala, Mandi Gobindgarh, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar./PPCB engineer Charanjeet Singh said, ""Over the past two-three years, pollution has seen a dip. Most of the credit for this goes to efforts by the school in spreading awareness against crackers. We expect the trend to continue this year,"" he added./What is measured and how?/PPCB fits its equipment and gives the public the broad idea of how polluted the cities are on two broad parameters. These are Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) for air and sound level in decibels./Even as Patiala might be a little better than its competition of these criteria, but its air and sound pollution also far exceeds the permissible level./RSPM refers to the term used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air./Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so small they can only be detected using an electron microscope./Pollution caused due to these is measured in terms of what is their concentration per cubic metre of air as in the more the concentration, the more harm these pollutants can cause./Typically, air in which the concentration of these particulates is less than 100 micrograms is clean and is considered not polluted. A microgram is very small unit of matter and is 1 gm divided into 10 lakh parts./Remembers, these are the particles that we can actually inhale and thus has a direct adverse impact on our lungs./For RSPM, the PPCB will update data every 8 hours on Wednesday by checking the emission of gases, including sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide regularly. These are among the main gases that are considered to be among the main RPSM gases and are the most harmful./Monitoring devices have been installed separately in residential, commercial and sensitive areas in each of these five cities./Officials will calculate the data from Friend's colony, Focal Point and Rajindra Hospital in Patiala. The figures recorded will be made public by the end of the week, officials said./What does noise level mean?/In terms of noise we usually encounter in normal life, a sound between 101-125 dB is considered extremely loud./110 decibels and over is the level at which other sounds can't really be heard. Aircraft takeoff, trains, and very loud concerts would fall into the 110+ decibels./At decibels 125+, the sound is painful and this is the sound that is produced when a rocket takes off. Anything above 90dB requires the use of earplugs./MP appeals for safe Diwali/Patiala Member of Parliament Dharamvira Gandhi appealed the city residents to celebrate a pollution-free Diwali. There are cases where people especially in old age has suffered heart problems during excess smoke. ""Diwali is a festival of lights, not of crackers. People, therefore, should resist bursting crackers, he added./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Residents of DLF 5 complain against construction noise,"Gurgaon, Nov. 11 -- Residents of The Icon, an upscale condominium in DLF 5, are irked over the ongoing construction and digging work for a school site on the Golf Course Road. The land is owned by the Ambience Group./""The loud noises at the construction site have made our life miserable. Work continues on full swing even in the night,"" said Aarti, a resident of The Icon./The residents also alleged non- compliance of constructions norms put down by the National Green Tribunal. ""There is regular movement of vehicles at night, off loading of construction material, uploading of mud and use of machinery that causes a lot of noise./Besides, no sprinklers have been installed at the site to control air pollution. There is already so much haze and air pollution these days. Dust rising out of the construction site makes it difficult for us to step out even in the balcony,"" said a 61-year-old resident of The Icon, on the condition of anonymity./In April, the NGT had given directions to stop construction on Golf Course Road if 2010 MoEF (Ministry of Environment and Forest) guidelines are not followed./The residents said that they continue to face issues due to the pollution caused by construction dust despite the order. Another resident, Karuna, said, ""The school construction site has become a major source of pollution in the area. It lies between The Icon and The Pinnacle so more than 700 families are forced to live amid dust and pollution,"" she informed./Meanwhile, an official spokesperson of the Ambience Group said, ""We have already given strict instructions to the workers not to carry out any construction at night. Sprinklers can be installed only after the digging work is completed.

Increase in Gurgaon's PM10 level confuses pollution board,"Gurgaon, Nov. 14 -- The sharp increase in the suspended particulate matter or the PM10 level on the night of Diwali has baffled officials from the pollution control board, who are now looking into the causes for its sudden rise./Respirable suspended particle (RSP), particles with a diameter of 10 micrometres or less, are known as PM10./According to officials, less use of fire crackers is apparent from the noise pollution data as well as the level of air pollution./However, at 361 micrograms per cubic metre (micro g/m3), the PM10 levels recorded in the city were 3.5 times more than the permissible level of 100 micro g/m3. This figure, pollution control board officials said, was not congruent with the other figures./""We are investigating how PM10 level could have shot up while the other parameters remained low. We have some theories but cannot pinpoint a definite cause. This is because all other air as well as noise pollution indicators show much less use of crackers,"" said Vijay Chowdhary, assistant environmental engineer, HSPCB./He added that as per reports, sale of smaller crackers that burst near the ground was more than that of bigger ones that burst in the air. This may have been one of the reasons for the increased PM10 level./""Very few crackers with light and sound effects were sold this year. The smaller crackers such as flower pots, sparklers and chakris that are lit close to the ground were the favourites. They produce more smoke. This could be one of the reasons for increased PM10,"" said Chowdhary./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Gurgaon.

Pollution levels shoot up a day after Diwali,"umbai, Nov. 14 -- A day after Diwali, air pollution levels skyrocketed across the city with an air quality index (AQI) of 313 on Thursday falling under the 'very poor' category, indicating a likely rise in respiratory ailments./According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Mumbai recorded 'poor' air quality levels on the Diwali night with an AQI of 279. On Friday, AQI levels dropped from Thursday's high to 298 that indicated an increase in respiratory symptoms for sensitive individuals, children and senior citizens./""We saw pollution levels peak between Wednesday night and Thursday morning between 12am and 4am owing to three reasons - low temperatures, drop in wind speed (calm winds) and pollutants from firecrackers. As a result, the layer where the pollutants mix was closer to the atmosphere, thus, pushing the AQI up to 313 on Thursday,"" said Gufran Beig, scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, and project director, SAFAR./Beig added that there was a marginal drop in AQI levels on Friday as winds from the sea picked up speed, dispersing pollutants that were close to the earth's surface./Over the past three days, the city saw a significant increase in fine particulate matter - PM2.5 and PM10. These are small particles between the size of 2.5 microns and 10 microns that are dangerous as they enter deep into the lungs and also the bloodstream./With a safety limit of 60 microgrammes per cubic metre (mu g/m3), Mumbai recorded nearly twice the permissible limit of PM2.5 levels at 114mu g/m3 on Diwali day. A day after, it rose to a whopping 136mug/m3. On Friday, however, it dropped to 120mug/m3./Similarly, for PM10, Mumbai recorded 170mu g/m3 on Diwali day, 206mug/m3 a day after Diwali and 184mu g/m3 on Friday, as against the permissible limit of 100mu g/m3./""The smaller the particles, the easier they are to inhale. Children and senior citizens are particularly vulnerable. Being slightly larger, PM10 particles get lodged into the nose, ear or throat, while PM2.5 particles get deposited into our lungs,"" said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist (chest-specialist), Lilavati Hospital, Bandra./""Asthma, bronchitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchitis are all after effects of these pollutants,"" Mehta said./Other gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were not affected by the firecrackers and were well within the permissible limits, said Beig./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Over 100 burn cases darken Diwali,"JAIPUR, Nov. 14 -- More than 100 cases of burn injuries and over 80 fire accidents were reported from across the city during Diwali celebrations./The Sawai Man Singh Hospital alone received 86 burn cases on Wednesday and 13 more the day after, Dr Jagdish Modi, in-charge of emergency department at the hospital said. A total of 11 patients were admitted to the hospital with serious injuries, he informed adding that the patients who were admitted to the hospital belonged to all age group./According to sources, scores of burn injury cases were reported in other hospitals across the city, which took the total number burn injury cases to over 100./Meanwhile, chief fire officer, Sanjay Sharma, told HT that fire broke out at over 80 places from Diwali evening till Friday morning, but no major incident was reported. ""Most of the incidents were minor and were controlled on time. No one received injuries in these incidents,"" he added./""This Diwali has been peaceful in comparison to last 10 years. Of the 80 fire incidents, in 30 cases crackers had flared up garbage. In four to five cases vehicles caught fire due to over heating or short circuit. In one case a grocery shop in Mahesh Nagar had caught fire, though minor loss was reported,"" Sharma said. The chief fire officer said that two fire accidents were also reported from the Walled City areas. ""There had been no major incidents as the fire department was vigilant and without any delay the vehicles were rushed. In total, 35 fire tending vehicles were prepared for any incident,"" he said./Jaipur police commissioner Srinivas Rao Janga confirmed that Diwali celebration across the city was largely peaceful. ""Additional policemen were deployed in order to maintain law and order,"" he said./In 2014, seven people were killed in a fire that broke out in a shop selling firecrackers in Balotra area of Barmer district on Diwali eve. Over 100 people were injured and 52 fire incidents were reported in Jaipur on Diwali last year./20% INCREASE IN BRONCHITIS PATIENTS/Air pollution caused by firecrackers this Diwali led to a rise of 20% in number of people suffering from pollution- related bronchitis in the city./According to experts, the rise was due to heavy use of crackers that had less noise but produced high fume. ""About 50 patients have been coming here every day since Diwali... The number this year is nearly 20-25% more than previous years,"" Dr Narendra Khippal, professor at the Institute of Respiratory Diseases, SMS Government Medical College, said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution over Diwali exceeds last year's levels,"umbai, Nov. 17 -- Air pollution caused by fine particles spiked in the runup to Diwali this year, exceeding levels recorded in the corresponding period last year, according to data from the state pollution control board's air monitoring station at Bandra. Meanwhile, pollution caused by oxides of nitrogen (NOx) fell gradually from November 9 to 13, but even at its lowest point, NOx pollution was well above the permissible limit./On Diwali day, Mumbai saw a sharp rise in fine particulate matter - PM2.5 and PM10. Particulate matter less than 10 microns in size is considered dangerous as it can go deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, while NOx is responsible for many respiratory infections./""Pollutants emitted from firecrackers are the main cause of the rise, especially for PM10 levels. PM2.5 and NOx levels were above permissible limits on all five days as a result of heavy traffic and low temperatures,"" said SC Kollur, scientific officer, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board./The permissible limit for PM2.5 particles is 60 microgrammes per cubic metre (mu g/m3) but Mumbai recorded almost twice that - 116mu g/m3 - on Diwali day. PM2.5 levels before and after Diwali were lower than that, but still above the permissible limit. For comparison, the PM2.5 level on Diwali day last year was 90mug/m3. Similarly, Mumbai's PM10 level was 186mug/ m3 on Diwali day this year, well above the permissible limit of 100 mu g/m3 and higher than last year's level of 163mu g/m3./Sanjeev Mehta, chest specialist at Lilavati Hospital in Bandra, said, ""Asthma, bronchitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis are all caused by these pollutants, with children and senior citizens most at risk.""/NOx levels fell from 164mu g/m3 on November 9 to 109mu g/m3 on November 13, but remained above the permissible limit of 80mu g/m3./""NOx is an important constituent of particulate matter and is released by automobiles, power plants, off-road equipment and firecrackers. The chemical irritates the lungs and lowers resistance to respiratory infections,"" said Kollur./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gurgaon pollution takes a toll on the lungs of senior govt officials,"New Delhi, Nov. 19 -- High levels of air pollution in the National Capital Region have seriously affected the lungs of senior government officials in Gurgaon, says a survey./The results of the lung function tests conducted by a private hospital on 100 officials showed 68% officials suffered from shortness of breath to varying degrees, 57% had below normal lung capacity and 48% had lung function suggestive of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which results in shortness of breath and breathing trouble./The senior officials whose lungs were tested include the deputy commissioner, additional deputy commissioner, all sub-divisional magistrates and officials from the Haryana Urban Development Authority, public health, electricity, revenue and several other departments. The mean age of the officials was 31 years./The tests were done last month and the results were released on World COPD Day on Wednesday./Most officials were not even aware of the problems./""The survey results are certainly shocking. We hope that the survey shall serve as an eyeopener for the people as well as healthcare stakeholders who will help point out the extent of the problem and importance of raising awareness on the same,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, head of department, respiratory critical care, Artemis Hospital, who was part of the group that conducted the survey./A total of 21% respondents reported cough at least few days every month and 8% said they couldn't exercise properly because of breathing trouble./Air pollution, both trafficrelated and indoor air pollution, caused by second-hand smoking and burning wood, coal for cooking, mosquito coils and incense sticks can cause COPD./Apart from air pollution, respiratory problems were compounded by the high smoking rate in Haryana. The lack of enforcement of the ban on smoking in public places aggravated the problem./According to Gurgaon deputy commissioner TL Satyaprakash, ""When cities grow as part of old cities such as Delhi, the problems remain the same throughout. However, we realise that there is a need to increase attention on healthcare. The Indian government has been promoting yoga and that seems to be one of the best solutions. As a city and nation, we should work towards such solutions.""/""In Haryana, hookah smoking is part of culture and starts at an early age in rural areas. Besides, the use of biomass fuel for cooking raises the risk of respiratory issues in women,"" said Dr Garg./According to World Health Organisation estimates, 65 million people have moderate to severe COPD. Rough estimates suggest that there are 30 million COPD patients in India./""The survey raises serious questions on outdoor as well as indoor air quality of Gurgaon. Despite this, very little attention has been paid to the respiratory diseases by the authorities and the medical community,"" said Dr Pratibha Dogra, consultant pulmonologist at Artemis Hospital./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Winters, air pollution add to woes of Delhiites","New Delhi, Nov. 23 -- Sore throat, highgrade fever, runny nose and chest congestion, with mercury seeing a sharp dip and level of air-pollution being on the rise, Delhiites are battling typical symptoms of seasonal flu these days./According to the doctors, nearly 90% of their patients are suffering from high-grade fever - 102 degree C and above and runny nose - these days. However, the illness mostly starts with a sore throat./Also, many people complain of severe head ache and body ache, and owing to high pollution levels in the city cough also sets in after a couple of days./""We usually start getting cases with flu-like symptoms in the months of October and November each year, and this year is no exception. Last one week has been particularly bad, with a significant rise in the number of flu cases,"" said Dr Srikant Sharma, medicine specialist at Moolchand Hospital./""The pollution only makes the symptoms worse as people tend to develop secondary bacterial infection that needs a course of antibiotics and takes longer time to treat,"" says Dr Sharma./It took two weeks for twentyone-year-old Kritika Kumar's, cough to subside./""My doctor put me on antibiotics when my phlegm changed colour, but despite that my symptoms remained for nearly two weeks. I still feel tightness in chest sometimes,"" says a postgraduate student from Delhi University, who suspects having caught the infection from her roommate who had also been down with sore throat and runny nose./However, most of the viral infections that result in highfever are self-limiting and do not require medicines. At most doctors prescribe symptomatic treatment and warn against use of antibiotics till the disease is limited to the upper respiratory tract. If the infection goes down to the lungs and leads to bronchitis or pneumonia, then it will require antibiotics to treat the disease./""We usually prescribe symptomatic treatment to bring down fever and decongestant drugs. It also helps to drink plenty of warm fluids such as soups, herbal tea, etc to keep the body well-hydrated as fever tends to dehydrate the body,"" said Dr RK Singal, director, internal medicine, BLK Super-Speciality Hospital./The worst-affected in this weather are children, people above 65 years of age and those with compromised immunity, owing to underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, HIV, heart disease, tuberculosis, liver disease, etc./""This group needs to be extra careful and see a doctor immediately after developing symptoms,"" says Dr Singal./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

How each of us can help clean the air in Delhi,"India, Nov. 23 -- The Centre, the civic agencies and the AAP government in Delhi rarely converge. But for the cause of a cleaner Capital, CM Arvind Kejriwal and city's three mayors came together.

What the CM didn't mention was how these waste dumps were also choking us./A research released by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health on November 18 found that higher levels of coarse particles in the air was leading to an increase in cardiovascular-related hospitalisations such as for heart attacks in people 65 and older in the United States./The researchers said this was so far the strongest evidence to show that coarse particulate matter (sized 2.5 to 10 microns in diametre) released into the air from construction projects among other things were extremely harmful for humans. Until now, the pollution studies had focused only on smaller particles released from automobile exhaust or power plants that could damage the lungs and enter the bloodstream./If construction dust is a killer, Delhi must be very worried. Our city has an amazing appetite for the brick and mortar. Delhi generates at least 4,000 tonnes of construction debris every day and only 10% of it is recycled. The rest is dumped just anywhere. Today, much of Delhi's soil is made of construction dust. And, as Johns Hopkins research shows, it doesn't just sit on the ground./Not only construction waste, almost 10% of the 10,000 tonnes of garbage Delhi generates every day ends up on its streets. It either lies on the roadside, clogs drains in the monsoon or is burnt somewhere. If the mid-morning air around you smells of something burning, it is certainly from a pyre of garbage and leaves in the vicinity. For residents, this is the quickest way of getting their trash out of sight. For sweepers who are supposed to carry garbage and garden waste to the community dumpsters or a composting pit, it is simply less work./Common discards such as synthetics, plastics, metals, and packaging material emanates poisonous chemical compounds and gases such as dioxins, arsenic, lead, mercury, furans, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and hydrochloric acid. Inhaling this smoke can cause irritation or trigger an asthma attack. Long-term exposure can lead to respiratory problems, cancer, birth defects and liver problems./In April this year, the National Green Tribunal banned burning of garbage in open and directed authorities in Delhi and NCR to impose a fine of Rs 5,000 on anyone caught burning garbage, leaves and garden waste, plastic, rubber out in open areas. But much like the garbage, the ban has gone up in smoke./As much as it is an enforcement issue, Delhi's cleanliness is also the responsibility of its citizens. We complain about air pollution but never feel accountable for it. It is always someone else's car fouling up the air or someone else's waste choking up the neighbourhood./The government's clean-up strategy has so far remained mostly on paper mainly because it focuses predominantly on long-term, capital-intensive solutions.

"Rising air pollution increases risk of lung cancer, say docs","Lucknow, Nov. 25 -- While air pollution was always known to be a leading cause of respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and coronary heart disease, doctors say the deteriorating air quality in our cities has also shown an increase in incidence of lung cancer./As the Lucknow Cancer Institute observes Lung Cancer Awareness Month, senior consultant Dr Vivek Garg, says there has been a steady rise in lung cancer in India in the past decade, and experts were now focusing on the changing trends in the disease's patterns and its leading risk factors./""While smoking and exposure to tobacco remains the leading cause of lung cancer, another emerging risk factor is the dangerous mix of air pollutants breathed in daily, especially among the urban population. The Global Burden of Disease Project 2010 attributed an estimated 3.2 million deaths worldwide to air pollution, including 223,000 to lung cancer,"" he said./Lung cancer is among the top five cancers prevalent in both men and women across the world. World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 1.59 million global deaths every year to lung cancer. In India, an estimated 63,000 new lung cancer cases are reported annually with a slim five-year survival rate of 10-15% patients. Lung cancer causes an estimated 6.8 deaths per 1000 population in India./According to estimates made by the Indian Council of Medical Research's national cancer registry programme, almost 90% of patients with lung cancer showed a history of tobacco exposure. Of the total number, 87% men and 85% women were active smokers, while 3 % of the patients had a history of passive exposure./""There is little doubt that smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. However, in recent years we are coming across a lot of patients who have never smoked. Pulmonologists in cities with high air pollution levels frequently talk about the effects of poisonous air on the respiratory system of residents. Now, there is growing evidence that the dangerous mix of pollutants in our air also increases risk of lung cancer. Urban air contains many known carcinogens (cancer causing agents) such as suspended particulate, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, among others. These components are believed to trigger cancerous mutation in the body's cells,"" says Dr Garg./The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has already declared outdoor air pollution, including diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals, and dust, as a carcinogen./""While there is no such comprehensive study in India linking air pollution to increasing lung cancer, clinical evidence suggests that this factor might be increasing people's risk. Despite bans on public smoking and pictorial warnings, the numbers of smokers is India is considerably high. Unfortunately, a large number of people in India, especially women and children, are exposed to second hand smoke. When combined with smoking, and exposure to second hand tobacco, air pollution tends to highly magnify the risk of lung cancer. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer becomes considerably high,"" adds Dr Garg./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Scientists for Euro and Bharat stage like norms for crackers,"Kolkata, Nov. 25 -- If vehicles can have emission norms why can't polluting fireworks? With air pollution levels shooting up by at least 300%-400% on the night of Kali Puja and Diwali, particularly in the city's residential areas because of fireworks and crackers, a section of the city's environment activists, lawyers and pollution control board officials are now advocating for setting emission standard for polluting fireworks on the lines of Euro and Bharat stage emission norms for vehicles./""The pollution level on the night of Kali Puja and Diwali had shot up to dangerous levels. It was many times higher than the permissible limits,"" said Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board./Here is a glimpse of what happened that day. According to data available with the state pollution control board, the level of PM 2.5 (the finest and most harmful of all polluting particles that float in the air) was hovering around 57 micrograms per cubic metre on November 5 (a normal weekday) in Kolkata. It shot up to 146 on November 11 and to 193 on November 12. The permissible limit is 60./In some areas the scene was much worse. The bigger-sized polluting particles (PM 10) shot up to 747 micrograms per cubic metre on November 11 from around 171 micrograms per cubic metre on November 5 at Jorasanko area in north Kolkata where the pollution control board's one of the automatic air quality monitoring station is located./These shocking details have galvanised a number of scientists, lawyers, environment activists and pollution control board officials now discussing the feasibility of developing an emission standard for fireworks./""Even though there are noise ceilings for the firecrackers, there aren't any such norms to control pollution as far as fireworks are concerned. Some fireworks cause heavy pollutions. No one is against fireworks. But just as there are norms to control pollution from automobiles (Euro and Bharat stage norms), there has to be a mechanism to control pollution from fireworks too,"" said Biswajit Mukherjee, former chief law officer of the state pollution control board./The Union ministry of road transport and highways has announced earlier this year that mass emission standards Bharat Stage IV (BS IV) will come into force across the country from April 1, 2017. Bharat stage emission standards are emission standards instituted by the government to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engine equipment, including motor vehicles./""Not all fireworks cause pollution. But there are some which cause heavy sound and air pollution. While there is a ban on crackers producing noise more than 90 decibels, it is high time to bring in some legislation for fireworks which trigger heavy pollution,"" said Subhas Dutta, environmental activist./Dutta also plans to take the matter up at the ""appropriate level"". Usually petitions against environment pollutions in the state are filed in the National Green Tribunal's eastern bench in Kolkata which has powers equivalent to the Calcutta high court./A firework manufacturer at Haral in Champahati in South 24-Parganas, a hub of firework manufacturers, revealed that metals and compounds such as aluminum, antimony sulphide, barium nitrate, copper compounds, potassium nitrate are used to prepare the fireworks./""While aluminum produces brilliant white lights, barium nitrate produce glittering green lights and copper compounds produces blue lights. In Chinese fireworks potassium chlorate is used as a propellant which produces a trail of smoke. Rangmashals, tubris, shaap baji, electric tar causes more smoke than others,"" said a firework manufacturer./Eminent pulmonologist Dr AG Ghosal said: ""In a bid to prevent sound pollution we have forgotten about air pollution during Diwali. Levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide shot up after Kali Puja. Children and senior citizens and patients with chronic pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis, COPD and asthma are the worst sufferers.

"Vehicular smoke chokes Delhi in winter, dust major summer killer","New Delhi, Nov. 25 -- What is polluting Delhi's air? A study on Delhi's air quality conducted by IITKanpur over two years has revealed that vehicle exhaust chokes our lungs in winter. In summer, it is the fumes from the coal-fired power plants, the fly ash they release and dust from roads and construction sites./IIT-Kanpur recently submitted the first draft of its ""source apportionment study"" commissioned by the Delhi environment department in 2011 to understand the causes of air pollution in Delhi so that suitable action could be taken. The final report is expected soon./""Source appor tionment studies helps in identifying the exact source of pollution and the extent of its contribution. The study has covered pollution in both summer and winter and has been done by monitoring air quality in north, south, east, west and central Delhi between August 2013 and September 2015,"" a senior environment department official told Hindustan Times./The draft, according to Delhi Pollution Control Committee sources, said that in winter vehicular emission and secondary particulates (particles that form in the atmosphere from other gaseous pollutants, particularly sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds) constitute 60% of the pollutants. Around 30% is caused due to biomass, garbage and leaf burning. The remaining is dust./""In summer, however, coal and fly ash contribute around 30% while road and construction dust cause 25% pollution. Vehicles and secondary particles contribute 25% while garbage, leaf, crop stubble and dried cow dung burning another 18%,"" said a DPCC official. This is the first-of-its-kind study done specifically for Delhi./Environment department officials said combating air pollution was quite difficult in the absence of a clear policy framework and this study, once finalised, would help frame a policy for a city./The study focused on what had caused the rise of pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, suspended particulate matter and nitrous oxides. It studied how industries, vehicles, burning of waste and leaves and construction dust contributed in increasing the air pollution./""Earlier studies didn't focus on secondary particles. Primary sources cause particle pollution on their own, while secondary sources let off gases that can form particles after reacting with the atmosphere.

In winter, it is the biggest polluting source.

'START EARLY TO AVOID TRAFFIC',"Lucknow, Nov. 29 -- I start from my house in Vikas Nagar early in the morning just to avoid traffic congestion at Khurram Nagar, Tedhi Pulia, Munshipulia, and Polytechnic. They are major bottlenecks from my house to the hospital in Gomti Nagar,"" says Dr Vaibhav Khanna, a microvascular surgeon. Besides these bottlenecks, traffic congestion is also intense at Daliganj railway underpass, IT crossing, Chowk crossing, Aminabad, Novelty crossing, and on the stretch of road near Kaiserbagh bus station. With the city growing rapidly, the number of vehicles has also increased significantly. Until March 2015, 17,09,662 vehicles were registered in Lucknow. In terms of public transport, the city has around 300 public city buses, in addition to 4,343 autos and 2,575 tempos. ""Reaching Chowk from my office in Aliganj takes over an hour by car, even if I takes different routes. I need to travel during the entire day and the dust that gets inside my car despite keeping the windows closed means I have to definitely clean it every week,"" says Milan, an engineer./Chronic respiratory illness is on the rise among Lucknowites, especially children and the elderly as air pollution levels remain higher than the permissible limits for the eight consecutive year. At least 100 cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) get admitted in an emergency condition every month to King George's Medical University (KGMU) alone. ""Collectively, I see over 500 cases of COPD Asthma in a month in my OPD, a respiratory problem that troubles three crore people across India,"" says Dr Surya Kant, president Indian Chest Society and Head of Department pulmonary medicine at KGMU. Air pollution is not the only concern, Uttar Pradesh has the highest rate of road accidents in the country with Lucknow's roads emerging as the most dangerous in the last eight years. According to the National Crime Record Bureau's (NCRB) 2014 report, nearly 62.5% (16,284) of the 26,064 accidents that occurred in UP resulted in the death of the victims./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

ARE YOU TIRED AND DON'T KNOW WHY?,"New Delhi, Nov. 29 -- Too exhausted to get out of bed to face the day? Most people blame it on insomnia and disrupted sleep, which may well be the case, but sleeplessness is just one of the many factors that turns you into a grumpy gnome at the thought of getting started each day./Sleeplessness could be a sign of stress, sleep apnea and/or depression, and persistent, relapsing fatigue after six to eight hours of sleep could be indicate an undiagnosed disease such as diabetes, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), cancers, or congestive heart failure, among others./For most of us, however, the underlying causes triggering chronic tiredness are lifestyle-related and can be managed, with or without prescription medicines./MENTAL STRAIN/Emotional stress and frustration can leave you physically exhausted, reported a study in published online in the journal Human Factors. The study found that overloading the brain and body simultaneously activates the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain that controls complex thought and decisionmaking. Too much stress on it fatigues you faster./Under stress, adrenalin peaks and raises heart rate and blood pressure, tenses muscles and makes breathing rapid and shallow. The hormone cortisol stimulates the release of energy, flooding the body with glucose, fatty acids and amino acids. Prolonged stress, however, forces the body to cope with this heightened state of physical stress, making it collapse as soon as your guard drops./POLLUTION/Air pollution can make you lethargic and forgetful and lowers productivity. Apart from irritating the airways and lungs and causing asthma and lung diseases, PM10 (fine particle matter, dust, soot) and ozone destroy red blood cells and lower the body's oxygen-carrying capacity, starving the brain, muscles and organs. The resultant exhaustion is compounded by complex interactions between SO2, CO and NO2, reported researchers in the International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics, in June./Among the indoor air pollutants that cause fatigue are secondhand smoke, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds, which include chemicals found in paints, cleaning agents, pesticides, air fresheners, and building material./ANAEMIA/Fatigue is the most common symptom of anaemia, which occurs when your body does not have enough haemoglobin - the iron-containing protein in red blood cells - to carry oxygen from the lungs. Even mild anaemia makes you tired, sluggish, forgetful and absentminded./If the deficiency is not acute, an ironrich diet is enough to push haemoglobin levels over the recommended 13 gm/dl. Haem iron - from animal sources such as red meat, chicken liver, shrimp, oysters and eggs - have high bioavailability and are easily absorbed by the body, with 15% to 35% being utilised by the body as compared to the 2% to 10% from fortified cereals, legumes, leafy vegetables etc./Cookin g in an iron pot or pan pushes up iron content in cooked food, while Vitamin C sources - fresh lemon or citrus fruit juice, for example - raise iron absorption from vegetarian food by making the stomach more acidic. Tea, coffee, colas and other caffeine drinks lower/absorption./DEPRESSION/Fatigue is a major symptom of depressive disorders. Depressive disorders are usually accompanied with other emotional disturbance, diminished focus, word-finding difficulties, and recall problems, reports the journal Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience. The lethargy is likely to be accompanied by feelings of low self-worth, nervousness, sleeplessness, overeating or appetite loss and excessive worrying. Depression affects twice as many women as men and signs usually first appear between the ages of 15 and 30./CHRONIC FATIGUE/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, causes overwhelming, debilitating fatigue from unexplained causes. Suspected triggers include immune system gone awry, nutritional deficiencies, viral infection and metabolic abnormalities, but there is no agreement on the causes. Most people with CFS also have recurring headaches, muscles and joint pain and muscular weakness./A new study released this week reported that people with chronic fatigue have higher levels of visual stress and experienced discomfort and exhaustion from viewing repetitive striped patterns, such as when reading text. The results of the study, which is published in the journal Perception, suggest visual system abnormalities in people with CFS are an identifiable and easily measurable behavioural marker and can help in its diagnosis./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Air quality in Delhi 'hazardous', worse than Beijing","New Delhi, Dec. 1 -- Air quality in Delhi remained ""hazardous"" on Tuesday and was far worse than the choking smog over Beijing that maintained an ""orange"" pollution alert, the second-highest level, keeping students indoors and asking factories and construction sites to reduce work./However, no health advisories were issued in Delhi over the current air quality to the public./As thick smog blanketed the national capital and visibility was down to about 200 metres, leaving buildings silhouetted in the haze, the city's air quality index (AQI) remained above the dangerous 400 mark./Punjabi Bagh in western Delhi remained the most polluted with an AQI of 456 while Anand Vihar in the east that has been consistently recording bad air, registered 399 on the index. Both figures fall in the ""hazardous"" category, a condition several areas in the city have been witnessing for the past fortnight./The US embassy's monitoring station in leafy Chanakyapuri recorded an air quality index of 292, which puts air pollution levels well into ""very unhealthy"" territory./Delhi tests people's lung power much more than Beijing's choking air, although Chinese cities get more global attention for their factory and construction haze./The Indian capital has more deadly particles in the air - those smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) - which can cause more damage to the lungs./A new analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014 said 13 of the world's top 20 cities with the worst air are in India, with Delhi perched atop the pecking order. WHO data on Tuesday showed Delhi's air pollution index was 91.95, compared with Beijing's 89.09./India set new standards in 2010, in line with WHO recommendations, but the yardstick for lung-damaging fine particles is much less stringent./Air quality in Delhi is usually bad during the onset of winter when smoke from the burning of crop stubble in the neighbouring states hangs heavy over the city of 16 million. Traffic fumes add to the menace as these are trapped over the city by a temperature inversion and the lack of wind./In Beijing, authorities ordered schools to keep students indoors while factories and construction sites were told to reduce work. People complained of a smoky, pungent odor and many wore tight-fitting face masks./People in Delhi chided the government for failing to minimise the risks to their health from air pollution./""The situation is really very bad and the quality of air in the coming days is going to be the same following the smog and stagnancy in the air,"" said Vivek Chattopadhyaya of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a green think tank./(With inputs from agency)/Read More/In pics | Smog engulfs heavily polluted Beijing/Smog chokes New Delhi, Beijing ahead of Paris climate summit/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

High levels of pollution keep Kaushambi residents indoors,"GHAZIABAD, Dec. 3 -- Residential highrises in Kaushambi are surrounded by five areas that cause massive air and noise pollution. The five areas include the Kaushambi ISBT across the main road, Anand Vihar ISBT across the border, Sahibabad industrial area, Ghazipur industrial area across the NH-24 and the Ghazipur landfill area./The highrises were also in the limelight as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal lived there before moving to the CM's residence in Delhi./Heavy movement of commercial and private vehicles across the border has also led an increase in the pollution level./Besides, regular use of pressure horns by commercial vehicles has also increased noise pollution in the area./""Heavy commercial vehicles pass through the border without any pollution check.

Lucknowites inhaling poison,"Lucknow, Dec. 5 -- If the Air Quality Index of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is anything to go by, the air pollution level of Lucknow is worse than that of Delhi. The board has listed Delhi air quality as 'very poor' with index value of 321. It cites the air quality in Lucknow as 'severe,' with 408 index value./Index value is a yardstick for measuring air pollution. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern./To curb rising pollution, the Delhi government on Friday decided that vehicles with odd and even numbesr would ply on alternate days in the national capital from January 1. Will Lucknow follow suit?/In Lucknow, a total of 17,09,662 vehicles were registered till March 31, 2015. Besides, 300 city buses, 4343 autos and 2575 tempos run every day. On an average, 149281 KL petrol and diesel are sold in a year. Lucknowites use 27,74,09,09 kg CNG in a year. The increasing number of vehicles on roads has choked the city, with people gasping due to increased vehicular pollution./The I ndian I nstitute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow that monitors air pollution levels, has pointed that higher level of particulate matter may be responsible for several cardiovascular and respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, reproductive impairment, increased risk of preterm birth and even mortality and morbidity rate./The IITR report categorically recommends that all encroachments should be removed for smooth flow of traffic so that vehicles do not have to stop often on road. This will ensure less pollution from vehicles./Regional transport officer SA Ansari told Hindustan Times that his office was taking steps to curb rising vehicular pollution. ""All means of public transport in the state capital are being made CNG-driven. Pollution checking centres will be upgraded soon,"" he said. When asked if the odd and even number rule would be replicated in Lucknow, he said that such decisions could only be taken by the state government./Chronic respiratory illness is on the rise among Lucknowites, specially children and elderly, as air pollution has been higher than permissible limits for the past eight consecutive years. Statistics say at least 100 patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) alone get admitted to King George's Medical University in a month in emergency condition./""Collectively I see over 500 cases of COPD, asthma in a month in my OPD, a respiratory problem that troubles 3 crore people across India,"" said Dr Surya Kant president (elect), Indian Chest Society and HoD, pulmonary medicine at KGMU. Including number of admissions in private hospitals the figure of patients per month would cross the 400 mark, said Dr Anoop Agrawal, secretary, nursing home association./""When a vehicle stops at a signal, the driver puts it in the neutral gear but when there is a traffic bottleneck, the driver has to keep the engine at raise, oozing out more pollutants,"" said Dr Vinod Jain, a public health expert./""There are often cases when a patient is not even in a condition to be brought to hospital.

"Delhi will restrict cars from Jan 1 to cut pollution, may face challenge","New Delhi, Dec. 5 -- The Delhi government announced on Friday each private car and two-wheeler will be allowed on the city's roads only every other day from next year in a bid to even the odds stacked against authorities in their efforts to clean up the Capital's toxic air./Private vehicles will be allowed to run on the streets on alternate days depending on whether their licence plates end in even or odd numbers, the government declared a day after it faced criticism from the Delhi high court over the city's mounting pollution problem./The method, more commonly known as road space rationing, is followed in various forms across the world, though experts said implementation could prove to be a major challenge as well over two million vehicles would have to be kept off the roads every day./""We are talking about implementing this plan in a city where no one is ready to follow basic traffic rules,"" said a senior government official on condition of anonymity./The model is already in force in Beijing, which Delhi surpassed last year to be ranked as the world's most polluted city in a WHO report./The decision taken at a meeting headed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will not apply to CNG-driven buses, taxis, auto-rickshaws and emergency vehicles but will cover automobiles entering Delhi from other states./Officials say even-numbered cars will be allowed to run on even days and odd-numbered ones on odd days./A committee comprising members of the environment department, traffic police, transport department and the divisional commissioner will decide how the policy will be implemented./Till then, traffic police may get interim powers to penalise errant drivers under the new rule./The sweeping move, like the one adopted by Beijing in 2008 ahead of the Olympics, will apply to a large bulk of nearly nine million vehicles registered in Delhi, which adds about 1,500 new vehicles to its roads every day./The city's vehicular population, which causes choking jams on all weekdays, includes about 2.7 million cars./The government also announced a slew of other measures that could help curb air pollution, including stopping roadside parking to battle congestion, a improving the public transportation system and bringing cleaner fuel to the city before the rest of the country./The city also plans to shut down one of its oldest and least efficient thermal power plants. The Badarpur plant, commissioned in the early 1970s, uses outdated equipment and often breaks down./Traffic police will also be told to ensure that diesel-guzzling trucks, which transit through the city at night, enter only after 11pm. Currently trucks are allowed to enter the city at 9pm, often resulting in massive traffic jams./It was not immediately clear when the measures would take effect or exactly how long they would continue./Earlier this year the city ordered all private cars older than 10 years to be taken off the roads, becoming the second major city in the world to do so after Beijing./Last year, the World Health Organization named the Indian capital as the world's most polluted, with 12 other Indian cities ranking among the worst 20./In November and early December the city's air quality slumped to hazardous levels, with levels of PM2.5 pollutants, the very fine particles that get lodged inside the lungs and cause the most damage, soaring to 12 times above WHO's safety level of 25 micrograms per cubic meter./The city has been blanketed in grey smog, and while there is no reliable data on respiratory diseases, most doctors in the capital report a sharp spike in pollution-related illness during the winter months./Sunita Narain, director of The Center for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based research and advocacy group, said the government had responded ""to a public health emergency.""/""I would like to thank the Delhi government,"" she told reporters./The Beijing model/*Beijing started road space rationing in 2008 to curb pollution levels ahead of Olympics./*Rationing was done for two months.

"Good step, needs public support, says green brigade","New Delhi, Dec. 6 -- The Centre for Science and Environment on Saturday welcomed the Delhi government's drastic measures to cut traffic volume in the Capital in a bid to reduce toxic emission from vehicles./""These measures promise to catalyse change needed to bend the curve of ever-rising air pollution levels in the city and prevent premature deaths and illness. We also urged the Delhi government to detail out an effective implementation strategy and organise public outreach for glitch-free implementation,"" a statement from the green advocacy group said./Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE's executive director-research and advocacy and head of its air pollution control unit, said: ""Alarming trends in air pollution levels in the capital city and its devastating impacts on public health have made the city desperate for urgent solutions. Such choking peak levels demand aggressive and drastic immediate measures. Small incremental steps will not help. If the public demand for clean air has merited this action, this needs even stronger public support to make it work as well. The city has little choice when there is at least one death per hour due to air pollution related diseases and the lung of every third child is impaired.""/According to her, halving the traffic volume and cutting out coal power emissions will have a significant impact on pollution./""Already, the draft report on source apportionment submitted by the IIT Kanpur to Delhi government has shown that vehicles are the second largest emitter followed by industry and power plants. More analysis from the CSE shows that of the total particulate pollution load from vehicles in the city the personal vehicle segments - cars and two wheelers - are responsible for 87 per cent of the load,"" she said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Locals burning garbage in Pathankot in absence of disposal mechanism,"Pathankot, Dec. 7 -- No one seems to stop local residents burning their waste in the open here, which is only leading to an increase in air pollution in the town. Residents are compelled to inhale poisnous gases emanating from the burning waste./The polluted air is leading to rise in cases of respiratory diseases among people as the ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists can be seen flooded with patients severely affected by diseases connected to air pollution./A large amount of garbage is burnt daily by local residents in the absence of a proper garbage disposal plant./At many places, municipal corporation employees can also be seen burning huge piles of garbage in order to make their job easier./Scrap dealers also contribute to severe air air pollution by burning scrap to yield copper and other metals from it. Among all this, the administration has only been sleeping as no action has been taken so far against these scarp dealers./""Smoke and fog mix to form smog, which settles down at a lower altitude and causes respiratory infections,"" said Dr Bhupinder Singh, an ENT surgeon at the Pathankot civil hospital./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

City needs to stop burning garbage,"umbai, Dec. 7 -- Last week, as Delhi's air quality reached deadly levels, the state government asked the city's municipal corporations to stop burning garbage and garden waste./The air in the capital continues to be noxious. On Sunday afternoon, the United States embassy in Delhi measured an Air Quality Index (AQI) - a pollution indicator arrived at after taking into account the amount of major pollutants like gases and dust in the air - of 346, which fall in the 'hazardous' category. This reading is an average for the entire city; the AQI ranges from 242 in Connaught Place to 369 in congested East Delhi. When the AQI is between 100 and 200, it is considered 'moderate'; levels below 100 mean that the air is safe to breathe. The air is cleaner in Mumbai, but only comparatively. On Saturday, Mumbai's AQI was 162 in the afternoon - not hazardous, but unhealthy. As this newspaper has reported, November was a bad month for Mumbai, with the AQI consistently below healthy standards./On November 5, Mumbai's AQI was 203, putting the city in 'poor' air category - a classification which says people with sensitivity to air pollution are at risk. The air was so bad on the day that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the state environment monitoring agency, issued a health warning for people with lung ailments and heart disease, especially children and senior citizens./One of the ways in which Delhi is trying to tackle the pollution - apart from placing restrictions on vehicles - is by banning the open burning of garbage and biomass like crop residue in the city's rural outskirts. The letter sent on December 2 by Delhi's environment secretary to the municipal corporations said that garbage was being burnt at landfill sites and suggested punitive action against those who burn garbage and garden wastes./If Mumbai decided to punish those who burn garbage, government agencies such as the railways and the municipal corporation would be the biggest culprits. Anyone who takes a suburban train to travel in Mumbai would have seen the smoking heaps of garbage near railway platforms. Large mounds of garbage, including plastic thrown by commuters on the railways tracks, are burnt daily at the largest stations on the suburban network - CST, Dadar, Kurla and Thane./If you are a commuter on the Central Railway, look to the left of the tracks at Dadar station's north end where garbage incineration has left large sooty stains on boundary walls. In the past, the railways have defended themselves by saying that the municipal corporation does not pick up their garbage, forcing them to burn it. Attempts to reach railways authorities for a response were not successful. Mumbai's municipal corporation, too, has been ignoring the issue of garbage burning. In April, this newspaper reported that a major fire at the Mulund dumping ground had covered the surrounding residential areas in smoke. The landfill caught fire again in May. The city's largest landfill - at Deonar - reports regular fires./Municipal authorities blame scrap collectors who deliberately set fire to trash to reach recyclable items like metals, but fires at landfills happen also because the municipal corporation has not employed enough equipment or manpower to stop the blazes. ""Open burning is prohibited by law. The irony is that a lot of municipal workers burn leaf litter (from roads and gardens), especially in winter,"" said environment activist Rishi Agarwal. ""They are flouting their own rules.""/Sumaira Abdulali of environmental watch group Awaaz Foundation said that very little research has been done on the sources of air pollution in Mumbai. ""Some sources - like the vehicles - are obvious and, of course, this has to be tackled,"" said Abdulali. ""There are other culprits; definitely government agencies are one of them (polluters). If the railways can do it (burn garbage), anybody can.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Dust, smoke eclipse Indirapuram","Ghaziabad, Dec. 9 -- Residents of Indirapuram are struggling with increasing air pollution. Dust from numerous construction sites in the area pollute the air and garbage burning is also a routine activity in the area./The authorities seem to have turned a blind eye to the issue despite the national green tribunal's (NGT) orders in September prohibiting burning of garbage./Residents are restricted to their homes as smoke from the burning garbage and dust from construction sites have made it difficult for them to get a breath of fresh air. Residents say they also have to keep the windows and doors of their homes closed. ""I feel uneasy when I go out for an hour-long walk in the area. The pollution also affects the greenery. Plants along the roads look lifeless,"" said Anil Rathore, a resident of Ahinsa Khand-1./One of the most rapidly developing areas of the city, Indirapuram is the worst affected by this crisis.

"Odd-even system a 15-day trial, to be based on dates","New Delhi, Dec. 9 -- Delhi's road-space rationing plan will be tried out for 15 days during which driving restrictions will be in place from 8am to 8pm while on Sundays all vehicles will be allowed, the government has said./In a review meeting on Tuesday, the government also decided that the odd-even formula that kicks in from the New Year's day will be in keeping with dates and not the days of the week as was decided earlier. So, odd-numbered vehicles will be allowed on the road on odd dates while those with evennumbered plates on even dates./""We will review the entire plan after 15 days and will decide the further course of action. The preparation is underway and another review meeting is scheduled on Thursday,"" transport minister Gopal Rai said./The government was forced to announce a string of measures, including a ban on private vehicles on alternate days according to registration numbers, after the Delhi high court said living in the city was like living in a gas chamber./The Capital has the most toxic air for any city in the world. Air pollution has worsened in the last few weeks with a thick blanket of smog enveloping the city./A blueprint of the plan would be made public on December 25, Rai said, adding the government would also decide on vehicles and people to be exempted from the driving restrictions./The government has been getting requests from various quarters to be kept out of the ban. ""Broadly there are five categories - women drivers, handicapped, two-wheelers, people suffering from disease and vehicles of other states. We will decide on Thursday whether to exempt them or not,"" Rai said./Public works department minister Satyendra Jain will be the nodal minister to coordinate the anti-pollution project./The Delhi Pollution Control Committee would collect air samples from 200 locations and real time data would be displayed at various locations during the 15-day trial run.

The punishment has not been decided yet,"" Rai said./The government has also sent notices to coal-fired Badarpur and Rajghat power plants to shut down operations within seven days. The two thermal plants cater to 5-20% of the city's supply, depending on demand, a Delhi Transco Ltd official said./Their shut down would not have any impact on city's power supply, the official said./Later in the day, Jain met Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari who promised him full support./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Beware of the air you breathe in Patna, it's dangerous!","PATNA, Dec. 11 -- The dangerously high level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in state capital's air, threatens the health of Patna's denizens./As against the standard 100 microgram per cubic meter of RSPM, Patna air consists of an average of around 200 RSPM, which is dangerous enough to cause chronic obstructive lung diseases (COLD), which may lead to death, if it remains untreated./What has alarmed chest specialists is the fact that the air is increasingly polluted with PM 2.5 micron, which may cause instant death./""Earlier, COLD used to attack smokers. However, of late, equal number of patients reporting to my clinic are nonsmokers, who have apparently been exposed to hazardous matter,"" said chest specialist Dr Sanjay Kumar./""Such patients approach us with the complaints of severe difficulty in breathing and with asthma like symptoms,"" said Sanjay, adding, deficiency of oxygen owing to breathlessness, might lead to cognitive impairment of the brain./""Air pollution caused by high levels of RSPM may also trigger cardio- vascular problems, including an abnormal increase in heart rate and various other secondary infections,"" said heart specialist Dr Basant Singh, while issuing a war ning, that unless effective and quick measures were taken to keep the pollution level under check, the situation might soon reach a point of no return./People, who are most at risk of air pollution are those suffering from asthma, influenza, lung, heart or cardiovascular diseases, elderly and children, felt physician Dr Rajiv Ranjan./While admitting that the city's air pollution level caused by high RSPM was not the least conducive to health, member secretary of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board AK Ojha said, unabated transportation of uncovered materials was at the root of the problem. A substantial increase in unsystematic construction activities, digging of roads and pathetic condition of patch work, besides vehicular emissions worsened the situation, he said./According to Ojha, the RSPM level of the state capital's air is as dangerous as that of Delhi, but the overall air quality is better here because the other polluting agents like sulphur dioxide ( SO2) and oxides of nitro gen ( NOx) are under control./An official of the pollution control board said that the ever increasing number of vehicles on Patna roads and traffic congestion would in no time further add to the problem. As per a scientific study, at low speed, vehicles burn fuel insufficiently and tend to pollute the air./""Delhi has hit the headlines for being the most polluted city in the country. But the trend in the Bihar's capital is no longer encouraging. If the government fails to reverse the trend, Patna would soon match the national capital in term of air pollution,"" warned the official./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Handkerchief + helmet = Dual protection against pollution!,"Lucknow, Dec. 11 -- Every morning, Rakesh Sharma, 44, steps out of his house with a little caution. He covers his face with a handkerchief first and then puts on his helmet for 'dual protection' against road accident and pollution./He has been doing this for the past few years, irrespective of the season./For Rakesh, this protection is not by choice but a compulsion as the ambient air in Lucknow has more pollution that what is prescribed as safe limit./On way to office from his home in Gomti Nagar extension, Rakesh passes through Indira Nagar (residential hub of Lucknow) that has the highest air pollution levels among all other residential areas./Considered to be the most planned and developed area in the state capital, Indira Nagar recorded an RSPM (respirable suspended particulate matter) level of 197.5 microgram/cubic metre which is almost four times of what the World Health Organization says is safe limit (50 microgram/cubic metre). However, the permissible limit as per national air quality standards is 100 microgram/ cubic metre./Following Indira Nagar is Gomti Nagar that registered 183.2 microgram/ cubic metre of RSPM./Though all the areas have recorded a decline in RSPM levels in comparison to previous years, the current levels are still high and damaging./""RSPM of size 4 to 5 micron passes through the nose and settles inside human organs as we breathe in polluted air,"" said Dr AA Mahdi, HoD, biochemistry department at KGMU./Lucknowites have been fighting with air pollution for the past several years and each one of them has devised some method to counter it. ""I keep the windows up while moving in the car,"" said Dr Milan Khanna, a gynaecologist./As a result of high air pollution, cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease too are on the rise./""At least 100 patients visit hospital OPDs complaining of breathing problems these days. As the air becomes heavy, the pollutants too are at a lower level in the atmosphere,"" said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, orthopaedic surgeon and director, Health City./Experts said measures such as better public transport and smooth traffic movement would reduce air pollution./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Green court orders action against farmers burning crop residue,"New Delhi, Dec. 11 -- The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Thursday banned burning of crop residue in five north Indian states and ordered punitive action against defaulters in sweeping measures to curb one of the main causes of the crippling air pollution gripping Delhi./Pushing hard to end the source of the toxic air hanging over the national capital, the NGT also asked the five states to withdraw all assistance provided to farmers who persistently fail to adhere to the ban on burning crop residue and slapped fines reaching up to ' 15,000 per incident./The alarming levels of air pollution in Delhi - identified as one of the world's most polluted cities - has forced the state government to introduce drastic measures including a radical road rationing formula which will see the city's 2.7 million private vehicles run on alternate days from January 1 according to their odd-even registration numbers./Besides, the government has also announced other measures to curb air pollution, including closing thermal power plants and bringing cleaner fuel to the city before the rest of the country./A NGT bench headed by chairperson Swatanter Kumar pinpointed five states - Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi - and asked them to ensure that the ban is enforced rigorously and proper action taken against defaulters./""In case of persistent defaulters of crop residue burning an appropriate coercive and punitive action could be taken by the state government concerned including launching of prosecution...,"" the bench said./The NGT's order came on a plea by environmentalist Vikrant Tongad who sought a ban on burning of agricultural waste/remnants in open fields./Tongad had alleged that burning of agricultural residue, like straw, in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh caused air pollution not only in these states but is also a major cause of smog in the National Capital Region of Delhi./The petitioner had cited a Hindustan Times report which had pointed out that burning of crop residue in the nearby states leads to a blanket of smoke over Delhi with carbon dioxide levels shooting up by 70 per cent besides significant rise in the concentration of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, triggering respiratory and heart problems./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"In Lucknow, slow traffic is giving us bad air","Lucknow, Dec. 11 -- Lucknow may not have as many vehicles as Delhi, but in terms of pollution, it does not lag behind the National Capital. In fact, slow movement of traffic due to encroachments is a bigger 'air killer' than other sources of pollution in Lucknow, say environmentalists/Experts have strongly recommended that pollution arising out of dust should also be controlled to keep the air clean. They also suggest the need to strengthen public transport besides shifting all the government offices out of city limits along with construction of flyovers and two to three-tier roads for free movement of traffic./Noted environmentalist VK Joshi says slow traffic due to encroachments is contributing to air pollution. For example, take the cases of Amar Shaheed Path and Gautam Buddha Marg - the former is free from encroachments, as a result traffic moves pretty fast while Gautam Buddha Marg and surrounding roads have encroachments galore which slow down traffic, thereby leading to more vehicular emissions./""If we wish to avoid a Delhi-like situation, the government has to check encroachments with an iron hand. The traffic will flow smoothly and pollution will be reduced,"" said Joshi./A recent study published by researchers of Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University, Lucknow and the Indian Toxicology Research Institute has shown that particulates with toxic chemicals and gases have been found in much higher quantities than the permissible limits in the air of Lucknow where the movement of traffic is slow. They have also blamed encroachments as one of the major factors of increasing pollution levels, adds Joshi./""The air we breathe in is injurious enough to cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease, says the study. OPDs of government and private hospitals these days are full of patients with respiratory problems. Come winters and the problem increases multifold, because the denser, moisture-laden winter air holds the particulate matter longer. The study reveals that the air of areas with heavier traffic is more polluted, compared to areas with less traffic,"" emphasis Joshi./Scientist and environmentalist Dr PK Srivastava, known for his 'scientoons' on pollution, says the situation in Lucknow cannot be compared to that of Delhi, so the remedies cannot be the same./Here, pollution is not because of vehicles but due to slow movement of vehicles because of encroachments. As part of measures to check pollution, the government will have to be ruthless on encroachers and police would have to ensure smooth flow of traffic at every spot./Besides, public transport system must be bolstered so that people can think of using autos, buses and tempos./He said 20 years back, Bangkok faced similar problems of pollution, but they came out of this beautifully by shifting all the government offices out of the city, making long flyovers, three-tier roads to evade traffic jams./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.
