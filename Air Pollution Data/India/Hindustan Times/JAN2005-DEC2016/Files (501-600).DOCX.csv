Air pollution kills 30K in Capital every year,"New Delhi, Dec. 16 -- Air pollution is responsible for 10,000-30,000 deaths in Delhi annually and is the fifth largest cause of death in the country, states the 'Body Burden 2015' report released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Tuesday. Outdoor air pollution kills 6,20,000 people and indoor air pollution kills 1.5 million people in India annually./The report states that 53% of days in November were in the very poor air quality range and 47% were in the severe range, as per the National Air Quality Index./""The way forward would be to reduce the source of air pollution.

Restrict diesel cars till Euro VI norms are enforced,"New Delhi, Dec. 17 -- Today, Delhi has got a landmark directive from the Supreme Court to reduce toxic emissions from diesel vehicles to reduce public health risk in the city. The environment compensatory charge on trucks has been doubled and entry of pre-2005 trucks banned./These trucks cause as much as 30% of particulate pollution from the transport sector in Delhi. The bench headed by the Chief Justice of India has also established an important principal: Rich car owners cannot misuse low-tax diesel for luxury consumption that adds to the health cost./Registration of luxury diesel cars and SUVs has been stopped across the national capital region until further orders after three months./These urgent measures are expected to be followed up with longer-term action on emissions standards for vehicles, power plant pollution and public transport strategy to clean up the air./What are the concerns around diesel? Diesel cars are legally allowed to emit three times more nitrogen oxides and seven times more particulate matter than petrol cars./These pollutants are rising in Delhi's air. Adding one diesel car is equal to adding three to seven petrol cars./The diesel car market, by shifting to bigger cars, is adding to toxic pollution. While the bulk of petrol car sales, 87%, sold in 2012 were below 1200 cc in engine capacity, more than 40% were above 1500 cc./The WHO has classified diesel emissions as class I carcinogen - putting them in the same class as tobacco smoking - for strong link with lung cancer./A new study by IIT Kanpur on air pollution sources has shown that diesel cars are a quarter of all cars responsible for 60- 70% of PM2.5 from vehicular sources across the city./The way forward is clear. Restrict diesel cars till the time Euro VI standards are enforced to close the gap between petrol and diesel emissions. Clean up diesel for other uses. Reduce the gap between diesel and petrol prices. Do not trade off cancer for profit./(The author is Executive Director - Research and Advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme at the Centre for Science and Environment)/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Patna HC to take up cases on air, noise pollution","PATNA, Dec. 19 -- A petition urging for judicial direction to the authorities concerned to maintain the quality of air in the state capital as per the parameters set under various environmental laws and regulation was filed in Patna high court on Friday by Samir Kumar./Pleading in the petition to maintain ambient air quality as mandated under National Ambient Quality Standards according to which particulate matter of 2.5 micron should be 60 microgram, the petitioner claimed that the present suspended particulate matter in the atmosphere has been assessed as 149 microgram, which caused severe health diseases and was dangerous to humans./He cited the WHO report for the year 2014 on 100 cities with worst air quality, including Patna on the list, while stating, ""It would be germane to mention that quality of air in the state, especially in Patna, is much worse than Beijing where alert had been sounded recently on parameters much less than what exist in Patna today""./The petitioner also sought the court's direction to prohibit burning of leaves, tyres, and plastics and rubber within the city of Patna and carrying of dust, building material and sand in open carriage and to force compliance of brick kilns to the environmental guidelines./The petition cited major causes of pollution in the city as emissions from the vehicles, running generator sets, carriage of dust and sand in open vehicles whose numbers are increasing day by day and reduction of greenery in the city with rising urban population, which he pleaded, has created tremendous pressure on the scarce habitable land, besides burning of city waste, which includes non-degradable materials like plastics./The complaint states, that air pollution is causing severe health problems like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebro-vascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, cancers of trachea and lungs and resulting in premature mortality./He said, that if the present situation is allowed to remain in Patna, the result would be an exponential increase in the mortality rate./The air pollution matter was filed as an addition (interlocutory- application) to the public interest litigation already filed over noise pollution and both matters are expected to be heard on December 21 in the Patna high court./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Abnormal Patna noise makes citizens aggressive,"Patna, Dec. 20 -- Honking of horns and piercing sounds of battered silencers have turned Patna into a noisy city./The unique feature of the noise pollution here is that it causes less damage to hearing, but much more to other body systems./The biggest concern to environmentalists and medical experts is that long exposure to high but fluctuating sound waves causes irritation and adds to aggressiveness that often results in road-rage or accidents./The findings are important in the context of the fact, that the Patna high court has now chosen to hear public interest cases over noise and air pollution, which so affect the state capital./S t u d i e s c a r r i e d o u t by researchers of environmental science department of A N College, Patna found that the average noise level in the state capital was between 85 and 92 decibel (dB) in many important localities like Exhibition road, Ashok Rajpath, Gandhi Maidan and Dak Bungalow crossing and more so on Bailey Road and Fraser Road, especially Patna station roundabout./""The permissible limit of Long exposure to high but fluctuating sound waves causes irritation and adds to aggressiveness that often results in roadrage or accidents/Average noise level in Patna is between 85 and 92 decibel in many important localities/None of the localities classified under silence zone, like important govt offices, hospitals, schools, colleges and places of worship have been declared no-horn zone/Frequent traffic jams with honking horns in congested areas raises duration of exposure to high decibel sound waves that cause psychological irritation and physiological abnormalities/Expert confirms increase in incisound levels in residential and commercial areas is 60-65 and 65- 70 dB respectively"", said Bihari Singh, head of the department and supervisor of the research works./The most startling fact is that none of the localities classified under silence zone, like the important government offices, hospitals, schools, colleges and places of worship, have been dents of road rage and ascribes it to stress- induced aggressiveness caused by long exposure to high level of sound range/Most common effects of noise declared no-horn zone nor have special arrangements been made to keep them free of noise pollution, he said./Students of environmental science who repeatedly studied status of sound on Patna roads found that frequent traffic jams with honking horns in congested areas, raised the duration of exposure to high decibel sound waves that caused psychological irritapollution are rise in blood pressure, especially among old aged persons, posing great risk for cardiac complications and also in infants tion and physiological abnormalities, said Neeraj Kumar, researcher who with his noise level meter recorded sound levels in Phulwarisharif, Anisabad, Bailey Road, Fraser Road, Boring road and several other localities./""We also found the level shooting up to 95 dB during long traffic jams and marriage parties (barat) around community halls and it was disturbing,"" added Kumar./""Noise affects human body in two ways, hearing loss and other physiological disturbances"", said Dr Rakesh Singh, head of the department of ear, nose and throat (ENT), Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences. Beginning with irritation, it leads to anxiety, intolerance and finally aggressive behaviour, he said./At IGIMS, the ENT department also received patients complaining of ear problems that were somehow related to noise pollution./However, the more alarming outcome of the noise pollution in Patna is the rise in road rage cases that often turned bloody, he added./Dr Mukesh Kumar, physician in Kankarbagh also confirmed increase in incidents of road rage and ascribed it directly to the stress- induced aggressiveness caused by long exposure to high level of sound range./""The most common effects of noise pollution are rise in blood pressure, especially among old aged persons. It posed great risk for cardiac complications and in infants"", said Kumar, adding that air pollution due to exhausts from automobiles added to the woes with chances of respiratory diseases and bronchitis. ""Days are not far when physicians and neurologists of Patna will begin writing their prescriptions for many ailments with humble advice to patients to shift to some peaceful locality for sometime to recoup the losses incurred due to noise pollution"", said professor and HoD of neurology, Patna Medical College Hospital, Dr AK Agrawal holding the additional post of vice chancellor of Aryabhatta Knowledge University./He said, apart from noise on roads, the state capital has become a silent victim of high frequency use of sound systems. Extreme sound on a sustained basis, he said, compromised mental peace. Such irritating attacks on the central nervous system led to sleep-disturbances, decrease in work efficiency and rise in stress level. Agrawal wondered why the local administrations remained a mute spectator to all this torture with human organs. Since these symptoms are not perceptible, people fail to realise their impact at early stages, he added./Head of the department of audiology and speech language pathology at Indian Institute of Health, Education and Research, Beur, Vikas Kumar Singh, said there has been continuous rise in the number of patients with hearing and speech impairment, largely due to regular exposure to high frequency sounds in Patna./""Long exposure to noise pollution leads to hearing impairment and we suggest people to use ear-plugs or ear-muffs to save their tympanic membranes from damage. The side effect of noise pollution is speech discrimination when the sufferers fail to coordinate with his mind and speech, he said./Children, according to Dr KK Rai, child specialist at Danapur Sadar hospital, suffered brain puzzlement due to long exposure to noisy road traffic on way to and from schools that led to mood disturbance and lack of concentration./""Watch, if your child returning from school through noisy roads behaves irritatingly and displays aggressive behaviour. Noise pollution could be one of its reasons,"" he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Bihar to ban old diesel vehicles, curb pollution","PATNA, Dec. 25 -- In a major step towards containing vehicular pollution and arresting climate change, chief minister Nitish Kumar ordered ban on all those diesel vehicles, which are more than 15 years old, besides clamp down on burning plastics, solid waste and rubber tyres within municipal limits./The orders came at a review meeting of the forest and environment ministry./Significantly, the chief minister directed officials to arrest sound pollution by way of curbing use of sirens, high pressure horns and educate people to curb unnecessary use of hooters and horns. He also advised that open carrying of sand and other building material, which adds to environmental pollution, be stopped forthwith./Raising concern over pollution in any form, the chief minister noted, that brick kilns along the Ganga river was an irritant, as it affected the city with smoke and air pollution, even as the water front was being eroded./H e s u g g e s t e d t h at s u b - divisional officers and forest officials should get together to plan a roadmap on curbing environmental and sound pollution, while the principal secretary, forest department, was directed to encourage social forestry under which fruit bearing and other trees like Bargad, Peeul, Pakar etc were taken up for afforestation on a large scale./He also instructed that a market should be created for sale of saplings of popular trees and that under agro- forestry an incentive be worked out to involve locals as stakeholders. He said, stakeholders, who would care for such trees planted under agro-forestry plan, could be paid ' 10 for the first two years and thereafter ' 15 from the third year to protect the plants./He said trees like Poplar were being planted in Bihar, but a market for it did not exist. Hence, steps should be taken to market them too./Acting on reports from districts affected by the monkey and elephant menace, he directed forest officers to find an immediate solution to save people and farmers and to set up a national dolphin centre in Patna on land available with Patna University, and if not possible, to locate it on the Ganga stretch between Sultanpur and Bhagalpur./The review meeting was attended by forest minister Tej Pratap Yadav, chief secretary AK Singh, development commissioner Shishir Sinha, principal secretary, finance, Ravi Mittal, principal secretary, forests and environment, Vivek K Singh, CM's secretaries Chanchal Kumar and Atish Chandra, besides others./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Brick kilns proliferate, eat up topsoil, pollute Patna environs","PATNA, Dec. 25 -- Bihar, a state known for fertile agricultural fields, is losing much of its topsoil due to unscientific mining by brick kilns, now mushrooming in all districts of the state./Scientists say, the suspended particulate matters (SPM) coming out with smoke billowing from their chimneys, settle down on vegetation and agricultural farmlands, impairing the process of photo synthesis in the leaves necessary for the growth of plants./There are over 6,000 brick kilns in the state. However, the fast pace clearance being given by the state expert appraisal committee ( SEAC), of the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority, Bihar, indicates that the number of brick kilns would proliferate by thousands in yet another year. However, experts admit, hundreds of brick kilns run illegally, but are yet to catch the attention of local administrations./In Patna alone there are about 525 brick kilns, mostly in Patna City, Digha and Danapur areas./Scientists and experts also agree that if the state government does not come up with stricter norms, clay mining for short term gain would lead to a long term disaster./Admitting the highly disturbing scenario on both agricultural and environmental fronts, chairman of SEAC and noted environmentalist Ashok K Ghosh of AN College, Patna said most of the agricultural land in Patna environs have already turned barren due to removal of the topsoil and their non- restoration in the dug up areas from where alluvial soil was mined for clay bricks./He said, though the rules made it mandatory on part of the brick kiln owners to keep aside three meters topsoil well protected before digging out the deeper alluvial soil, while restoring the topsoil every five years for maintaining the natural earth profile, it is hardly followed./""Hundreds of acres of fertile land that produced foodgrains and vegetables have already been reduced to ditches or low lying barren land, which could hardly support vegetation,"" he said./Brick kilns also prove to be an environmental hazard in the state capital due to high density of SPM coming out from their chimneys that add to the air pollution of Patna, he said, adding, that none of the brick kilns had set up machinery to settle down the SPM through water sprinklers before these were spread by the wind./A member of SEAC, Nupur Bose of geography department of the same college, said the worst impact of brick kilns is that it changed the soil profile needed for agriculture./""Since July 2014 the SEAC has given clearance to over 1600 brick kilns under the present norms for the purpose"", she said./As most of the brick kilns are on river side that have alluvial soil, removal of their topsoil has rendered them unusable./She said, ""Deeply concerned with an environmental tragedy in the making, SEAC is working to send a proposal to the Ministry of Environment and Forest for carrying out scientific assessment of the losses due to brick kilns in Bihar and accordingly recommend measures to check uncontrolled clay mining,"" added Bose./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Let 2016 be the year in which Delhi redefines its public transport,"New Delhi, Dec. 28 -- For Delhi, 2016 may herald a cultural shift. We will start by testing the existing modes of transport when the road space rationing is enforced for a fortnight on January 1 and, hopefully, end the year with many more buses and new Metro lines to ease our daily commute./Right now, the government itself is not sure of the carrying capacity of the poorly-networked buses and the Metro. At least that is the reason it gave for exempting two-wheeler drivers from the 15-day restriction. But by end of 2016, Delhi would have added 118 kms of Metro lines to its existing 213-km network and, as promised by the AAP government, at least 2,000 extra buses./But how many of us will chuck our cars in favour of public transport? Metro says that in 2014, it kept 3.9 lakh vehicles off roads, helping Delhi save ' 10,364 crore in fuel, besides easing congestion, reducing air pollution and accidents. Yet, 5.5 lakh new vehicles were registered in the city during the same time. Clearly, not many of those who could afford cars and twowheelers were using the Metro./It could be because of the patchy network which will expand considerably by the end of 2016. Without optimal utilisation, mere development of infrastructure will not unclog Delhi's roads. We need to fix last-mile connectivity and levy anti-car taxes. But a switch to public transport need not be a compulsion. It has many more benefits other than cutting congestion and air pollution./STAY ACTIVE/Public transport users get more physical activity per day than those who use private vehicles, reported a study by Moriguchi City Health Examination Center, Japan, this November. The center interviewed 6,000 adults in Osaka, Japan, comparing bus and train commuters with those who drove./Adjusting factors like age, gender, smoking, etc, the study found that compared to those who drove to work, people who took the bus or train were 44% less likely to be overweight; 27% less likely to have high blood pressure; and 34% less likely to have diabetes./CUT STRESS/The Marchetti's constant, developed by Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti, states that anything beyond a 60-minute commute stresses one out. Delhi drivers have long crossed that limit. The waiting time at traffic signals is becoming longer. According to IBM's 2011 Commuter Pain Index, 70% of the respondents in Delhi said traffic increased their stress levels, upped their anger, and negatively affected their performance at work or school./There is the added strain of finding space to park. Once parked, one worries for the safety of the vehicle. A Centre for Science and Environment report states that in some locations in Delhi, as much as 45% of the circulation area is under parking encroachment. Yet, parking is a mad scramble. This year, a vehicle was stolen every 15 minutes in Delhi. Police blame acute shortage of safe parking space as the main reason behind these crimes./BOOST ECONOMY/In their paper, Transit Service, Physical Agglomeration and Productivity in US Metropolitan Areas, researchers Daniel Chatman and Robert Noland said that the economic value of mass transit could be worth anywhere from $1.5 million to $1.8 billion a year, depending on the size of the city. Every time a metro area added about four seats to trains and buses per 1,000 residents, the central city ended up with 320 more employees per square mile - an increase of 19%, Chatman told the CityLab of the Atlantic. FIND TIME/Riding public transportation also gives people time to do things they couldn't (legally) do while driving. Bus and Metro travellers can talk on the phone, send text messages, work, read, and listen to music while commuting. Or just take a power nap./Ultimately, public transport is of little use if the commuters can't time their journey. In Delhi, we not only need a reliable network but also real-time information at bus stops and Metro stations and through websites and phone apps for those on the go. There is no reason why ""sarkari"" can't be smart, or why we can't make a lifestyle choice for a greener, faster and healthier Delhi./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Winter air dangerously toxic in Mumbai,"umbai, Dec. 29 -- This year, the winter chill has also brought with it poor air quality.

The standard for slightly larger particles called PM 2.5 (particles less than 2.5 microns) is 60 microgrammes per cubic metre. It is found that PM1 constitutes 30-40% of PM 2.5. The current levels of the pollutant in Mumbai are quite high and extremely dangerous for people sensitive to air pollution,"" said Beig said./SAFAR carried out separate studies at their nine monitoring sites in the city and found PM1 levels to be high at all the sites. The highest levels of PM1 were observed at Bhandup, which recorded 67 microgrammes per cubic metre in October, followed by Navi Mumbai at 50 microgrammes per cubic metre. In December, however, Chembur, Mazgaon and Navi Mumbai recorded the highest PM1 levels at 59 microgrammes per cubic metre, 53 microgrammes per cubic metre and 55 microgrammes per cubic metre respectively./Beig said PM 2.5 particles, which are considered lethal to the cardiovascular system, had raised an alert in many nations.

"City to ring in the New Year with very polluted air, says SAFAR","umbai, Dec. 30 -- A pollution forecast has said that air quality in the city later this week is expected to be 'poor'./On December 31, the city is expected to have an air quality index (AQI) - pollution measuring indicator - of 279 that is further expected to deteriorate to 277 on January 1, 2016, said officials from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research ( SAFAR) on Tuesday. AQI ranging between 200 and 300 is considered poor, while that ranging from 100 to 200 is moderate. Readings below 100 are 'good'./The health advisory statement released by SAFAR for the next few days said, ""People with heart or lung diseases, older adults and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion and outdoor activity.""/According to SAFAR officials, the AQI levels have been predicted on the basis of regular trends for pollutant particles and meteorological forecasts such as wind pattern, temperatures and humidity./""Air pollution l evels are expected to be between poor and very poor on December 31 and January 1. Due to low temperatures, high moisture levels and light winds, we expect pollutant particles to be suspended less than a kilometre from the surface, creating a layer of pollutant particles responsible for increasing the AQI,"" said Gufran Beig, scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, and project director, SAFAR./SAFAR also released data for predicted particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) -pollutants comprising dust, soot or smoke particles that can easily enter our respiratory system. The level of PM2.5 will be between 108-114 micrograms (mu g) per cubic metre (mug/m3) falling under the 'poor' range, while the levels of PM10 will be in 'moderate' range.

Poison in the air: Many ways in which pollution hurts your health,"New Delhi, Jan. 1 -- With the New Year, the Delhi government implemented in the odd-even plan or road space rationing in an effort to check the Capital's alarming level of air pollution./Air pollution is not only about toxic air as it does more than just trigger asthma and wheezing. Stepping out in polluted air can make your eyes sting, your nose run, your throat dry and itchy, and your head ache. It often causes nausea, dizziness, headache and chronic allergy. Over time, it kills by triggering heart attacks, stroke and cancers./Outdoor air pollution caused 6.2 lakh premature deaths in India in 2010, a six-fold jump from the 1 lakh deaths in 2000. This makes polluted outdoor air the fifth biggest killer in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution (mainly from smoking chullahs that use biomass fuels such as wood, coal, straw, manure, etc), tobacco use, and poor nutrition, says the Global Burden of Disease 2013 (/<a href=""http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-incidence-prevalence-and-years-lived-disability-2013"">http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-incidence-prevalence-and-years-lived-disability-2013</a>/), which tracks deaths and illnesses from all causes every 10 years./It is world's biggest environmental health risk, exacerbating respiratory and heart diseases and triggering deaths from stroke (25.48%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.32%), heart disease (48.6%), lung infections (6.4%), and trachea, bronchus and lung cancer (2.02%)./Toxic air/One in three people in India live in critically polluted areas that have noxious levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and lung-clogging suspended particulate matter smaller than 10 micron (SPM10) in size. Of the 180 cities monitored by India's Central Pollution Control Board in 2012, only two -- Malapuram and Pathanamthitta in Kerala -- meet the criteria of low air pollution (50% below the standard)./Just being stuck in heavy traffic can trigger heart attacks. People who have already had a heart attack were more than three times as likely to have been in traffic within an hour of getting a heart attack, found a study of 1,454 in Germany, with the risk being highest for women, people over 65 and those with existing heart disease./Exposure to traffic noise makes children hyperactive and sleepless, report researchers in the journal Environmental Research. Sleeping in rooms exposed to the sound of nighttime traffic raises children's blood pressure, reports a study in the journal Noise Health./Here's how the top three components of polluted air hurt your mind and body:/Smog/Smog is produced when airborne dust, carbon particles, noxious gases and ozone react chemically in the presence of sunlight to create a toxic mist that aggravates bronchitis, asthma, and other lung problems and reduces lung function even in healthy people. There are no safe levels of smog./Inhaling smog tightens the arteries, reducing the blood flow, and triggering heart attacks and stroke, report Harvard research in the journal Circulation. At most risk are people who have had a heart attack or angioplasty or those who have angina, heart failure, heart rhythm problems, and/or diabetes./Ozone/Ground-level ozone, which is the main constituent of smog that hangs low over Delhi throughout the year, irritates the eyes, nose, and throat. When it is inhaled, it dehydrates and inflames the protective membranes of the nose and throat, raising risk of throat and lung infections./Apart from aggravating asthma, exposure to ozone for just six to seven hours, even at relatively low concentrations, triggers asthma attacks, lowers lung function and triggers wheezing in healthy people. People over 65, children under 12 and people with asthma and lung disorders need to limit exposure as much as possible./Suspended particles/Suspended particulates (SPM10 and SPM2.5) from diesel and petrol fumes, power plants, industry, agricultural fires and construction dust remain hanging and air and cause irreversible damage lung and respiratory tissue damage. Combined with ground-level ozone, the main constituent of smog, SPM causes wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulties, especially during exercise./SPM give lower visibility and contribute to the brownish-yellow colour characteristic of smog./SPM2.5 and below are more deadly. Unlike larger particles that get filtered by the mouth and lungs, fine airborne particles are inhaled deeper and get lodged in the lower regions of the respiratory tract to lower the lungs' working capacity and aggravates respiratory problems./Over time, exposure damages lung tissue, causes cancer and premature death./Nitrogen oxides/Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and other oxides of nitrogen (NOX), formed from vehicular emissions and electricity and industrial plants, irritate the airways and cause frequent nose, throat and lung infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. People who live near busy highways are at most risk./NO2 concentrations are 30 to 100% higher within about 50 metres from busy roads as compared to areas away from roadways. NOX reacts with volatile organic compounds in the presence of heat and sunlight to form deadly ground-level ozone./Sulphur dioxide/Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is released from burning fuels that contain sulphur (coal, oil, diesel etc) and from coal- and oil-fired power plants, pulp and paper mills, steel mills and smelters./Short-term exposure affects breathing and causes wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, sore throat and nose irritation.

TOXIC AIR HURTS OUR CHILDREN THE MOST,"New Delhi, Jan. 3 -- Lately, air pollution has been popping up in conversations with the inevitability of a hangover after spirited celebrations. It's the only thing people in Delhi are talking about. If they're not griping about the paralysis of successive state governments to craft a comprehensive clean air policy, they are fretting over the inconvenience of using the state's disjointed public transport or apologising for the city's roads being choked with aggressive road warriors out to seek and destroy. And destroy they do, in ways more insidious than road traffic accidents. Vehicular emissions hurt more people off the roads than on it, with children being the hardest hit./Children have high respiration rates and inhale far more air in proportion to their body weight than adults do. While healthy adults at rest breathe in 12 to 16 times in a minute, babies less than a year old inhale 24 to 30 times a minute, toddlers under 5 years 20 to 30 times, while children ages 6 to 12 years do it 12 to 20 times a minute. Since children are usually active and spend far more time outdoors -be it at school or at play at home - than adults, their respiratory rates get pushed up further, which leads to their inhaling more pollutants per kg of body weight compared to an adult./LUNG DAMAGE/Add to this the fact that their airways are narrower and their lungs still developing - 80% of the air sacs (alveoli) where oxygen gets transferred to the blood develop after birth - and you have a cocktail of risk factors that can obstruct breathing on exposure to air toxins, such as suspended particulate matter or ground-level ozone, which is hazardous at all levels./Growing up in polluted areas led to irreversible lung damage, showed data from a US study that tracked children between ages 10 and 18 over eight years. The study, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine found pollution led to lung function dropping by an average of 20% below normal, which was similar to the effect of growing up in a home where parents smoked indoors./Even short-term ozone exposure lowers lung function, causes breathing problems and lung inflammation in both children and adults, reported the Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, which also found ozone exposure raised death rates among people with heart disease, congestive failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes./CELLULAR DAMAGE AND CANCER/Along with ozone, sulfur dioxide, sulphate aerosols and suspended particles cause cellular damage to the airways and lungs and impair their function permanently. Sulfuric acid compounds and other acidic aerosols paralyse the mucociliary clearance system in the lungs by drying mucous, paralysing cilia and bronchi, which together are in the frontline of the lung's defense system against particles and bacteria. Sulphur dioxide also constricts the airways, causing wheezing and asthma attacks, lowers lung cell permeability, and form scar tissue in the lungs./The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified outdoor air pollution as a carcinogenic (Group 1) after it was found to cause lung cancer and contribute to bladder cancer. Particulate matter was evaluated separately and also classified as carcinogenic to humans./ASTHMA AND ALLERGIES/Ozone, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter trigger attacks and lead to higher medication use and increased hospitalisation, with children living next to busy streets have 1.2 to 1.7-fold higher chances of developing asthma, found a eight-city study across India. The study, done cross 18 centres in eight cities and published in the Journal of Asthma, compared asthma prevalence to traffic density near the homes of the children aged 6 to 7 years and 13 to 14 years. The prevalence of asthma in children in Delhi was 6.02%, which was higher than the national average of 5.35%./ATTENTION DEFICIT/The damage begins in the womb, with pollutants leading to brain changes and developmental delays that result in slower processing speed, attention deficit and behavioural problems after birth, reported researchers in JAMA Psychiatry. Past research in the journal also linked a mother's mental stress and exposure to air pollution during pregnancy with changes in the baby's behavioural development, with the child more likely to be depressed, withdrawn, aggressive and disruptive. Children exposed to pollution in the womb have low birthweight, length, and head circumference, which leads to their being stunted in later life./MORE HOSPITALISATIONS/Pollution not only leads to coughing, and upper respiratory infections in children but also causes more severe diseases. Several studies have linked a rise in ozone, sulfates, aerosol hydrogen ion levels, and particulates with increased hospital admissions.

Dept impounds over 20 vehicles for flouting pollution norms,"Noida, Jan. 3 -- The Noida transport department impounded more than 20 vehicles and fined drivers of another 52 vehicles for flouting pollution norms on Friday, the first day of a monthlong drive./The drive has been started following a Supreme Court direction. It will continue till January 31./Earlier this week, the environment pollution prevention and control authority (EPCA) had held a discussion with the Noida administration to express its concerns over the increasing vehicular pollution in the city./The officials had taken a stock of the smog situation in the district in the third week of December./The transport department has formed six teams to carry out the month-long drive against polluting vehicles./The department will also take help from the traffic police for the drive./Rachna Yaduvanshi, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), said, ""We are monitoring the enforcement work and we update the pollution department and the district administration on a daily basis."" Talking about the poor quality of air in Noida, regional transport officer (RTO) Mayank Jyoti said, ""The EPCA has shown its concern over PM10, which is three times higher than the standard limit of 100 micro grams per cubic metres."" Smog had enveloped entire Noida and Greater Noida and several nearby residential areas after Diwali, troubling those suffering from respiratory diseases. Senior citizens and children were among the worst sufferers./Atulesh Yadav, re gional officer of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Gautam Budh Nagar said vehicles and construction activities are the main contributors to pollution./""Besides construction activities and industries, automobiles are the major contributor to air pollution.

Sanitation workers to be coached against burning waste,"Noida, Jan. 3 -- The Noida authority on Saturday said that it has decided to educate nearly 1,200 sanitation workers against the practice of garbage burning that causes pollution./The authority will spread awareness among the sanitation workers by conducting a series of workshops in different areas./The authority's move came after residents complained that many sweepers collect household waste and burn it, causing pollution./Residents said people, especially senior citizens and children, suffer from respiratory diseases because of air pollution./Additional chief executive officer (ACEO) of the authority Rajesh Prakash and deputy chief executive officer (DCEO) of the authority Saumya Srivastava on Saturday held a meeting with all project engineers in this regard./""We have realised that sweepers, who play an essential role in cleaning Noida, are not aware of the fact that garbage burning is a hazardous activity. Therefore, we have decided to rope in environment and waste management experts who will help us in educating the sweepers,"" said Saumya Srivastava./The authority has asked 10 work circle officers to organise workshops for sweepers in their respective areas. A circle officer is responsible for keeping 20 sectors clean./""Locals can lodge a complaint online (/<a href=""http://www.noidaauthorityonline"">www.noidaauthorityonline</a>/./com) if our circle officer, project engineer or sweeper is not working properly to keep areas clean,"" said Saumya Srivastava./Officials said that Noida produces nearly 140 truckloads of waste daily./Cart and rickshaw pullers, who collect household waste, usually dump it on roadsides or in green belt areas./Residents, meanwhile, said sweepers argue if they try to stop them from burning the garbage./""Many sweepers have the habit of burning garbage in residential areas and they argue if we try to stop them.

Pollution at alarming levels for second time since Jan 1,"umbai, Jan. 7 -- Mumbai had haze-laden skies on Wednesday as air pollution levels climbed to extremely high levels for the second time this year. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) - pollution measuring indicator - of 302, putting it in the 'very poor' category that recommends a health alert for everyone in the city./Pollution levels have been estimated to further increase to 306 on Thursday. An AQI of more than 300 falls in the very poor category. On the last day of 2015, Mumbai had recorded an AQI of 311, which was one of the highest for the year. On January 1, 2016, AQI levels were still under the 'very poor' category at 305. On Wedeneday, AQI calculated by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) across nine locations in the city found Chembur was the only location that recorded 'good' air quality while the other eight locations either recorded 'poor' or 'very poor' levels with Malad being the most polluted with an AQI of 358. SAFAR records AQI for PM2.5 and PM10 - particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 and 10 micrometres - that can penetrate deep into the respiratory system. The health advisory statement issued by SAFAR said, ""People are advised to avoid outdoor activity, especially children and senior citizens. It is advisable to use pollution masks."" Pollution experts attributed the rise in pollutants due to increase in moisture levels. According to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), humidity levels were recorded at 83% and 89% at the suburbs and south Mumbai respectively on Wednesday morning. ""The Mumbai horizon on Wednesday evening was dustladen because of high humidity levels combined with calm winds across the city. An increase in moisture holds pollutant particles closer to earth's surface,"" said Neha S Parkhi, senior programme officer, SAFAR adding that moisture levels are expected to remain similar on Thursday resulting in a further increase in AQI levels. PM2.5 levels in the city were also recorded under the 'very poor' category on Wednesday, as it was more than twice the permissible standard. As against a safety limit of 60 microgrammes per cubic metre (mu g/ m3), Mumbai recorded a concentration of PM2.5 at 122.5 mu g/m3 on Wednesday, with a projection that it could increase to 122.8mu g/ m3 by Thursday. However, PM10 levels fell under the 'moderate' category with 162.8mu g/ m3 against safety standards of 100mu g/m3./PM10 levels are expected to drop to 161.8mu g/m3 on Thursday. ""Pollutant particles released in the air with main sources such as vehicular emissions and construction dust released are not being dispersed due to unusually calm winds. Winds coming from the sea stop these pollutants from getting suspended. However, this has not happened on Wednesday. If the current wind speed continues, pollution levels are likely to further increase,"" said Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

""Why is it necessary to have it for 15-day... Is there any better method which can be brought in,"" the bench asked as it reserved the verdict on a bunch of petitions challenging the scheme for January 11./Delhi transport minister Gopal Rai and AAP member Ashish Khetan and environmentalist Sunita Narain were also present in court during the hearing./For 15 days from January 1, private cars are being allowed on the city's roads every other day to try to reduce pollutant levels, which regularly hit 10 times the World Health Organization's safe limits./Cars with odd-numbered licence plates have been directed to ply on odd-numbered dates, and those with even-numbered plates on the other days./The government on Thursday had said that the road-rationing plan was working and would not be cut short as pollution levels in the city had dropped considerably. A week into the 15-day trial run, the city government, battling criticism that the odd-even formula for private cars had failed to clean city's dirty air, had said the concentration of finest particles, known as particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), had fallen significantly./Sixty micrograms per cubic metre is considered the maximum safe level while the World Health Organization recommends 25 micrograms.

Currently there is no plan to extend it further,"" said Rai./The Aam Aadmi Party government had on Fridaytold the Delhi high court that it may extend the odd-even scheme beyond the 15-day trial period, saying it has a ""definite positive"" effect against air pollution in the capital./For 15 days from January 1, private cars are being allowed on the city's roads every other day to try to reduce pollutant levels, which regularly hit 10 times the World Health Organization's safe limits./Read|Odd-even formula: People leave cars at home, opt for Metro, buses/Cars with odd-numbered licence plates have been directed to ply on odd-numbered dates, and those with even-numbered plates on the other days./Till now 5893 challans have been issued to violators. ""The money collected from challan will be used in giving subsidy to those planning to buy bicycle. We want to promote use of cycle,"" said Rai./Government helpline has received 13500 calls till now and transport department has formed 66 teams to check the traffic jams on Monday and Tuesday./The government on Thursday had said that the road-rationing plan was working and would not be cut short as pollution levels in the city had dropped considerably. A week into the 15-day trial run, the city government, battling criticism that the odd-even formula for private cars had failed to clean city's dirty air, had said the concentration of finest particles, known as particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), had fallen significantly./Sixty micrograms per cubic metre is considered the maximum safe level while the World Health Organization recommends 25 micrograms. These tiny particles released by factories and motor vehicles can cause respiratory distress and have also been linked to cancer and heart disease./Read|This winter more polluted, but driving curbs helped: SC-appointed body/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Quality of air worse than Diwali peak for a 2nd day,"umbai, Jan. 9 -- Air quality in Mumbai on Friday was worse t han that during Diwali. The Air Quality Index (AQI) - a pollution measurement tool - in the morning was 315 which falls under the 'very poor' category. On November 12, the day after Diwali, the AQI was 313. Pollution levels are likely to remain at alarming levels over the weekend with a predicted AQI of 312 for Saturday. An AQI of more than 300 falls in the very poor category./A health advisory war ning from The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), which measures and forecasts air quality in Mumbai, said: ""People are advised to avoid outdoor activity, especially children and senior citizens. It is advisable to use pollution masks.""/SAFAR said that meteorological forecasts have indicated that pollution levels are expected to drop from Monday onwards. ""The whole country is reeling under poor to very poor pollution levels due to current weather conditions. Cities like Mumbai are experiencing extremely poor air quality due to high levels of humidity combined with calm winds holding pollutant particles closer to the surface. However, we expect winds to pick up from Monday onwards that will improve Mumbai's air quality,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. ""We calculated the average AQI of 315 on the basis of the magnitude of suspended pollutant particles overnight and on Friday morning. However, the AQI dropped through the day to 307 as wind patterns dispersed some of the pollutant particles by the evening on Friday."" he said./Humidity levels in south Mumbai and the suburbs were 77% and 85% respectively./On Friday, eight out of nine locations in the city where SAFAR measures pollution levels recorded either 'very poor' or 'poor' pollution levels. Chembur that has been recording good air quality for the last five days also recorded an AQI of 194 falling under the 'moderate' category. Pollution was highest in Malad where AQI was 359; it was 343 at Andheri./Concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 - particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 and 10 micrometres that can penetrate deep into the respiratory system - was high. As against the safety limit of 60 microgrammes per cubic metre (mu g/m3), Mumbai's air had a PM2.5 concentration at 131mu g/ m3. PM10 levels were 'moderate' at178.4mu g/m3, against safety standards of 100mu g/m3./Scientists said that while the government has been taking steps at the macro-level to control pollution, citizens need to safeguard themselves by protecting indoor air quality. ""When moisture levels increase, bio-aerosols -suspended airborne particles, including dust, bacteria, fungi or virus that settle - rises. They are responsible for a number of lungrelated diseases,"" said Padma Rao, senior principal scientist and head, air pollution control division, National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur./Rao added that immediate measures were needed to purify indoor air quality. ""Increasing the green cover around houses, keeping doors and windows closed once the house is cleaned and switching off electrical equipment to conserve electricity,"" she said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

City air no longer fit for morning jog,"Kolkata, Jan. 10 -- Kolkata is not a suitable place for an early morning jog anymore, said Claudio Marabotti, an Italian cardiologist who attended the Cardiology Update 2016 held in the city on Saturday to create awareness among people about the increasing heart disease caused by the air pollution in the city./Around 120 doctors and 80 patients attended the event./Marabotti added, ""The particulate matters (PM10), Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are the three main pollutants which are found in high amount in Kolkata's air can induce the damage of Endothelium (lining of the inner surface of the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels).""/The Kolkata chapter of Heart Friends around the World, a forum of cardiologists, also organised a heart check up camp at Ruby General Hospital for 45 underprivileged children (aged between 7-10 years) from different slums of the city. Research work was also carried out along with scientists from National Research Council, Italy. The two-day programme at Ruby General Hospital also focused on creating awareness of both primary and secondary prevention and rehabilitation of heart disease./Dr. KN Siddiqui, president of Heart Friends around the World, told HT on Saturday, ""Youngsters should refrain from smoking and consumption of junk foods as they are the primary agents that would lead to heart diseases in the future.""/Siddiqui also added that poor living conditions in early life of the slum children of the city is one of the leading factors for cardiovascular diseases in adulthood.

Pollution shadow over cargo hub in city,"New Delhi, Jan. 10 -- It's afternoon and the sun is struggling to shine through the haze shrouding the horizon. A plume of smoke is rising from the landfill in Okhla. An abandoned cement plant of Cement Corporation of India, with its giant silos has lent an eerie touch to the bleak landscape. We are on the terrace of the administrative building of the Inland Container Depot ( ICD) in Tughlakabad -a 130-acre dry port in southeast Delhi./While there is no blue sea here, one can see thousands of shipping containers placed on the ground in rows in what is called custom-bonded area. One can frequently hear loud thuds of 40- feet containers being loaded on the trains by giant reach stackers and rubber-tyred gantry cranes./""You see, that is the real cause of air pollution in Delhi. This fire has been burning for past several months, "" says Sanjay Bajpai, chief manager, ICD Tughalakabad, (ICD TKD) pointing to the smoke rising from the Okhla landfill that abuts the container depot./Bajpai's reference to 'real pollution' has a compelling context . Container Corporation Of India (CONCOR), a navratna public sector company that runs ICD, is faced with a tough poser from National Green Tribunal - why ICD TKD should not be directed to shift outside Delhi from its present location since trailers and heavy vehicles which bring cargo causes serious congestion and air pollution in the entire Delhi./For the uninitiated, ICD TKD is a dry port - a facility in landlocked Delhi that serves as a regional cargo handling hub for import and exports. It is connected directly to the sea ports by four rail lines. Like in a marine port, all processes such as custom clearances and cargo storage are handled here. Every day, about 1,000 large container trucks move in and out of it./Many like Bhure Lal, chairman of Supreme Courtappointed Environmental Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), feel that such a facility has no business operating out of the city. ""Their container trucks cause traffic jams and contribute enormously to the air pollution in the city. Most of the goods are not destined for the city and they should be shifted out of Delhi,"" says Lal./But Rahul Mithal, group general manager, strategic planning and coordination, CONCOR contests the claim. Mithal says that 85 per cent of the container cargo at ICD, Tughalakabad is destined for Delhi and NCR./""Our custom data proves this. The fact is shifting ICD-TKD out of the city will only add to the air pollution in Delhi,"" says Mithal, adding, ""ICD handles about 1,400 containers every day. It takes about three trucks to carry the goods of a container. So, if ICD is shifted out of Delhi, every day about 4,000 trucks will move in and out of Delhi, creating chaos on the borders and adding to the air pollution in Delhi.""/Among the commodities that arrive at ICD-TKD in Delhi include plastic toys, fabrics, furniture, paper, and the commodities exported include auto parts, readymade garments, medicines, utensils, etc./Every night at 11 pm about 850 container trucks start moving from its exit gate on Mehrauli- Badarpur road to various warehouses within and outside the city. Most of these container trucks are old and only BS-II compliant./""Studies have shown that the area around Okhla and Tughlakabad have one of the worst air quality in the city, thanks to the heavy movement of trucks. There is a need to minimise the movement of trucks in the city, so this facility should be shifted out of the city. They can bring goods destined for Delhi through an alternative, green mode of transport,"" says Anumita Roychowdhury, head, air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). She also said that the government should immediately introduce Bharat Stage-IV emission standards which will help improve truck norms by 80 per cent./While CONCOR cites examples of dry ports in such cities as Munich and Madrid, urban affairs experts believe that as cities evolve and grow, dry port needs to be redesigned and relocated. The ICD Tughlakabad is about 17 km from Conanught Place./""When ICD was commissioned, Tughlakabad was on the periphery of the capital, but now it is very much part of south Delhi. So, it should be shifted out of the city and there can be a hierarchy of vehicles involved in the transport of goods from there to the city to ensure there is no heavy movement of trucks in the capital,"" says Prof Jagan Shah, director, National Institute of Urban Affairs./But Mithal says 'containerisation' is the most efficient measure of reducing of the volumes of cargo trucks and other transport vehicles moving in and out of the city. The better solution, he says, is to introduce BS-IV norms for trucks./""We have also been making efforts to develop container terminals around Delhi and divert cargo which is not destined for the city to our terminal in Dadri. We are planning more terminals in Sonepat, Palwal, and Khatuwas (Rajasthan) which will be operational soon. The idea is to ensure Tughlakabad terminal handles only Delhidestined containers,"" says Mithal./Local residents say that unlike in the past, container trucks arriving and departing from ICD are no longer parked on the road, but there is no escaping the stench of diesel in the air. ""In the night when hundreds of container trucks move, you smell the smoke in the air, I am sure it is killing us slowly,"" says Shiv Kumar, who lives in Prem Nagar, located close to the depot. Other colonies near the depot are Vishwakarma Colony and Pul Pehladpur./But these days, air pollution is not the only thing on Bajpai's mind. Later this month, ICD TKD will be a venue for a street art festival./""We will have art on the walls as well as on the silos of the cement plant. The idea is to introduce art to thousands of truck drivers and other labourers who come here. In fact, I also get a lot request for film shoots, a few films have been shot here,"" says Bajpai as he walks downstairs from the terrace of the CISF-guarded administrative building, which, much like a sea port, has the offices of the customs commissioner and the international shipping lines./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Patna among world's most polluted cities,"PATNA, Jan. 11 -- Patna may not be at par with some big cities in terms of infrastructure, but when it comes to air pollution, it more than matches up to them. The air quality index here - very poor to severe (434 on Jan 7 & 379 on Jan 9) - is worse than Delhi's and has earned the state capital the notoriety of being among the world's 20 most polluted cities./Patna's pollution is from known sources. Emissions from road transport, brick kilns, diesel generator sets, domestic cooking and heating, open waste burning, dust on roads and construction activities, are the main contributors of air pollution./According to data available with the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), the annual average respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10 - less than 10 micron size) for 2014-15 was 214 against the standard of 60 microns per cubic metre (ug/m3)./During the same period, the finer respirable suspended particulate matter (PM2.5 - less than 2.5 micron size), which directly goes into the lungs on inhaling, was 110-120 against the standard 40 ug/m3./A 2014 project, ""Characterising P a t n a 's Ambient Air Quality and Assessing Opportunities for Policy Intervention"", by the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, New Delhi, says that the PM10concentrations averaged 140 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) in 2012./This was more than Mumbai (97ug/m3) and Nashik (113ug/ m3). But Delhi (261ug/m3), Amritsar (219ug/m3) and Ludhiana (214ug/m3) were much higher then. However, over the years, Patna has now caught up with the most 'polluting' states./The high PM10 level is attributed to increasing number of vehicles and growing congestion in the city. The registration of new vehicles has increased exponentially over the last 10-15 years./Against 16,073 vehicles registered in Patna during 2000-01 and 19,633 during 2004-05, it had shot up to 1,01,299 in 2014-15 - a growth of 416% in the last decade. In 2015, till last November, 76,068 vehicles had been registered in Patna./With vehicles going up, the transport department, other than undertaking pollution check drives, is yet to formalise an effective plan to curb air pollution in the state capital./The region also has the largest number of brick kilns - 520 as per 2014-15 figures available with the district administration, even as the BSPCB had given its consent to establishing of 600 brick kilns./These kilns, with inefficient combustion technology, using a mix of biomass and coal for combustion, are also a source of pollution. While the clusters of brick kilns are more than 10km away from the heart of the city, they still contribute up to 11% air pollution in the city centre./Of late, however, as the consciousness about pollution grew, the district administration has demolished 11 brick kilns and taken action against several others./Building construction activity in the open also contributes to air pollution. With as much as 2,500 multi-storied buildings already in place in the capital and many more coming up, it is not surprising that in 2010-11, the official production of sand and bricks was 31,53,600 and 1,50,000 tonnes, respectively./Among the diffused sources of pollution, domestic cooking and heating; open waste burning and diesel generator sets, top the list./According to the 2011 Census, 29% households still use a nongas stove for cooking and heating purposes in the city./Garbage bur ning in the residential areas emit substantial amount of pollutants and toxins. According to the city development plan submitted to the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewable Mission (JNNURM), Patna metropolitan produces an estimated 1,200 tonnes of solid waste per day./The landfill facility, however, has a capacity to handle only 600 to 1000 tonnes of waste per day, prompting the excess garbage to be burnt at an estimated 500 makeshift sites in the city. This also contributes to air pollution./With shortage of electricity, most business establishments and residential apartments supplement their electricity needs with diesel generator sets. The study by the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation estimated the total diesel consumption in generator sets at 7 PJ (picojoules - one million millionth [10-12] of a joule), approximately 10-15% of the total energy consumption in the transport sector./With less than 9,000 industrial units functional out of 16,866 registered (August 2014 data of the District Industry Centre, Patna), the one good thing is that gaseous emissions, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone, are well within normal limits./The high particulate matter concentration, however, has a direct impact on health. It is estimated that 2,600 premature deaths, 200,000 asthma attacks, and 1,100 cardiac admissions were reported in 2012 due to poor ambient air quality in Patna. If no control measures are introduced, it is estimated that 4,900 premature deaths, 507,000 asthma attacks, and 2,850 cardiac admissions may occur by 2030./""An average daily 25 of the 50 patients we check for spirometry (to assess lung condition), suffer from restrictive lung diseases./With reduced vital capacity, they are likely to develop cardiac obstructive pulmonary disease, the acute exacerbation of which can be fatal. Such cases are increasing by the day,"" says Dr Ashok Shankar Singh, professor of TB and chest diseases department, Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH)./Renal specialist Dr Pankaj Hans says, ""The time lag to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD), which is the last spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is shortened, reducing the lifespan of patients with renal failure, having chest infection as well.""/Against this backdrop, the authorities need to put in place an effective mechanism for emission control. Such measures, says environmentalist Prof Bihari Singh of AN College, can be technology, land use (relocation) and operational changes for the brick kiln; introduction of cleaner fuel for vehicles, which currently has access to only Bharat-3 type fuel; improvements in the public and para-transit systems and introduction of alternative fuel (CNG) for these modes; targeting the diesel generator sets; and controlling dust suspension on roads./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Noise, smoke pollute Sector 55","Nioda, Jan. 11 -- First class civic amenities inside Sector 55 make this area one of the best maintained colonies in the city. However, heavy movement of vehicles around the sector that cause noise and air pollution has made the lives of residents miserable./The sector has 1,200 houses and was developed in 1984. It is a relatively small sector that has 800 plots and 400 flats./POLLUTION, A CONCERN Residents said the presence of well laid roads around the sector was boon initially but with growing occupancy of the city, it has turned curse for them as there is a heavy volume of traffic round-the-clock on these roads./""The sector is surrounded by major roads on all four sides./Houses situated along the periphery are worst affected by the constant honking and smoke emission from the vehicles running on roads surrounding the sector. We raised the issue with the traffic police and demanded a diversion of routes. But no action has been taken so far,"" said Mehak Singh, a resident of Sector 55./However, the police say diverting traffic is not possible. ""The demand to divert traffic from the periphery of Sector 55 is not feasible. Roads that surround the sector are main roads and cater to a high volume of traffic throughout the day,"" said Dharmendra Singh, traffic inspector, Noida./RUSTED ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE Residents complained that rusted and damaged iron electricity poles are posing a threat to motorists and residents in the sector./They complained that electricity infrastructure needed to be upgraded, but the department is not taking any notice of the rusted electricity poles, which need to be replaced immediately./""Many of the damaged electricity poles have been straightened out with some unprofessional adjustments, but it has started to tilt again and could lead to fatal accidents. Electricity supply often gets affected due to damaged poles or faults in wiring,"" the RWA president said./Mukul Singhal, superintending engineer with the electricity department said that he will instruct members of the division concerned to survey the sector and replace the rusted electricity poles./NEED FOR PLAYGROUND Residents demand a playground for children in the sector. ""The authority should develop a playground in the green belt area available in the sector. Children have no room to play outdoor games. We do not have a club facility in the sector either,"" said Rajiv Sharma, a resident of sector 55./Authority said it has responded to each problem registered by residents of Sector 55.

'TRY ODD-EVEN MODEL IN CITY',"umbai, Jan. 13 -- Ten days after the Delhi administration introduced the odd-even experiment to regulate the number of cars on roads in the National Capital Region, a city activist has approached the Bombay high court seeking implementation of similar measures to curb vehicular pollution in the city./Activist Shadaab Patel has sought a direction to the state authorities to introduce the odd-even experiment in the city in order to regulate the number of vehicles plying on city roads. The Bandra resident has contended that Mumbai is not far behind the NCR in terms of air pollution, especially by diesel vehicles./In a public interest litigation filed through advocate Jayant Bardeskar, Patel has relied on the air quality monitoring done by the US embassy, which found the air quality index (AQI) for Delhi at 360 and that for Mumbai at 191. According to the US environment protection agency, while EPA beyond 300 is considered hazardous for health, the index between 150 and 200 is considered unhealthy./According to the environment protection agency, higher value of AQI - beyond 150 - results in serious aggravation of heart or lung diseases, among others. The Bandra resident said if no preventive steps are taken at this stage, the air quality will soon reach hazardous level./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Govt finally wakes up to NGT order,"Faridabad, Jan. 16 -- As pollution has become a subject of serious debate this winter despite National Green Tribunal's earlier order banning burning of garbage, the government in Haryana has finally decided to act against the menace. T hough, the administration in Faridabad is yet to strictly implement NGT order, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar's swift action in a case in Sonipat district has woken up district officials in Faridabad also./""I am aware of how burning of dry leaves and household waste causes environmental pollution. This issue is being seriously looked into,"" said Chander Prakash, deputy commissioner, Faridabad. ""I have decided to call a meeting of all elected sarpanch and panch to decide the course of action in their areas,"" he said. ""NGT order banning burning of dry leaves etc is being strictly implemented,"" he added./Acting on a complaint made on Twitter regarding the burning of garbage, the Chief Minister's Office had recently directed the Sonipat Deputy Commissioner to address the issue. The complainant had reported on Twitter about garbage being burnt at an empty plot, an officials release said./""A s soon as Deputy Commissioner Rajiv Ratan got the complaint, he sent Executive Officer( E O ), Municipal Corporation, Rohtash Bishnoi and EO, HUDA, Vijay Rathee, to the spot. Finding that some private garbage collectors were burning the garbage, the duo war ned them that action would be taken under the NGT order in this matter,"" the officials said./However, burning of such waste is a common sight in different parts of this industrial township with no serious effort from the implementing agencies./Though, the NGT order specifies the authorities responsible for violation of its order, there is still confusion among officials on this issue./""Garbage burning has been going on in our campus and after NGT order, this has continued,"" said a resident of NH4 area, Faridabad. ""We expected that NGT orders will be followed to effectively check air pollution, but bur ning of leaves and other waste continues,"" he added./The safaikaramcharis take burning as the easiest way to get rid of the garbage collected from the residential campus. Even before the NGT order, some residents had raised this issue with the safaikaramcharis, but they did not listen. Even now, the situation has not changed, said another resident./""I have been telling the safaikaramcharis that the smoke from burning of garbage pollutes the air and has adverse impact on health, but they continue to bur n the waste,"" said Kapil Kumar, another resident./""I have asked health officers to launch awareness campaigns about the NGT order and that punitive action will be taken against defaulters,"" said Ashok Sharma, former Commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF). Sharma is now deputy commissioner Palwal and additional deputy commissioner of Faridabad./As part of its efforts to check air pollution, NGT had on April 28 banned burning of waste in the open. The tribunal also announced a fine of Rs 5,000 for violation of the order./The bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar made it clear that all authorities are duty bound to oblige with the orders. The bench said it had data to support the view that waste of burning is responsible for a major portion of emissions in the city. Nearly 29.4% of the total PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) are from waste burning, the bench had said./""For every incident of burning of such material, the person who is actually found burning or responsible for burning would be liable to pay compensation in terms of Section 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 under the principle of polluter pays,"" the bench had said adding that the money collected would be used for restoration of environment./The green panel said that in case an offender refuses to comply with the orders, the officer-in-charge would be at liberty to serve show cause notice to him for appearing before the Tribunal and explain why he shall not pay compensation./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Residents shiver as mercury falls by 6 degrees, thick fog cover to continue","NOIDA, Jan. 16 -- Residents of the city felt the winter chill on Friday as the maximum temperature fell by six degrees. A thick layer of fog enveloped Noida and Greater Noida throughout the day./The maximum temperature in the city was recorded at 13 degree Celsius. It was 19 degrees on Thursday and 23 degrees on Wednesday. The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 25 degree Celsius, two notches above normal for this time of the season./The fog blanket was so thick that several tall under-construction buildings in Noida and Greater Noida West were not visible./The meteorological department said that Saturday would witness fog.

Your city's future is going up in smoke,"umbai, Jan. 19 -- An invisible, silent killer is slowly taking over the air you breathe, and it is time you knew. This poisonous pollutant, otherwise known as Particulate Matter 1 (PM1), is made up of ultrafine dust particles, spewed from vehicle exhausts and construction activities. And don't be fooled by their size. They may be less than one micron, but they can lodge deep inside your lungs and enter your bloodstream./But that is not the worst part. What is even more worrisome is that ever since Indian scientists began observing their levels six months ago, the concentration of these particles has been steadily on the rise. The clincher: There are no established permissible limits - not in India or any country in the world./From 15 microgrammes per cubic metre (mu g/m3) in July 2015, PM1 concentration in the air increased three-fold to 45 mu g/m3 in December. The concentration of PM1 was 13 mu g/m3, 19mu g/m3, 33mu g/m3 and 37mu g/m3 in August, September, October and November respectively. ""The initial impression was that since these particles (PM1) were so small they would leave the body without any damage. But research studies showed that these are deadly pollutants,"" Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist, Lilavati Hospital, Bandra./The rise in PM1 levels can be attributed to the 2.54 million vehicles in Mumbai, according to the civic body's Environment Status Report 2015, which has also found a spike in nitrogen dioxide l evels across the city./""It i s found that 30-40% contribution within PM2.5 ( pollutant particles of the size of 2.5 microns) is of PM1. If the current trend of bad air quality continues, Mumbai will surpass Delhi by 2020. Mumbai will frequently breathe 'severe' level of air quality, and morbidity and mortality rates will increase due to respiratory ailments,"" said Gufran Beig, scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, and project director, SAFAR, which monitors PM levels./For the past two months, the air quality index (AQI) that measures six pollutants has been in either the 'very poor' or 'poor' category, indicating a health alert for Mumbaiites. ""The rise in pollution levels is because of fuel combustion from diesel and private vehicles,"" said Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute. ""More private vehicles cause traffic congestion, releasing toxic fumes that deteriorate the city's air quality.""/Scientists fear health implications of rising PM1 levels in the form of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. ""PM1 is found to be higher in locations close to slum areas because of biofuel emissions from domestic cooking and open burning,"" said Vivek Chattopadhyay, deputy coordinator, air pollution unit, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi./According to a NEERI study from 201011, around one-third of PM pollution was recorded from local area sources - like bakeries - responsible for high levels of pollutants. ""Increased developmental activities like municipal solid waste, incineration, and other energy intensive activities increase the respirable fraction of particulate matter leading to air pollution,"" said Padma Rao, head, air pollution control division, NEERI. ""Meteorological conditions alone may not be sufficient for dispersion of pollutants. There is an urgent need to take note of how we can treat the problem before the city runs out of options.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"'At current pollution levels, Mumbai will surpass Delhi by 2020'","umbai, Jan. 19 -- HT spoke to Dr Gufran Beig, scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology about how high pollution levels could affect the city in the future. Beig, who has 33 years of experience in the field of air quality, weather and climate sciences, launched System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) in Pune in 2013. It was launched in Mumbai - in collaboration with the IMD and the BMC - in June 2015./What are the major contributors for the rise in air pollution levels in the city?/Particulate matter - PM1, PM 2.5 and PM10 - is a major contributor and is linked to health problems, including heart, lung diseases. Exposure to it in the short term (days) and long term (months, years), could aggravate asthma, respiratory symptoms and an increase in hospital admissions./Real-time air quality data has indicated that Mumbai's air quality is worsening. Why?/While real-time air quality data monitoring cannot provide trends, our observations have shown that air quality is good during the monsoon season because particulate pollutants get washed away. It starts to deteriorate in the summer and is the worst in winter owing to the lowering of inversion/boundary layer, which traps the pollutants near the surface of the earth./Does Mumbai come close to Delhi/when it comes to air pollution?/At the current pace and the trend observed by SAFAR, emissions are increasing from transport and industrial sources. If this continues, Mumbai will catch up with Delhi. But in Mumbai, pollution doesn't accumulate rapidly as pollutants are swept away/with sea breeze and fast-moving winds./If the current trend of bad air quality continues in Mumbai, what could be the situation by 2020?/Mumbai will surpass Delhi. We will frequently breathe 'severe' level of air quality./What role does a lack of open and green spaces in Mumbai combined with taller concrete structures and vehicles play in air pollution?/The lack of open spaces traps pollutants, preventing them from getting dispersed,. The absence of green cover deteriorates the air quality, while cars contribute heavily to PM2.5 emissions./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

The heart of the pollution problem,"umbai, Jan. 22 -- Air pollution triggers respiratory diseases - this is well known. But did you know researchers are increasingly linking toxic air to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases?/One in four cases of Type II diabetes - a chronic condition where the body is unable to produce enough insulin, leading to a rise in sugar levels - in the world is found in the Indian subcontinent, which has 23% of the population. Recent estimates suggest 62.4 million Indians live with diabetes, another 4.6 million have tuberculosis (TB). In Mumbai, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and TB are the top three killers, according to municipal records./The concerns that air pollution's effects are not limited to lung ailments has set off a host of studies. In Mumbai, the Foundation of Medical Research, a government-recognised institute, is planning a study to find out how pollutants play a role in causing and worsening tuberculosis and diabetes symptoms. ""Air pollution can bring a dual set of epidemic of diabetes and TB,"" said Dr N Mistry, director and trustee of the facility, which recently did a presentation on air pollutants and possible pathways that could make a person susceptible to developing diabetes and TB./Head of department of medicine, Jaslok Hospital, Dr Altaf Patel, said there is enough evidence linking air pollution to non-communicable diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. ""The inflammation caused by air pollutants affects the heart's arteries. The inflammation leads to thickening of blood vessels and causes a heart attack. People think air pollution can only affect the lungs and worsen respiratory conditions, but there is more to it,"" said Dr Patel./Researchers are trying to piece together the link between air pollution and cardiovascular deaths. The Expert Position Paper on Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease published in the European Heart Journal last year showed oxidative stress, a condition that impairs the body's energy production and repair mechanism thesis, and inflammation caused by pollutants can affect heart rhythm, leading to arrhythmia that may result in a heart failure./Calling air pollution a global public health concern, Dr Sanjay Rajgopalan, professor of medicine and physiology at University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, said, ""Some studies show ambient air pollution can lead to insulin resistance, an underlying condition that causes diabetes."" Dr Rajgopalan has published scientific papers explaining this association. He said studies suggest air pollution aggravates heart conditions and appears to have a role in its development./Echoing the view, Dr Patel said about 40 years ago, the incidence of diabetes was extremely low. ""Suddenly, we are recording so many cases. Genetics alone cannot be responsible, as the genetic pool takes years to change. The role of pollutants should be probed,"" said Dr Patel./In fact, Dr Mistry's team has designed a study to understand the impact of exposure to pollution on incidence of communicable and non-communicable diseases. ""We will study changes in the internal biochemistry of an individual exposed to pollutants and the onset of diabetes and TB. Such changes are known to trigger conversion of latent to active TB,"" said Dr Mistry./Public health experts said air pollution is not just a matter of vehicular emissions. Small factories in slums and the way homes are built lead to exposure. To illustrate, a study in Govandi slums showed homes had only one to two air exchanges over 15 hours, against the ideal seven to eight. Air exchange is the replacement of air inside a building with fresh air from outside./Hyderabad-based diabetologist, Dr PV Rao, said, ""We know children born to mothers exposed to pollution can develop diabetes and thyroid. There are studies about emissions from common implements such as non-stick pans. We cannot ignore the role of pollution.""

"18-storey toxic tower, scrap mafia: Why Mumbai is choking on bad air","umbai, Feb. 1 -- Air quality in Mumbai continued to be ""very poor"" on Monday, four days after a mystery fire at the city's largest dumping ground left it struggling with record levels of air pollution. Here's what we know about the landfill, which has seen recurrent fires and futile efforts by local residents to have it shut down./AN 18-STOREY TOXIC TOWER/On January 28, fire brigade authorities get a call about a blaze at the Deonar landfill, which receives 6,000 metric tonnes of waste daily, including 600 tonnes of silt and 25 tonnes of bio-medical waste every day. Between March and June, the daily deposit of silt touches more than 9,000 metric tonnes because of drain cleaning in preparation of the monsoon. The dump, the city's oldest, is often as tall as an 18-storey building./Spread across 326 acres, the dumping ground is located on the eastern suburbs, close to the crowded neighbourhoods of Chembur, Sion and Navi Mumbai which are worst affected by last week's fire. The city has two other major landfills in Mulund and Kanjurmarg./ASTHMA WOES AND DYING BABIES/Recurrent fires at the dump pose grave health hazards to local residents who have complained of everything from acute asthma and skin rashes to higher infant mortality rates. In 2008, many residents of Chembur went on a hunger strike to protest against illegal burning of fires at the landfill. Four years later, Chembur residents protest with the civic authorities, particularly pointing to the rising incidence of asthma among them./Last year, several surveys identified the localities around Deonar as the city's most polluted. Officials figures show infant mortality in the nearby areas nearly doubles the average of the city at 60.80 per 1000 live births, although there are no studies directly linking the fatalities to the landfill./STOMPING GROUND OF SCRAP MAFIA/The Deonar dumping ground regularly reports fires, often started by errant contractors and the scrap mafia trying to separate iron, copper and other metals from the garbage. Fires are also lit illegally to manage dumping levels. The facility has little surveillance; has no CCTV cameras or guards. Last week's fire has also been blamed in a police complaint on dumping ground contractors and unnamed rag-pickers and the scrap mafia./Past police complaints in similar incidences of fire have also blamed unidentified saboteurs. Convictions are almost nil./WHERE DO THINGS STAND NOW?/The amount of smoke from the dump has reduced and the air quality has improved marginally since Friday when the city recorded its worst air pollution since monitoring began in last June.On Monday, seven out of 10 locations in Mumbai recorded ""very poor"" levels. Chembur continued to be the most polluted location for the fourth day in a row with an air quality index of 363 while locations such as Andheri recorded 355 and Malad and Mazgaon both recorded 330. Dozens of schools remained shut for the fourth day Monday. Fire tenders and civic officials continue to fight the fire, which they said had been controlled but not doused yet./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Deonar dump fire yet to be doused,"umbai, Feb. 3 -- With the richest civic body, which has a solid waste management allocation of more than Rs300 crore unable to contain the fire in one of the city's biggest dumping ground for six days, the fire brigade is now sprinkling magnesium chloride (hydrant) on the garbage, as suggested by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)./Read more: 'Very poor' air quality in Mumbai after Deonar fire here to stay/The sporadic fire in some pockets, which the experts said is because of methane trapped in the garbage, has led to smoke covering the area from Chembur, Deonar, Govandi to as far as Andheri. NEERI has also suggested the BMC install methane recovery wells to release methane from the dumping ground. Residents around the dumping ground complained of aggravated fire on Monday night too./Read more: Smogged out: Mumbai reeling under air pollution/""The fire is under control but not completely doused as some pockets continue to burn. Earlier, we tried using water and mud to control the heat. Each dump is emanating methane, which adds to the he fire. We are now sprinkling magnesium chloride on the garbage. It is proving to be helpful and has reduced the smoke considerably,"" said a fire officer./Deonar has exceeded the limits of garbage being dumped. Fire officers said the mismanagement could lead to a wildfire-like situation./Local corporator Rais Shaikh alleged no senior official are present at night, leading to chaos and absence of a fire-fighting operation. ""We are staying put at night to ensure the fire-fighting operations go on smoothly,"" he said./Fire officials complained that no officer from the solid waste management department has entered inside the dumping ground to provide technical support. Mayor Snehal Ambekar, leader of the house Trushna Vishwasrao and standing committee chairman Yashodhar Phanse visited the Deonar dumping ground on Tuesday. The Congress on protested outside the municipal chief's cabin, demanding closure of the dumping ground./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Chemical scientists could find out the solutions to the sufferings of the humanity.""/He said, ""Today we are facing many problems like garbage, agriculture waste, solid waste, water and air pollution. How the pollution and disease related to the unsustainable use, production and disposal of chemicals can hinder progress towards key development targets by affecting water supplies, food security and well-being. So, reducing hazards and improving chemical management should be an essential part of research. We can make the maximum use of waste just like the developed countries with help of our chemical scientists,"" said the V-C./Meanwhile, P Balaram, for mer director of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, was the chief guest and delivered the keynote address.

Internal roads feel the pressure,"New Delhi, Feb. 3 -- Internal colony roads are bearing the brunt of the endless traffic jams that cripple vehicular movement on the Capital's arteries almost every day. To avoid snarls on the main roads, drivers take detours through colonies because of which there has been a steep rise in traffic movement in residential areas./A study conducted by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in August 2015 shows colony roads in many south Delhi localities experienced at least three times more traffic than their original capacity./The study conducted in three localities - Alaknanda, CR Park and Greater Kailash - revealed startling facts about the unprecedented congestion and the lack of planning in Delhi's colonies./A major observation made in the study was that these colonies experienced over four times more on-street parking than the space available, adding to the congestion./""During peak traffic hours, the time taken to cross these stretches nearly doubles. This adds to pollution, congestion, daily stress and trauma. The lack of public transport, poor and unsafe local access and free parking has turned this area into a congestion nightmare,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director and head of the CSE's air pollution control unit./Roychowdhury said that apart from contributing to ending traffic hauls, during winters these areas recorded some of the worst pollution levels./Ironically, when the Delhi government is promising more buses, some parts of the city such as Chittaranjan Park have seen massive curtailment of bus services, increasing dependency on cars in these neighbourhoods./The Delhi Traffic Police observed a similar trend in colonies across the city. Senior officials said that on days when the main roads were packed with vehicles, internal roads faced a worse situation. In fact internal roads experienced twice as much vehicular movement on such days./""The road network in Delhi is not keeping pace with the vehicular growth and the growth is increasing with every passing day. The load on the roads is increasing and this not only contributes to congestion but also pollution. Every day, over 1,500 private vehicles are added on the roads. What else can we expect?"" said Muktesh Chander, special commissioner of police (traffic)./According to health guidelines laid down by World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2013, residential colonies in a city should be at least 100 metres away from a main road./In contrast, a study conducted by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) shows that over 70% of the colonies in Delhi-NCR do not follow this guideline./Doctors and pulmonary experts warn of serious health implications in colonies near main roads. Constant exposure to vehicular emission (at home and outside) may cause lung diseases, blood pressure and cardiac problems./Topping the list of the most polluted and congested neighbourhoods are Malviya Nagar (near Khirki Extension and Hauz Rani), South Extension, Anand Vihar and Rajender Nagar./""The authorities are looking at big arterial roads and solutions like public transport. However, there is a need to look at what is happening at the doorstep of residents. If the localities are clogged, the residents are becoming a part of the problem as well as victims. Big solutions for the city will come from local solutions,"" Roychowdhury said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Five reasons why Delhi air will never be clean,"New Delhi, Feb. 5 -- Air pollution in the capital will never come down to safe limits because of a geographical disadvantage, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) told the Delhi High Court on Thursday./While controlling industrial and vehicular emissions and agricultural fires helps to bring down toxins in the air, little can be done about Delhi's unique geography and weather conditions that contribute to its lung-smothering toxic haze. Here's why./Geographical disadvantage/The Himalayas in the north and the Vindhyas in the south prevents polluted air from dissipating, trapping it over the Indo-Gangetic plain./The temperature inversion in December and January further compounds this problem, with suspended particulates - a mixture of dust, organic carbon, black carbon, sulphates and nitrates - lowering visibility by settling low over ground./Dust storms/Sandstorms from the neighbouring Thar desert, construction dust from Delhi and the NCR, and deforestation in the mountains around Delhi add to dust and suspended particles./Agricultural fires/Fires to clear agricultural stubble after harvest in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, forest fires in Himachal and Uttrakhand, leaf burning, and cooking and heating stoves used for warmth add to the visibility-lowering fine particulates and carbon that are major constituents of smog./Emissions/Emissions from vehicles, coal-fired power plants, brick kilns and factories add nitrates, sulphates and black carbon. These add to winter smog, which is produced when airborne dust, carbon particles, noxious gases and ozone react chemically in the presence of sunlight and moisture to create a toxic mist./Weather/Air is the cleanest in the spring and monsoons, but quickly deteriorates after harvest in October and November, when the farmers start burning stubble to clear their fields for the next crop./The notorious winter smog is formed when moisture droplets sit on the suspended particulates and react with gases to form the muddy-brown haze that's become a part of Delhi winter. Damp conditions and high humidity add to haze and lower visibility, which explains why the dry conditions this year resulted in the clearest nights Delhi has had in several years./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Deonar fire: It's time to blaze into action,"umbai, Feb. 5 -- The fire that has been raging at the Deonar dumping ground has cast a pall of gloom - literally and metaphorically - all over Mumbai. ""How could this threat have been ignored for so long?"" is the constant refrain I have heard over the past week./For those who would like to believe that the problem is localised, let me warn that there are no 'safe' areas in such situations. It is not only 'downmarket' Deonar, as one ill-informed and arrogant townie described it, that will suffer./The shadow and stench of burning waste has covered the entire city, making all claims of geographical superiority pointless. In any case, it is so absurd to believe that the air over any area remains static that a rebuttal itself is foolish./Without trying to be preachy, it is now well known that the planet responds to how we treat it: if care and concern is lacking, it can be unsparing./Read more: Pollutant particles near Deonar were 8 times more than permissible limit/Specific to the problem on hand, if those who live in and those who administrate cities are either ignorant or callous about maintaining it, there can be hell to pay, as Mumbai is realising to its great cost./Just as Delhi has been struggling to recover from its smothering pollution despite some serious crisis management (let's abstain from the politics of it), the portents for Mumbai are equally - if not more - ominous./Read more: Photo gallery: Mumbai reeling under air pollution/The wind carries poison all over the city. As if things were not already bad enough with rising pollution from vehicular traffic, construction dust and industry./It is tempting to look back at an earlier Mumbai where Chembur was jokingly called ""Chambers"" because of industrial pollution from factories in the area or when Parel and Labaug were avoided by everybody who didn't work and/or live there because of the textile mills./That was also a time when everyone smoked in closed spaces and no one was concerned because the debilitating effects of smoking were not as widely known as they are now./The only saving grace was that very few people owned cars, but with economic growth, this was never going to remain the case always. The argument about better public transport and road planning becomes stronger, but that's another issue./Fact is, the ill-effects of pollution are now all too well-known to us and no one is immune or safe. The sea helps Mumbai by clearing the air, but the sea is constantly abused by the city: whether it is rubbish chucked into it by the general public or untreated sewage by the authorities./And there we reach the nub of the problem - all the authorities that rule Mumbai and help each other in the great game of passing the buck. If one single matchstick carelessly thrown- which has been attributed as the cause - can set off a fire in a dump, far, far away for more than a week without relenting, the consequences for Mumbai are frightening./There are other colossally scary dimensions too. The Deonar dump was reportedly almost 22 storeys high; and rising, because 6,000 tonnes of rubbish were being added to it every day! How come this never caught attention?/News channels were outraged earlier this week that many BMC corporators were on a junket to the Andamans, as the Deonar fire broke out. But the problem is older and more serious than that./The BMC is still the primary agency that runs Mumbai, but subsequent state governments and endless political wrangling have brought things to a pass where fingers are pointed everywhere, but a few remedies are provided./The Deonar ground should have been closed years ago. Instead, it is now several metres high; an edifice that is not just ugly and unaesthetic, but also a major environmental and health threat to Mumbai./If this fire is not a wake-up call, what is?/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

India's cities are faced with a severe waste management crisis,"umbai, Feb. 7 -- Travelling from central Delhi towards Ghazipur in the city's east, the first warning that you get of the approaching landfill is the sight of circling birds of prey. The mound of waste itself becomes visible much before one is assaulted by its stench. Smoke rises steadily from the pile, as the decomposing waste generates highly combustible methane gas./None of this bothers 10-year-old Jeevan and 12-year-old Devender as they make their way to the top. For years, the two have spent much of their time at the Ghazipur landfill - picking, sorting and selling waste. Without the protection of gloves or masks, the boys, like most ragpickers working at dumping sites across India, are vulnerable to infections and illnesses. ""Often we cut ourselves on bits of discarded glass or metal,"" says Jeevan. But they show no animosity towards the waste that helps them earn a living./Not just the ragpickers, most of those living and working in the neighbourhood have made peace with the trash. Two girls take a shortcut through the landfill on their way to the neighbouring dairy. A couple walks hand-in-hand through the dump. Markets, houses and places of worship dot the land just outside the 32-year-old landfill - in blatant disregard of the specifications introduced in the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, which requires landfills to be ""away from habitation clusters""./An officer at the Central Pollution Control Board says existing landfills are facing problems because of encroachment. ""The old dump sites had no buffer zone,"" he says./When it comes to waste management in India, little is the way it's meant to be. Mumbai literally raised a stink recently when a fire broke out at the Deonar landfill, severely compromising air quality in the city. The national capital too is fast becoming one huge garbage dump with civic body sanitation workers on a strike to protest against non-payment of salaries./""We need to learn from Sweden, which is a zero waste country. We need to learn from countries like Sri Lanka, which is segregating its waste, or Bhutan where everybody is conscious to not pollute their land,"" says Swati Singh Sambyal, programme officer, sustainable industrialisation, Centre for Science and Environment./While a landfill fire or a strike by workers is not an everyday issue, activists insist we are following a flawed system of waste disposal and management. The Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 gives detailed specifications for collection, segregation, storage, transportation, processing and disposal of MSW./The metro cities and major economic hubs generate the maximum volume of waste, but a survey of 20 smaller cities selected to be developed as smart cities show that most are struggling to manage waste. And activists feel The Smart City planhas not given as much weightage to management of waste as it has to infrastructure and development./This includes directives to municipal authorities to organise awareness programmes for citizens to encourage segregation and recycling. Most activists too push for segregation at source and feel a strict framework of laws and the fear of penalty is needed to make people comply. ""Our policy has to mandate segregation and penalise all households and institutions that do not segregate at source,"" says Sambyal./In its absence, most people do not even bother to make the most basic dry and wet waste segregation. ""Whatever little recycling is happening is because of our waste pickers, who are recycling about 20-25% of our waste. The government should make them contract employees and provide them with space to work. Formal recognition will give them regulated work hours, pay and health benefits,"" says Chitra Mukherjee, head of programmes, operations, Chintan, an NGO./In Bhopura near the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, Chintan runs a waste recycling unit where approximately 70 wastepickers work in hygienic conditions. The dry waste is recycled and wet waste composted. ""Only 10-15 per cent of the waste that we get is sent to landfills,"" says Jai Prakash Choudhury, secretary of the Safai Sena, a registered organisation of waste pickers and recyclers who work alongside Chintan to run waste recycling units like the one in Bhopura./Instead, what the government is doing is looking for more landfills when even the existing ones are flawed. ""Many municipalities simply dump the waste and claim these dumps are landfills. Landfilling should be done only for inorganic wastes and the rejects after processing./The landfilled waste should be compacted and put under soil cover daily so that there is no fear of pollution,"" says the CPCB official. With land being at a premium across urban India, most landfills in the country are also way past the saturation period. ""Improper waste management causes problems such as air pollution from burning of wastes both at landfill sites and in open areas and pollution of groundwater (from leachate - the liquid residue that forms as water seeps through contaminated areas and mixes with surface and groundwater),"" says Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organisation (South-East Asia Region)./At the Ghazipur landfill site, where the civic body is running a waste-to-energy plant on trial, locals complain of pollution. Last year, the National Green Tribunal ordered an inspection of the waste-to-energy plant in the capital's Okhla area after residents raised similar concerns./""Plastic and metals are the major source of the calorific value of the waste. The combustion of plastics gives rise to highly toxic pollutants,"" says Sambyal. The CPCB officer, however, feels such plants can be operated without causing environmental pollution if proper measures are installed. While that may or may not be true, Sambyal believes the very model is not correct for India./""Fifty-five per cent of our waste is organic, thus its calorific value is low, unlike in countries like Germany and Sweden, where the majority of waste that goes to incinerators has high content of plastic and packaging material,"" she points out. Sambyal pushes for decentralisation in waste management, where waste is segregated and treated locally./""Our state policy must discourage landfills. In no time, these dump sites will catch fire, which are often difficult to extinguish because they burn through methane, plastic, and other highly flammable substances,"" she warns. The fire at Deonar was finally extinguished on Friday, 10 days after it broke out. Unless we take stock of our waste management, the only thing that might remain uncertain is the site of the next crisis./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

But discussions on who should be spared the curbs are still on./The date was chosen to ensure students writing their school boards were not affected. The exams will end on April 12./The CM said two-wheelers couldn't be brought within the purview of the scheme because of the city's inadequate public transport system. ""Public transport needs to be improved. By December we will have 3,000 new buses. We are planning an elevated BRT (bus rapid transport) corridor with two levels, one for cars and another for buses. Until all these happen, odd-even can't be permanent,"" he said./The announcement came on the day the Aam Aadmi Party government made public results of opinion from people which is ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of reintroduction of the scheme./Overall 81% of respondents want odd-even back and more than 60% said the formula should be made permanent, the CM said. The government got 4.1 lakh responses from the public through multiple channels./Kejriwal said implementing the formula for a fortnight every month could be explored because it would mean six days of inconvenience for an individual but also relief for 15 days./""The number of buses will be increased. Traffic enforcement teams will be allowed to penalise people,"" he said, announcing that 500 retired defence personnel will be hired as traffic enforcement inspectors./Offenders may have to shell out more than the R2,000 fine imposed during the trial run./The government requisitioned school buses to replenish the public transport system in January. But that will not be the case in April. Instead, 5,500 private buses will be hired./The government was forced to introduce the radical scheme as pollution levels in the city of 25 million consistently shot past the WHO safety standard this winter with thick smog hanging low over the sky./Besides exhaust from vehicles and smoke from industries, smog from crop residue burnt in neighbouring states added to pollution levels, prompting the national green tribunal (NGT) to ban such activities in five states in north India./The A AP government announced other measures, such as shutting down dieselfired power plants and introducing vacuum cleaning of roads./The judiciary also stepped into the war against pollution with the Supreme Court banning registration of diesel vehicles above 2000cc till March 31./However, the Central Pollution Control Board said the scheme could have a visible impact on air quality if similar experiments were carried out in the entire national capital region./The pollution watchdog reached this conclusion after analysing Delhi's air pollution for a month, including the 15 days from January 1 when the trial run was on./But thousands of people, who carpooled, took crowded buses and the Metro, reported less time-consuming commutes and less-clogged roads during the trials./Critics of the scheme said the restrictions were not radical enough as motorcyclists and women driving alone are allowed, besides a long list of exemptions such as VIPs.

"China, India account for over 50% worldwide deaths due to pollution","Beijing, Feb. 14 -- China and India account for 55% of more than 5.5 million premature deaths caused by pollution annually, latest international research has revealed./It means that more than three million deaths are caused yearly in China and India, two of the fastest growing economies of the world./""About 1.6 million people died of air pollution in China and 1.4 million died in India in 2013,"" the data compiled as part of the Global Burden of Disease study, an international collaboration led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, said./It measured health and its risk factors, including air pollution levels, for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013./The research was presented on Friday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and painted a grim picture for the future: it found that despite efforts to limit future emissions, the number of deaths linked to pollution will climb over the next two decades unless much-stricter emission and anti-pollution norms were put in place./Emission of small particles by power plants, industrial manufacturing, vehicle exhaust and burning coal and wood was the main culprits behind pollution and deaths./""In China, burning coal is the biggest contributor to poor air quality.

Fact: Five insidious ways in which air toxins destroy your health,"New Delhi, Feb. 27 -- Have you been feeling tired lately? Or irritable? Listless? More than the news headlines, it's the toxic air you're inhaling that is making you feel sick and depressed. Air pollution, mostly caused by transport, power generation, industrial or agricultural emissions and heating and cooking at home, raises risks for several illnesses, such as asthma, heart attack and stroke./But it also hurts you in far more insidious way./Here are five lesser-known ways in which bad ambient air assaults your mind and body./1 Depression/Air pollutants contain suspended chemicals, toxins and metals that reach deep into the lungs and penetrate into the brain, affecting mood and memory. Outdoor air pollution increased symptoms of depression, making people feel dissatisfied, worthless, bored, unhappy and hopeless, reports a study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. People who lived in neighbourhoods with high ambient levels of suspended dust and carbon particles (suspended particulate matter, or SPM10), nitrogen dioxide and ozone had disturbed sleep and were more prone to alcohol and substance abuse, the study found./Then there's the indirect link to mood degeneration. Studies have linked air pollution to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chronic lung disorders, which are associated with dementia and poor brain health./2 Dementia/Suspended particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and ozone raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, reports the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. The study, of close to 100,000 people, showed that even short-term exposure to particle pollution more than doubles the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Another study of close to 20,000 women living across the US published in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that over time, breathing in polluted air speeds up brain decline and contributes to the equivalent of about a two-year decline in brain function. Women who lived in areas with the worst quality air scored lowest on tests of memory and thinking than those who lived in cleaner areas, the study found./Air toxins are particularly damaging for young minds, with a study published in PLOS Medicine reporting they lower brain development in 7 to 10-year-old children. Children from schools in polluted neighbourhoods did worse in tests of working memory, superior working memory, and attentiveness, showed the year-long study of 2,715 primary school children across 39 schools in Barcelona, Spain./3 Low immunity/Chronic exposure to pollution warps the immune system and makes it mistake airborne particles for hostile pathogens, such as virus or bacteria, and launch an attack to seek and destroy them.

"Dug up lanes, debris give hard time to GK-1","New Delhi, Feb. 27 -- It has been eight months since the work of relaying storm water drains on Hansraj Gupta Marg in Greater Kailash-1 started. However, heaps of dug- up ear th on both sides of the road, outside the M-Block market and entire B-block, have been left uncleared by the Public Works Department (PWD) and the pavements remain unrepaired./The main road, which has houses on both sides, has heaps of debris, broken road signs, damaged, rusty pipes and other construction material strewn along the road. The dug-up material, besides being a nuisance to residents and commuters, creates a haze adding to air pollution. This is despite a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order about dust control, in particular, on construction sites./The pavements that were dug up to lay 6 feet diameter pipes, too have not been repaired, leaving no room for pedestrians to walk. Of the entire 2.5km project, the 1.2km stretch from B-block to Archana Complex has already been covered, even as the leftover material stays put on the road. The dug-up material scattered all over the road often leads to traffic jams before the M-block market and at the right turn from Archana Complex./While the project is still ongoing, it was to be initiated in 2014, however, work on it began only in 2015, which was also the deadline to complete work. The project is to be completed at a cost of ' 18 crore./""The PWD has made a mess of the entire stretch. The dug-up pavements and roadsides have reduced the main carriageway to two lanes only leading to traffic jams. Also, the dust in the air leaves one gasping for breath,"" said MK Gupta, member, GK residents association./After repeated complaints to the PWD, only one of the 25-30 feet patch outside gate number-1 of S-block has been repaired while all the major points are left unattended./While the mouth of the new pipes to take the rainwater from the road to the drain has not been covered, the debris has blocked the newly-laid pipes./""If they do not pay heed to the condition of the roads and the newly-laid pipes, it will be such a waste of resources with the money literally going down the drain,"" he added./A senior PWD officer said, ""We have taken up work in small stretches. We will be winding up the process soon after which the dug-up portions will be repaired.""/However, MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said, ""I am aware about the issue and any inconvenience to residents must be looked at instantly. To raise the issue, as it is a common grievance after every project, I will be meeting PWD minister Satyendra Jain on Monday. The way such public utility projects are undertaken will be changed.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

HOW AIR TOXINS HURT INSIDIOUSLY,"New Delhi, Feb. 28 -- Have you been feeling tired lately? Or irritable? Listless? It's the toxic air you're inhaling. It makes you feel sick and depressed. Air pollution, mostly caused by transport, power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions and heating and cooking at home, raises risks of several illnesses, such as asthma, heart attack and stroke. But it also hurts you in far more insidious ways./DEPRESSION/Air pollutants contain suspended chemicals, toxins and metals that penetrate into lungs and the brain, affecting mood and memory. Outdoor air pollution increases symptoms of depression, making people feel dissatisfied, worthless, bored, unhappy and hopeless, reports a study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. People who lived in neighbourhoods with high ambient levels of suspended dust and carbon particles (suspended particulate matter, or SPM10), nitrogen dioxide and ozone had disturbed sleep and were more prone to alcohol and substance abuse, the study found./Then there's the indirect link to mood degeneration. Studies have linked air pollution to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chronic lung disorders, which are associated with dementia and poor brain health./DEMENTIA/Suspended particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and ozone raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, reports the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. The study, of close to 1,00,000 people, showed that even short-term exposure to particle pollution more than doubles the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Another study of close to 20,000 women living across the US published in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that over time, breathing in polluted air speeds up brain decline and contributes to the equivalent of about a two-year decline in brain function. Air toxins are particularly damaging for young minds. They lower brain development in 7 to 10-year-old children. Children from schools in polluted neighbourhoods did worse in tests of working memory, superior working memory, and attentiveness, showed the year-long study of 2,715 primary school children across 39 schools in Barcelona, Spain./LOW IMMUNITY/Chronic exposure to pollution warps the immune system and makes it mistake airborne particles for hostile pathogens, such as virus or bacteria, and launch an attack to seek and destroy them. Fine carbon and dust particles (PM II) cause low-level inflammation that disrupts the body's immune response at several levels. A study in the Archives of Environmental and Occupational Health found that women exposed to outdoor pollution tested high for inflammation markers (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6) and functional tests of cellular immunity (natural killer cell cytotoxicity, T-lymphocyte proliferation).

City doc in a 20-yr battle for Deonar,"umbai, March 7 -- More than two decades before the major fire at Deonar dumping ground fire sparked off health concerns in the city, a Mulund resident played a vital role to douse the burning problem haunting the neighbourhoods near the city's biggest landfill./Dr Kishore Chandra Mohanty, a chest physician, had reached out to j ustice Ranganath Mishra, the then chairman of the Human Rights Association of India, to take up the matter. ""Justice Mishra held a press conference and got the state government and civic machinery's attention to the problem,"" said Mohanty./""Thanks to Mohanty's efforts, the combustion process to extract metals was stopped within a month. However, there were reports of isolated f ires but the situation was better controlled for nearly 10 years after he highlighted the problem,"" said Dr Jagdish Vithal Keny, chief medical officer, Group of Tuberculosis Hospital, Sewri. He, however, added that the violations started soon after./""From 2005, stray incidents of fire were being reported at the dumping ground. The situation has now become abysmal,"" said Keny./Undeterred by this, Mohanty continues his fight to improve the situation of neighbourhoods around city's landfills and also makes sure people become aware about protecting the environment. He founded the Environmental Medical Association that has organised 22 conferences across the country on health problems owing to air pollution and mitigation strategies./""Mohanty had submitted a proposal to the municipal corporation in the 90's to take steps to reduce air pollution by disallowing heavy motor vehicles from entering the city during the day,"" said Dr Rajendra Nanavre, medical superintendent, Group of Tuberculosis Hospital, adding that Mohanty had the foresight for tackling air pollution challenges plaguing big metros now./Mohanty, also a practicing pulmonologist, pointed out that owing to the poor air pollution levels, there has been a 100% increase in cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Mumbai in the recent years./""Environment cannot be taken as a piecemeal; it has to be tackled through a collective effort by citizens and the government to protect the future of our children before it is too late,"" he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Rain washes away heat and pollution, more showers likely","New Delhi, March 7 -- Light rain in Delhi took the sting away, temporarily, from the unusually warm weather./The city received 6.1 mm rainfall between Saturday and Sunday. The maximum temperature was recorded at 29.1 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal but lower than the maximum of 33 degrees Celsius that Delhi witnessed on several days in the past week. Another spell of rain is expected over the weekend./The minimum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 15.5 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees above normal./The long-awaited rain also cleaned the polluted air, with the city seeing moderately polluted air on Saturday and Sunday, an improvement over the very poor and poor air quality that the city saw throughout most of January and February./On Sunday, the RK Puram monitoring station recorded air quality at 108 against 500 and fell in the moderate range. At the moderate range, breathing discomfort is experienced by people suffering from respiratory and cardiac diseases./Rain helps wash away pollutants, especially particulate matter, from polluted air./Delhi barely saw any rain for five months between September and February, leading to an unusually warm winter and also a very polluted one. The city usually sees rainfall in January as well as February, which brings down temperatures as well as pollution levels./In February, the RK Puram station saw only two days with moderately polluted air. This was on days when strong winds blew. The remainder of the month saw only poor, very poor and severely polluted days./According to the Safar air pollution index, the city is expected to see moderate air quality for the coming three days./The temperature, too, is expected to be pleasant, though warm for this time of the year.

'Take care' means more than 'get well',"India, March 7 -- What is the mandate that society gives to a health ministry? Is it to provide some level of clinical care and limited financial support after people get very sick or to keep people as healthy as possible for as long as possible? The duties of a modern state require it to provide both health protection and illness care, with greater investment in the former. However, health ministries often tend to see the latter as their main task. It is not surprising, therefore, that the finance ministry sees a few disconnected benefactions to sick people as evidence of a 'health-friendly' Budget. How can it project a 'big picture' plan for health financing when the draft National Health Policy is lying untouched for over a year?/We must thank the finance minister for some good things he offers for health, both within that sector and through other sectors. Increased investment in pulses production signals an overdue recognition that the scarcity and high prices of these protein sources are depriving millions of Indians, especially children, of essential nutrition. The pledge to provide clean cooking gas and electricity to all villages dovetails well with the prime minister's call to the affluent to surrender their gas connections in favour of the poor. Universal access to clean energy will help free millions of women and children from the kitchen's curse of indoor air pollution from solid fuels, and reduce the threat of several associated diseases. While the sight of the finance minister wielding his (t)axe on cigarettes is welcome, the absolute immunity that beedis continue to enjoy makes his claim of shielding health from tobacco's harm sound untenable./Within the health sector, what catches the eye is the fillip to dialysis centres across the country. It certainly will help many patients with a chronic kidney disease. However, where is the vision to strengthen primary health services for an early detection and effective treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes? Failure to do so will result in ever-growing numbers of persons seeking dialysis and cardiac repair, when many of them could have been effectively protected from reaching an advanced stage./In 2008, Thailand included dialysis in the programme of universal health coverage on grounds of equity even though it did not meet the cost-effectiveness criterion. While professional groups argued for hemodialysis, the less expensive option of peritoneal dialysis was chosen for government funding and trained nurses have been providing this service even at patients' homes. At each stage, the decisions were guided by health technology assessments (HTAs)./The choice of health technologies to be prioritised for government funding is guided, in many countries, by a formal process of HTA, which combines evidence of clinical effectiveness with considerations of comparative cost-effectiveness, affordability and equity. In Britain, this function is performed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which guides the National Health Service. In Thailand, the HITAP (Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Programme), an autonomous arm of the ministry of public health, performs this role. In India, we do not have any institution that provides such analytic support to the health ministry, which in turn should appropriately advise the finance ministry. Ideally, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) should establish a multi-disciplinary expert group analogous to NICE or HITAP. Recent cuts in the budget of the ICMR do not bode well for that./Who will bear the cost of recurrent dialysis and on what scale? The cost of supporting dialysis rose from 0.2% of the Thai health budget in 2008 to 3.4% by 2012. Thailand launched a massive programme screening for hypertension and diabetes to provide effective early care that can curtail the demand for dialysis and contain escalating health care costs. Such coupling of preventive and palliative care has not been strategically signalled in our Budget./Lowering financial barriers to accessing health services and providing financial protection against health care-related impoverishment are the objectives of the Universal Health Coverage, to which the government is committed. Will the proposed insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh per family meet these objectives? While the poor will have greater access to hospitalised care, insurance will not cover the cost of outpatient care and drugs, which account for 70% of out-of-pocket expenditure. Jan Aushadi stores will help increase access to low-cost generic drugs for the middle class but will they assure unimpeded access to essential drugs for the poor?/The claim that the insurance programme will reduce catastrophic financial shocks due to hospitalisation is only partly true, since the over-limit in-hospital costs and post-hospitalisation expenses will be out of pocket. More important, the cumulative burden of recurrent expenses on common ailments and continuous spending on chronic conditions are what drain the health and savings of many Indians. Insurance does precious little for that. Weak primary care services will land more people in hospitals and health care costs will progressively escalate beyond the reach of government budgets./A universal insurance scheme for acute hospitalised care will succeed only if it is part of an integrated system that seamlessly connects essential basic services for disease prevention and early clinical care with referred advanced care when needed, and ensures efficient follow-up on return to primary care. In essence, it calls for the marriage of an expanded National Health Mission and all government-funded health insurance schemes to create an integrated system of service provision and financial protection. When will that happen? Why is the urban health mission still on the drawing board? Will the central insurance scheme compete with or assimilate the state-funded health insurance schemes, which selectively target hospitalised care? Some questions to ponder, as we prepare for the Budget of 2017./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Foul air blowing over India, not just in Delhi","New Delhi, March 11 -- Air is the ultimate democratiser, affecting each one of us, rich or poor, old or young, Indian or from any other nationality. Unlike water, we cannot carry bottles of purified air. The air we breathe has many components. The harmful components include gaseous pollutants like ozone, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulphur and nitrous oxide, microbiological pollutants like bacteria and viruses, and, the worst, particulate matter (PM) - mostly tiny carbon particles and dust. The most deadly among these are PM2.5 particles, which are invisible to the naked eye. Studies have been conducted on the effects of PM2.5 and on how inhaling these micro-particles can affect our lungs and overall health. Once we breathe in these micro particles, they never leave our body, increasing the chances of stroke, seizure, cardiovascular disease, cancer and impaired brain function./So, if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is serious about inviting foreign investment and his 'Make in India' initiative, then his government needs to get equally serious about cleaning the country's air. No foreign investor in his right mind is going to follow his money to live in a polluted city that can affect his family's lungs the minute they step on Indian soil. And even if such investors decide to give work out on contract, they will have to pay higher salaries and compensations to their executives to come, live and execute their projects in India./Many international companies and organisations have already begun to realise the intangible and increasingly heavy costs of sending their workers and staff to India./Few have been bold enough to state their reservations openly. Multilateral agencies and multinationals are talking about this in hushed tones in an attempt to find a solution - because it is not diplomatic to criticise your host country's flaws. Gradually, these conversations are growing louder./One large multilateral organisation is sending a fact-finding team to India to research and implement interim measures to limit toxic effects from Delhi air pollution on their roughly 300 staff posted here. Smaller and less affluent multinationals are looking for other creative solutions. Even if we go a step further and say, well, give us your money, and hire our people to execute and manage your projects, it still comes back to breathing polluted air. There is really no getting away from this. There is an economic cost to pushing mindless industrialisation and growth. It manifests itself not just through lost productivity caused by ill-health, but also through rising medical costs, which often go unmeasured. While Delhi holds the dubious distinction of being the world's most polluted city (according to the World Health Organisation), 13 of the 20 most polluted cities worldwide are Indian. Calling it the problem of India's capital is not enough, this is a national crisis./If Modi wants to welcome foreign investors and stop local investors from leaving, he needs to enforce and implement bold and concrete steps to arrest this menace./Otherwise, not just expatriates and foreign agencies, even many who do not want to move out, who moved to India from cleaner climes, made difficult choices or those of us who never had a choice will begin to look for options./But by not taking this issue seriously enough, India is creating a cohort of environmental migrants fleeing our cities, even the country as a result of an early recognition that rapid economic growth will come at the cost of declining health, a gigantic, invisible and intangible cost./Jyoti Pande Lavakare is a Delhi-based columnist and co-founder of Care for Air, an awareness and advocacy platform The views expressed are personal/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution, both indoor and outdoor, ups asthma risk: Study","New Delhi, March 21 -- Nearly 8% children aged between 7 and 15 years have asthma in Delhi. The scenario is worse in industrial areas with the breathing disorder affecting close to one in eight children. The prevalence of the disorder is the lowest among children from villages, where only 3.9% children have asthma. In cities, 7 .5% children are affected./Shahdara residents are the worst affected with the disorder with 14.2% -- close to one in seven - children are affected./T h e s t u d y, d o n e b y researchers at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute and published in the Pneumonologia i Alergologia Polska, included 3,104 children living in eight areas in Delhi and its sur rounding villages. Ashok Vihar, Janakpuri, Nizamuddin and Siri Fort were the residential areas selected f o r t h e s t u d y, Shahdara and Shahzada Bag were the industrial areas and Dallupura and Jagatpur were the villages./The study found that indoor air pollution also played a role. The levels of NO2, SO2 and suspended particulate matter (SPM) indoors in 25% of the homes selected in each area showed that asthma was higher in children living in areas where the indoor pollution levels was high./""More children living in industrial areas had asthma and in homes where indoor/VILLAGES RELATIVELY CLEAN/119 Children diagnosed with asthma/Wihout disease/98/Industrial air pollution levels were also very high. When we speak of asthma, we always think of ambient (outdoor) air pollution caused by vehicles, but indoor air pollution can be dangerous,"" said Dr Raj Kumar, the leading author of the study./Children in affluent homes had higher levels of asthma, with 10.03% affected as compared to 9.11% in poor households. ""The people from the better-off homes had a clear medical history, but this could be because there is underreporting of asthma among people from a lower socioeconomic background,"" said Dr Kumar./More people had asthma in homes where food was cooked using biomass fuel like wood, coal or animal waste, which pushed up SO2 levels. The SO2 levels also increased in homes where four or more people shared a room and if there was a smoker in the house./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Toxic smog chokes Mumbai after another major fire at Deonar dump,"umbai, March 21 -- A fire raged at Mumbai's largest garbage dump in Deonar on Monday, a day after it enveloped a stretch from Chembur to Navi Mumbai with thick smog cover./Recurrent fires at the dump pose grave health hazards to local residents who have complained of everything from acute asthma and skin rashes to higher infant mortality rates./""The fire broke out at around 10am (on Sunday). I think the dumping ground should be removed from this place so that the local residents can be relieved. This dumping should be carried to the place where is there less population. The local residents face a lot of problems because of the smoke that comes out...,"" Shairaz Hussain, who lives close to the dump, told ANI./The first major fire at the dumping ground this year broke out on January 28 and lasted an entire week. Air quality in Mumbai was ""very poor"" during the fire after it mysteriously broke out at the city's largest dumping ground./Civic authorities said on Sunday it could be much bigger and worse than the January fire , as garbage was found to be burning in at least seven to eight places./The dump, the city's oldest, is often as tall as an 18-storey building. Spread across 326 acres, the dumping ground is located on the eastern suburbs, close to the crowded neighbourhoods of Chembur, Sion and Navi Mumbai, which were the worst affected in January's fire./Last year, several surveys identified the localities around Deonar as the city's most polluted. Officials figures show infant mortality in the nearby areas nearly doubles the average of the city at 60.80 per 1000 live births, although there are no studies directly linking the fatalities to the landfill./The Deonar dumping ground regularly reports fires, often started by errant contractors and the scrap mafia trying to separate iron, copper and other metals from the garbage. Fires are also lit illegally to manage dumping levels. The facility has little surveillance; has no CCTV cameras or guards. Last week's fire has also been blamed in a police complaint on dumping ground contractors and unnamed rag-pickers and the scrap mafia./Past police complaints in similar incidences of fire have also blamed unidentified saboteurs. Convictions are almost nil./The amount of smoke from the dump has reduced and the air quality has improved marginally since Friday when the city recorded its worst air pollution since monitoring began in last June.On Monday, seven out of 10 locations in Mumbai recorded ""very poor"" levels. Chembur continued to be the most polluted location for the fourth day in a row with an air quality index of 363 while locations such as Andheri recorded 355 and Malad and Mazgaon both recorded 330. Dozens of schools remained shut for the fourth day Monday. Fire tenders and civic officials continue to fight the fire, which they said had been controlled but not doused yet./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Citizens will protest fire today,"umbai, March 22 -- Residents of Chembur, Vashi and other areas around the Deonar garbage dump will protest against the municipal corporation's failure to stop fires, on Tuesday at Azad Maidan./""We were promised by the chief minister that fire incidents will not happen again at the Deonar landfill. But only a month later, another fire has begun choking us again,"" said Priya Fonseca, resident of Chembur. ""On Tuesday, we will wear black clothes and masks as a sign of protest.""/Residents living near the dumping ground pointed out that the smoke drifted towards Navi Mumbai on Monday morning and there was no improvement as the blaze spread from one location to the other./Chembur resident Vandana Tripathi said, ""The air that we are breathing today is poisonous and could lead to cancer, birth deformity and tuberculosis. It is a slow poison, possibly leading to premature death.""/Nirupama More, resident of Govandi, told HT that she did not send her children to school on Monday because of the air pollution. ""Adults, senior citizens and children are suffering due to the thick smog. The civic authorities have been unable to check the pollution. The situation is getting worse by the minute.

Pollution illnesses: Family of four in city spends ' 1.68L a year,"umbai, March 23 -- Treating diseases caused by air pollution costs a family of four in Mumbai around Rs1.68 lakh, or Rs42,000 per person every year, said a recently released study that looked at the economic cost of polluted air on citizens./The study by Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Worli, found that residents of Deonar, which houses the city's largest landfill, and Maravali (Chembur), which has two oil refineries and a fertiliser plant in the vicinity, spent more money to treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and other respiratory illnesses caused by exposure to high PM10 (particulate matter up to 10 microns in size that can be inhaled into the respiratory tract). Those living in Andheri had similar complaints from inhaling high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emitted from vehicles./Residents of Maravali and Deonar spent about Rs5,607 crore (US$ 890 million) and Rs4,284 crore (US$ 680 million), respectively, on treatment and those in Andheri spent around Rs3,213 crores (US$ 510 million) in 2012. The study, however, did not calculate per capita expenditure for each of the locations./Overall, Mumbai spent US$8,000 million in 2012, the year in which the study was done. If the annual spend is converted into Indian currency, after taking the US-India currency exchange rate as Rs63 for a dollar in 2012, Mumbai's 12.4 million residents spent Rs53,000 crore on medicines, consultations with doctors and hospitalisation. Researchers said they did not expect any significant change in spending since 2012 as pollution patterns in Mumbai have not changed. ""Increase in exposure to NO2 and PM10 comes from vehicular exhaust, construction activity and vehicle movements that kick up dust,"" said Awkash Kumar, lead investigator, Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering, IIT-B./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution down in Delhi thanks to strong winds,"New Delhi, March 23 -- Delhi's air quality was cleaner than usual on Tuesday, thanks to strong winds brought about by western disturbances./Air pollution levels in the Capital had reached alarming levels last winter, with the Delhi High Court last year observing that the city had turned into a ""gas chamber""./The temperature in the city also took a plunge, owing to the strong winds, with the minimum temperature falling to 17 degrees, two degrees below Monday's average, and the maximum temperature hovering around 30 degrees, one degree below normal./According to data obtained from the monitoring stations of Central Pollution Control Board, PM2.5 reading was 38.38 g/m3 at Punjabi Bagh, 37.15 g/m3 at RK Puram and 27 g/m3 at Mandir Marg. The safe limits for PM 2.5 microscopic particles - that can enter and embed deep inside the lungs and the human bloodstream - is 60 ug/m3./Monitoring by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), under the ministry of earth sciences, also revealed average PM2.5 level at 78 on Tuesday for Delhi, with a forecast of shooting up to 85 on Wednesday. This air quality, according to an SAFAR health advisory, was satisfactory with air pollution posing little or no risk./In Mumbai, the air quality remained ""poor"", owing to the Deonar landfill site fire, and was recorded at 222./An AQI of 301-400 is considered very poor which may give rise to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. When it's is between 201-300, it is regarded as poor, which may cause breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure./The Met office, however, warned that the temperature/Shadipur/Civil Lines/Anand Vihar/RK Puram/88 was going to start rising from Wednesday with Delhi witnessing partly cloudy sky during Holi./""This wind speed will come down and the temperature will go up by 1 or 2 degrees Celsius,"" said RK Jenamani, Director IGI Airport Met Centre./On Wednesday, the day is expected to remain clear with/179/231/231 mist and haze in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperature is likely to hover around 32 and 17 degrees Celsius./Rain and thunderstorm may also occur during the weekends.

SC extends registration ban on big-engine diesel vehicles,"New Delhi, April 1 -- The Supreme Court on Thursday maintained a ban on large diesel cars in the national capital region till further orders to clean up its filthy air, while indicating that it will impose a tax on the purchase of high-end vehicles running on the ""polluting fuel""./The court also pushed by a month a March 31 deadline for private taxi operators in the area, including Ola and Uber, to shift from diesel to compressed natural gas, offering respite to hundreds of drivers from small towns and villages who failed to make the switch./A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice TS Thakur told automobile majors such as Mercedes, Toyota, Mahindra and General Motors that it is inclined to modify the ban and let all cars get registered, but at a higher price./""We want your cooperation to clean this city. It is your city too,"" the court told lawyers representing the companies. ""People who buy diesel cars knowing they pollute more should be ready to pay compensatory charges.""/The World Health Organization says diesel fumes can cause cancer and belong in the same potentially deadly category as asbestos, arsenic and secondhand cigarette smoke./""Why should someone, having power to purchase a polluting vehicle, be allowed to make the life of others miserable? Let them pay a cost for it since they can afford it,"" the bench said./The SC gave time to the companies to come back with their views on the cess and said it will fix a Saturday to hear the matter, a first in the top court's history./Delhi has 8.5 million vehicles - up 97% from 2000 - and adds 1,400 new cars to its streets every day, contributing to a hazardous blanket of smog that intensifies during the winter months, triggering a slew of respiratory and life-threatening diseases./When a counsel sought relief on the registration of trucks in NCR, the bench said, ""No trucks will be registered as the city is already choked... Heavens will not fall if trucks are not registered.""/Air pollution levels in the Capital reached alarming levels in the winter and the Delhi high court said the city had turned into a ""gas chamber""./T he AAP gover nment imposed an odd-even number formula for two weeks, barring private cars from driving on alternate days. The second round of the road-rationing scheme will begin for a fortnight from April 15./The top court prohibited in December the registration of new diesel luxury cars and SUVs with over 2000cc engine capacity. This was one of the measures it pronounced to clear the air in Delhi, considered the world's most-polluted city./The move was cheered by environmental activists but it sparked worries among the automobile and travel industries./However, the SC exempted high-security vehicles belonging to the Special Protection Group (SPG) from the ban. But the Centre, it said, will have to pay 30% of the vehicles' price as compensation./The SPG had asked for the exemption, pointing out that diesel-run SUVs are required as escort vehicles for protectees and the petrol variants are not as efficient./The court was also informed how stringent measures, including diversion of non-Delhi destined trucks, brought down pollution levels in the Capital./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Can't completely shut Deonar dumpyard, says BMC chief","umbai, April 1 -- Completely shutting down the city's largest dumping ground at Deonar is not an option and it would take at least two years to even begin closing it down correctly, civic authorities said on Thursday./""Completely shutting down the Deonar dumping ground is not an option,"" municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta said. Civic officials handling the issue acknowledged that resolving the problem of frequent fires - and the resulting air pollution in several parts of the city - is important, but finding a solution would take time./Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, in a meeting on Wednesday, asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to come up with a plan to manage the waste at Deonar./He told HT on Thursday, ""Our focus is to resolve the issue arising out of the Deonar dump, which has been in the making for a long time. The environment ministry will monitor the situation, once the civic body comes back to us with a waste management plan in three months.''/The BMC, meanwhile, said its plan to scientifically close down Deonar - by turning waste into energy- will take place in stages. Of the 132 hectares, the waste-to-energy technology will be used first in 10-12 hectares, processing 2,000 metric tonnes ./Tata Consultancy services (TCS) was appointed in February to study how feasible a waste to energy plant at the dump yard will be and it will submit its report in the next three months./Sources said even if the civic body worked round the clock and get all clearances on time to make a scientific processing unit at the dumping ground, it will still take two years, as the ground is spread over 132 hectares, holding 12 million tonnes of waste./""If all modalities are done on time, and the contractor is appointed soon after TCS submits its report, it will take at least a year and a half to build the waste to energy plant, another six months to make it functional,"" said an official./Following Wednesday' s meeting with the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF), BMC will submit a report in a month on long-term and shortterm measures it will put in place at the Deonar landfill./BMC collects approximately 9,600 metric tonnes of waste every day and transports it to three dumping sites across the city./A senior s t at e g ove r n - ment official who attended Wednesday's meeting said it was not possible to shut down the Deonar dump i n three months, and in the short-term, the BMC was expected to present suggestions to avoid pocket fires, reduce smoke and pollution and look at the feasibility of waste to energy plan./""In the medium-and-longterm, a bid document can be worked out and finalised and then a consultant could be appointed to carry this out,'' he said./Javdekar said his ministry was also planning permanent measures to avoid situation similar to the Deonar disaster in other cities. ""The existing law does not allow us to even impose heavy penalties in such situations. I am changing that, and the new draft law should be ready in a year. This will allow us to impose heavy penalties for such failures,""he said./To control the repeated pocket fires at Deonar, the civic body is implementing methods suggested by NEERI and IIT-Bombay, such as sprinkling heaps with debris and mud. IIT-Bombay had suggested putting in place a system to capture methane gas and take it out from the dumping ground. This will take another two months to be implemented./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

One in 12 Delhi children suffers from asthma,"New Delhi, April 3 -- One in 12 children aged 7 to 15 years suffer from asthma in Delhi, with the breathing disorder maximum affecting those living in industrial areas where one in eight suffered from it, showed a study./Children from Shahdara were the worst affected where nearly one in seven (14.2%) were affected./Prevalence was the least among children from villages where one in 24 were affected against one in 13 children in residential neighbourhoods./The study by Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute surveyed 3,104 children living in eight areas in Delhi and its surrounding villages. Ashok Vihar, Janakpuri, Nizamuddin and Siri Fort were the residential areas selected for the study, Shahdara and Shahzada Bag were the industrial areas and Dallupura and Jagatpur were the villages./The study found that indoor air pollution played a role too. Monitoring levels of NO2, SO2 and suspended particulate matter (SPM) indoors in 25% of the homes selected in each area showed that more children had asthma in areas where indoor pollution levels were high./""More children living in industrial areas had asthma and in homes where indoor air pollution levels were also very high. When we speak of asthma, we always think of ambient (outdoor) air pollution caused by vehicles, but, indoor air pollution can be dangerous,"" said Dr Raj Kumar, the leading author of the study./Children in affluent homes had higher levels of asthma, with 10.03% affected as compared to 9.11% in poor households. ""The people from the better off homes had a clear medical history, but this could because there is underreporting of asthma among people from a lower socio-economic background,"" said Dr Kumar./Asthma was higher in homes where food was cooked using biomass fuel like wood, coal or animal waste, which pushed up SO2 levels. The SO2 levels also increased in homes where four or more people shared a room and if there was a smoker in the house./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

It is an admitted fact by the municipal bodies that often burning of garbage is observed at landfill sites which is due to methane gas generation from the decomposition process of garbage,"" the statement said./The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said that similar instances of fire were seen during inspections in May last year and in January and March this year./At 2 pm on Thursday, the particulate matter 10 (PM 10) level at Punjabi Bagh - where the DPCC's air quality monitoring station closest to Bhalswa is located - was 504 micro grams per cubic metre. This was higher than any reading during the past 24 hours./Open burning leads to an increase in PM 10 levels./An increase in PM 10 levels was seen at most stations even though wind speed was good./The DPCC said the three landfill sites in Delhi - Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla - do not have any authorisation./""All three landfill sites are not designed as per the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Rules that came into effect in the year 2000. DPCC has not granted authorization to all three landfill sites. Municipal bodies have informed they have no other option but to use these sites for disposal of MSW as land is not available in Delhi. They have informed that request has been made to DDA to allot land for landfill sites,"" said a statement./The DPCC had fined the east and north municipal corporations on February R 5,000 each for open burning of garbage. Notices were again issued in March./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

HEALTH SCAN: A LIFE IN GREENER AREAS CAN HELP ONE LIVE LONGER,"New Delhi, April 24 -- Living surrounded by trees lowers deaths from respiratory illnesses and cancers but has no effect on death rates from heart disease, diabetes, stroke or infections, showed a study that tracked more than 100,000 women between 2000 and 2008. Factors that helped account for the beneficial effects were less air pollution, more physical activity, more social engagement and, most significant, better mental health, as measured by a lower prevalence of depression, reported the journal, Environmental Health Perspectives./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Bhalswa fire a warning, it's time for mandatory waste recycling in Delhi","India, April 25 -- As the fire simmering within the Capital's Bhalswa landfill grew into a blaze last week, it also sparked a new round of AAP-BJP politicking. The AAP government alleged that the fire was to ""sabotage"" its ongoing odd-even road rationing experiment and that the city's air would be fouled by the garbage fire./Delhi's four dumpsites are managed by the BJP-run municipal corporations and its leaders said the AAP was playing politics. They termed dumpsite fires as a ""natural phenomenon"" that occurs routinely even in advanced countries such as the US and the UK./Politics apart, the event has served to direct attention to what has been the Capital's dirtiest secret./Last summer, a fire broke out every third day at Delhi's landfills. Experts say that the trash piled in dump yards degenerates into highly combustible methane gas. Some fires are deliberate, set off by rag-pickers to segregate metal from mixed waste. Others may be accidental, sparked by a burning cigarette tossed away carelessly. The dry atmospheric heat also sets these dumps ablaze./Our authorities don't think dumpsite fires are a serious civic hazard, unless, of course, they visibly contaminate the city air. Early this year, the fire at Deonar, Mumbai's largest and oldest dump yard, raged with flames so high and smoke so thick that it was visible even from space. For a week, the air pollution levels were higher than Delhi's and schools had to be shut down./Deonar has 17 million tonnes of garbage dumped over 132 hectares. At least 5.87 million people live in the 10-km radius of the dumpsite, states the Waste Atlas 2014, a compilation of data on the 50 biggest dumpsites of the world./Delhi's Ghazipur, one of the four methane-filled simmering landfills in the national capital, has also made it to this list of 50. In operation since 1982, Ghazipur has collected 14 million tonnes of household trash and animal waste from the markets and slaughterhouse nearby, plus thousands of tonnes of plastic and construction rubble./Atop the 70-acre dump, a small army of rag-pickers, many of them children, collect every possible bit of recyclable material. They brave the stench, the feral dogs fighting for territory, and a host of health hazards in the absence of basic protection. The Waste Atlas listed asthma, tuberculosis, skin diseases as some common health conditions among the rag-pickers here./At least three million people live within the 10-km radius of Ghazipur and the nearest residential settlement is just 200 meters away. This landfill is not just fouling the local air and groundwater, the Waste Atlas states that it may also be polluting Sanjay Lake that is 2.5 km and the Yamuna, which is 7km from Ghazipur./Three out of Delhi's four landfills ran out of space nearly a decade ago.
