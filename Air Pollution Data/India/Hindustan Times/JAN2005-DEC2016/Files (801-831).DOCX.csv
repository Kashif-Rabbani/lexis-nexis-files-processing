Pollution control board gives air pollutants a miss,"Bhopal, Dec. 1 -- Owing to non-availability of equipment, the Madhya Pradesh pollution control board is unable to measure three air pollutants -- carbon monooxide, benzene and benzo(a)pyrene -- in the state capital. These pollutants are major source of respiratory diseases./Under National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) 2009, a state pollution control board is mandated to monitor 12 parameters./A board official, wishing not to be named, told HT: ""Carbon monooxide, benzene, benzo(a) pyrene-levels are not measured in Bhopal as we are yet to procure equipment for it. We recently started measuring ammonia level in Bhopal. At present, besides ammonia, we are measuring sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, P10, P2.5, ozone, lead, arsenic and nickel.""/Besides Bhopal, the board monitors air pollution in 13 other cities/towns of the state./PS Bundela, the pollution control board's regional officer, said they were in the process of procuring equipment for measuring the three remaining parameters./Environmentalist Subhash Pandey, who had filed a petition on poor quality of air in Bhopal in the National Green Tribunal, said according to the 2009 notification issued by central pollution control board, a state pollution control board is bound to measure air pollution levels on all 12 prescribed parameters./""Leaving a parameter like carbon monoxide, can be highly harmful to the people, animals and environment as a whole. Its exposure causes many problems and affects body's ability to use oxygen,"" he said./Pandey said instead of just 13 cities, the board should measure air pollution levels in the state's 51 districts./In January, the green regulator admitted Pandey's petition complaining that air pollution levels in Bhopal have reached alarming levels./He said the levels of PM2.5 -- the fine particles linked to higher rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and lung disease -- in the city are 11 times higher than the permissible limit./While levels of respirable suspended particulate matter or P10 are 12 times higher than the permissible limit./Acording to a Central Pollution Control Board 2010 study, small particulate matter penetrates deep into lungs and can reach the alveolar region, causing heart ailments. These fine particles cover a large surface area, absorb toxic compounds such as heavy metals and organic compounds with high carbon content, the study said./Earlier, in November, the pollution control board had planned to coduct a study that would cover pollution from vehicles, housing and other activities./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Indore.

Ageing inside a dust bowl,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 1 -- It was a regular morning for 72-year-old AK Srivastava till he was overcome by a feeling of discomfort. Within minutes he was gasping for air and veins were protruding on his face. He was soaked in cold sweat before he was taken to the hospital and nebulised./This was on November 6, when Delhi experienced the worst pollution spell of the season, breaking the record of the great London smog of 1952./""I am not an asthmatic by birth. It is only in the last 10 years that I have developed breathing problems. Last week, when the smog was high, I survived on oxygen support,"" he said./Srivastava, who is a retired Indian army official residing in east Delhi's Anand Vihar, said Delhi's scene in early November was something that he has never witnessed in the last 60 years of his stay in the city. His age, clubbed with the capital's pollution, made him a victim of several diseases, including severe bronchial infection and deteriorating eye sight. Despite the fact that he has never touched a cigarette all his life, the doctors have told him that he has developed a condition called, 'smoker's lung' - seen in the last decade in many non-smokers in Delhi./""The sight in my left eye is deteriorating and every time the dust levels go up I can feel an itch in my eyes. Delhi is not the best place to grow old but where should I go, when my family is settled here?"" he wonders./The haze of dust that enveloped the city's sky seemed to be a loud warning of an imminent apocalypse, says Srivastava./""Our life is nearing end, but I fear for the next generation.

SC okays Centre's action plan to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR,"India, Dec. 3 -- The Supreme Court asked the Centre on Friday to put in place a pollution coding mechanism with a graded response system to tackle New Delhi's growing foul air./The grading system will ensure that certain steps can be automatically introduced. When air quality dips, the odd-even car rationing formula will kick in, along with closure of schools, a four-fold hike in parking fee, ban on entry of trucks, and halt in construction activities./The order came after the top court approved the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) ""graded response action plan"" that outlines measures based on air quality - moderate to poor, very poor, severe, and severe-plus or emergency. A separate set of action plan has been suggested for each category./A bench headed by Chief Justice TS Thakur asked the board to install real-time and manual pollution monitoring stations in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to check air quality for the graded response./Smoke from farm fires, construction dusts, exhaust fumes from vehicles and factories, and firecrackers combined to shroud New Delhi and its satellite cities in their worst smog for 17 years after Diwali in November. The government was forced to take emergency steps such as closing schools and halting construction, while the judiciary too chipped in with stinging remarks against administrative inaction to clean up the Capital's foul air./""Do you want to wait till people start dying? People are gasping for breath,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice Thakur said then./The board, which the top court had pulled up for failing to make a roadmap to reduce air pollution, said severe and very poor air quality are common during winter: November to February./The air quality index is measured on the basis of PM2.5 and PM10 in the atmosphere, which are tiny particles of dust that can cause grave respiratory disorder and damage the lungs./The situation becomes severe or emergency when PM2.5 level is above 300 microgram per cubic meter or PM10 crosses the 500-mark. In such a scenario, authorities will close schools, stop the entry of diesel trucks into the Capital, halt construction activities, introduce the odd-even scheme for private vehicles, and hike parking fees./The graded response fixes responsibility on the agency that has to enforce the measure./Ban on diesel generators, construction and burning of garbage on landfill sites will kick in if the air index is very poor, with PM2.5 between 121 and 250./When air quality is moderate or poor, the steps to be taken are ban on garbage burning, watering of fly ash ponds, closure of brick kilns and polluting industries, and mechanised sweeping of roads./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Need a month to prepare for re-introducing odd-even scheme: Delhi govt,"India, Dec. 3 -- The Delhi government will need at least a month to prepare before the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme can be introduced under a Supreme Court directive to curb pollution in the capital, officials said on Saturday./The top court on Friday said the scheme can be implemented if pollution levels rise beyond a limit for two consecutive days, clearing potential hurdles for the government in re-introducing the radical plan that allows vehicles to ply on alternate days based on the last digit of their registration numbers./""There will be chaos on (the) streets if we do not plan it well. As we don't have enough number of buses, we have to hire buses to improve public transport as people will leave cars,"" an official told HT./""Hiring buses will need a month. and similarly, we also hire civil defence volunteers to manage traffic on roads. Doing all this immediately after high pollution for two consecutive days is almost impossible as public also need to be informed in advance.""/The Arvind Kejriwal government had introduced the scheme twice though experts are divided over its efficacy, besides the hardships it causes to a city of 16 million people./Since Diwali in October-end, Delhi has seen one of the worst pollution spikes in recent years with the level of deadly PM 2.5 and PM 10 - fine particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs - rising several times beyond the safe limit./The SC said the odd-even formula can be automatically enforced and all construction activities stopped if air pollution breaches the PM2.5 emergency level of 300 micrograms per cubic metre for 48 hours at a stretch./In October 2015, only one day had such severe air quality. In November, it was 16 days, in December 10 days, while in January this year, 14 days had PM2.5 more than 300 microgram per cubic metre./""This means the department needs to be ready from the start of October till February. This is possible when we have adequate buses and are ready to provide the last-mile connectivity to people who are leaving cars. In the beginning there is bound to be inconvenience as the odd-even rule will be flexible,"" the official said./Sources indicated the scheme can be introduced during the winter break of schools as was done in January this year./Delhi reeled under a thick cover of smog and haze for at least seven days after Diwali, sparking health concerns among the citizens. Faced with criticism, the city government announced a raft of measures, including closing down of schools./Sources said ministers and officials will meet next week to discuss how to proceed on the matter./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Not safe within four walls: Indoor pollution is killing you,"India, Dec. 7 -- Indoors or outdoors, pollution doesn't discriminate. It kills equally./Though a majority of our anti-pollution strategy has remained focused on what is beyond the boundaries of our houses - vehicles, power plants, construction projects - there are several sources of pollution that pose danger to our health indoors too./Experts suggest the composition of indoor air is different from outside. Unlike air quality outside that is measured on the basis of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone and sulphur dioxide levels; air quality inside the house is determined by volatile organic compounds (from paints), bio-aerosols, nitrous oxides (from cooking gas) and so on./Dr Raj Kumar, head of pulmonology department at Vallabhai Patel Chest Institute, however, has a slightly different view. ""Pollutants that are present outdoors are also there inside our houses. Just that their density is lesser indoors. But, the good thing about indoor pollution is that curbing it is in our own hands, unlike the outdoor one for which we need to depend on the government and other agencies for cleanup,"" he said./Let's fight pollution: Choked in dusty Delhi/According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 4.3 million people a year die from exposure to household air pollution./In poorly ventilated dwellings, smoke in and around the home can exceed acceptable levels for fine particles 100-fold. Exposure is particularly high among women and young children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth. (/<a href=""http://www.who.int"">www.who.int</a>/)/Most people have now moved on to using lesser-polluting cooking fuels in cities. However, chemical compounds used in buildings such as paints and varnishes are known to have adverse impact on health. Indoor air pollution from biological agents in indoor air related to damp and mould increases the risk of respiratory disease in children and adults by 50%, says WHO./Researchers at the Patel Chest Institute have found that burning of incense sticks, a common practice in Indian homes for both aesthetic and religious reasons, increases the concentration of particulate matter (PM) to up to 15 times more than the permitted levels inside homes. The smoke emitted by incense sticks releases harmful pollutants and PM 1.0, PM2.5 and PM10, the study says./Survey predicts 3000% rise in vehicles from 2015 to 2050/The daily permissible limit for PM10 is 100 micrograms per cubic metre and PM2.5 it is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The study found that mean concentration of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 levels increased by 1879.7g/m3, 1775.4g/m3 and 1,300.1g/m3 during burning of incense sticks indoors./To fight pollution indoors, residents are buying air purifiers. The market for air purifiers in India was estimated at 40,000 units in 2015-16. It is expected to grow at least three times by the end of this year. All air purifier manufacturers have reported a steep spike in the sales, especially after the choking haze that enveloped Delhi-NCR after Diwali on October 30./For those living around major hubs of pollution like Rajneesh Mathur the risks are even higher. Mathur lives in a fourth-floor flat in East Delhi's Gharoli. The Mathur family's immediate neighbours - Ghazipur landfill and Anand Vihar Bus Terminal - are one of the major pollution hubs in Delhi./""My father and I bought this house about two decades ago. We are repenting now. Reeta, my wife, complains of gastric problems all the time. The doctor says it is also because of the location we live in. We try keeping our doors and windows shut for most part of the day to keep away dust and the stench of the rotting garbage as there is a lot of dust in the air. The stench gets worse during monsoons,"" said Mathur./Gases like methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, sulphides, carbon monoxide and non-methane organic compounds such as benzene and vinyl chloride are in abundant supply for the Mathur family due to their proximity to the 70-acre Ghazipur landfill./""We are worse off than others. Despite staying inside, our eyes burn due to the toxic smoke that emanates from the numerous fires that keep erupting at the landfill,"" said Adarsh Joshi, a resident of Kaushambi in Ghaziabad./Doctors say persistent exposure to gases that are released by landfills can cause gastrointestinal infections, cancer, birth defects and asthma./Greenpeace says 1.6 million died due to pollution in India, China in 2015/""Pollution is so bad in our houses that the pipes of our air conditioners often get corroded leading to gas leakages. It's anybody's guess what this air does to the human body. Even the clothes we dry outside have a thin grey layer of dust and they lose colour,"" said Manju Devi, a resident of IP Extension./Others like Aanchal Kothari Oswal who lives in Noida Sector 104, are now ramping up defence against indoor pollution by adopting simple measures./At least 36 indoor plants have been neatly placed at different corners of Aanchal's home. ""We had first installed an air-purifier, but found that it does not cover our entire house.

Pollution beginning to hit home,"NEW DELHI, Dec. 7 -- Indoors or outdoors, pollution doesn't discriminate. It kills equally./Though a majority of our anti-pollution strategy has remained focused on what is beyond the boundaries of our houses - vehicles, power plants, construction projects - there are several sources of pollution that pose danger to our health indoors too./Experts suggest the composition of indoor air is different from outside. Unlike air quality outside that is measured on the basis of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone and sulphur dioxide levels; air quality inside the house is determined by volatile organic compounds (from paints), bioaerosols, nitrous oxides (from cooking gas) and so on./Dr Raj Kumar, head of pulmonology department at Vallabhai Patel Chest Institute, however, has a slightly different view. ""Pollutants that are present outdoors are also there inside our houses. Just that their density is lesser indoors. But, the good thing about indoor pollution is that curbing it is in our own hands, unlike the outdoor one for which we need to depend on the government and other agencies for cleanup,"" he said./According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 4.3 million people a year die from exposure to household air pollution./In poorly ventilated dwellings, smoke in and around the home can exceed acceptable levels for fine particles 100-fold. Exposure is particularly high among women and young children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth. (/<a href=""http://www.who.int"">www.who.int</a>/)/Most people have now moved on to using lesser-polluting cooking fuels in cities. However, chemical compounds used in buildings such as paints and varnishes are known to have adverse impact on health. Indoor air pollution from biological agents in indoor air related to damp and mould increases the risk of respiratory disease in children and adults by 50%, says WHO./Researchers at the Patel Chest Institute have found that burning of incense sticks, a common practice in Indian homes for both aesthetic and religious reasons, increases the concentration of particulate matter (PM) to up to 15 times more than the permitted levels inside homes. The smoke emitted by incense sticks releases harmful pollutants and PM 1.0, PM2.5 and PM10, the study says./The daily permissible limit for PM10 is 100 micrograms per cubic metre and PM2.5 it is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The study found that mean concentration of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 levels increased by 1879.7g/m3, 1775.4g/m3 and 1,300.1g/m3 during burning of incense sticks indoors./To fight pollution indoors, residents are buying air purifiers. The market for air purifiers in India was estimated at 40,000 units in 2015-16. It is expected to grow at least three times by the end of this year. All air purifier manufacturers have reported a steep spike in the sales, especially after the choking haze that enveloped Delhi-NCR after Diwali on October 30./For those living around major hubs of pollution like Rajneesh Mathur the risks are even higher. Mathur lives in a fourth-floor flat in East Delhi's Gharoli. The Mathur family's immediate neighbours - Ghazipur landfill and Anand Vihar Bus Terminal - are one of the major pollution hubs in Delhi./""My father and I bought this house about two decades ago. We are repenting now. Reeta, my wife, complains of gastric problems all the time. The doctor says it is also because of the location we live in. We try keeping our doors and windows shut for most part of the day to keep away dust and the stench of the rotting garbage as there is a lot of dust in the air. The stench gets worse during monsoons,"" said Mathur./Gases like methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, sulphides, carbon monoxide and non-methane organic compounds such as benzene and vinyl chloride are in abundant supply for the Mathur family due to their proximity to the 70-acre Ghazipur landfill./""We are worse off than others.

Indoor pollution is as damaging as the foul air outside,"India, Dec. 10 -- Time was when Delhi's winters were to die for. But for the last few years, the city is losing that classic winter-Christmassy makeover, thanks to a spike in air pollution. With all those particulate matters floating, it's depressing to be in the Capital these days. At social gatherings, coffee shops, ATM queues, over drinks and kebabs, the discussion is monotonously similar: Its pollution or the other foggy-smoggy scheme, demonetisation./Last week, when I was standing in one of those serpentine queues, trying to get my weekly quota of cash, I overheard neighbours discussing the air quality index (AQI) of area, not demonetisation./Over tea and biscuits (they were equipped for a long haul), the neighbourhood 'I know all' 70-something uncle was throwing pollution-related jargons at others. [By the way, if you have not done it yet, do check the Hindustan Times air quality index monitor, it's worth keeping an eye on it]. ""I have bought an air purifier,"" he said grandly about the new addition to his list of acquisitions, which includes two diesel-guzzling SUVs and a bungalow with a diesel generator for backup electricity. It turned out that several others in that group had also done the same. They exchanged the brand names and the prices but not for once did anyone raise the question: Who is responsible for the rising pollution levels in the city?/But to speak the truth, I was happy listening to their discussions on air pollution. After years of living in denial, the people of the city are hopefully waking up to this crisis (even if they don't want to accept that we are all responsible for it) that will have immense health and economic effects. My doctor friends tell me that there has been a spike in the number of patients with pollution-related allergies./In fact, these days, I think twice before going to any open-air restaurant or joining any of the city's heritage walk events. It's a pity because this is the outdoorsy season. A couple of my outstation friends skipped this year's Delhi marathon because they were scared about the toxic air. My cyclist friends have already given up their weekend biking routine./According to the World Health Organisation's Ambient Air Pollution database, 13 of the top 20 cities in the world with the highest annual levels of PM2.5 are now in India, with Delhi being among them. With relatively weak policies to manage industrial, transport and other emissions, and increasing economic activity and industrialisation across the country, the situation is likely to become worse. In fact, ambient levels of PM2.5 from transport sources alone are expected to double by 2030 if no action is taken./Now that we have finally broken the silence on outdoor pollution, it is time to raise the discussion levels on indoor pollution. This menace became a sore issue when US President Barack Obama came in 2015 and the US embassy installed air purifiers inside their offices. All hell broke loose when the story came out and the Centre became defensive, saying that the air was not as bad as in Beijing. But now it's again square one, and we have beaten Beijing on this one./Indoor air pollution is the presence of a number of pollutants in the indoor environment, such as suspended particulate matter, which is hazardous. Those of most concern are very tiny particles, less than 10 microns (one micron = one-thousandth of a millimetre) in diameter (PM10). These particles are very dangerous because they can easily penetrate the human respiratory tract./The worst health effect of indoor air pollution is acute respiratory infection. Women and young children are highly susceptible to diseases such as pneumonia and eye infections. Some studies have indicated that lung cancer and tuberculosis may be associated with indoor air pollution, but further research is needed to establish this link./It's not that people are completely oblivious to indoor pollution: Look at the spike in sales of air purifiers and mist fountains in the last few months. A report in HT said that from President Pranab Mukherjee to the high commissions - all have taken to the big, boxy appliances in an effort to clean the atmosphere in their offices and homes./Across the road from the HT office is the British Council, a LEED-certified building. Recently, the Council ordered a study to see how severe the indoor pollution is in the building. ""The results will come this week and then we will implement ways to reduce air pollution. Delhi's foul air forced us to commission this study,"" a friend who works there told me./But while urban India has found an expensive solution, though not a fool-proof one, to tackle indoor air pollution, the real crisis is for those in rural areas that still use biomass, wood or coal for cooking. But there are no shortcuts to solve this problem. Environmentalists say the short-term alternatives would be to construct chimneys, which disperse the emissions outside, and the introduction of better-designed stoves. Also, the design of the house could be changed to ensure that air does not get trapped inside. A long-term solution could be investing in solar energy projects./Unfortunately, while exposure to air pollution is a risk factor common to both rural and urban populations, the routine monitoring of air quality, as it stands, is nearly exclusively confined to large cities. This makes the task of understanding the nature and distribution of population exposures much harder, says a 2015 steering committee report on pollution./But brushing the rural problem under the carpet will do us no good. This is because studies have shown that emissions from cooking using biomass contribute to around 25% of ambient PM2.5 air pollution in the country. This highlights that exposure to air pollution, be it ambient or household, is part of a continuum, and reinforces the need for an integrated approach towards mitigation and harm reduction. Unfortunately, the approach still looks very piecemeal with second-tier cities or rural India left to fend for itself./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Varanasi, Allahabad had zero 'good air days' last year","NEW DELHI, Dec. 13 -- Varanasi and Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh had zero good air quality days last year, said a report released on Monday that uses the government's air quality data to conclude B-towns have the most toxic air in India./Varanasi and Allahabad did not record a single day of ""good"" air quality day, said the report, which based its findings on the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) 2015 dataset./Out of the 227 days of recorded data on air pollution, Varanasi had 'zero' good air quality days last year. And out of 263 days, Allahabad had zero good air quality days./""Good"" air is an Air Quality Index score below 50, above 100 is ""moderate"", and over 150 indicates ""severe"" air pollution./The levels recorded in Varanasi regularly cross 150, with the levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM) smaller than 2.5 micro m - the most harmful because they go deep into the airways and lungs - routinely double the safe limit in October and November/SPM less than 10 micro m were three times the safe limit in 2016 and had increased by more than one-third since 2010, said the report/Among six cities in Uttar Pradesh highlighted in the report, only Kanpur and Agra had more than 12 ""good"" air quality days each year./The leading causes of pollution are the same across north India: agricultural fires, a mix of dust kicked up by traffic and construction sites, vehicular and industrial emissions, coal-fire power stations, brick kilns, smoke from private diesel generators and use of wood and coal fires for cooking./The report, launched by Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), IndiaSpend and Care4Air, concludes that heavy industrial activity across the Indo-Gangetic belt has led to rapid degradation of air quality across north Indian region./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Secrets to a long life,"Mumbai, Dec. 13 -- Ageing occurs when cells are permanently damaged by the continuous attacks of free radicals. They are formed daily through normal body processes, when the body eliminates toxins or fights diseases. In addition to this, certain environmental pollutants can generate free radicals within the body. For instance, they are formed due to air pollution and radiation (when you are exposed to sunlight). These free radicals, thus formed, are highly unstable and are highly reactive. They can cause severe damage to the cell structure, which can potentially induce cancer, heart disease, inflammation in the arthritic joints, brain degeneration and also hasten the ageing process./According to research scientists, about 80% to 90% of all degenerative diseases involve free radical activity, which leads us to believe that all maladies actually involve 'accelerated ageing'. If one can kill the free radicals or diffuse their activity, we can slow down the ageing process./Chemically, free radicals are molecules that have a missing electron.

"Secrets to a long life, uncovered","New Delhi, Dec. 15 -- Ageing occurs when cells are permanently damaged by the attacks of free radicals. They are formed daily through normal body processes, when the body eliminates toxins or fights diseases. /Certain environmental pollutants can also generate free radicals within the body. For instance, they are formed due to air pollution and radiation (when you are exposed to sunlight). These free radicals, thus formed, are unstable and are highly reactive. They can cause severe damage to the cell structure, which can potentially induce cancer, heart disease, inflammation in the arthritic joints, brain degeneration and also hasten the ageing process. According to research scientists, about 80% to 90% of all degenerative diseases involve free radical activity. ageing'. If one can kill the free radicals or diffuse their activity, we can slow down the ageing process. Chemically, free radicals are molecules that have a missing electron. Since free radicals are highly reactive and unstable, they seek out another electron to pair up with in order to turn stable. It thus causes further damage to the other existing normal cells. These free radicals can be neutralised by antioxidants - compounds that can give up one of their electrons. Antioxidants are found in fruits and vegetables. They are designed to diffuse the destructive free radicals. They stop the formation of free radicals, snuff them out and repair the damage.

Sultanpur National Park gets fewer avian visitors this migratory season,"Gurgaon, Dec. 25 -- Fewer of migratory birds have visited Sultanpur National Park in the first part this season, as compared to last year. The winter migratory season lasts from October to March./Although bird watchers, bird experts and park authorities have reported spotting winter migratory birds from different regions, the numbers are less./According to the state wildlife department, 95 species of migratory birds from various parts of the world were spotted in the park by December last year./However, this year the number had reached only 53 by the first week of December./""We had built small islands and created a shallow area ideal for water birds, but the park failed to attract migratory birds during the first part of the season./However, the situation is more favourable now,"" said divisional wildlife officer, Shyam Sunder Kaushik./Every year, the park shuts down from May to August. This year, it was finally opened for visitors in October because of late breeding by summer migratory birds. It was shut down for a month again in November because of the bird flu scare./""The park was closed for a month in November after the death of three pelicans was reported from Delhi zoo on November 11.Itwasreopenedon December 2,"" said Kaushik./Although no bird flu deaths were reported from the park, wildlife officials shut it down to avoid any possible spread of the disease./While these shutdowns kept human visitors away, this season the authorities had made several arrangements for the avian visitors. These included creation of two new watch towers, grasslands under the mounds and new islands in the park's water body./However, the number of birds that arrived in November was less than the same month the previous year. Experts are of the opinion that high level of air pollution was the cause and birds headed south to avoid it./""Although the number of winter migratory birds was initially low, as the pollutants cleared, their number increased. However, because the first pack of birds gave the park a miss, the bird count is less this season,"" said Purbasha Banerjee, biologist, Bombay Natural History Society, which is engaged in conservation and biodiversity research./The park is now host to birds such as bar-headed and greylag geese, northern pintail, plovers, Isabelline shrike and the greenwinged teal (common teal). However, park authorities said some oftheregularbirdspeciesdidnot stay in the park for long./Apart from the atmosphere, the park faces other threats too./""The Haryana government's decision to expand the Gurgaon- Farrukhnagar road, passing along the park, to four lanes is a negative approach as around seven to eight acres of the park will be lost. Encroachments around the park are still present and the government is turning a blind eye towards them. All these developments are also reasons for less number of birds in the park as compared to last December,"" said a green activist, Vivek Kamboj./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Gurgaon.

"Mumbai in 2016: A year of small victories, surprise endings","India, Dec. 31 -- A ROAD SCAM WAS UNCOVERED; ARRESTS MADE/A scam should typically hold some element of surprise (my word, did he really bug the offices of his political opponents; no way, did he really fake that much stamp paper?). The surprise element in this year's road repair scam was that the guilty were being brought to book. It was enough to make one re-evaluate all one had held to be true, enough to make one wonder, 'What next? Builders forced to play by the rules?'. After the initial surprise came waves of delight as, finally, finally, contractors, municipal officials and even chief engineers were booked and taken down to the station in handcuffs. They had cheated on materials and contracts and laid waste to the roads they were supposed to fix. There followed a similar crackdown on those who had pretended to clean stormwater drains and done only the most cursory of sweeps, if any. Good times. Now it's time to test the fruits of the crackdown as the rains approach./DEMONETISATION #URBANPOVERTY/On November 8, in a sudden announcement, prime minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. As per RBI reports, that was 86% of the currency in circulation./After the initial shock, the move was met largely with applause for a government that was pro-people, and a fearless leader now following through on his election rhetoric to weed out black money. Yet, as time passed, and the inconveniences were prolonged, the jubilation began to die down./Unprecedented queues outside banks and ATMs became familiar sights across the nation, and criticism of the government for poor planning began to gain ground. The Opposition, with interests of their own, called it a gimmick ahead of the UP election./And it did not help that the rules on exchanging and depositing old currency, and caps on withdrawal, were changing all the time./The issue has remained hot on social media all along, with the latest coinage being ""Reverse Bank of India"", after the rollback on the Rs 5,000 deposit limit for old notes./The jury is still out on the move. But the use of ""demonetisation"" as a joke for a job well-intentioned but badly executed, and the more serious fear of an impending fall in GDP, do not bode well./TATA, MISTRY HAD A BITTER?BREAK-UP/It's had all the makings of a TV soap, played out on the business pages, starring India's largest conglomerate. First there was the shock announcement in October: Cyrus Mistry was told, as part of a discussion of miscellaneous items on the agenda at a board meeting, that he would need to step down as chairman of the $103-bn Tata Group. What followed felt like the worst break-up in history. Amid plunging stocks and full-page advertisements, the two sides began a very public game of you-know-what-you-did and do-you-want-everyone-to-know-what-you-were-like-behind-closed-doors. It went from shocking to riveting to frankly quite embarrassing. Common friends ended up taking sides; peers made public statements trying to exonerate their guy. As things stand, it looks likely that the fight will be fought on a legal platform, turning this into one messy public divorce. The only hope is that small shareholders do not lose their investments and brand Tata is not sullied./UBER AND OLA OVERTOOK THE KAALI-PEELIS/Years from now, when send your grandkids to school in self-navigating, zero-emission, superfast transport pods, tell them how the smart-commuting revolution began. This was the year Indians realised they didn't need to wave their hands endlessly or plead with a kaali-peeli driver in order to hail a ride at rush hour. India became Uber's largest market after America in 2016, accounting for 12% of all trips booked around the world. Local competitor Ola, the market leader, upped its game with in-car entertainment, a multi-use pass and a subscription scheme that allows users to bypass surge pricing for a fee. Uber fought back with carpool services and even ventured into two-wheeler options for a while. Meanwhile, kaali-peeli drivers went on strike in protest, driving still more traffic towards app-based rides./SAIRAT REDEFINED THE MARATHI BLOCKBUSTER/Sparks flew when Archi met Parshya on screen in April. Those sparks set aflame Solapur society, where the film is set. It ignited conversations about inter-caste love, which the film is about. And it burned through previous box office records, becoming the first Marathi film to cross Rs 50 crore, and eventually Rs 100 crore worldwide. Filmmaker Nagraj Manjule intended for the film to echo his own experiences as a lower-caste person in rural India; it ended up resonating with viewers across the country and beyond. The film's young stars - actress Rinku Rajguru is just 16 - are still grappling with fame. And the tunes of 'Zing-zing-zing-zingaat' played almost on a loop all through the festive season./DEONAR FIRE SET NEW STANDARDS FOR AIR POLLUTION/One of the defining images of 2016 has to be that before-and-after NASA tableau showing smoke slowly enveloping the city as the Deonar garbage dump burnt. It was like a candid, tragic selfie of a city drowning in neglect./As the massive, 326-acre dump burst into flames again and again, it was like all our skeletons came tumbling out of the closet at once - the overcrowding, the lack of civic sense, the total absence of any vision or long-term planning. From January through March, firefighters kept dashing back to the scene as pockets of gas erupted. Sometimes the fires took days to put out, sometimes a week and more./In heavily populated neighbourhoods nearby, such as Chembur and Sion, windows had to be kept shut and still children complained of burning in their eyes and difficulty breathing. The Bombay high court has since set up a monitoring committee to watch over the dumping ground. There are reports of the BMC using drones to monitor the landfill./We still don't separate or treat our garbage./MUMBAI GOT A?NEW RAIL?STATION; IT?WAS?CALLED RAM MANDIR/A project, sanctioned a decade ago, is completed after several years of missed deadlines. Nothing unusual there. We needed a railway station at Oshiwara. We could have built a railway station at Oshiwara, simply called it Oshiwara, and life, and the relentless Mumbai local, would have gone on as usual./Instead, Mumbai's first new Western Rail station in decades became a platform for religious, and political, one-upmanship. Enter Ram Mandir. According to the powers that be, the station is innocuously named after the road leading up to it, and a local temple. But the controversy and criticism that ensued tell a different story./Add to that the sloganeering by local BJP and Shiv Sena workers - each trying to take credit for the station and the name - on the day of the inauguration, and all claims of just-a-name go out the window. It also points to the growing dissent between the two parties currently in power. And it seems to have set the ball rolling for a few other name changes. But politics aside, the station at Oshiwara bridges a 3.2-km gap between Jogeshwari and Goregaon, and comes as a blessing for the local residents./A CALL CENTRE SCAM PUT US ON THE GLOBAL CRIME MAP/They had floor monitors and team leaders, telecallers and login sheets. And all they were doing, day after day, call after call, was scamming US citizens./It was straight out of a Hollywood movie - and ironically, this one wasn't a copycat plot. It was an evil genius with a taste for crime./The multi-crore Mira Road call centre scam emerged in October, after one of the callers boasted to a friend that all he did all day was impersonate US tax officials on the phone and get the person on the other end panicky enough to pay./The individual sums usually weren't large; but put together, the spoils ran into an estimated $300 million./Soon after the telecaller's boast, seven fraudulent call centres were raided and shut down, and 70 people arrested. In the spirit of diversification, it turned out the criminals had set up branches in Ahmedabad too./The mastermind, Sagar Thakkar alias Shaggy, is still at large, though his 'mentor' and key 'investor', Jagdish Kanani, was nabbed in October./Never mind the lack of leave and unregulated hours; there are now clearly new reasons to begin monitoring the industry./OPERA HOUSE REOPENED/For the culture set, first-look shots from the Royal Opera House, refurbished, restored and reopened after 23 years, were Instagram gold. The 500-seat baroque-style theatre, the only one of its kind in India, closed down in the 1990s after first switching to Hindi films. But when it opened for the inaugural event of the MAMI Mumbai film festival in October, you could practically hear the gasps, oohs and aahs behind the pictures on social media. Did you score a seat for an event? You must have seen the Italianate balustrade, the dome featuring frescoes of great men of the stage, that elaborate chandelier, the Minton floors tiles and those stunning gold accents. And you probably appreciated the modern touches: discreet air-conditioning, comfortable seats and elaborate chandeliers. Don't believe the old-timers. Even in its avatar as a film theatre, Mumbai's Royal Opera House never looked this good./HUMBOLDT PENGUINS CAME TO THE MUMBAI ZOO; ONE DIED/How did you first feel when you heard they were bringing penguins to Mumbai? For most of us, it was a mix of incredulity, mirth and dismay./Imagine how the penguins must have felt when they arrived./All through, there had been experts saying what should have been patently obvious - it was absurd to expect creatures from the polar icecaps to withstand the kind of weather than even most Bangaloreans can't stand./There were others, of course, including zoo officials, who insisted there were ways to make them comfortable (they still couldn't explain why one would want to try)./Anyway, the penguins arrived from South Korea, as part of a never-ending Rs 433-crore zoo makeover project. But their home wasn't ready. So they were put in a 'quarantine facility' where temperatures were supposedly kept between 16 and 18 degrees Celsius./Three months on, in October, 18-month-old Dory died. She had never even been put on display; the other penguins still haven't been. But the zoo says they're doing fine./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.
