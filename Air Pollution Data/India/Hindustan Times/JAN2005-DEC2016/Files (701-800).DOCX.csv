High-level meeting at 1pm to tackle spiking air pollution: Delhi deputy CM,"India, Nov. 1 -- Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia called a high-level meeting at 1pm on Tuesday to tackle with spiking air pollution, which has touched alarming levels in the past two days./In a tweet, Sisodia said he convened the meeting to ensure the city administration deals with the problem on a ""warfooting"". He also described the air pollution as a serious health crisis./Delhiites have woken up to a blanket of smog and haze enveloping the city for two mornings now after heavy cracker burning. HT's air-quality monitoring system shows a ""severe"" reading - the worst possible on the scale - for many points in the city with important thoroughfares such as Punjabi Bagh, RK Puram, Shantipath and Anand Vihar showing a maximum reading of 500./Sisodia's remark comes a day after his colleague and health minister Satyendra Jain thanked Delhiites for what he described as a fall in cracker burning. The Aam Aadmi Party government has been criticized by experts for not doing enough to counter rising air pollution that can cause a raft of respiratory diseases and even cancer./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Four reasons why crackers should be banned,"India, Nov. 1 -- A blanket of haze and smog enveloped Delhi on Monday morning after a night of Diwali revelry. At 7:23 am, HT's air quality index showed a reading of a severe 447. Air pollution level is classified as severe if it is between 401 and 500./While the deed is done for this year, here's why there should be a blanket ban on crackers in India:/First, the chemical footprint of crackers is deadly./Second, the impact of crackers on children is far greater than it is on adults because their defence mechanism is much poorer and their ability to metabolise and detoxify environmental agents is different. Moreover, due to their high level of physical activities, children inhale more volume of air as compared to adults and so breathe in more toxic air./Third, fire crackers have carbon and sulphur and they produce a range of gases. Plus, there are a number of chemicals that act as colouring agent, reducing agent, oxidiser, stabiliser and binder./These colours have antimony sulphide for the glitter effect, aluminum for white, barium nitrate for green, lithium for red, copper for blue and strontium for purple./These chemical substances are harmful to our body./Aluminum and antimony sulphide (colouring agents) causes Alzheimer' disease, perchlorate (ammonium and potassium), an oxidizing agent, can cause lung cancer. It causes thyroid complications, the cadmium compounds damage the lungs and leads to gastrointestinal problems./The barium nitrate is poisonous and causes respiratory irritation, radioactive effects, gastrointestinal problems and muscular weakness./The lithium and copper compounds causes hormonal imbalance and is poisonous to plants and animals, detrimental to physical and mental growth in infants and unborn children, accumulation within the body and by-products like nitrogen dioxide which is highly poisonous, fatal for infants, the source of acid rain./Most of these toxins can trigger cancer./Fourth, these gases cause respiratory problems. Hospitals in Delhi report at least 30%-40% increase in wheezing, respiratory disease, bronchial asthma, bronchitis, and worsening of asthma./India Chest Society has issued warning about hearing loss, blood pressure, sleeping disturbances, heart ailments and nausea effects on pets./In 1992, the Centre issued a notification to ban explosives containing a series of dangerous substances like sulphur or sulphurate mixed with potassium chlorate or chlorate of other elements./It said storage and handling of these compounds is hazardous and can cause serious accidents. They are sensitive to the slightest amount of friction and are toxic to the skin. When coupled with potassium, they form explosives that lead to fires and deaths. The fire that took place at a temple in Kollam, Kerala, killed over 100 people in April 2016 was caused due to fireworks made from these banned substances./The unstable and explosive nature of chlorates and perchlorates makes crackers noisier and gives a ""bigger bang for your buck"". Before the 1992 notification, firecracker manufacturers preferred potassium chlorates and perchlorates because they were cheaper. They cost one-third as compared to their substitutes, potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate mixtures./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Firecracker emissions blank Patna on Diwali day,"Patna, Nov. 1 -- Sunday had Patna reeling with a serious air quality issue with respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) level increasing over four times than permissible limit, sending alarm across the environment conscious sections of the capital./Pollution experts say the cracker bursts between 2pm of Sunday and 10pm at night which was measured, has suggested that RSPM level increased up to 487.74 micro grams per metre cube (g/ m3) that was over four times the permissible level of 100 g/m3 in residential area and 150 g/m3 in industrial areas./What is alarming is that it rose still between 10pm of Sunday and 6am on Monday morning to 685.97 g/m3 and covered the city with a blanket of smoke and fog that lessened the visibility levels drastically on Monday morning./The air pollution level is considered severely hazardous if it is between 401 and 500 g/m3./However, the RSPM level on general days other than Diwali is also recorded higher than the permissible level as per the reports of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) that checked the ambient air quality at Boring Road crossing./BSPCB, which recorded the air quality on October 24, nearly a week before Diwali, said it was 232.46 g/m3, which too was much above the ideal level for RSPM. But this was limited to vehicles exhaust On Diwali day, cracker emissions of poisonous gases boosted RSPM level to 498.63 g/m3 against the standard level of 100 g/m3./Also, the level of Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) increased to its maximum on Diwali night from 10pm to 2am. The permissible level of NO2 in air is 80 g/ m3 but it rose to an alarming level of 142.41 g/m3 from 6pm to 10pm while it was 104.65 g/m3 from 10pm to 2am. On an average the level of NO2 was recorded 101.07 while the standard is just 80 g/m3./It is advised by the Pollution Control Board to the Patnaites to step out of their homes only when it is important as the air quality is deteriorated and is considered hazardous for those with heart and lung diseases and for children./A Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) data, however, said Patnaites breathed seven times more pollutants than safety limits on Diwali with Dak Bangalow area being the most polluted with 692 g/m3./CEED monitored four different areas namely, Dak Bungalow, Patna City, Sultanganj and Bhikhna Pahari. The particulate matter concentrations compared during pre-Diwali days and on the day of Diwali within a time frame of 6pm to 10pm had shown an increase of 49% in PM 2.5 level./Ankita Jyoti, program manager CEED said, ""Excessive fireworks on Diwali resulted in a lethal cocktail of smoke in Patna which will be trapped in the city for days. The pollution level was found highest after 10pm.""/She said levels of PM10 and PM 2.5 rose to a maximum of 1.4 and 3 times higher, respectively as compared to normal days. The concentration of PM 2.5 increased up to 6.6 times above the prescribed national ambient air quality standard and 15.8 times above World Health Organisation safety limits./At Dak Bungalow area the air quality was the worst of all with the highest recorded figure of 692 g/m3 of PM 10 and 659 g/ m3 of PM 2.5 at 10:55 pm, while Sultanganj was second worst area with highest reading of 683 g/m3 of PM 10 and 408 g/ m3 of PM 2.5 at 10:43 pm./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Cracker injuries down this Diwali,"Patna, Nov. 1 -- Thanks to the 'say no to crackers' campaign in schools and the increased awareness about air pollution among children, the incidence of burn cases reported during Diwali this has gone down significantly./If firecracker injury cases reported during Diwali at government institutions here are an indication, children in particular and youth in general have turned more conscious, not just towards environment, but also protecting themselves from firecracker injuries./If data from the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) is to be believed, firecracker injury cases have plummeted by almost half this year. Against 33 burn cases in 2015, reported at the emergency unit of the plastic surgery department, and 37 in 2014, this year, only 17 were reported 24 hours till Diwali on Monday, said head of the plastic surgery department Dr Vidyapati Chaudhary./Similarly, in the eye department, only four firecracker injury cases were reported. ""The cases were much less compared to previous years,"" said Dr Umesh Prasad Sinha, head, department of ophthalmology, PMCH./At the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), no cases of burn or eye injury due to firecracker were reported, claimed its superintendent Dr Anand Prasad Singh. ""Till last year, some insignificant number of firecracker injury cases used to be reported, but this year, there were none whatsoever,"" said Dr Singh./At the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), head, department of ophthalmology Dr Bibhuti Prassana Sinha said, ""Only two cases, one with burn and another with blast injury was reported on Monday. They have been admitted for intervention.""/At the AIIMS-Patna, though no burn and eye injury cases were reported, medical superintendent Dr Umesh Bhadani said, ""We got telephonic calls of respiratory distress from patients due to increased pollution in atmosphere due to firecrackers.

However, the blanket of haze and smog was less intense in Ghaziabad compared to nearby Delhi. Residents and commuters complained of zero-visibility and of the smell of burnt firecrackers. At Kaushambi, adjacent to Delhi's Anand Vihar, the Delhi pollution control committee's online ambient air-quality data recorded Particulate Matter (PM) 10 at 766 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) on Monday morning, against the permissible limit of 100mpcm. The level of the finer PM2.5 particles was also alarmingly high - 549mpcm - against the permissible limit of 60mpcm at 8.20am on Monday. ""In our area, the pollution is already high. The smog and fog were markedly enveloping Crossing Republik township on Monday. Many residents preferred not to take their morning walks.

On the last three Diwali days, the city has witnessed high levels of pollution. On Diwali day in 2013, the PM10 was nine times the permissible limit, at 900mpcm as per the Vasundhara monitoring centre. However, this reduced to 427mpcm and 410mpcm in 2014 and 2015, respectively, but which are still much higher than the permissible limit. Further, at the Model Town monitoring centre, the level of PM10 was at 796mpcm, 506mpcm and 496mpcm on Diwali day in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Apart from this, the noise levels also remained high on Diwali day as crackers were burst well past midnight. The pre-Diwali noise levels in 2015 stood at 57.9 decibels (db) against a limit of 45 db (day). This further increased to 76.3db during Diwali day. The noise pollution level this Diwali are yet to be released. ""Our air pollution data will be compiled soon while the detailed data will require another three days to be finalised.

Delhi's anti-pollution plans are at best piecemeal,"India, Nov. 2 -- Just as the response to dengue and chikungunya comes around the time the diseases acquire the shape of an epidemic, pollution-fighting measures too, it seems, wait until the air becomes heavy with toxic substances. The Delhi government on Tuesday announced such measures that can at best be called piecemeal. What's noticeable is that the odd-even scheme relating to vehicles, implemented during January and April this year, is missing in the new list of plans. Last year the Delhi government waited till December to announce its odd-even plan, which, while somewhat successful in reducing road congestion, did not go far in cleaning up the city's foul air, though the city government had claimed ""success"". That it was not successful is not surprising because a report by IIT Kanpur had identified dust and the exhaust from trucks as the chief culprits in contributing to air pollution rather than cars and jeeps, which were covered by the odd-even plan. And even in the truncated scheme, exemptions given were far too many, making the project feeble right from the start./As for its current measures, the government has decided to introduce vacuum cleaning and sprinkling of water on the roads. The question is how many vacuum cleaners and mist sprayers can be installed and how far they will be effective in places such as ITO or Anand Vihar, which are supposed to be some of the most polluted places in Delhi. And while air purifiers could work well indoors because closed doors and windows can keep the pollutants out to some extent, the same cannot be said for an outdoor environment, which is right open to the sources of pollution. Using chimney smoke tappers at crematoriums where wood is used for burning the dead can again help partly but it requires a study to detail how much of this can be a mitigating factor./The study by IIT Kanpur also said the PM10 and PM2.5 emission from dust on roads is ""79,626 kg per day and 22,165 kg per day, respectively"". So given the magnitude of the problem, will just sprinkling water help? I rest my case./There are things the government could have done when there was time. The first solution is repairing roads, and mechanical sweeping. Nothing practically was hard on this. The second was taking action against tandoors that use coal as fuel, which too was cited in the IIT report. And even if it might be conceded that not much could be done about polluting industries, at least they can be persuaded to use lighter diesel./So what comes through in the government's announcement is not a comprehensive plan but just some expedient measures that will achieve little to bring done the pollution level./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Odd-even missing in Delhi govt's latest plan to combat air pollution,"New Delhi, Nov. 2 -- The Delhi government unveiled on Tuesday a raft of measures to control an alarming spike in pollution, shifting attention from vehicular emissions to other sources that impact air quality such as crematoriums and construction and waste disposal sites in the capital./Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said there is no plan to reintroduce the odd-even scheme, a twice-experimented vehicle rationing project which, experts said, failed to bring down pollution levels earlier this year./Sisodia's announcement came after he spoke to officials from several departments amid a surge in post-Diwali pollution that has left the city-state blanketed by a thick layer of toxic smog, triggering warnings that even healthy people were at risk of respiratory problems./Multiple monitoring agencies put the air quality index at ""severe"", a level at which there is a dense concentration of particulate matter (PM 2.5), tiny particles that can pass through the body's filters and penetrate the lungs. The level of PM 10, slightly larger in size, also remained alarming./Experts blame PM 2.5 for a host of ailments, ranging from minor respiratory problems to reduced lung function and even cancer./Track pollution levels in your city with this real-time air quality map/Sisodia said the government has also asked the public works department (PWD) to re-introduce within two weeks vacuum cleaning and sprinkling of water on 1,250 km of roads./""By doing this, we can control dust particles. In several countries, such technology is being used to curb dust pollution,"" he said two days after the city recorded the worst Diwali night pollution in three years./He added that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has been asked to carry out regular inspections at construction sites with more than 20,000-square metre area./""Over 90% of dust pollution comes from the construction, sites which need to be regulated. There are 61 major construction sites in Delhi, there are several small such sites and most of them violate laid down rules,"" he said./Sisodia said the government will install chimney smoke-tappers to control emission at 75 cremation grounds where wood is used as the fuel./Apart from this, the government also decided to introduce controlled burning at garbage dumps, identified as major sources of harmful air pollutants./The new measures were announced a few days after government said it will install giant air purifiers and mist sprayers at busy road junctions in the metropolis of 16 million people, identified as among the most polluted cities in the world./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi, learn to clear the air: How five world cities got rid of smog","India, Nov. 3 -- The day after Diwali, Delhi woke up to find itself enveloped in a cloud of smog so thick that you could not see beyond a few feet. There was a sharp decline in air quality, with most places registering off-the-charts severe conditions. Reports suggest that Delhi's air quality over Diwali weekend was one of the worst in the world./But when it comes to battling deadly smogs, the Delhi of 2016 has many historical counterparts. Post the Industrial Revolution, many cities in the world have been choked by poisonous clouds of smog, resulting in new laws and regulations regarding pollution./Here are five of the deadliest smogs recorded in world history:/Meuse Valley Fog, 1930/What happened? On December 3, 1930, most of Belgium was shrouded in a cold foggy mist, but what the densely-populated valley of Meuse, east of Leige, witnessed has become a landmark in any study of air pollution./The heavily industrialized area was home to steelworks, zinc smelters, glass manufacturers and fertilizer and explosives plants. The cocktail of pollutants from these industries, including what later researchers say were gaseous fluorine and sulphur compounds, were prevented from rising by a temperature inversion. The city stewed in the toxic fumes for three whole days before the smog lifted./Deadly effect: 60 deaths are attributed to the fog. Many people reported nausea, vomiting, laryngeal irritation, dysponoeic breathing - asthma-like attacks with labored expiration./Lessons for Delhi: On December 6, the Royal Prosecutor of Leige opened a judicial enquiry and appointed a committee of medical experts to ascertain the causes. The Belgian Government voted 250,000 fr to defray the cost of the investigation. This was the first documented incident that showed air pollution could prove to be fatal./Donora Smog, Pennsylvania, 1948/What happened? In 1948, the southern Pennsylvania town of Donora woke up to a yellow haze. This wasn't new for a town where a steel and zinc plant chuffed out great puffs of smoke every day. But the town had never seen what unfolded over the course of the next five days: a yellowish-black smog darkened the skies and refused to lift./Deadly effect: The smog left 20 dead and 6,000 affected. It sickened half the town, creating a burning sensation in throat and eyes. At one time, the Donora Hotel was converted into an emergency hospital as hospitals ran out of beds./Lesson for Delhi: In 1949, the state government established the Division of Air Pollution Control to study the event. A million-dollar suit was filed against the operator of the Donora Zinc Works' American Steel and Wire Company and the plant shut down nine years after the event. The environmental disaster led to the formation of federal laws and agencies to control pollution, including Pennsylvania's 1970 'Environmental Bill of Rights', which states that ""the people have a right to clean air, [and] pure water.."", the national Environmental Protection Agency, and the Clean Air Act passed by the Congress./The Great London Smog, 1952/What happened? In the December of 1952, London grappled with a poisonous haze that consumed the city for five days and is remembered as the world's deadliest smog. The smog was a mixture of several deadly elements: sulphurous fumes from coal fires that Londoners lit to get through a particularly cold night, gases from factories, the misty fog and an anticyclone which prevented the toxic air from dispersing./Deadly effect: 4,000 lost their lives and many suffered breathing problems. Prize cattle displayed at Smithfield died of suffocation, leading people to fashion masks for their livestock. In the Isle of Dogs, people could not see their feet as they walked./Lessons for Delhi: When the haze lifted from London, the city launched an investigation into what had happened. The Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968 were a direct outcome of the killer smog, which banned emissions of black smoke and made it mandatory for urban residents and factory owners to convert to smokeless fuels./Los Angeles smogs, 1950s and 1960s/What happened? Los Angeles is no stranger to smogs as the area is a natural pollution trap. Several smogs occur here as the mountains cause temperature inversions which trap dirty, polluted air and don't let it disperse. One of the first severe smogs was recorded during World War II, which people suspected to be a Japanese chemical attack. But through the 1950s, 60s, 70s, smogs were a recurring feature in Los Angeles. For a long time, the public was not convinced that car emissions were as much responsible as industry./Deadly effect: On particular days, the smog was bad enough for parents to keep children out of school, cancel athletic events and send people scurrying to emergency rooms with breathing problems./Lessons for Delhi: In California, sustained public movements and citizen action changed the course. After a link between vehicular emissions and smog was proved, movements such as Stamp Out Smog created awareness and took on the automobile industry. In 1954, about 6,000 people turned up at a Pasadena protest against pollution. By early 1960s, Californian law demanded stronger anti-smog controls on cars. While smog hasn't disappeared from Los Angeles, the city has improved considerably./Beijing Smog, 2013/What happened? Many of China's cities have a poor air quality record, but in January 2013, AQI in Beijing went up to 993, signaling an 'airpocalyspe' in the country. Visibility was so poor that entire buildings disappeared in the haze./Deadly effect: People stopped venturing outside unless necessary, and even then, with face masks on. The Children's Hospital in Beijing reported treating 7,000 patients on a daily basis. The smog affected other Chinese cities as well, impacting 800 million people, according to researchers. Cases of lung cancer were detected in very young patients, which were linked to the pollution./Lessons for Delhi: The government responded by cracking down on firecrackers and outdoor barbecues during the Chinese New Year celebrations. Cracker sales declined by 37%. Beijing also pledged to lower its PM2.5 levels, earmarking $277 billion plan to cut down pollution and emissions. In 2015, Beijing issued a 'red alert' because of alarming air quality levels and shut down more than 2,000 factories./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

India's air quality among world's worst over Diwali weekend: Report,"India, Nov. 3 -- Over the Diwali weekend of 2016, India's air quality was among the world's worst and between 40% and 100% worse in five north Indian cities than at the same time the preceding year, according to global air pollution data and an IndiaSpend analysis of national data and our #Breathe network of sensors./On October 30 and 31, 2016, from 9 pm to the wee hours of the next morning, North India-especially parts of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar-recorded PM 2.5 levels of over 500 g/m cube-exhibiting ""beyond scale"" pollution values, according to the database run by Berkeley Earth, an independent US research organisation. Represented through heat maps, the database typically records the world's worst air quality-at the top of the scale, most between ""very unhealthy"" to ""hazardous""-in dust-blown Xinjiang province in northwest China and parts of North India./PM 2.5 is fine particulate matter about 30 times finer than a human hair. These particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and respiratory diseases, and are known to pose the greatest risk to human health. Their measurement is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)./For this analysis, IndiaSpend compared 2016 Diwali air-quality data (October 23 to November 1) from our #Breathe monitors-in Lucknow, Agra and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Patna in Bihar, and two locations in Delhi-with air-pollution data recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in similar locations over the same Diwali period (November 4 to 13) in 2015./South Delhi's 24-hour average PM 2.5 levels in 2016 were 38% higher than on Diwali night 2015. The next day, these levels were twice as high as the day after Diwali in 2015, crossing 650 ug/m cube, 26 times above the WHO's guideline levels, or levels considered safe. On the morning of November 1, 2016, citizens in Delhi woke up to an average PM 2.5 level of over 700 ug/m cube-some of the highest levels recorded the world over and 29 times above WHO standards./The WHO guideline for 24-hour average PM 2.5 levels is 25 ug/m cube. With an annual average PM 2.5 level of 122 ug/m cube, Delhi's air is the worst among global megacities with dense populations, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016 based on WHO data./The CPCB sensors were located within a 5-km radius of our #Breathe. We observed that for the week ending October 30, 2016, PM 2.5 levels recorded by the CPCB monitors were lower than those recorded by #Breathe sensors in many instances. This variance could be attributed to the difference in location and other local climatic factors. However, the trends of variation in PM 2.5 levels over the week are similar, as the graph below indicates./Away from the national capital region, Patna recorded a 24-hour average PM 2.5 level of 437.3 ug/m cube- nearly 95% higher than the levels recorded last year (224.9 ug/m cube) and 17 times above WHO guideline levels. In Varanasi, while Diwali day itself recorded a 40% higher average of PM 2.5 at 247.1 ug/m cube, the next day's levels continued to soar to an average of 578.6 ug/m cube, 23 times above WHO guideline levels. Agra recorded rising pollution levels progressively up to the morning of November 1, 2016, more than double the values recorded last year. Lucknow recorded a 37% increase in PM 2.5 levels in 2016 over 2015./The escalation in pollution levels this year was swifter and sharper, according to our analysis./On October 23, 2016-one week before Diwali-Varanasi recorded a 24-hour average PM 2.5 level of 96 ug/m cube, nearly half the level recorded last year. Similarly, average pollution levels in Agra and the Delhi were 38% and 30% lower, respectively, than those recorded on the corresponding day in 2015 (November 4, 2015). Lucknow was 11% less polluted this year, while only Patna recorded 38% higher levels, compared to November 4, 2015./Lower wind speeds and a shorter vertical mixing layer-the height at which air turbulence can disperse pollutants-caused particulate matter to remain trapped near the surface level, according to the CPCB. With the festival arriving earlier this year, the recorded mean wind speed was 61% lower.

Car-free zones to curb pollution is a great idea but it will not work in Delhi,"India, Nov. 3 -- Union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu has told the New Delhi Municipal Council on Wednesday to convert Connaught Place and Khan Market into 'no vehicle zones' to curb the city's air pollution and traffic congestion./The city of about 20 million, which ranks among the world's top cities with its toxic air on a World Health Organization list, has been struggling to clean up its air that contains a toxic cocktail of dust, smoke and gases from vehicle and factory exhausts./While I agree in principle with Naidu's blockbuster of an idea, it will not work in Delhi./Here's why:/First, Delhi is full to the brim with touch-me-not people, and the number of such people per square foot is highest in central Delhi (Connaught Place-Khan Market area, aka Lutyens Delhi), the seat of government power./So you have politicians, bureaucrats, judges, defence personnel, businessmen and diplomats moving in cars with beacons or UN/CC/CD number places./This section will never agree to leave their cars and walk to Khan Market/CP./In fact, both Khan Market and CP are connected by the Delhi Metro, but how many of the Lutyens' Delhi residents use it?/If they can't use a first-class system such as the Delhi Metro, I don't think they will use any alternative transport system (battery-operated cars etc) that could be made available by the government to access these popular spots./If they don't follow, then be sure those in non-Lutyens areas won't either, citing all kinds of problems: Lack of public transport, distance, cost, crowds etc./In the West, politicians use cycles/public transport to reach their offices. Here, ministers don't even use the fantastic Airport Express but opt for their polluting cavalcades./The urban development minister must lead the way in this and start using public transport whenever possible./Second, let's not blame the residents of Lutyens' Delhi only. There is a certain class of Indians who abhor the idea of walking, (at least in India)./It's a culture thing (as well as fitness issue), especially in Delhi: To many among them, cars are an accessory and add to their social stature./So what's the point of buying a fancy car with a fancy number plate and not moving around in it?/Will they give up their vehicles for a pollution-free city? Not likely./Third, traders are always against any transport rationing system, and the government of the day listens to them because, no surprises here, they are useful during civic elections./As expected, some have already spoken out against Naidu: ""The biggest reason why Khan Market sees a lot of people above the age of 40 is because they feel safe. Now if you pedestrianise the area, they will stop coming as cars will be parked far away and hawkers will start encroaching. Khan Market is a high street market, not a mall,"" said Khan Market Traders Association president, Sanjeev Mehra./Put simply, he means: Our high-end shoppers will not walk down to the market. Oh, those dirty hawkers, how can they 'pollute' Khan Market!/Traders in Connaught Place (CP) --- an area where it is a pleasure to walk --- said that it would lead to long traffic jams on the roads just outside CP./Fourth, there is no political will to push this idea through. There never likely to be./We have heard this plan before but governments have never managed to roll it out, fearing an electoral backlash./Take for example, the odd-even scheme. After two rounds, the Delhi government is not keen to revive it but is now focusing on giant air purifiers and mist sprayers. The idea was worth pursuing for a few more rounds./Fifth, what is stopping the government from taking strong measures such as taxing cars heavily and hiking parking fees in areas such as Connaught Place?/By the way, parking in Khan Market is free (paid by the traders' association)./The obvious counter-argument of the I-can't-leave-my-car brigade is lack of proper urban transport over-crowding, weather etc./But unless people shift to public transport, the government will not invest in improving it./If you can't do your bit to curb pollution then don't expect clean air./But do remember that it is a do-or-die situation./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

What world's deadliest smogs teach us,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 4 -- The day after Diwali, Delhi woke up to find it self enveloped in a cloud of smog so thick that you could not see beyond a few feet. There was a sharp decline in air quality, with most places registering off-the-charts severe conditions. Reports suggest that Delhi's air quality over Diwali weekend was one of the worst in the world./But when it comes to battling deadly smogs, the Delhi of 2016 has many historical counterparts.After the Industrial Revolution, many cities in the world have been choked by poisonous clouds of smog, resulting in new laws and regulations regarding pollution./MEUSE VALLEY FOG, 1930/On December3,1930,most of Belgium was shrouded in a cold foggy mist,but what the densely populated valley of Meuse, east of Leige, witnessed has become a landmark in any study of air pollution./The heavily industrialized area was home to steel works,zinc smelters, glass manufacturers and fertilizer and explosives plants.The cocktail of pollutants from these industries, including what later researchers say were gaseous fluorine and sulphur compounds, were prevented from rising by a temperature inversion. The city stewed in the toxic fumes for three whole days before the smog lifted./60 deaths are attributed to the fog. Many people reported nausea, vomiting, laryngeal irritation, dysponoeic breathing-asthma- like attacks with labored expiration./What Delhi can learn: On December 6, the Royal Prosecutor of Leige opened a judicial enquiry and appointed a committee of medical experts to ascertain the causes.The Belgian Government voted 250,000fr to defray the cost of the investigation.This was the first documented incident that showed air pollution could prove to be fatal./DONORA SMOG, PENNSYLVANIA, 1948/In 1948, the southern Pennsylvania town of Donora woke up to a yellow haze. This wasn't new for a town where a steel and zinc plant chuffed out great puffs of smoke every day. But the town had never seen what unfolded over the course of the next five days: a yellowish-black smog darkened the skies and refused to lift./The smog left 20 dead and 6,000 affected. It sickened half the town, creating a burning sensation in throat and eyes. At one time, the Donora Hotel was converted into an emergency hospital as hospitals ran out of beds./What Delhi can learn: In 1949, the state government established the Division of Air Pollution Control to study the event.A million dollar suit was filed against the operator of the Donora Zinc Works 'American Steel and Wire Company and the plant shut down nine years after the event.The environmental disaster led to the formation of federal laws and agencies to control pollution, including Pennsylvania's 1970 'Environmental Bill of Rights', which states that ""the people have a right to clean air, [and] pure water...."", the national Environmental Protection Agency, and the Clean Air Act passed by the Congress./THE GREAT LONDON SMOG, 1952/In the December of 1952, London grappled with a poisonous haze that consumed the city for five days and is remembered as the world's deadliest smog.The smog was a mixture of several deadly elements: sulphurous fumes from coal fires that Londoner slit to get through a particularly cold night, gases from factories, the misty fog and an anticyclone which prevented the toxic air from dispersing./4,000 lost their lives and many suffered breathing problems.Prize cattle displayed at Smithfield died of suffocation, leading people to fashion masks for their livestock.In the Isle of Dogs,people could not see their feet as they walked./What Delhi can learn: When the haze lifted from London, the city launched an investigation into what had happened. The Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968 were a direct outcome of the killer smog,which banned emissions of black smoke and made it mandatory for urban residents and factory owners to convert to smokeless fuels./BEIJING SMOG, 2013/What happened?Many of China's cities have a poor air quality record, but in January2013, AQI in Beijing went up to 993, signalingan' airpocalyspe'inthecountry.Visibility was so poor that entire buildings disappeared in the haze./People stopped venturing outside unless necessary, and even then, with face masks on. The Children's Hospital in Beijing reported treating 7,000 patients on a daily basis. The smog affected other Chinese cities as well, impacting 800 million people,according to researchers.Cases of lung cancer were detected in very young patients,which were linked to the pollution./What Delhi can learn:The government responded by cracking down on firecrackers and outdoor barbecues during the Chinese New Year celebrations.Cracker sales declined by 37%.Beijing also pledged to lower its PM2.5 levels, earmarking $277 billion plan to cut down pollution and emissions./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Under the weather? Indoor pollution could be hurting you at home,"India, Nov. 4 -- Every so often - winter, Diwali - there's talk of how smog and air pollution are hurting your lungs. But there's a hidden danger to your health hiding in your home: indoor air pollution./Within the glass confines of our office buildings and in poorly ventilated homes, you could be breathing in kitchen fumes, pest dander, even chemical traces from cleaning products./""In a lot of homes, particularly in an urban jungle like Mumbai, the problem is worsened by lack of direct sunlight,"" says architect Aravind Unni./Call centre executive Rupali Gopal*, 25, for instance, has suffered repeated bouts of breathlessness, coughing and sniffling over the past six months./""I never used to fall ill so frequently,"" she says. Gopal and her colleagues eventually realised that their centrally air-conditioned workspace was to blame./""There is hardly any ventilation and no openable windows,"" says Nilesh Yevale*, 29. ""As a result, we get no fresh air - and if one person falls ill, the virus keeps circulating.""/As the cost of commercial space skyrockets in Mumbai, companies tend to accommodate as many people as possible in a given area, says Pankaj Kapoor, director of realty consultancy Liases Foras. ""Over the past 10 years, the average space per employee in Mumbai has dropped from 100 sq ft to between 40 and 65 sq ft,"" Kapoor adds./With few business districts in the city, many office buildings have been constructed in residential areas. ""This brings large air-conditioning plants into the midsts of homes, and this is neither good for the local residents' health nor is it sustainable ecologically,"" says architect Unni./Solutions must begin at the design and planning stages, at the macro and micro levels./""Green building principles like keeping in mind direction of wind and sunlight to allow for natural lighting and ventilation are good starting points,"" says Unni./IN BLACK AND WHITE/""In Mumbai the value of land overrides everything, even the well-being of its population,"" says Unni. It's important that laws prescribing minimum amount of sunlight, fresh air, good ventilation are made part of the National Building Code (NBC) of India and enforced, he adds./Even in the bylaws of the NBC there is no mention of climatic condition and building materials that are conducive to the environment and people's health, says Prathima Manohar, an architect and an urban planner. ""For instance, bamboo and grass curtains could work wonders in cooling spaces naturally.""/It would also help to create more commercial zones in the city. ""Mixing residential and commercial use is not a good idea because both have different requirements and needs that impact on one another,"" says Unni. ""For instance, residential buildings generate more wet waste and this could spread infections in office buildings with a high density of people. Office spaces, meanwhile, typically accommodate less greenery and generate more heat.""/ACTION STATIONS/There are some things you can do to reduce your exposure to indoor pollution. One simple and effective measure is house plants. ""They can work wonders in improving air quality,"" says Manohar. Research done by environmental researcher Kamal Meattle in 2008 showed that the areca palm, mother-in-law's tongue and money plant released the most oxygen, absorb the most carbon dioxide and reduce pollution in the air dramatically. If planted in the right amount, they could even improve air quality in a workspace. For instance, he says, you need six to eight waist-high mother-in-law's tongue plants per person. He adds that plants like these could take care of problems such as eye irritation, headaches, lung impairments and other common respiratory diseases./Another way to keep rodents, cockroaches and pigeons at bay is to build smart furniture./""Furniture is no longer a prop to fill in an already cluttered space. It's an important focus area in health and employee satisfaction,"" says Umesh Rao, founder and CEO of Vector Projects, a turnkey solution provider for commercial and residential real-estate projects. ""In India, we do not change our furniture even when it is beyond repair. The older the furniture the more chances are of it being attacked by pests and insects. This could worsen indoor pollution and spread infections.""/Finally, people must stop depending on the airconditioner to freshen their living spaces. ""Keeping the windows open at least for an hour a day, ideally in the morning, when outdoor air pollution is low, could be one way to release indoor pollution and make your home healthier,"" says Manohar./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Car-free zones to curb pollution a great idea, but will not work in Delhi","India, Nov. 4 -- Union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu told the New Delhi Municipal Council on Wednesday to convert Connaught Place and Khan Market into 'no vehicle zones' to curb the city's air pollution and traffic congestion./The city of about 20 million, which ranks among the world's top cities with its toxic air on a World Health Organization list, has been struggling to clean up its air that contains a toxic cocktail of dust, smoke and gases from vehicle and factory exhausts./While I agree in principle with Naidu's blockbuster of an idea, it will not work in Delhi./Here's why:/First, Delhi is full to the brim with touch-me-not people, and the number of such people per square foot is highest in central Delhi (Connaught Place-Khan Market area, aka Lutyens Delhi), the seat of government power./So you have politicians, bureaucrats, judges, defence personnel, businessmen and diplomats moving in cars with beacons or UN/CC/CD number places./This section will never agree to leave their cars and walk to Khan Market/CP./In fact, both Khan Market and CP are connected by the Delhi Metro, but how many of the Lutyens' Delhi residents use it?/If they can't use a first-class system such as the Delhi Metro, I don't think they will use any alternative transport system (battery-operated cars etc) that could be made available by the government to access these popular spots./If they don't follow, then be sure those in non-Lutyens areas won't either, citing all kinds of problems: Lack of public transport, distance, cost, crowds etc./In the West, politicians use cycles/public transport to reach their offices. Here, ministers don't even use the fantastic Airport Express but opt for their polluting cavalcades./The urban development minister must lead the way in this and start using public transport whenever possible./Second, let's not blame the residents of Lutyens' Delhi only. There is a certain class of Indians who abhor the idea of walking, (at least in India)./It's a culture thing (as well as fitness issue), especially in Delhi: To many among them, cars are an accessory and add to their social stature./So what's the point of buying a fancy car with a fancy number plate and not moving around in it?/Will they give up their vehicles for a pollution-free city? Not likely./Third, traders are always against any transport rationing system, and the government of the day listens to them because, no surprises here, they are useful during civic elections./As expected, some have already spoken out against Naidu: ""The biggest reason why Khan Market sees a lot of people above the age of 40 is because they feel safe. Now if you pedestrianise the area, they will stop coming as cars will be parked far away and hawkers will start encroaching. Khan Market is a high street market, not a mall,"" said Khan Market Traders Association president, Sanjeev Mehra./Put simply, he means: Our high-end shoppers will not walk down to the market. Oh, those dirty hawkers, how can they 'pollute' Khan Market!/Traders in Connaught Place (CP) --- an area where it is a pleasure to walk --- said that it would lead to long traffic jams on the roads just outside CP./Fourth, there is no political will to push this idea through. There never likely to be./Check: What your AQI?/We have heard this plan before but governments have never managed to roll it out, fearing an electoral backlash./Take for example, the odd-even scheme. After two rounds, the Delhi government is not keen to revive it but is now focusing on giant air purifiers and mist sprayers. The idea was worth pursuing for a few more rounds./Fifth, what is stopping the government from taking strong measures such as taxing cars heavily and hiking parking fees in areas such as Connaught Place?/By the way, parking in Khan Market is free (paid by the traders' association)./The obvious counter-argument of the I-can't-leave-my-car brigade is lack of proper urban transport over-crowding, weather etc./But unless people shift to public transport, the government will not invest in improving it./If you can't do your bit to curb pollution then don't expect clean air./But do remember that it is a do-or-die situation./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Kejriwal blames stubble burning for increasing pollution in Delhi,"New Delhi, Nov. 5 -- Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal admitted on Friday that air pollution in the city had spiked but appeared reluctant to clamp a ban on firecrackers seen as responsible for smog and haze blanketing the city./Speaking to a TV channel, Kejriwal blamed stubble burning as the biggest reason for increasing pollution across the city and batted for technological solutions to dissuade farmers from carrying out the environmentally damaging exercise./""Delhi pollution cannot be seen in isolation. The government has to give subsidy for alternative technology to stubble burning,"" Kejriwal said./But the chief minister appeared reluctant to blame firecrackers for the smog engulfing Delhi that has been described as the worst in 17 years and triggered a health crisis across the city./""Diwali can affect one or two nights. If people want to voluntarily shun crackers, they can do it. This year, fireworks were 40% less,"" Kejriwal said./On Friday morning, HT's air-quality index showed the maximum severe warning at 11 different spots in the city - a situation that holds out the risk of asthma, health disease, stroke and even cancer for Delhi's 17 million residents./Kejriwal identified three causes for the spiking pollution - stubble burning, dust and vehicular exhaust. The government has already unveiled plans to install giant outdoor air purifiers at key intersections and regularly vacuum clean streets to improve the city's air, among the worst in the world./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Is the post-Diwali smog getting to your dog? Give it some TLC,"New Delhi, Nov. 5 -- Do you know what the new chai-time conversation in the Capital is? Zero visibility, high levels of pollution and the thick layer of smog that has settled itself over the city. In the aftermath of Diwali, the city has hit alarmingly new levels of pollution, so much so that even going out for an evening stroll seems like an unhealthy option. In such a grim situation, the worst affected are our furry friends - dogs./""The number of cases that we have tended to after the festival is worrisome. Every year, we have people come to us with dogs who got burned or injured during the festival. This year, people are bringing in pets who have contracted allergies and other respiratory issues given the amount of smoke in the air,"" says Bhanu Dev Sharma, a veterinarian./While not much can be done about the pollution in the air, there are several steps that pet parents can take to ensure their babies are least affected by the smog. ""It is very important that pets be taken for a walk in a park. I know that there are issues around walking a dog in most parks, but in such times fresh air is a must for them. And do not take them out on the roads, even if that means taking them around in a car,"" adds Sharma./Other tips include using air purifiers and keeping the doors and windows locked. ""Pollution is everywhere, so if you think your pet is safe inside your house, you need to reconsider. Turn on your air purifiers or even air conditioners - as they too purify air. And keep all your doors and windows locked as much as you can. Also, ensure that you spend a lot of time with them as they need to be as comfortable as they can,"" explains Swati Tandon, pet expert, adding ""Exercise of some sort is crucial. It will help keep the toxics off their bodies so find ample time for that too.""/And what can one do if there are any signs of a respiratory problem or a reaction to smog? ""Take your dog to a vet at the earliest even if you notice nasal discharge or any other symptom. Put them on anti-allergics or homeopathy, and if you can, then fashion a mask out of a muzzle. That may help,"" says Satbir Josan, another veterinarian./People against air pollution/The thick smoke hanging over Delhi-NCR after Diwali celebration left many shocked and frustrated. The smoke from the firecrackers has not just choked the air but also affected visibility, even after a week. To raise awareness about the issue, Manas Fuloria, a resident of Gurgaon is organising a people meeting in the city./""We have enough laws but the problem is enforcement. We will sign the petition against the open burning and increasing pollution and submit it to the local authorities, Chief Minister of Haryana, Delhi and at Prime Minister Office too! Not just government but we all are responsible for the same,"" says Fuloria./The level of pollution has got manifolds in the past few years. ""The smoke is due to the increase of pollution level in the air. Once a level gets certain threshold, sunlight can't penetrate,"" says Fuloria, adding that not just burning of crackers but all other activities such as crop burning, waste burning add to the problem./Catch it live/What: People Against Air Pollution/Where: Leisure Valley park, Sector-29, Gurgaon/When: Nov 5/Timings: 10 pm/Nearest Metro Station: IFFCO Metro Station on Yellow Line/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

It's not fair to blame just Punjab's farmers for Delhi's red pollution map,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 6 -- Saturday morning in New Delhi felt like a day from the dark and smoggy winter of 1998.But even in that year, which triggered the Supreme Court to introduce CNG engines for public transport and phase out old commercial vehicles, the conditions had been much better than they are now./Though the Nitrogen Oxide that hurts the eyes is almost at the same level, average particulate matter is more than double of what it had been then./Delhi has reached this sorry state due to a lack of political will and the unwillingness of its residents to change their lifestyle.The per capita registration of high-emission vehicles in the city is the highest in India, according to data from the road transport ministry. Transport officials say that more than half of Delhi's middle-class homes have two or more cars -- a sign of their growing affluence./This has led to the vehicle population to treble since 2007 -- when the first signs of the reemergence of pollution rise had became visible - and average traffic speeds on congested stretches have dropped to 50 per cent of what they were in 2000./One can no longer look at Delhi and its adjacent towns are separate units since the green corridors that divided them have vanished./As per the Census Commissioner's estimate for 2015, the population in the new concrete conglomerate of Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonepat, Noida and Ghaziabad has almost doubled to 28 million in the last 15 years.The majority of this population growth has happened in the areas that surround Delhi./On Friday, two days into the worst smog the city has witnessed in 17 years, the particulate matter in Faridabad was even higher than in south Delhi, while Gurgaon and Noida were at par with the Capital, showing that pollution is not just a Delhi problem any longer./But even today,politicians are abdicating their responsibility by blaming stubble burning alone for the ongoing crisis. This is not just counter-productive, it is also an over-simplification.Had the stubble burning in Punjab been the only cause for Delhi's bad air, pollution in cities falling between Delhi and Punjab would have been alarmingly high as well./Rohtak, north-west of Delhi in Haryana, serves as an interesting case study. Winds bringing smoke from Punjab farms should spike Rohtak's pollution levels. On Saturday, the particulate matter in the fast-growing township, which has an IIM and an AIIMS, was less than 100 micrograms per cubic metre.About 50 kms away, the PM10 level in Delhi's Punjab Bagh on Rohtak Road was nearly 1,200./Here is how the air deteriorates between the two places.Three big industrial zones, Nangloi, Bawana and Mundka, release huge pollutants. Delhi's inner and outer rings roads add heavy vehicular traffic to the mix. Cramped colonies around the industrial zones not only lead to traffic congestion but also stop the foul air from escaping./""The wind speed in the last few days has dropped and there has been a dip in temperature.They contribute to pollutants getting trapped at a breathing level,"" says Gufrain Beg of the Indian Institute of Tropical Metrology./While stubble burning may be a big contributor, source appropriation studies by the Central Pollution Control Board and IIT Kanpur in 2015 showed that over 80 per cent of air pollution in Delhi was because of sources within the city and its immediate neighbourhood./Blaming stubble burning alone for the rise in Delhi's air pollution serves as a convenient tool because it shifts the blame on people not accountable to the residents of Delhi. It helps Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the city's administrative head Najeeb Jung evade questions about their failure to take adequate measures. While they shrug their shoulders, Delhi's pollution map is all red and the lungs of millions of Delhites are turning black./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

The majority of this population growth has happened in the areas that surround Delhi./On Friday, two days into the worst smog the city has witnessed in 17 years, the particulate matter in Faridabad was even higher than in south Delhi, while Gurgaon and Noida were at par with the Capital, showing that pollution is not just a Delhi problem any longer./But even today, politicians are abdicating their responsibility by blaming stubble burning alone for the ongoing crisis. This is not just counter-productive, it is also an over-simplification. Had the stubble burning in Punjab been the only cause for Delhi's bad air, pollution in other cities falling between Delhi and Punjab would have been alarmingly high as well./Rohtak, north-west of Delhi in Haryana, serves as an interesting case study. Winds bringing smoke from Punjab farms should spike Rohtak's pollution levels. On Saturday, the particulate matter in the fast-growing township, which has an IIM and an AIIMS, was less than 100 micrograms per cubic metre. About 50 kms away, the PM10 level in Delhi's Punjab Bagh locality on Rohtak Road was nearly 1,200./Here is how the air deteriorates between the two places. Three big industrial zones, Nangloi, Bawana and Mundka, release huge pollutants. Delhi's inner and outer rings roads add heavy vehicular traffic to the mix. And cramped colonies around the industrial zones not only lead to traffic congestion but also stop the foul air from escaping./""The wind speed in the last few days has dropped and there has been a dip in temperature. All this has contributed to pollutants getting trapped at a breathing level,"" says Gufrain Beg of the Indian Institute of Tropical Metrology./While stubble burning may be a big contributor, source appropriation studies by the Central Pollution Control Board and IIT Kanpur in 2015 showed that over 80 per cent of air pollution in Delhi was because of sources within the city and its immediate neighbourhood./Blaming stubble burning alone for the rise in Delhi's air pollution serves as a convenient tool because it shifts the blame on people not accountable to the residents of Delhi. It helps Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the city's administrative head Najeeb Jung evade questions about their failure to take adequate measures. While they shrug their shoulders, Delhi's pollution map is all red and the lungs of millions of Delhites are turning black./Read more - Air so dirty you can smell, taste: Delhi grapples with toxic pollution/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

All you wanted to know about Delhi air pollution cleared up here,"New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- Thick smog has enveloped New Delhi since the Diwali festival, as the Capital witnessed the worst spell of smog in a season on Sunday./The air quality has been ""severe"" as pollution levels touched a new high. Levels of particulate matter finer than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) crossed the 900 mark in some areas, recording almost 15 times the safety limit./Environmentalists said Delhi is facing an emergency situation and the AAP government has introduced a set of measures that include closing down schools for 3 days and shutting down the Badarpur power plant for 10 days./Here's all you need to know about Delhi air pollution:/What is smog?/A weather expert said that for a 'cloud' causing low visibility to qualify as smog, there should be enough pollution, smoke, and moisture in the air. The smoke and other particulate matters combine with fog when there is high humidity and low temperatures to form smog./What is causing this pollution?/The smog, since Diwali, has been relentless due to certain weather conditions such as low wind speed, lack of vertical wind and lower temperatures. Winds usually blow the pollutants and particulate matter away, helping to clear up some of the smog. But with no winds, the pollutants remain stagnant in the air. This was exacerbated by a unique wind phenomenon that blew most of the smoke emanating from various parts of northern India towards New Delhi./The spike in pollutants during the festival season has primarily been attributed to vehicular traffic, smoke from firecrackers, and the burning of post-harvest paddy stalks in neighbouring states./""This is visibly the worst pollution spell that we have witnessed in the city so far. We will have to wait for the weather conditions to play up. The temperature is dipping and the mixing height, which means the dispersion of pollution particles in the air, is low. This is making the pollutant particles float in the air,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./What is the impact of air pollution on health?/Many people said that the thick smog left bitter taste in the mouth and eyes watering. Hospitals have reported a rise in cases of respiratory distress, with elderly and children the worst hit./""There have been a large number of people in our pulmonary out-patient department with cough and breathlessness, without previous history of respiratory illness,"" said professor GC Khilnani of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./Particulate matter are tiny dust particles that can be absorbed in lungs and blood tissues, and trigger respiratory and cardiac problems./What can you do to stay safe?/As the government mulls over ways to curb pollution, Delhi residents are being forces to find ways to safeguard themselves./Wear masks. Masks -- available at prices ranging from Rs 90 to up to Rs 2,200 -- can be meant for one-time use and the high-priced ones with air filters claim to stop over 99 per cent of the pollutants from entering the user's nostrils./Install air purifiers. Air purifiers are expensive but an Assocham survey has said that there has been a jump of nearly 50% in the demand for air purifiers in Delhi-NCR in last four days./What are the measures proposed by the government?/The urgent measures announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday include shutting all schools - private and public - till Wednesday, a move that the Aam Aadmi Party government was forced to take after saying it was not necessary earlier in the week./Other steps include:/Another round of odd-even initiative/Shutting down Badarpur coal plant for 10 days/Five day ban on all construction and demolition in the city/Water sprinkling of roads/Five-day ban on diesel generators, except at places such as hospitals and cellphone towers/The Delhi government has also asked the Centre to consider cloud seeding, a process that induces artificial rain that can help settle pollutants and clear the smog. The efficacy of the process is, however, debatable./Are the measures enough?/A look at the pollution control measures taken by the Delhi government last year suggests that a number of steps, which otherwise should have continued at regular intervals, have only been reintroduced or re-packaged./Environmentalists too are unimpressed with the directives, saying they believed the steps are a repetition of last year's action plan./Bhargav Krishna from the Public Health Foundation of India asked why the government did not act earlier, when the situation could have been controlled./Moreover, none of the measures introduced by the government are considered viable long-term options./What can we learn from other cities around the world?/China's capital Beijing too reels under heavy winter smog as the country switches to coal-fuelled central heating and releases more pollutants in the air. But a newspaper said China has launched a crackdown on heavy vehicles that failed to meet emission standards./Beijing also plans to create ventilation corridors by connecting the city's parks, rivers and lakes, highways with green belts and low building blocks that will allow the air to flow and blow away smog./Delhi can also learn from cities such as London and Los Angeles that have battled deadly smogs in the past, but have taken measures to combat the situation./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Supreme Court to hear petitions on Delhi pollution crisis tomorrow,"New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday petitions on the air pollution crisis in Delhi amid mounting concern over a thick blanket of haze enveloping the city for a week./The top court asked the advocates of the central and state government to be present when the public interest litigations are heard on Tuesday./The court's decision comes on a day the Centre and city lieutenant governor have called emergency meetings to tackle the pollution, which holds out the threat of a massive public health hazard for the Capital's 18 million citizens./The city government has already unveiled a raft of measures, including a temporary ban on construction and demolition work, a three-day shutting of all schools and vacuum cleaning of roads./But many experts fear the measures may be too little, too late. On Monday, Hindustan Times' air quality monitoring system showed the maximum ""severe"" warning across all but two spots in the Capital at 11am. Anand Vihar in east Delhi and Connaught Place were among the most polluted spots with levels of the most-toxic PM 2.5 at 12 to 15 times times above the safety limit./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi's worst smog yet wakes up govt, emergency measures announced","New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- The Delhi government woke up after breathing toxic air since Diwali and announced a spate of ""emergency"" measures on Sunday - shutting down schools and halting all construction activities - to combat the crippling smog that has engulfed the Capital./Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who compared the city's conditions with that of a gas chamber, held an emergency cabinet meeting before announcing the list of steps to tackle the air pollution that was worst in almost two decades on Sunday./The Capital, which topped a 2014 World Health Organization list of cities with the foulest air, recorded an average level of PM2.5 - tiny particulate matter that can clog lungs - at nearly 600 micrograms per cubic meter on Sunday. That's more than 60 times the level considered safe by the WHO and 10 times the government's norms./Anumitra Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) compared the conditions with that of the 1952 Great Smog in London, which killed about 4,000 people./The urgent measures announced on Sunday include shutting all schools - private and public - till Wednesday, a move that the Aam Aadmi Party government was forced to take after saying it was not necessary earlier in the week./Anti-pollution experts, however, welcomed the decision to put construction projects on hold for at least five days, to temporarily shut the coal-fired power plant at Badarpur, which produces fly ash, and to vacuum clean and douse roads with water./Another welcome step was a five-day ban on the use of all diesel-powered electricity generators, except at places such as hospitals and cellphone towers. The government also decided to enforce strictly a ban on the burning of leaves and garbage in the city./The chief minister, who advised residents to stay indoors, said his AAP government could consider a proposal for artificial rain through cloud seeding./""We have asked officials to work with the Centre and assess its possibility and effectiveness.""/The efficacy of cloud seeding is doubtful because such measures in pollution-hit Beijing have proved futile and highly expensive./Pollution reached an alarming level in a large swathe of northern India as smog-related road accidents in Haryana killed at least nine people and injured 10 on national highway 24 in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur./The smog cover led to the cancellation of two Ranji Trophy matches - Bengal and Gujarat at Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium and Hyderabad versus Tripura at Karnail Singh Stadium in Delhi./Weather officials and pollution monitoring agencies, however, held out hope, saying the overhanging grey smog could clear by Wednesday./As people gasped for air, Kejriwal said: ""Please stay indoors and try to work from home as much as possible.""/His government is also planning another round of the odd-even road rationing formula, which was tried before for two fortnights in January and April./Delhi's pollution levels shot up after Diwali on October 30. Smoke from firecrackers, vehicle and factory exhausts, and the burning of post-harvest stalks of paddy and other cereal plants in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab combined to make matters worse. Low wind speed and high humidity also blocked dispersal of pollutants./Kejriwal blamed Delhi's neighbours for choking the city and accused the Centre of doing little to curb the practice of farmers burning crop stubble./But the Centre disagreed, saying 80% of the pollution was because of the litter the city generates. Union environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told news agency ANI that satellite images from ISRO show neighbouring states were responsible for only 20% of the pollution./Haryana environment and industries minister Vipul Goel countered Kejriwal, saying the Delhi chief minister should not play politics over pollution and indulge in blame game. ""We should work together to give the people a clean environment. Our government has come down hard on hundreds of farmers burning crop residue. The situation is being constantly monitored.""/For his part, Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, who facing a tough election next year, said farmers have been asked not to burn crop stubble./""We have also given better farm equipment, which can help in cutting of crops in a better way but they do some or the other mistake.""/The Centre and Delhi lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung called meetings of officials on Monday to find ways to clear the city's toxic air, which is posing a health risk to millions of people./Hundreds of people, including children, on Sunday staged a protest in New Delhi over the worsening air quality, demanding immediate and effective steps from authorities./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Stubble burning: Growing mechanisation, increase in paddy area added to problem","Chandigarh, Nov. 8 -- Sukhwant Singh, a farmer in Haryana's Kurukshetra, had most of his 12 acres of agricultural land under paddy. After harvesting his crop, he set the paddy stubble on fire, burning it to the ground within a few hours./Singh and most other paddy growers in Punjab and Haryana, who are facing financial constraints due to falling productivity and dwindling returns, do not care about the ban on stubble burning put in place by the state governments in 2003-04./District authorities issue notices and impose financial penalties to those who overlook the ban. In the current season, Haryana has issued notices to 1,472 offenders for a total penalty of Rs 15 lakh till Monday. Punjab issued notices to 736 farmers till October 27 but stopped since then./The ban, however, was never seriously implemented as farmers are a huge political constituency./The result: the stubble burning has increased in recent years. Officials with regional pollution control board say stubble burning in neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab is one of the major contributing factors to the severe smog in Delhi and the national capital region./Delhi is witnessing worst smog in 17 years, which has pushed pollution, is making children wheeze, giving the otherwise healthy a chronic cough, and risking 17 million people to asthma, heart disease, stroke, and even cancer./The city of 20 million people, which ranks among the world's top cities with foul air on a World Health Organization list, has been struggling to clean its air that contains a toxic cocktail of dust, smoke and gases from vehicle, factory exhausts and coal-fired power stations./Besides the cost factor, growing mechanisation of paddy harvest, non-availability of stubble management equipment and an increase in area under paddy cultivation have contributed to stubble burning. Between 2006 and 2016, paddy area in Punjab has increased by 20%, going up from 25 lakh hectares to 30 lakh hectares./""Due to mechanisation of paddy harvest, the crop residue that remains in the field is of larger quantity and when burnt causes larger smoke quantity,"" a Punjab State Farmers Commission consultant said./As per the commission, the cost of removing stubble comes to roughly Rs 1,000 per acre./Haryana Kisan Ayog secretary RS Dalal said the burning of crop residue is the least expensive option available to farmers./""The straw management equipment is costly and the process time consuming. Also, the cost of stubble management is not taken into account while determining the minimum support price (MSP). We want the farmers to spend money so that we get a clean environment,"" Dalal told Hindustan Times./He said the stubble problem was not as severe when paddy was harvested manually because the farmers use to cut it as close to the ground as possible./Another agriculture expert said that farmers burn their paddy stubble because they do have much time available between two crops./""Wheat sowing has to be completed by November-end. Delay in sowing means a decline in yield. This leaves them with very little time to clear the farm for sowing. Crop residue burning affects soil health, but they do ignore it,"" he said./Last week, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulled up the states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for not stopping the large-scale burning of crop stubble that has sent air pollution Delhi-NCR to a critical level./The NGT directed the three states to comply with its earlier order of taking coercive and punitive action against those who burn agricultural waste and directed them to file affidavits detailing steps taken for the implementation of its order./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

All you need to know about Delhi air pollution,"New Delhi, Nov. 8 -- Thick smog has enveloped New Delhi since the Diwali festival, as the Capital witnessed the worst spell of smog in a season on Sunday./The air quality has been ""severe"" as pollution levels touched a new high. Levels of particulate matter finer than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) crossed the 900 mark in some areas, recording almost 15 times the safety limit./Environmentalists said Delhi is facing an emergency situation and the AAP government has introduced a set of measures that include closing down schools for 3 days and shutting down the Badarpur power plant for 10 days./Here's all you need to know about Delhi air pollution:/What is smog?/A weather expert said that for a 'cloud' causing low visibility to qualify as smog, there should be enough pollution, smoke, and moisture in the air. The smoke and other particulate matters combine with fog when there is high humidity and low temperatures to form smog./What is causing this pollution?/The smog, since Diwali, has been relentless due to certain weather conditions such as low wind speed, lack of vertical wind and lower temperatures. Winds usually blow the pollutants and particulate matter away, helping to clear up some of the smog. But with no winds, the pollutants remain stagnant in the air. This was exacerbated by a unique wind phenomenon that blew most of the smoke emanating from various parts of northern India towards New Delhi./The spike in pollutants during the festival season has primarily been attributed to vehicular traffic, smoke from firecrackers, and the burning of post-harvest paddy stalks in neighbouring states./""This is visibly the worst pollution spell that we have witnessed in the city so far. We will have to wait for the weather conditions to play up. The temperature is dipping and the mixing height, which means the dispersion of pollution particles in the air, is low. This is making the pollutant particles float in the air,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./What is the impact of air pollution on health?/Many people said that the thick smog left bitter taste in the mouth and eyes watering. Hospitals have reported a rise in cases of respiratory distress, with elderly and children the worst hit./""There have been a large number of people in our pulmonary out-patient department with cough and breathlessness, without previous history of respiratory illness,"" said professor GC Khilnani of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./Particulate matter are tiny dust particles that can be absorbed in lungs and blood tissues, and trigger respiratory and cardiac problems./What can you do to stay safe?/As the government mulls over ways to curb pollution, Delhi residents are being forces to find ways to safeguard themselves./Wear masks. Masks -- available at prices ranging from Rs 90 to up to Rs 2,200 -- can be meant for one-time use and the high-priced ones with air filters claim to stop over 99 per cent of the pollutants from entering the user's nostrils./Install air purifiers. Air purifiers are expensive but an Assocham survey has said that there has been a jump of nearly 50% in the demand for air purifiers in Delhi-NCR in last four days./What are the measures proposed by the government?/The urgent measures announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday include shutting all schools - private and public - till Wednesday, a move that the Aam Aadmi Party government was forced to take after saying it was not necessary earlier in the week./Other steps include:/Another round of odd-even initiative/Shutting down Badarpur coal plant for 10 days/Five day ban on all construction and demolition in the city/Water sprinkling of roads/Five-day ban on diesel generators, except at places such as hospitals and cellphone towers/The Delhi government has also asked the Centre to consider cloud seeding, a process that induces artificial rain that can help settle pollutants and clear the smog. The efficacy of the process is, however, debatable./Are the measures enough?/A look at the pollution control measures taken by the Delhi government last year suggests that a number of steps, which otherwise should have continued at regular intervals, have only been reintroduced or re-packaged./Environmentalists too are unimpressed with the directives, saying they believed the steps are a repetition of last year's action plan./Bhargav Krishna from the Public Health Foundation of India asked why the government did not act earlier, when the situation could have been controlled./Moreover, none of the measures introduced by the government are considered viable long-term options./What can we learn from other cities around the world?/China's capital Beijing too reels under heavy winter smog as the country switches to coal-fuelled central heating and releases more pollutants in the air. But a newspaper said China has launched a crackdown on heavy vehicles that failed to meet emission standards./Beijing also plans to create ventilation corridors by connecting the city's parks, rivers and lakes, highways with green belts and low building blocks that will allow the air to flow and blow away smog./Delhi can also learn from cities such as London and Los Angeles that have battled deadly smogs in the past, but have taken measures to combat the situation./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air quality improves but is still 'severe',"NEW DELHI, Nov. 9 -- The air quality on Tuesday saw an improvement compared to the past few days as the PM level 10 was recorded at 474 micro gm3 while PM2.5 was 295 micro gm3, according to the 24-hour rolling average calculated by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)./The permissible level of PM 2.5 is 60 micro g/m3 while PM10 is 100 micro g/m3. Anything beyond that can cause harm to the respiratory system as the ultra fine particles can embed themselves deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream./On Monday, even though the apocalyptic weekend smog cleared up due to high wind speed, PM10 and PM2.5 were recorded at 808 micro g/m3 and 622 micro g/ m3 respectively./The air quality remains ""severe"" and according to SAFAR forecast it become very poor on Wednesday./Air pollution level is classified as severe if the AQI is between 401 and 500. China declares a ""red alert"" at this level./SAFAR has advised people to avoid all outdoor physical activity./People with heart or lung diseases, senior citizens, and children should remain indoors and keep activity levels low when air quality turns ""severe"", it said./People with existing heart or lung diseases such as asthma, congestive heart disease, or ischemic heart disease should avoid heavy exertion when the air quality is ""very poor""./The main factors that influence Delhi's air quality are wind speed and wind direction, and if the two remain favourable, chances of pollution peaking to extreme levels,as seen last week, are ""rare""./""Today winds are westerly and contribution of biomass burning has falles to less than 10%.

Delhi-like haze can shroud city too,"Kolkata, Nov. 9 -- The dense cover of grey haze shrouding the country's capital for almost a week could happen in Kolkata on any winter day, city's atmospheric scientists have warned. It would just need an environmental trigger - popularly known as ""temperature inversion""./Delhi and Kolkata have had always hit the headlines for their high pollution levels. While Kolkata had been earlier dubbed as the ""diesel capital"" of India, more recently a World Health Organisation report suggests that Kolkata is also the fourth most polluted megacity in the world as far as pollution triggered by coarse dust particles - a byproduct of construction activities./""But what aggravated the situation in Delhi was a meteorological phenomenon. We call this temperature inversion. This can happen in Kolkata too on any winter day,"" said Abhijit Chatterjee, a senior atmospheric scientist with the Bose Institute in Kolkata./Scientists explained that normally, air temperature drops at a rate of 6.4 degree Celsius every kilometre of ascent. When this normal cycle is present air constantly flows between the warm and cool areas. This disperses the pollution and we don't get to feel it./But there exists a layer in the atmosphere which scientists call 'temperature inversion layers' or 'just inversion layers'. Here things get reversed meaning air above is warmer than the air below it. It acts like a cap. Inversion layers can occur anywhere from close to ground level up to thousands of feet./""Problem occurs when this cap-like layer comes down closer to surface. The pollution gets trapped near the surface. That is exactly what happened in Delhi. It can happen in Kolkata too. Lack of highvelocity wind aggravates the situation as the pollution didn't get a chance to disperse,"" said Sutapa Chaudhuri, a professor of atmospheric science in Calcutta University./Senior meteorologists in Kolkata said that such phenomenon usually occur when a warm, less dense air mass moves over a dense, cold air mass./Fog is formed in a similar way./""This can happen when the air near the ground rapidly loses its heat on a clear night. In this situation, the ground becomes cooled quickly while the air above it retains the heat the ground was holding during the day. Situations aggravate if the air has high pollution levels. The pollution gets trapped choking the city,"" said GK Das, director of Indian Meteorological Department's regional office in Kolkata./During severe inversions that last over long periods smog can cover entire metropolitan areas and cause respiratory problems for the inhabitants of those areas./In December 1952, for example, such an inversion occurred in London. Because of the cold December weather at the time, Londoners began to burn more coal, which increased air pollution in the city. Since the inversion was present over the city at the same time, these pollutants became trapped and increased London's air pollution. The result was the Great Smog of 1952 that was blamed for thousands of deaths./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

GOVT'S FAILURE TO FIGHT POLLUTION 'GENOCIDE' EARNS HIGH COURT WRATH,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 11 -- An average of 10,500 people die every year because of respiratory diseases in the Capital, the Delhi high court said on Thursday and held the government responsible for the ""genocide"" from the city's air pollution./""Firecrackers during Diwali are a small part of the problem. Satellite images submitted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee clearly indicate that crop burning in Punjab is the main culprit for the spike in pollution,"" the court said./In September, the court warned Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and UP to prevent farmers from burning paddy stalks to prepare their farms for the wheat crop./Smoke from farm fires, construction dusts, exhaust fumes from vehicles and factories, and firecrackers combined to shroud New Delhi in its worst smog for 17 years last weekend./The city government was forced to take emergency steps such as closing schools and halting construction, while the judiciary too chipped in with stinging remarks against administrative inaction./The Supreme Court pulled up the Central Pollution Control Board on Thursday for failing to make a roadmap to reduce air pollution./""Do you want to wait till people start dying?

"Students write to PM Modi, ask for a 'Clean Air Day'","Gurgaon, Nov. 11 -- After smog engulfed Delhi-NCR post Diwali, over 1,400 students of a city private schoolhaswrittenindividualletters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to declare a 'National Clean Air Day' and alsototakeconcretemeasuresto curb pollution in the national capital and NCR./The children of Delhi Public School, Sushant Lok, wrote postcards putting forward several ideas to Modi for making the air clean. These suggestions included measures such as planting more trees, banning crackers on Diwali, curbing burning of crops by farmers, introducing the odd-even scheme in Gurgaon, promoting the use of bicycles on the lines of China, stricter pollution checks on industries and using clean fuels for vehicles./A Class 10 student wrote, ""I am baffled by how the people of Delhi-NCRarebeingmadetolive in a gas chamber. Urgent measures are needed to reduce pollution levels or else, the city will keep getting buried year after year under a thick blanket of smog. Please don't allow our future to go up in smoke. We need to observe a National Clean Air Day each year to create awareness about this burning issue."" Another student pointed to the problems they faced - from wearing masks to not playing outdoors - during the last few weeks./Ashreya Singh, another student, wrote, ""The level of air pollution in the city is increasing day by day. I suffer from asthma and have breathing problems. I get bored at home because my parents do not allow me to play outside due to pollution. I wear a mask, which is very cumbersome and annoying. I wish we all could breathe clean air. Modi sir, please take strict measures against air pollution so that children like me can lead normal lives. We appeal to you to declare a National Clean Air Day so that we can all breathe easy."" Sunita Nagpal, principal of DPS Sushant Lok, said, ""Last week, the whole of Gurgaon was covered in smog, leading to closure of schools. We don't want Delhi-NCR to become like Beijing where air quality is equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day. We at DPS Sushant Lok are doing our best to minimise exposure of students to air pollution./These letters to PM Modi not only show the angst of students at the toxic air quality but also highlight their hope and confidence in making a difference. I feel proud that we are raising a generation with a conscience and a thinking mind."" The principal added that, according to the figures of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), around 600,000 children under the age of five die due to air pollution each year.

Holy smoke: kitchens pollute homes,"New Delhi, Nov. 20 -- When we think of the term 'air pollution,' we tend to think of car exhausts or factory fumes expelling gray smoke. However the most harmful sources of pollution can reside inside our home. And one of the sources of indoor air pollution is your kitchen./A kitchen is the heart and the hearth of a home. But it can be worse than a factory when it comes to pollution, especially if there is a lack of ventilation. The combustion from gas stoves produces nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde and carbon monoxide. Electric stoves produce the same pollutants at lower levels. What's more, electric burners, in particular, produce high levels of ultrafine particles that are easily inhalable and over time deposit themselves into the lungs from where they are absorbed into the blood. In addition, foods that are cooked, produce gases and particles similar to those emitted by the burners. Indian households typically cook most of their three major meals at home and given the techniques of Indian cooking, a considerable amount of smoke is generated during the process. The cooking gas emits a host of gases including formaldehyde and all these pollutants pose the biggest risks to the elderly and people with respiratory or cardiovascular problems. A stuffy modern kitchen could expose you to higher levels of toxic pollutants than walking through a smog-filled city./Pollution outside is something that you can't control. But you can control the air purity inside your homes through Asian Paints' Royale Atmos. This paint doubles up as an air purifier as it absorbs a large range of chemicals and odours within your home. It's Activated Carbon Technology traps these chemicals and rids your air of these irritants. Your kitchen will feel fresh and our lungs will thank you for it./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"From Delhi to faraway Tawang, no respite from smoke and dust","NEW DELHI, Nov. 21 -- It was supposed to be my lucky escape from Delhi the morning after the Diwali smokefest. To reach the airport, I had to cut through a haze that lay over the city like a shroud of obeisance to the collective firepower of my fellow Delhi residents. The city would remain enveloped in smog for days, choking even the hardiest of respiratory systems./But my lungs were meant to be in a safer place. From Guwahati airport, the smooth drive along Deepor Beel, a wetland under the Ramsar Convention, was greeted with crisp morning air. Windows rolled down, I finally breathed easy. But it didn't last. On the National Highway 40 to Meghalaya, my car was soon tailing a nasty smokespewing diesel truck. Then, it became routine - serial ambushes featuring commercial and military vehicles belching fumes amid the incessantly swirling dust from broken roads all the way to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. Clearly, there was no escape from dirty air./As estimated by the Centre for Science and Environment in 2013, even with limited air quality monitoring in the northeastern states, 68% of all cities and towns checked for pollution here had particulate matter levels higher than the prescribed limits. Greeted by locals wearing breathing masks during most of my journey across three of the seven sisters, I realised the air didn't get any cleaner in three years./Hill towns, anyway, have special challenges. The CSE study blamed higher elevation and inversion condition (when a layer of cool air at the surface is overlain by a layer of warmer air trapping pollutants close to the ground) for exacerbating breathing conditions. Roads in a perennial state of re-construction and influx of ancient vehicles only make things worse./Quoting studies by the Desert Research Institute, Nevada, USA, and NASA, the CSE stated that in cities such as Guwahati, about 70% of vehicles didn't have emission clearance certificates and emitted excessive black carbon which had already increased daily temperature by 2 degrees Celsius./This was indeed a sad story in the land where people otherwise care for nature. Mawlynnong in Meghalaya has been judged the cleanest village of Asia by successive surveys since 2002 and was praised by the Prime Minister in his Maan Ki Baat. In 2008, Sikkim was declared ""Nirmal Rajya"", a state free from open defecation. Fishing is banned in many streams and rivers in Arunachal Pradesh. But foul air is something they don't have a grip on./Clearly, air pollution is a national crisis. Last year, the World Health Organization said that India had 13 of the world's 20 most polluted cities. The Central Pollution Control Board's data between 2002 and 2014 showed that all major cities in northern and central India --- Gwalior, Kanpur, Ludhiana, Gwalior and Surat --have recorded a sharper increase in pollution as compared to Delhi, HT reported on November 2. Engines that are more than ten years old contributed 60% of vehicular pollution mainly because of ill-maintenance and poor emission standards./While many towns and cities are still under the radar due to lack of monitoring, even the ones monitored don't have clear pollutionfighting plans. India's fight against air pollution has remained only Delhi-centric - whether it is judiciarybacked measures or belated action plans from the Centre and the state./Even suburban towns have got little attention. Ghaziabad and Faridabad rank among the most polluted Indian cities but don't monitor air-quality daily. Fumes from brick kilns, factories, thermal plants and construction dust foul the air unchecked. Polluting diesel trucks are fined only when they reach the Delhi border. As if air follows state boundary restrictions./Increasing motorisation, lack of public transportation, differing fuel standards, lack of regulations on phasing out old vehicles, poor enforcement of emission norms, polluting industries and power stations, blazing dumpsites, unabated construction activities, biomass and stubble burning - the factors contributing to air pollution don't differ much from cities to towns to even remote mountain hamlets./We need to chalk out a national policy, frame a timebound action plan, and employ a strict monitoring and enforcement system that holds good across the country. Otherwise, already gasping for breath in the big cities, we may soon have nowhere to turn to for clean air./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Low temp, slow wind may spike pollution","NEW DELHI, Nov. 22 -- After a week of respite, Delhi's pollution levels are set to spike again. Experts said with the temperature dipping to 10 degree C and low wind speed, the air quality will remain poor till Wednesday./The levels of particulate matter touched the 400 mark in several observatories in the early hours of Monday and hovered over 350, as per the Delhi Pollution Control Committee data./Particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) was recorded at 402 micrograms per cubic meters (ug/m3) in RK Puram, 485ug/m3 in Punjabi Bagh and 510ug/m3 in Anand Vihar./The permissible limit of PM 2.5 are 60ug/m3. These are fine particles that gets into the lower lung chamber, making its way into the heart and blood stream. Doctors say that these enter into tissues and clog the pores, causing heart attacks and cancer in the long term./The weather conditions on Monday also remained unfavourable. It was a cold morning in the national capital with the mercury dipping to 10.7 degree C. Early morning mist was also recorded./The Met department has forecast that the minimum temperature on Tuesday will touch/10 degree C and the maximum will be 30 degree C. Wind speed on Monday also averaged at around 10 kmph, which is not very low, but cannot be classified as strong either. With similar wind speeds and temperature predicted for Tuesday, one is left wondering if the air quality will plummet to crippling levels again./""We have witnessed in the first week of November what unfavourable weather conditions and slow winds can do to the pollution levels. The people of Delhi need to take their safety into their own hands till the government chalks out a comprehensive pollution programme,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)/Delhi had experienced the worst pollution bouts of the season around Diwali - between October 28 and November 7 - and the primary reasons for it were the increased cases of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, and cracker burning clubbed with low wind speeds./After November 7, the levels has seen a marginal improvement, but still remained in the 'very poor' category./Weather experts explained that lower temperatures, with high levels of humidity, can result in fog. Also, if there is no wind to blow away the dust, smoke and other pollutants in the air can mix with the fog and cause the deadly smog./However, they claim that it is still too early to hit the panic button. ""First of all, the level of air pollution in the city has not been alarming in the past couple of days, though it was not very good. Second, winds are expected to pick up again in a couple of days time. If the wind get stronger, air quality will definitely improve, as will visibility,"" said an expert./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Breathless in Delhi: Why we must clean up the air for our kids,"India, Nov. 26 -- Three toddlers moved the Supreme Court in September last year asking for a ban on firecrackers that made Delhi's air after Diwali the most toxic in close to two decades. On Friday, the Court recognised their right to clean air and banned the sale of crackers in the national capital region./While banning sale of firecrackers is not enough to stop people from using them, it's a start. In 2012, air pollution killed 7 million people globally -- one in every 8 deaths. Of these, 600,000 of those who died were children under 5./Polluted air starts hurting, sometimes killing, babies before they are born. It causes miscarriages, premature delivery and low birth weight. These raise the child's chances of dying prematurely from airway and lung infections, such as pneumonia. Half of all pneumonia deaths in children under five are attributed to air pollution./'Air Pollution' is listed as a carcinogen that's as hazardous as tobacco, alcohol, ultraviolet radiation, arsenic and radioactive substances, says the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). It causes premature deaths, lowering life expectancy by 23 months in India. And with pollution levels shooting through the roof, children born today will have their lives cut short by many more years./Health hazard/Each component of polluted air -- particulate matter, diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals and soot - is individually on the IARC's hazardous list, which make falling air quality a public health emergency that needs immediate action./Air pollution hurts the unborn baby as much as the mother's smoking or breathing secondhand smoke. Chronic exposure to tiny particulate matter (PM1 and PM2.5, or particles with a diameter less than 1 and 2.5 microns, far smaller than the 70 micron-diameter of a human hair) from smoke, fumes and construction dust raises rates of early foetal loss, pre-term delivery and lower birthweight./The children who survive, bear the scars for life. The lung capacity of children living in polluted environments can be reduced by 20%, which is similar to the effect of growing up exposed to secondhand smoke at home. Children breathe twice as quickly as adults, and inhale more air relative to their weight than adults, which exposes them to a higher concentration of pollutants. Tiny toxic particles can easily cross the blood-brain barrier in children to damage tissue and lower learning and IQ./Their airways are also smaller and sensitive to inflammation, aggravating wheezing, asthma and respiratory distress. Children's airways are also more permeable and allow pollutants to slip easily into their lungs and bloodstream, causing and exacerbating life-threatening diseases. Studies show that people who grow up in polluted neighbourhoods have more respiratory problems in later life./Two billion children live in areas where pollution levels exceed the minimum air quality standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO), estimated Unicef's Clean the Air for Children report using satellite imagery. Of them, 300 million children live in areas with extremely toxic air, including Delhi and several cities in north and central India./Just do it/Air pollution kills 1.59 million people in India each year, with 13 of the world's most polluted cities being in India. If the situation is left unattended, things will get worse. Urban outdoor air pollution went up by 8% between 2008 and 2013, estimated the WHO. And children are among the worst hit./Under-5 deaths from polluted outdoor air could be 50% higher than current estimates by 2050, estimates the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A study in the journal Nature is more pessimistic and predicts deaths doubling by 2050. The OECD study estimates the total annual costs of air pollution currently at 0.3% of global GDP, which is expected to go up to approximately 1% of GDP by 2060./Meeting global air quality standards for PM2.5 could prevent 2.1 million deaths across all ages and improve the health of many millions. Instead of knee-jerk reactions and ""red alert"" warnings that involve shutting down schools, construction and non-essential businesses and urging people to stay indoors, the government and pollution-control agencies need to focus on an action plan to stem the toxic tide./An efficient public transport system to reduce people's dependence on fossil-fuel burning cars is a start, as is moving industrial sites, smoldering dumps and electrical generators that burn biomass fuels away from residential neighbourhoods, and adopting sustainable energy solutions to reduce reliance on polluting sources of energy./Children should not have to seek legal intervention to protect their right to life. We must make air cleaner for them./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

6 ways to neutralise the effects of air pollution,"India, Nov. 26 -- Our lungs have built-in pollution filters called cilia, which are small hair-like structures that push toxins away so that the lungs can take in oxygen./However, cilia can deal only with dust and pollen, whereas the air in cities is also heavy with vehicle fumes, smoke and chemical toxins. This mix overwhelms the cilia, and as a result, our bodies are at risk of harbouring carcinogens that create cell malfunctions. Fortunately, some easily available and used foods, herbs and oils can help keep your lungs clean. Here's the list./1. Jaggery: Studies have proved that consuming a small piece of jaggery every day can fight carbon pollution. In fact, this is one of the most popular ways to protect factory workers who work in polluted environments./2. Water: This sounds very basic, but the fact is that you need to drink a lot of water every day. This will dilute the pollutants in your body and excrete them via the kidneys./3. Grapes and Pomegranates: The antioxidants in both these fruits help neutralise the damage caused to cells by free radicals./4. Vegetables and fruit mixed juices: A juice made out of carrots, beetroots, aloe vera, mint, tulsi and ginger makes for the perfect mocktail against urban pollution. It's full of vitamins A, B complex and C, which protect against the damage that pollution causes./5. Trikatu, Pippali, Mulethi and Tulsi: These herbs help clean the lungs. Trikatu, in particular, removes toxins. The best way to consume Trikatu is to take 2.5 gms of the herb with 1 teaspoon of honey, followed by a cup of hot water. Do this twice a day./6. Nasyam oil therapy: Use ayurvedic oils like Anu Tailam as nose drops to lubricate the nose and decrease allergic tendencies./Also avoid tobacco, alcohol and fried foods. Do not use chemical room sprays and chemical home cleaners, and cut down the amount of cheese children eat./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

SUPREME COURT BANS SALE OF FIRECRACKERS IN DELHI AND NCR,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 26 -- The Supreme Court on Friday responded to a plea by three toddlers and banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi, stepping in once again to clean up the national capital's notoriously foul air./A bench headed by chief justice TS Thakur asked the government not to renew firecracker licences./""Keeping the grave air quality in mind, we can intervene to suspend the licence,"" the top court said. The petition was filed by three toddlers - Arjun Gopal, Aarav Bhandari and Zoya Rao Bhasin - through their fathers./""Delhi has retained (the) unique distinction of being (the) most polluted city in the world. Levels of particulate matter are highest and across the country, over 700,000 deaths occur annually due to air pollution-related diseases,"" said the petitioners, aged between six and 14 months./""Studies show citizens of India have 30% lower lung capacity than Europeans and that the children are worst affected, as their lungs are not fully developed, making their systems more vulnerable,"" added the petition filed last year. A bench headed by then chief justice HL Dattu declined to issue orders, but had reiterated an earlier SC direction issuing guidelines for use of crackers./The top court had intervened several times to curb pollution in the capital which was blanketed by a thick layer of toxic smog for nearly a week after Diwali, raising serious health concerns for millions of people, especially children and the aged./In its order on Friday, the top court also asked the Central Pollution of Control Board (CPCB) to study the harmful effects of materials used in the manufacture of crackers. The report will be submitted within three months./""We want to know what kind of diseases can be caused due to these materials and whether it leads to cancerous diseases. One if an obvious effect (on environment) that is visible, but if the elements used are carcinogenic then it affects the users too,"" the bench told solicitor general Ranjit Kumar who appeared for CPCB./Though the direction does not include ban on bursting crackers, advocate Amit Bhandari -- father of Aarav -- said the stringent order will achieve the outcome. ""Nonavailability would ensure there is no bursting,"" he said./Advocate Gopal Shankaranarayananan, father of Arjun, said the rules also ban transportation of fire crackers./""If an attempt is made to get the crackers from outside NCR, it would be illegal,"" he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

It's time we cracked down on crackers. Even the SC agrees,"India, Nov. 27 -- On Friday the apex court banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and the national capital region. But the damage to the environment had already been done. The statistics in Gurgaon bear testimony to this.

Wellbeing @ Work: How is your office pitching in?,"India, Nov. 27 -- Stressed? Highly likely, if you spend your days juggling long hours at work, unending commutes, ATM queues, air pollution, family dynamics, rising prices, less time for friends and loved ones, irritable colleagues and surly strangers./""Physical and mental stress touch every aspect of life,"" says Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Allied Multispecialities. ""And such stress has links to hypertension, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, low libido, loss of bone and muscle mass, dementia, cancers, accelerated ageing and early death.""/One in two employees in the IT sector in India suffers from chronic stress-related disorders such as hypertension, obesity, frequent infection, insomnia and diabetes, with absenteeism from chronic stress increasing by 300% over the past two decades, Dr Misra pointed out, speaking at the 5th Healthy Lifestyle Symposium, titled Wellbeing at the Workplace and held in New Delhi this past week./The first step to lowering workplace stress is acknowledging it. ""In a typical office, one in five people has a mental disorder during their most productive years [20s to 40s], and one in 20 experiences burnout,"" says Dr Samir Parikh, director of the department of mental health and behavioural sciences at Fortis Healthcare./GOING DIGITAL/Corporate houses are increasingly using web-based programmes to improve employee wellbeing by taking wellness beyond bands and apps that simply track activity, calories and sleep patterns./Investment in corporate wellness programmes works for both employees and employers. ""A meta-analysis of studies showed that medical costs fall by $3.27 and absenteeism costs by $2.73 for every dollar spent by employers on wellness programmes,"" says Dr Misra./Increasingly, HR companies are using digital initiatives to improve the health and quality of life of their workforce. ""Mobile apps can help measure, monitor and create a roadmap for improved mental and physical wellness and provide scientific guidance on prevention and nutrition,"" says Janez Uplaznik, director of 24alife, a website developed to promote employee wellness, in partnership with Mayo Clinic, the world's largest non-profit medical institution./""Workplace-based counselling works because most people spend more waking hours at work than at home and it presents a captive audience for interventions,"" Uplaznik says./Wellbeing needs to be audited as much as everything else, Dr Parikh adds. ""The workplace should not be an unemotional robotic place; social interaction while working is equally important. Identifying early signs of stress works only if there are solutions - we must bring counselling to the workplace.""/HAVING THE TALK/Digital workplace counselling helps employees lose weight, boosts fitness levels, lowers cardio-metabolic risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol, keeps motivation high and optimises output, found a study by Centre for Public Health, India./For the study, 180 people at two sites were given active intervention for six months and maintenance support for three months, while another 180 were control subjects with delayed intervention. All 360 people were followed for 18 months./Once people registered, they were encouraged to post queries, take up challenges, give feedback and get immediate expert advice on nutrition, fitness and wellbeing. ""Biochemical tests and physical exams done before and after showed improvement in all health parameters, including fall in weight, blood pressure, bad cholesterol, triglycerides and improved blood glucose control,"" says Dr Misra, who was the principal investigator of the study./""Health promotion and social security are key to employee loyalty, as are opportunities for skilling, training, continuous learning and opportunities for feedback,"" adds Sanjay Singh, principal resident representative at Tata Sons, who cited the example of the 26/11 attack in Mumbai./All 600 employees inside the Taj Mahal Palace hotel when the attack began chose to stay back to help guests after they were told staying back was voluntary.

"'Our breathing, respiration directly connected to environment'","Mumbai, Nov. 28 -- Hindustan Times spoke to Dr Dipankar Saha, a scientist and additional director, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Since 2009, Dr Saha has been serving as the head of the air laboratory division, under the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change. Dr Saha has been associated with CPCB since 1998, serving in various positions and postings./Over the past year, doctors have pointed out a rise in air pollution-related illnesses in Mumbai. What are the major contributors ?/We have to realise our respiratory system is directly connected with the environment. There is a link between air pollution and respiratory diseases. The contributors that establish this link are number of vehicles, road dust, sea salt, industries, coal and firewood./Real-time air quality data has indicated a decreasing trend in Mumbai's air quality, especially during winter./In Mumbai, the winter months are crucial for wind direction and speed, thereby fluctuating ventilation of pollutants. Both sea and land breeze during this period are less, resulting in less dilution of impurities in the air. Another problem is low temperatures as pollutants get trapped near the surface. Firecrackers during Diwali, open burning at slums add to the problem./Is Mumbai following in Delhi's footsteps when it comes to air pollution?/The problem with Delhi is its complicated geographical location, where we observe almost negligible wind speed during winters. That is not the case here. But, there is an immediate need to quantify vehicular growth and understand carrying capacity of roads. As far as odd-even is concerned, it definitely helps decongest the city. There could be other ideas, like flexible office, school hours./What are the most dangerous pollutants?/The main issue is unburned hydrocarbons, or fuels emitted after petroleum is burned in an engine. Mumbai roads rigged with potholes are carrying many vehicles and make this the primary source for their emission. When it comes to particulate matter, it is not a Mumbai-centric problem, but an issue across India, which is a dustladen country. The diesel operated vehicles in all mega cities need to be phased out./What should the city do, at the macro and micro level, to control pollution levels?/None of our mega cities are following the land-use plan. Besides government machinery, every citizen should participate to improve air quality. Mumbai has proved it by controlling noise pollution already. We should use public transport, pedestrian walkways, cycles and carpools. Mumbai is among the 16 most polluted cities in India./If we continue this way, what will 2020 look like?/Citizens need to be optimistic and ensure a city-wide emergency does not arise.

Air we breathe: Act now or forever hold your breath,"Mumbai, Nov. 28 -- For most of November, days after Diwali celebrations ended, many in Mumbai have been trying to shield themselves and their children from the pollution around them. But it isn't easy; that silent killer is all around us./Studies have, over and over again, showed there is nothing beautiful about foggy, hazy mornings and evenings, not anymore. They hold those dangerous, fine pollution particles called PM 2.5 that easily invade our bodies - and, experts believe, being exposed to high concentrations of such particles has the same effect as smoking about two packs of cigarettes a day./So what is plaguing the air we breathe?/Our cars, bikes, autorickshaws and buses, according to Urban Emissions (India), an independent research group that studies air pollution. The group looked at sources of pollutants that affect the city's air quality and found two-, three-, four-wheelers, including public buses and taxis, accounted for 23% of PM 2.5 in the city, and 21% in the suburbs./""Technically, all sources leading to high particulate matter in Mumbai need to be addressed. But with vehicular emissions, three aspects need to be checked - the number of vehicles, usage and emission factor as against standards,"" said Sarath Guttikunda, Urban Emissions (India) director. ""We need to tackle all of them and find ways to reduce vehicles on the road and promote public transport.""/In just a year, there was a 9% rise in the number of vehicles plying on Mumbai's streets - from 25,46,749 vehicles in 2015 to 27,86,512 in 2016. The number of two-wheelers (16,00,998 in 2016) saw the maximum rise, by 9.5%; four-wheelers (8,84,882) rose by 7.3% since 2015, according to the latest environment report by the municipal corporation./Citizens should be encouraged to buy only one car or bike per family, said Guttikunda. ""There needs to be a shift, towards using pedestrian walkways, cycling or carpooling whenever possible,"" he said, adding that the state needs to push for implementation of better fuel standards (Bharat stage VI) by 2020. ""If this can come sooner than 2020, it would benefit all mega cities.""/The lack of discipline, according to Mumbai traffic police officials, is adding to the pollution problem. ""Every day, 500 new vehicles are registered in Mumbai. There is an immediate need for pollution (PUC) checks, and then one again every six months. Online facilities have been provided,"" said Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner (traffic). Bharambe pointed out the lives of more than 1,500 traffic policemen, who work in polluted road junctions, are at risk./The other polluters/While Mumbai has seen deindustrialisation -factories have shifted out of the city - emissions from industrial activity were the second largest source of pollutants at 20% for the city and 19% for the suburbs. Urban Emissions identified two different types of industries - heavy and light - in Mumbai and those in neighbouring districts in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR)./""Heavy industries include fertilisers, iron and steel, aluminum; the light ones are pharmaceuticals, metal, paper pulp, and ink,"" said Guttikunda./Other major contributors the study identified were domestic cooking, space heating, water heating and lighting that accounted for almost 16% emissions, both in the city and the suburbs. ""Roadside cooking using kerosene, firewood, cow-dung and even plastic at times contributes a major portion of PM2.5 in Mumbai's air,"" said D Saha, additional director and scientist, Central Pollution Control Board. Diesel generator (DG) sets and power plants are another source, accounting for 13% and 15% for the city and suburbs respectively./""There are hardly any power plants inside the city, but DG sets installed at corporate complexes produce a lot of particulate pollution, and this coupled with carbon emissions do not disperse easily,"" said Guttikunda./As a port city, the large number of freight vehicles entering and exiting Mumbai daily is also adding to the pollution. While dust pollution released from these heavy vehicles accounted for almost 10%, open biomass burning, such as the two major fires at the Deonar dumping ground earlier this year, contributed 3-4% of emissions into the air the city breathes every day./The price of pollution/If there aren't enough reasons to worry about air pollution already, consider the health consequences. Over the past year alone, doctors have reported an increasing number of air pollution-related illnesses in Mumbai. Treating these diseases costs a family of four in Mumbai about Rs1.68 lakh - or Rs42,000 per person - every year, a study on the economic cost of unhealthy air by the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay (IITB) and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) found./Why is Mumbai choking?/Experts attribute it to urbanisation and increasing population.

'Respiratory system is directly connected to environment',"Mumbai, Nov. 28 -- Hindustan Times spoke to Dr. Dipankar Saha, scientist and additional director, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./Since 2009, Dr. Dipankar Saha has been serving as the head of air laboratory division, under the aegis of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change. He is responsible for managing monitoring locations, installation and training on technical instruments and equipment, in-house calibration on monitoring equipment, data management and analysis. Dr Saha has been associated with the CPCB since 1998, serving in various positions and postings. He prepared the emergency air pollution action plans for Kanpur and Agra, and was instrumental in setting up the CPCB laboratory in Kanpur and the establishment of ambient air quality monitoring stations at Agra./Over the last one year, doctors have pointed out that the number of air pollution-related illnesses has increased in Mumbai. What according to you are the major contributors to this problem?/We have to realise that our respiratory system is directly connected with the environment. There is a link between air pollution and respiratory diseases. The contributors that establish this link includes the increasing number of vehicles, road dust, sea salt, industries, coal and firewood used in slums. To curb pollution, there needs to be a latest city-wide source apportionment study./Real-time air quality data has indicated a decreasing trend in Mumbai's air quality, especially during winters, why do you think it is getting worse?/Specially speaking for Mumbai, winter months are crucial for wind direction and speed, thereby fluctuating ventilation of pollutants. Both the sea and land breeze, during this period is less and this results in less dilution of impurities in the air. Another problem is low temperatures; the pollutants will get trapped near the surface. Additional sources such as firecrackers during Diwali, open burning at slums during the night and early morning add to the pollution problem./Do you think Mumbai is following the footsteps of Delhi when it comes to air pollution? Do you think an odd-even formula as implemented in Delhi would help Mumbai?/The problem with Delhi is its complicated geographical location, where we observe almost negligible wind speed during winters. However, it is not the same for Mumbai but there is an immediate need to quantify vehicular growth and understand the carrying capacity of the roads. As far as odd-even is concerned, it definitely helps in decongestion of the city. Rather than replicating the model, there could be other ideas such as based on the heavy load of vehicles, office and school hours should be made flexible. To reduce emissions, the idea should be to evenly distribute or compartmentalise./Which are the pollutants of prime concern when it comes to the pollution in Mumbai?/The main issue is unburned hydrocarbons (fuels emitted after petroleum is burned in an engine). The Mumbai roads rigged with potholes are carrying a number of vehicles and make this the primary source for their emission. When it comes to particulate matter, it is not a Mumbai-centric problem but an issue across India because we are a dust-laden country./The diesel operated vehicles in all mega cities including Mumbai need to be phased out because of the pressurised combustion, there is a high chance of having nitrogen dioxide. Similarly nitrogen oxides are major byproduct from power plants./What should the city do, at the macro and micro-level, to control high pollution levels?/None of our mega cities are following the land-use plan. Besides government machinery, each and every citizen needs to participate and contribute in the program to improve the air quality. Mumbai has proved it by controlling noise pollution already. Wherever possible, the use of public transport, pedestrian walkways, cycles and carpools should be done./Mumbai has been adjudged as one of the 16 most polluted cities in India. The state pollution board has already developed an action plan for both short-term and long-term measures. At every step it needs to be reviewed and rejigged based on modern day changes. Burning of leaves, plastic and other such emissions need to be banned and new waste management rules thoroughly implemented./If the current trend of bad air quality continues, what will be the situation by 2020?/Citizens need to be optimistic and not let such a city-wide emergency situation arise. India has been investing in improving fuel quality, efficiency and complying with Bharat Stage VI norms to improve auto-emissions. There are stricter standards for thermal power plants. Along with the natural advantages such as the sea and mangrove buffer zone, Mumbai's pollution problem can be curbed./The air we breathe: Mumbai's toxic road junctions can stop traffic, your heart/Air we breathe: Act now or forever hold your breath/Traffic junctions at Andheri, Wadala, BKC saw an 80% rise in pollution over 3 years/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Airocalypse: Death by micrograms,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 29 -- The national capital this year was engulfed by a thick layer of smog after Diwali that did not dissipate for days. As each breath became difficult, Delhiites, especially the elderly and children, were exposed to a range of ailments. The government and authorities seemed powerless and the citizens were left to defend their health, lifestyle and livelihood. Though the smog has dispersed over the last few days due to high velocity winds, the critical question remains: Is Delhi's 'airocalypse' really over and how is it affecting us?/IMPACT OF THE 'AIROCALYPSE'/In the first week of November this year, Delhi's 24-hour average air pollution - 900 micrograms per cubic meter of PM 2.5 - was 40 times higher than the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines (25 micro g/m3) and around 15 times higher than the Indian standards (60 micro g/m3)./All segments of the city's population - children, senior citizens, construction labourers, street workers, people who work from home as well as sportspersons - were affected by smog. If confinement was a problem for children, senior citizens were particularly vulnerable to breathing ailments; if exposure was extremely high for construction workers, even those working from home were forced to take precautions; where street workers like auto drivers and vendors had no choice but to go out for daily bread and butter, sportspersons had to abandon their training schedules./""When pollution levels go up, people living with chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis, experience an aggravation of symptoms. Pollution also results in hypertension, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke,"" said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant physician at Moolchand hospital./A World Health Organisation (WHO) report showed that one in every four children in the capital suffers from serious lung disorders. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), PM2.5 levels over 250ug/m3 can adversely affect even those who are healthy. Health experts said that the fine PM2.5 which can embed itself in the respiratory and cardiac system has been linked to up to 16,200 premature deaths a year in Delhi. It is also responsible for a staggering 6 million asthma attacks annually. Apart from particulate matter, Delhi's air is a concoction of toxic gases such as sulphur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides, which cause a range of short and long term health effects, including reduced lung capacity and shortness of breath. Prolonged exposure also affects the functions of heart and causes cancer./WORSE THAN THE WORSE/The pollution levels in the city this year broke records. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the smog on November 6 was worse than the great London smog of 1952 which had caused 4,000 premature deaths./An IIT Kanpur study showed that stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, use of diesel cars, construction and road dust and coal-based power plants were the major cause of poor air quality in Delhi. Usually, winter in Delhi is the time when pollution levels peak. Helped by poor weather conditions and low winds, pollution particles settle on the surface./In the face of such acute pollution levels and disruption of normal life, the government could only muster a 'lukewarm' response. On November 3, an emergency meeting was called by the Union environment secretary, with the environment secretaries of five statesPunjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan. It ended with the decision to shut down brick kilns, regulate use of diesel gensets and to conduct drives against polluting vehicles./After a few days, the Delhi government too, came up with measures like mist fountains, road vacuuming, and water sprinkling on road sides. However, these emergency measures cannot solve the problem of deteriorating air quality in the long run. Moreover, these measures were forgotten as soon as the air quality improved marginally after a week because of the westerly winds blowing into Delhi./The Delhi government asked people to stay away from work but offered no compensation to those who could not, or whose livelihood suffered./THE SOLUTIONS/Emergency measures may have helped mitigate smog but what Delhi needs is a regional plan to tackle pollution. To begin with, we can take lessons from Beijing, which has been facing a similar problem. Though Beijing was the world's most polluted city for almost a decade, it has now taken some lasting and difficult measures to ensure that the worse is over./According to NASA's satellite data, the PM 2.5 levels in India got worse by 13% between 2010 and 2015, while China's steadily improved. Last year was the worst for India in terms of particulate pollution and the best in China. PM 2.5 levels in China fell by 17% between 2010 and 2015 with quite a dramatic improvement towards 2015 (Beijing saw a 16% annual fall in PM 2.5 levels)./The data by Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) also showed that more people died in India because of exposure to outdoor air pollution than in China last year. In India, 3,283 deaths were reported in 2015, while in China there were 3,233 premature deaths. ""It clearly indicates that China's measures to tackle pollution have contributed to the year-on-year air quality improvement, while in contrast, India's pollution levels have increased over the past decade,"" said Sunil Dahiya, India campaigner for NGO Greenpeace, which analysed the data./China has set up a broad, regionally coordinated system of air pollution monitoring. It has installed high-tech pollution abatement equipment on a majority of its power plants and devised means to restrict car ownership in major cities./""Making noise merely when the pollution levels rise, will not help, we need a comprehensive plan for the next 365 days,"" Dahiya said./In October 1948, a small industrial town of Donora, in Pennsylvania (USA) experienced its worst smog spells. After two days, 20 people died and over 7,000 people were hospitalised, according to government data. The Donora disaster, however, paved way for the Clean Air Act which was finally passed in 1963. The act was amended in 1970./This is exactly what Delhi needs - a strong pollution control plan, which will pave a road map for the years to come./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Let's fight pollution: Smog over, but the battle against Delhi's toxic air isn't","India, Nov. 29 -- The toxic grey smog, which had enveloped Delhi in early November, might have lifted. The air quality might have improved from its record breaking levels. But the fight against pollution is far from over. Experts say that unless a comprehensive pollution control plan is not implemented, Delhi will be plagued by harmful pollutants that cause debilitating health problems every winter./The levels of deadly PM2.5 particulate matter crossed the highest-recordable 999-mark this year, more than 16 times the acceptable limit of 60. On November 6, the smog in Delhi was worse than the Great London Smog of 1952, which had jolted the UK into passing the Clean Air Act of 1956. But the state and central governments have still not woken up to the dangers posed by pollution./Though a slew of emergency measures were announced, the moment a westerly wind blew into Delhi, making conditions relatively better, the authorities moved on to other issues and anti-pollution promises were left unfulfilled. This cycle of pushing pollution to the backburner until the next crisis comes along has gone on for too long. Even this year, experts warn that the worst is yet to come./Starting today, Hindustan Times launches a seven-part series that looks at why air pollution cannot be fought in a piecemeal or an ""emergency"" manner. We examine how bad air affects every kind of person living in the city - children and seniors, who are the most vulnerable, are not the only ones affected./The air we breathe is slowly killing us, even after the smog has lifted. We ask all citizens to join this fight and compel the authorities to change their attitude./The national capital this year was engulfed by a thick layer of smog after Diwali that did not dissipate for days.

Bharat Stage emission standards are norms established by the Centre to regulate output of air pollutants from engines. For the past three years, India has been following European emission norms. BS-IV norms are currently applicable in 33 cities in which the required grade of fuel is available. ""In a city like Mumbai, most of the pollution comes from traffic.

What can be done to reduce this problem?/Three main strategies. First, limiting age of vehicles licenced to use the roads. Compared to older vehicles, more recently manufactured ones are generally made in accordance to a more stringent design standard. Second, improving quality of fuel with stringent fuel quality standards. These standards can target pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons. Third, introducing alternative fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas or natural gas./Give us an example/A good example is Seoul, South Korea, which adopted a range of strategies to improve air quality after the special act on the 'Improvement of Air Quality in Seoul Metropolitan Area' enforced in 2005.

No child's play: Breathing in Delhi taking a toll on our kids' future,"India, Nov. 30 -- Inactivity in the face of crippling air quality is not just choking our lungs but also compromising our future. Delhi's children are the worst affected, confined to their homes, forced to wear masks when going out, their young lungs subject to a dangerous cocktail of toxic gases and deadly particulate matter./Pollution directly affects children's cardiovascular system and can attack the nervous system at an early age, experts say./Two studies released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2012 said one quarter of Delhi's children suffer from upper respiratory diseases and this number was rising alarmingly./This is primarily because children have underdeveloped immune systems that are not equipped to fight heightened pollution levels, particularly in the winter months when PM2.5 levels max out./Experts say that pollutants can even impede lung growth in children, which can lead to difficulties in breathing throughout their lives./It is not just the lungs that are harmed permanently at a young age. Children in Delhi complain of skin irritations and burning eyes that could leave a lasting impact on both organs./In spite of this direct risk to more than 45 lakh children under the age of 15 in the city, both the central and state governments treat pollution only with emergency measures, making no effort to implement permanent solutions./It is high time this stops. The stakes are simply too high./I feel suffocated. I can't go out in the open anymore. Why do I have to be fully covered before I step out?/These are some of the things that kids in and around Delhi have been complaining of since the 'airocalypse', which saw the national capital and its satellite towns wrapped in a haze of pollution for days. Restricted indoors and faced with breathing difficulties, the city's children were among those affected the most./In the recent months, Delhi's air quality has been crippling at best and toxic at worst. With an increasing number of people across the country feeling the brunt of pollution, India now seems to be headed for the dubious title of 'World's Pollution Capital'. In a city like Delhi, which has 45,65,319 children under the age of 15, this translates into a threat to the future./With the increase in breathing difficulties and allergies, parents are now scrambling for solutions - and there aren't many. Air purifiers and masks are among the few available options but these are neither economical nor effective in the long run. On one hand the city's upper class is digging deeper into its pockets to ensure safe air for their children and on the other there are those who have no option but to watch their children inhale toxins each day. Many say that Delhi is a city of opportunities, they have now started wondering 'at what cost?'/The cost of pollution/""My daughter has a persistent cough. Of course it is related to the bad air quality. It is choking my kids,"" says Chitra Biswas, a resident of Krishna Nagar. Her daughter Archisha, who studies in Class 11, says she finds it difficult to breathe each time she steps out of her house. ""When I go for tuitions, I can see smoke and haze. It burns my eyes and makes it difficult to breathe. I may have to get a mask soon. My mom does not let me go out any more,"" says Archisha./She is not the only one who has been trapped indoors because of the bad air. Vanita Verma, a resident of Gurgaon, whose two daughters are studying at the American Embassy School, says she has no choice but to take extreme steps. ""My kids wear masks when they go to school and their school has air purifiers. Once they get back home, they are not allowed to leave the house where I have installed air purifiers. I have no other way to ensure that they are breathing clean air,"" she says./Doctors say the immune system of very young children is not fully developed, making them more susceptible to pollution. ""The breathing rate of children is higher than adults. The amount of air they take in, corresponding to their lung size, is more compared to adults. With the more air they take in, they also take more pollutants,"" said Dr Anant Mohan, pulminologist at AIIMS./Prarthana Borah, director of the Indian division of Clean Air Asia, an international organisation that specialises in air quality and air pollution, says there is little that parents can do to reduce the risk of exposure. A mother herself, Borah feels anxious. ""What is the alternative here? I let my child out in the toxic air, which can potentially kill her? Yes, I could get her a mask. But this is not very effective either. You have to breathe 'harder' when using a mask, which can stress your lungs. Masks are not advised for long term use.""/Dr Mohan agrees that masks, especially the popular N95, may not be a long term solution. ""N95 masks fit tight on your face. The mask's filters make normal breathing difficult ,"" he says./Dr Mohan says it is a tricky situation for parents. ""If the air quality is really bad, like it was post Diwali in Delhi, they have restrict the movement of their children make them wear N95 masks and install air purifiers at home.""/Fettered children/Prarthana's daughter Tanya, like most other children her age, is not happy about the new lock in hours at home. She says she used to enjoy walking to tuitions but is not allowed anymore. ""I took pride in doing my little bit for the environment that way. But now, my mom is worried about the air and does not allow me to walk to tuitions. My brother is upset too. He has been asked not to go for his cricket training sessions,"" Tanya said./Besides lung damage and related breathing problems, the city's toxic air also causes skin allergies, ear infections, weak immunity and cognitive impairment. ""I have a sensitive skin. I get acne regularly. However, the breakouts are more severe when the air quality is bad. Dust and other pollutants irritate my skin,"" said Tanya. Archisha also has similar skin problems. ""I have been wearing full sleeves clothes now. I am worried that my skin will be affected because of the pollution,"" Archisha said./But several families cannot provide the protection that parents of Tanya and Archisha can afford.
