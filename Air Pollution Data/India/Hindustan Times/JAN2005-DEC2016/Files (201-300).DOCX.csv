Air pollution doesn't increase risk of preterm delivery,"Washington, July 3 -- Exposure to carbon monoxide and fine particles in the air during pregnancy does not increase the risk of preterm delivery or preeclampsia, according to a new study./The research was conducted in the region around Seattle, Wash., using data from 3,675 women who were enrolled in the Omega Study, an investigation of the effects of diet and environment on women's health and nutrition before and during pregnancy./""There is strong evidence that air pollutants may increase risk of cardiovascular disease. This led me to examine air pollutants in relation to preeclampsia, which is similar to cardiovascular disease and a risk factor for the condition,"" said Carole Rudra, assistant professor of social and preventive medicine at the University at Buffalo, and first author on the study./""Pollutants may interfere with delivery of oxygen to the placenta and increase maternal oxidative stress and inflammation. These pathways could lead to both preeclampsia and preterm delivery,"" Rudra added./Rudra noted that carbon monoxide levels were fairly high in the Seattle area in comparison with other U.S. cities when she began this research, but have declined significantly in recent years./The researchers collected data from regional air-pollutant-monitoring reports on concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and minute airborne particles (such as dust, fumes, mist, smog and smoke) during specific exposure windows at residences of study participants./The exposure windows were the three months before pregnancy, the total of the first four months of pregnancy, during each trimester and the last month of pregnancy./Analysis of the data showed that the amount of air pollutant exposure at any of the collection times had no effect on either of the pregnancy problems./""In this geographic setting and population, these two air pollutant exposures do not appear to increase risks of preeclampsia and preterm delivery,"" said Rudra./The results were presented June 23 at the Society for Pediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology annual meeting held in Seattle.

Air pollution linked with increased risk of suicide,"London, July 16 -- A new study in South Korea suggests that air pollution doesn't just make it hard to breathe - it may also push people to take their own lives./Chang Soo Kim of Yonsei University in Seoul and his colleagues found that suicides were more common in the two days following a spike in pollution./According to The New Scientist, the results revealed that people were 9 per cent more likely to kill themselves following a spike in pollution rising across the middle 50 per cent of recorded values./For people with cardiovascular disease, the increase was almost 19 per cent./A decade later, the researchers show that suicides were more than twice as common among those with asthma - and the more severe their symptoms, the higher the risk./David Callahan at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, says that people with depression are known to be worse at managing chronic diseases by taking prescribed drugs and following other medical advice - potentially causing a spiral of physical and mental deterioration./Kim suggested that PM10s may also cause nerve inflammation, affecting mental health through a direct biological mechanism./The study is published in American Journal of Psychiatry.

Smog bad for your heart: Study,"Washington, July 22 -- An early test on rats has provided the first direct indication that smog is bad for heart./A major component of smog might trigger cell death in the heart, researchers said at the American Heart Association's Basic Cardiovascular Sciences 2010 Scientific Sessions - Technological and Conceptual Advances in Cardiovascular Disease./The study found that exposure to ground-level ozone over several weeks increased the activity of a substance that triggers cell death in the heart./Ozone becomes a major component of smog when it forms near the ground through reactions between sunlight, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons from fossil fuels and industrial processes./""Several epidemiological studies have linked air pollution to the development of cardiovascular disease, but air pollution contains hundreds of chemicals and those studies were unable to separate out the effects of individual components,"" Rajat Sethi, an assistant professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the Texas A and M Health Science Center Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy in Kingsville, Texas said./""Our study looked for direct evidence of the role of ozone alone in cardiac dysfunction by creating a controlled environment,"" he added./The researchers tested four groups of 10 rats living in clear plastic-glass boxes. The first two groups were exposed for eight hours a day to 0.8 parts per million (ppm) of O3 for either 28 or 56 consecutive days. The other two groups were exposed to 28 days or 56 days of clean, filtered air for eight hours per day. After the eight hours of testing, all the rats experienced 16 hours of clean air overnight./The study found that the hearts of the O3-exposed rats had increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF a), an indication of inflammation compared to hearts of the control rats. Increased TNF a levels have been linked to a drop in levels of a heart-protective protein called Caveolin-1 (Cav1). Scientists believe Cav1 protects the heart by binding to a chemical called p38MAPK alpha (p38MAPK a), which is known to be a cell death signaling chemical, Sethi said./The researchers found that Cav1 levels decreased in the hearts of rats exposed to O3 compared to the hearts of control rats who breathed filtered air./""We believe the decreased levels of Cav1 make more unbound p38MAPK a available for telling the heart cells to die. That link between Cav1 and O3 has never been shown in the heart,"" Sethi said. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International.

"Soot emissions key factor in global warming, says expert","Washington, July 29 -- A new study has found that the quickest, best way to slow the rapid melting of Arctic sea ice is to reduce soot emissions from the burning of fossil fuel, wood and dung./According to Stanford researcher Mark Z. Jacobson analysis, soot is second only to carbon dioxide in contributing to global warming. But, he said, climate models to date have mischaracterized the effects of soot in the atmosphere./Because of that, soot's contribution to global warming has been ignored in national and international global warming policy legislation, he said./""Controlling soot may be the only method of significantly slowing Arctic warming within the next two decades,"" said Jacobson, director of Stanford's Atmosphere/Energy Program./""We have to start taking its effects into account in planning our mitigation efforts and the sooner we start making changes, the better.""/To reach his conclusions, Jacobson used an intricate computer model of global climate, air pollution and weather that he developed over the last 20 years that included atmospheric processes not incorporated in previous models./He examined the effects of soot - black and brown particles that absorb solar radiation - from two types of sources./He analyzed the impacts of soot from fossil fuels - diesel, coal, gasoline, jet fuel - and from solid biofuels, such as wood, manure, dung, and other solid biomass used for home heating and cooking in many locations. He also focused in detail on the effects of soot on heating clouds, snow and ice./What he found was that the combination of both types of soot is the second-leading cause of global warming after carbon dioxide./He also found that soot emissions kill more than 1.5 million people prematurely worldwide each year, and afflicts millions more with respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease and asthma, mostly in the developing world where biofuels are used for home heating and cooking./Jacobson's study will be published this week in Journal of Geophysical Research (Atmospheres).

Skin,"India, Aug. 7 -- Everyone's skin ages depending their genes and lifestyle. However sun exposure accelerates the signs of ageing such as dryness, wrinkles and skin growths like liver spots (keratoses). That's the reason why your face, neck, hands and forearms are areas that age the fastest. Other factors that accelerate ageing are smoking, air pollution (ozone depletes the vitamin E from the skin), and rapid weight loss./Fine surface lines can be treated with anti-ageing treatments, but deeper creases require techniques such as injecting fillers./Anti-ageing creams/Using creams regularly, especially before going to bed, minimises ageing. It's a good idea to pamper and nourish your skin at night because that's the time when blood supply to the skin surface is optimal, increasing cream absorption. Creams prevent moisture loss, assist the skin in absorbing moisture from air and compensate for the natural sebum that may have been lost./The right age to start skincare actively using simple moisturising creams is 25 years. Use anti-ageing creams only after the age of 35./Anti-ageing creams work by stimulating the cells to form more fibre for firmness. They contain alpha-hydroxy acids that increase blood supply and realign the collagen to reduce creases. These creams also trap moisture on the skin's surface and prevent it from drying up, especially in dehydrating air-conditioned environments./The active ingredient in anti-ageing creams is the vitamin-A derived tretinoin. Using it regularly at night reduces fine wrinkles by 30-40 per cent. After using the night creams daily for one year, you can cut down use to two to three times a week. The other ingredients are antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene./These creams make the skin sensitive to the sun. To prevent redness and itching, using sun-protection - be it using a hat, umbrella or sunscreen cream or lotion - is a must. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

LPG most polluting? Experts disagree,"New Delhi, Sept. 20 -- A government claim that the source of the Capital's deadliest pollutant Particulate Matter 2.5 is liquid petroleum gas (LPG) in homes and not vehicles has miffed experts who term it as an attempt to give the transport sector a clean chit for air pollution. PM 2.5, the smallest pollutant absorbed/mostly by the human body, can trigger heart attacks and respiratory diseases./Rise in number of vehicles was believed to be the major source of the pollutant./This claim was countered by Indian Oil Corporation this week when it quoted a Central Pollution Control Board study saying LPG was the major contributor to rising PM 2.5 in the Capital./An IOC presentation at a seminar organised by diesel vehicle manufacturers said that half of PM 2.5 in residential areas of Delhi was because of combustion of domestic LPG. In industrial areas, it was as high as 61 per cent and at traffic junctions 40.5 per cent./""It is not a complete view,"" said CPCB chairperson S.P. Gautam. The board for the first time in India conducted an air pollution source appropriation study which was peer reviewed by air pollution experts from Europe and the US and is being examined by an inter-ministerial group. ""I don't know what IOC had said but there are many factors which contribute to particulate matter.""/The most intriguing findings were for residential areas in Delhi where vehicles contribute 22.4 per cent and kerosene combustion 17.4 per cent to total PM 2.5 pollution./The presentation states vehicles contribute only seven per cent to particulate matter at traffic intersections and garbage burning for 14 per cent./""It is shocking,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, Associate Director with NGO Centre for Science and Environment. ""Refinery and auto industries have hyped data in public forums to prove vehicles are the cleanest and must be left alone.""/The CPCB study, which Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has decided not to put in public domain, is likely to be the basis for India's future auto fuel policy. The government has constituted an inter-ministerial group to review the present policy, which expires in 2010, and create one for the new decade./Environment ministry officials said the aim of the new policy would be to reduce the sources of air pollution./Chowdhury said the government was framing a new policy without consulting people.

Pollution 'increases risk of cardiac arrest',"Washington, Sept. 21 -- A new study has revealed that the fine particles of pollution that hang in the air can increase the risk for sudden cardiac arrest./A team from Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Medical Center and The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research conducted the study./Robert A. Silverman, MD, and his colleagues have been interested in the effects of ambient fine particulate matter on a number of medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and asthma./The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) keeps tabs on air pollution through dozens of strategically placed pollution sensors in cities and towns throughout the country. This data allowed the researchers to collect data on average 24-hour values of small particulates and other gaseous pollutants around New York City during the summer (when pollution is higher) and winter months./They then compared that data to the 8,216 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred between 2002 and 2006. Most people in the throes of a cardiac arrest do not survive in time for emergency medical service teams to save them./Dr. Silverman and his fellow researchers reported that for a 10ug/m3 rise in small particle air pollution, there was a four-to-10 percent increase in the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The current EPA standard is 35ug/m3. The effect was much greater in the summer months, said Dr. Silverman, an associate professor of emergency medicine and director of research at LIJ's Department of Emergency Medicine./""Small particulate matter is dangerous to health,"" said Dr. Silverman./The report has been published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

"Now, an iPhone app that can measure pollutants in air","Washington, Sept. 21 -- A new smartphone application can now allow users to keep a tab on the air quality and see the level of pollutants around them./University of Southern California computer scientists hope that as many users as possible download and try it in order to improve the software./Currently, the download works for smartphones running the Android system and soon will be widely available on Android app sources. An iPhone app is in the works./The basic principle of the Visibility app is simple, according to the paper documenting the work by USC computer science professor Gaurav Sukhatme./The user takes a picture of the sky while the sun is shining, which can be compared to established models of sky luminance to estimate visibility./Visibility is directly related to the concentration of harmful ""haze aerosols,"" tiny particles from dust, engine exhaust, mining or other sources in the air. Such aerosols turn the blue of a sunlit clear sky gray./There is one caveat' It has to be the right picture. The visibility/pollution models are based on the viewing geometry of the image and the position of the sun./The Visibility app works because modern smartphones contain a rich set of sensors that include cameras, GPS systems, compasses and accelerometers, in addition to the powerful communication capabilities that are inspiring a slew of intelligent phone applications ranging from personal health monitoring to gaming and social networking./Sameera Poduri, a postdoctoral researcher in Sukhatme's lab, explained that the accelerometer in the phone - the sensor that tells how the user is holding the phone, determining whether it displays information vertically or horizontally - can ""guide the user to point the camera in exactly the right direction.""/The picture must be all or mostly sky, which makes a contribution from human user judgment critical./""Several computer vision problems that are extremely challenging to automate are trivially solved by a human. In our system, segmenting sky pixels in an arbitrary image is one such problem. When the user captures an image, we ask him [or her] to select a part of the image that is sky,' noted the research paper./The accelerometers and the compass on the phone capture its position in three dimensions while the GPS data and time are used to compute the exact position of the sun./The application automatically computes the camera and solar orientation, uploading this data along with the image ' a small (100KB) black-and-white file ' to a central computer./The central computer analyzes the image to estimate pollutant content and returns a message to the user, as well as registering the information. (User identities are anonymized)/The system potentially can help fill in the many blanks in the existing maps of air pollution./So far the results are promising, but they indicate that several improvements are possible./Sukhatme said: ""We're sure we can improve it if we get people trying it and testing it and sending data.""

Breast cancer linked to traffic-related air pollution,"Washington, Oct. 7 -- Air pollution, which has already been linked to a range of health problems, may put women at risk of for another deadly disease./A ground breaking new study suggests pollution from traffic is associated with the risk of breast cancer./The study has been conducted by researchers from The Research Institute of the MUHC (RI MUHC; Dr. Mark Goldberg), McGill University (Drs. Goldberg, Dan Crouse and Nancy Ross), and Universit' de Montr'al (Dr. France Labr'che). ""We've been watching breast cancer rates go up for some time. Nobody really knows why, and only about one third of cases are attributable to known risk factors. Since no-one had studied the connection between air pollution and breast cancer using detailed air pollution maps, we decided to investigate it,"" says study co-author Dr. Mark Goldberg, a researcher at The RI MUHC./Dr. Goldberg and his colleagues approached the problem by combining data from several studies./First, they used the results of their 2005-2006 study to create two air pollution ""maps"" showing levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a by-product of vehicular traffic, in different parts of Montreal in 1996 and 10 years earlier in 1986./Then, they charted the home addresses of women diagnosed with breast cancer in a 1996-97 study onto the air pollution maps. Their findings were startling. The incidence of breast cancer was clearly higher in areas with higher levels of air pollution./""We found a link between post-menopausal breast cancer and exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is a 'marker' for traffic-related air pollution"", says Dr. Goldberg./""Across Montreal, levels of NO2 varied between 5 ppb to over 30 ppb. We found that risk increased by about 25 per cent with every increase of NO2 of five parts per billion./Another way of saying this is that women living in the areas with the highest levels of pollution were almost twice as likely to develop breast cancer as those living in the least polluted areas.""/These disturbing results must be interpreted with great caution, warns Dr. Goldberg. ""First of all, this doesn't mean NO2 causes breast cancer,"" he explains. ""This gas is not the only pollutant created by cars and trucks, but where it is present, so are the other gases, particles and compounds we associate with traffic - some of which are known carcinogens. NO2 is only a marker, not the actual carcinogenic agent.""/The study has been published in the prestigious journal Environmental Health Perspectives.

Long-term air pollution exposure 'ups risk of severe COPD',"Washington, Oct. 20 -- Researchers in Denmark say that long-term exposure to low-level air pollution may increase the risk of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)./""We found significant positive associations between levels of all air pollution proxies and COPD incidence,"" said Dr. Zorana Andersen, lead researcher on the study./Dr. Andersen, and colleagues used data from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study, which consisted of more than 57,000 individuals between the ages of 50 and 64 who lived in Copenhagen or Aarhus, the first and second largest cities in Denmark, between 1993 and 1997./""When we adjusted for smoking status and other confounding factors, the association remained significant, indicating that long-term pollution exposure likely is a true risk factor for developing COPD,"" Dr. Andersen said./These associations were slightly stronger for men, obese patients and those eating less than 240 grams of fruit each day./But notably, the effect of air pollution on COPD was strongest in people with pre-existing diabetes and asthma./""These results are in agreement with those of other cross-sectional studies on COPD and air pollution, and longitudinal studies of air pollution and lung function, and strengthen the conclusion that air pollution is a causal agent in development of COPD,"" said Dr. Andersen./The research was published in the American Thoracic Society's American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

Queasy stomachs good for the lungs,"India, July 2 -- You always get some good with the bad. No, this is not an airy philosophical debate on good and evil, but statement based on hard, scientific data. Groundbreaking research in Switzerland shows that infection from the stomach bug Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) - which causes painful gastritis and/stomach and intestinal ulcers - protects against asthma. The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation on Saturday, confirm the hygiene hypothesis that blames increasing asthma cases around the world on lowered exposure to bacteria in early childhood, which prevents the body from developing a healthy immunity./In simple words, the bug that gives your stomach grief - H. pylori infects half the world's population - also makes you breathe easy. It is resistant to stomach acids , which helps it survive in the stomach without symptoms for a long time. Under some conditions, however, it causes gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and stomach cancer, which is why antibiotics are prescribed to wipe it out even if you do not have symptoms./The double whammy, of course, is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which is now an established trigger of asthma. Other airway irritants are air pollution and pollen, food colour and additives, obesity, smoking, poorly ventilated homes and workplaces (10% of adult asthma is work-related), cold weather, exercise and stressors such as domestic violence and even relationships breaking down./The triggers, of course, work only on people with sensitive (hyperallergic) airways. What makes airways sensitive is your immune system's threat perception. An asthma attack occurs when an allergen or another stress factor causes an immune reaction that leads to inflammation (swelling) in the airways, which narrows air passage and reduces air flow in the lungs. This causes wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, which can last for a few minutes to days, depending on the severity and length of exposure. If not treated, asthma attacks can kill./Apart from exposure to organisms that cause disease, harmless - bacteria and fungi found in vegetation and dust also offer protection by preventing the immune system from overacting to allergens. Two large studies support this. One, from the University of Columbia in the US, reported that asthma cases went down by 25% among children who lived in neighbourhoods with lots of trees. Another, from the Institute of Epidemiology in Munich, Germany, used blood test reports to confirm that having a pet dog boosts children's immune system and lowers their risk of asthma as compared with children occasionally exposed to inhaled allergens such as house mites, animal fur and pollen./Previous studies have shown that living in farms among animals, having many older siblings and attending day care at an early age offer protection against asthma, most likely because all these situations translate into more exposure to germs - both good and bad - in early childhood./This celebration of germs and dirt is likely to make you wonder, how dirty is dirty enough? It is premature to advocate giving children dirt or germ pills for breakfast, but don't worry about the occasional slush football or romp in the park with the family pet as long as they wash up - the children not the dogs - before meals. And if you find yourself feeling squeamish about the dirt, remind yourself that it's good for health. Given the consistency at which new superbugs are popping up around the world, they need a super-charged immunity to survive without popping antibiotics three times a day.

WOODSY TROUBLE - Manali's wood-fired ovens fuel concerns over ecology,"anali, August 1 -- Tourists in Manali are nibbling away at the environment, literally. With wood-fired ovens being a rage at this popular tourist destination in Himachal Pradesh, the alreadydepleting forest cover ha been further endangered./From upscale restaurants in New Manali to more affordable ones in Old Manali, every eating joint -worth its olives and jalapenos -has strategically placed a board announcing ""wood-fired oven pizzas"" at its entrance. It's a sure-fire way to lure hordes of tourists on the lookout for newer experiences./Yet, no one seems to be bothered about the gastronomic threat to the fragile alpine ecosystem. Rough estimates suggest trees are being chopped every day (during the peak tourist season from April to June) to keep numerous wood fired ovens alive in Manali and nearby areas including, Vashisht, Solang Valley and Naggar./""It's what tourists want./We are forced to cater to this growing demand. It's about market dynamics,"" says a restaurant owner in Old Manali, refusing to be named. ""We only use firewood from dead trees. We, too, care about the environment,"" says the proprietor of one of the oldest eating joints here, popular with foreigners./Even the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC)owned Kunzam Cafe (on Mall Road) has fallen in line and offers pizzas baked in wood-fired ovens./This, despite the HPTDC website claiming to use only 'dead, diseased and decaying trees' for 'bonafide requirements' of locals./GS Thakur, District Forest Officer, Publicity, Himachal Pradesh says, ""Only dead trees, not green trees, are cut for firewood. Also, fuel wood is sold only from registered sources, like the forest corporation depot."" Thakur adds, ""If someone uses fuel wood from any other source, it's illegal.""/Yet, the threat to forest cover in the area is immediate. ""In May 2009, per capita fuel wood consumption at Kohlibher village near Kullu was 31.24 kg,"" says Dr JC Kuniyal, scientist at Kullubased GB Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development. With an estimated 16 lakh tourists frequenting Kullu-Manali annually, the already-strained green cover is groaning./Add to it vehicular emissions and the problem grows manifold. Dr Kuniyal says: ""A 2005 study --Trend of atmospheric aerosols over the north-western Himalayan region -shows that the level of air pollution over the sensitive area of north-western Himalayas (under which Kullu-Manali falls) is increasing due to high anthropogenic (caused or produced by humans) activities.""

City gasps for breath through traffic snarls,"umbai, Aug. 29 -- With the increase in vehicular traffic and construction activity, air pollution in the city is on the rise. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's Environment Status Report (ESR) for the year 2010-11 revealed that the emission load of Mumbai has increased from 588.57 tonnes per day last/year to 597.12 tonnes tpd in 2010-11, which is leading to the rise in air pollution. Experts attribute this rise to an increase in the number of vehicles, which in turn leads to an increase in exhaust emissions, and to construction activities./According to the ESR report, exhaust emissions from automobiles has increased to 391.26 tpd from 383.69 tpd last year. Exhaust emissions constitute 65% of the total emission load./This is largely because Mumbai's car population is growing at a rate of 5.6 % annually. The number of vehicles in the city was 19.09 lakh in January this year as against 18.06 lakh vehicles in January last year. The ensuing traffic congestion leads to vehicles emitting large volumes of exhaust gas as vehicles move at snail's pace or remain halted for long periods of time./""Traffic congestion is reducing fuel efficiency and is an leading to increase in emissions,"" said Rakesh Kumar of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. He said that the low popularity of clean fuels such as CNG and LPG among private car owners is contributing to the problem./Unchecked construction activity in the city has also added to the emission load of the city, says the report. ""Rampant construction activities in the city is also responsible for the increase in particulate matter,"" said Kumar./In fact, the Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) has crossed the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) standards of 140 ug/m3 at all the six air pollution monitoring sites in the city, which include Worli, Khar, Borivli, Andheri, Bhandup and Maravli. The average SPM count was 125 to 642 ug/m3. SPM is primary cause of respiratory diseases. The presence of heavy metals such as lead has also seen a rise, but is still within CPCB standards, said the report. The report also says that levels of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) has reduced in all the six monitoring stations while, Nitrogen Dioxide(NO2) and Ammonia (NH3) are within approved standards in all five air monitoring stations expect Maravli.

Ozone can trigger asthma: study,"NEW DELHI, Sep. 01 -- India's urban centres are experiencing a new air pollution health hazard ozone whose just two-hour exposure can trigger a lethal asthma attack, says a study conducted by Delhi-based Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute./In the last few years, ozone level has surged with increase in automobile and industrial emissions. Ozone is a complex chemical reaction of nitrogen oxide gases and volatile organic compounds, by-products of burning gasoline and coal, with oxygen when temperature hovers around 25 to 35 degrees Celsius./""High ozone levels in Indian cities have been observed during afternoon and early evening hours,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of Centre for Science and Environment./""We have found the days when ozone levels are high in Delhi, we get larger number of patients with asthma attacks. The reason is that the ozone reduces lung function allowing allergens in air to cause asthma,"" S K Chhabra of the institute said at a seminar on Wednesday./To link ozone with asthma attacks, the institute conducted the maiden study in the country and found that two hours of exposure was enough to trigger a lethal asthma attack. ""We have photographs showing that in two hours of exposure to ozone, lungs turn pale,"" he said./The study also found effect of ozone more on children than adults a probable reason for increase in asthma incidence in children in the country./Another interesting finding of the study was that ozone has adverse impact on human health even if it is below the government notified standard of 50 particles per million (ppm) for eight hours. ""Even at 40 ppm it causes lung dysfunction,"" Chhabra said./The reason for this was that the ambient air quality standard for ozone was based on studies done in west and not in India./""It shows that we should redraft our air quality standards based on domestic studies,"" Chowdhury said./Sundeep Salvi, director of Pune-based foundation said lung function among Indians was poorest in the world. ""The difference between us and Europeans is about 30%,"" he said./They also found that inhaling the mosquito repellant was equal to about smoking 100 cigarettes and burning of two incense sticks release bad smoke equal to about 30 cigarettes./R N Tandon, joint director with Indian Medical Association, said there is a reason to believe that pollution was causing increase in disease burden as smoking was on the fall.

Pollution can trigger heart attacks,"NEW DELHI, Sept. 25 -- Bad diets, inactivity and smoking cause heart disease, but car fumes can tip you over. Breathing in heavy traffic fumes can trigger a heart attack, say UK experts in the British Medical Journal. The risk remains raised for about six hours after exposure and goes down again after that. Air pollution thickens the blood to make it more likely to clot, putting you at higher risk of a heart attack. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Toxic Capital air killing like never before,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 -- The Capital is breathing poison. Every day 21 people die of respiratory diseases in Delhi and vehicular pollution is to be blamed in the majority of cases./In 2010, 7,525 persons died of complications from respiratory diseases. The figure is up 41% from that for 2009 when 5,328 such deaths were reported, according to the Delhi Statistical Handbook, 2011./""Pollution is a major cause of the fast increase in the cases of respiratory diseases in the city,"" said health minister AK Walia. ""With the introduction of CNG, the air quality had seen improvement. But the situation seems to be deteriorating again.""/Deaths due to respiratory diseases have almost doubled in the last four years. In 2007, the number was 4,246 but in 2010, it touched 7,525./Asthma is the most common problem which plagues both the elderly and children compounded by dirty air. ""Pollution is one of the major contributing factors that makes the condition of people suffering from chronic respiratory diseases worse, "" said Dr Nishant Jain, a chest specialist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. ""Asthmatics, in particular, are prone to life threatening attacks.""/Walia also blamed rising numbers of vehicles for the worsening air quality. As many as 13,000 new vehicles are added to the city roads a day./Hectic construction activity in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games also contributed to the spike in the number of people complaining of respiratory disorders in 2010, said Walia. Dust particles remained suspended in the air for a long time, contributing to the pollution. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

TIRUPATI: THE TEMPLE TOWN'S HIDDEN MESS,"NEW DELHI, April 9 -- Tirupati has more pilgrims than most other cities in the world. Though the temple is located outside the city, there is a still a lot of trash from a roaming population the city has to deal with. It also has a fair amount of its own trash at least 140 tonne a day that is collected and dumped. But, Tirupati's waste collection and disposal is probably one of the most poorly handled systems in the country. For one, though the average pilgrim can't see it, but most of the trash is burned. This is illegal. Ironically, the waste is burned next to a series of windmills. Wastepickers rummage through the smouldering ash. How tragic that in a town where so much wealth circulates, there lies this toxic underside. Perhaps the Tirupati municipality should begin doorstep collection and recycle the waste. The presence of windmills will then seem less hypocritical./MASK YOURSELF/Many Indians are amused by tourists who wear masks. Now, a new study published in the journal, Environmental Health Perspectives, conducted on Beijing roads, suggests that wearing a high-efficiency mask can protect a person from air pollution and coronary heart disease. In India, we discuss masks as an occupational safety feature. We need masks that can keep out smaller particles, and these are expensive, not to mention uncomfortable in the humidity. But while air pollution is still beyond safety limits, we may have to throw fashion to the winds. But this should not stop government from cleaning up our air.

An unbalanced act,"India, July 1 -- India's economic growth had been impressive but it has failed to grow in an environmentally sustainable manner. Forty years down the line, the call of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1972 to strike a balance between growth and environment still remains a distant dream. ""Back at the Cocoyoc Declaration in 1974, when the definition of development was discussed, it was recognised that development is not of 'things', but of mankind. We ended up moving in the opposite direction,"" says power policy analyst Shankar Sharma./The government's own data shows how planners have rampaged through ecology to achieve high growth in the last two decades, when the shackles of the license-permit raj were removed. Around 70% of India's surface water is now contaminated, just 35-40% of waste water from Indian industries is cleaned before discharge, most industries failed to score more than 50% on environment sustainability scorecard, half of the Indian cities fail to meet the government's own air pollution norms, two of the world's most polluted cities - Vapi in Gujarat and Sukinda in Orrisa - are in India and half of rural Indian homes do not have safe drinking water sources. The issue hits even closer home. The Renuka dam in Himachal Pradesh was proposed to provide drinking water to Delhi, but the government didn't make any provisions to safeguard existing resources./India's success story in the last two decades has gone hand in hand with the exploitation of natural resources. This has had its obvious implications. The proportion of dense forests has been rapidly falling, according to latest Forest Survey of India report. As many as 89 new bird species are on the threatened list since 2001 due to habitat loss, says Asad Rahmani, director of Mumbai based Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). ""The Saker Falcon and the Great Slaty Woodpecker are the latest additions,"" he says. ""According to the National Forest Policy of 1985, at least 33% of the country needs to be under forest cover. It's less than 20% currently,"" says Sharma./The stark environmental degradation indicators have had an impact on the country's health. The World Health Organisation estimates that 24% of global disease burden and 23% of all deaths can be attributed to environmental factors. A study of US Based Health Effects Institute said that at least 3,000 people in Delhi die every year due to air pollution linked causes. ""In developing countries such as India, an estimated 42% of acute lower respiratory infections are caused by environmental factors,"" a WHO official says, adding that the majority of victims are poor./Indian industry, however, claims that it's doing its bit to protect the environment and that the country's per capita ecological footprint has shrunk by 12% in the last two decades when the GDP grew by 190%. Industry also claims it is one of the most energy efficient in the world even though around 450 million Indians don't have a regular power connection. ""Every ATM has two ACs that run 24/7. Calculate the number of ATMs in the country and one gets an idea of the extent of electricity consumption,"" points out an environment expert./""The larger enterprises have adopted global best practices in sustainability,"" says S Gopalakrishanan, president designate of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and co-founder of Infosys, while admitting that the 11 million medium and small scale industries (which contribute 40% of industrial GDP) were a problem./Civil society bodies such as Kalpavariksh and South Asian Network for Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP) has blamed the government and industry collusion for failing strike to balance between growth and industry. Himanshu Thakkar of SANDRP says unless economic growth is democratic and participatory, protecting the environment will be difficult. Ashish Kothari of Kapavariksh is of the view that unless the government puts the interest of the people before industry, balance can't be achieved. The solution, according to Sharma, lies in cost versus benefit. ""We need to change the paradigm from looking at the project developers' side to looking at society. Whether its Singur (West Bengal), Posco (Orissa) or Mundra (Gujarat), we're failing to see the cost to people and resources.""/Gopalakrishanan agrees that achieving the balance is important considering India's rising population and limited natural resources and suggests a two-pronged approach. First, industry should adopt green norms such as renewable energy sources, the reuse of waste and adoption of cleaner technologies and second, the government should drive sustainable development by simplifying procedures and providing incentives. The practical way forward, according to environment experts, is to take a rational view of the country's development needs - how much electricity does a child need to read or how best can drinking water be provided to every household in the country - as well as decreasing inequality in resources usage./Noted environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta feels the concept of sustainable development hinges on justice, democratic participation and good governance. ""Currently, its the classic case of hiding behind the poor. First you say projects are needed for them. When the poor protest, you violently crush them."" When the Uttranchal dams were sanctioned in 2005, there was little information on how the project would impact people and resources. Yet it went ahead says Dutta. ""In 2009-10, when the rivers started drying up, the government had to scrap the project despite having invested R600 crore. So much could've been avoided if public consultation had taken place earlier.""/Achieving what civil society and industry is saying is possible by tweaking existing provisions. The Forest Rights Act provides for informed consent of locals for new industrial and developmental projects and a similar rule can be extended to non-forest areas. Rules under Environment Protection Act provide for recycling of waste and faster approval to industries adopting cleaner technologies. ""Its implementation in letter and spirit is required,"" says a senior Planning Commission functionary./Foresight is crucial. The recent approval suspension for projects such as Andhra Pradesh's thermal power plant, Tamil Nadu's IL&FS or the Renuka dam in the last year, owing to the lack of legal compliances, are some cases in point. ""It's better to be suspended at the planning stage than face people's anger later, like what happened in Singur. Business in India is thriving because people opt for shortcuts thinking it'll save costs,"" says Dutta. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Badal campaigns for greener state,"FEROZEPUR, July 2 -- Punjab government has decided to conduct a survey across the state to check the quality of potable water, said chief minister Parkash Singh Badal presiding over a function, to launch 'Greener Punjab' campaign, in Fazilka on Sunday./Under the survey, to be completed in three months, samples of water being supplied to households through tube wells or canal-based schemes would be tested to ensure safe drinking water, informed the CM. He asked the people to join hands with the government to curb air and water pollution. Badal said that within the next two years the state government would fully check river pollution, while the campaign, Greener Punjab, will control air pollution, thus making the state clean and green./Badal rued that due to deforestation, the forest cover has reduced to 7% of the total area of the state whereas, according to government of India norms, it must be more than 33%. He assured that the state government would enhance the green cover to 15%./Emphasising on the need to make the campaign a public movement, the CM said that such a drive would check the spread of diseases caused by environmental pollution, such as cancer, asthma and diabetes. Reiterating 'each one, plant one', the CM said that all government departments, NGOs and religious bodies, besides individuals, needed to play a proactive role to check environmental degradation./On the issue of Abohar-Fazilka train, which is yet to start though the work is complete, Badal lashed at the Congress-led UPA government and said that it was a testimony to the fact that Punjab was meted out with a step motherly treatment. Advocating special incentives for the border areas of Punjab, he said that a special cadre of teachers of border areas was launched, which would not only give recruitment to the youth but also improve the level of education./Replying to a query regarding education system of the state, the CM said that a survey was being conducted to gauge infrastructure and staff needed for the education sector. He said that in the next three years Punjab's education system would be overhauled./Forest minister Surjit Kumar Jyani, financial commissioner forest DS Bains, chief parliamentary secretary Chaudhary Nand Lal, Lok Sabha MP Sher Singh Ghubaya and Fazilka deputy commissioner Basant Garg were also present on the occasion.

Not fired with logic,"NEW DELHI, July 26 -- In the development business doing something for both women and the environment is the equivalent of holding a royal flush in poker. Which is why, a few years ago so many people signed on to the idea of an improved cookstove: in September 2010, for instance, Hillary Clinton announced the formation of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC), which calls for 100 million homes to adopt clean and efficient stoves and fuels by 2020./The basic idea is simple. The world's poorest people use the cheapest available fuels - dung and twigs and even leaves. This might sound like protecting the environment - after all we are not burning something that needs to be pulled out of the earth. But it is not. These are among the dirtiest fuels available, in terms of the amount of particulate matter and carbon dioxide released into the air; coal is clean by comparison. And when a woman bends over the stove to cook, a lot of those newly liberated particles travel more or less directly into her lungs. A lot of the rest swirls around the house, ending up in the respiratory system of those who spend a lot of time at home, like young children and the elderly. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 2 million people die from this kind of indoor air pollution every year, which is about as many deaths as malaria and tuberculosis combined./Improved cookstoves seemed to be a simple but brilliant solution to the problem. Why not enclose the fire so that neither the heat nor the smoke can escape from the stove and channel the smoke out of the house through a simple chimney? Enclosing the heat saves energy and lowers emissions; and sending smoke out is obviously better./This is what the new generation of stoves were designed to do and when tried out under controlled conditions they seemed to work: this was why there was so much excitement about them. Yet, a recent study by some of my colleagues from Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that followed several thousand households with and without improved stoves in Odisha over four years reluctantly concluded that having a stove at home made absolutely no difference. The study was done with great care: households were selected by lottery to receive a subsidised stove to ensure that those who got those stoves were exactly like those who didn't. It was not that the stoves just never arrived - Gram Vikas, one of India's most respected NGOs, was in charge of implementation and every eligible household that wanted a stove got one. A wide range of outcomes - from school attendance of children to the carbon dioxide in the lungs of their mother - were measured. Quite remarkably, by the end of year four, there was really no good news to report, whether it was health that you cared about or fuel use or time spent cooking./It is instructive to try and understand why the promised miracle did not happen. At one level the answer is simple - people stopped using the improved stoves. They had them in their homes, but they used their old unimproved stoves. Interestingly, this was true from the very beginning. People never stopped using their old stoves, though the new stoves did get significantly more use in year one than in year four. Correspondingly, in year one carbon dioxide in the lungs of women does go down, but it goes back up over time, as the new stove falls into disuse./One advantage of the old stoves is that they are portable. When the weather was not too hot or wet, cooking was more pleasant outside than inside their small single room houses. The new stoves, with their fixed chimneys, could not be moved. But surely there must be something else to the story - remember all of this got started because there was enough cooking inside to be a health hazard. Well, it turns out that improved stoves, like all stoves, have a tendency to crack. But a crack in an improved stove defeats its whole point. Smoke comes into the room through the crack rather than exiting through the chimney. Heat leaks out, reducing fuel efficiency. New stove owners, data shows, spend significantly more time repairing their stoves. And since such repairs in rural Odisha are a man's job, this probably involved a fair amount of persuasion by the woman./The improved stoves also demanded more attention. There were two burners, and both need to be covered all the time, even if only one was being used - otherwise the smoke just leaked out through the other hole. If you got distracted and forgot to put the cover on, because, say, a child was crying outside, you would come back to find yourself in a room full of smoke./For the hyper-rational being that lives in economic models, none of this ought to matter. They would never forget in any case, and even if they did, they would recognise the superiority of the new technology and stick to it. But I know how I would react: I would be so frustrated with all the things that keep going wrong with new stove (especially after all that hype) that I would stop using them./The broader point is not at all that new technologies never work or that the poor cannot adapt to them - no one who has seen the cellphone sneaking in and out of the ghunghat in rural Rajasthan can believe that. It is not even that such a stove cannot be made to work - there might even be one already somewhere that does. But it does remind us that technology works best when it sits lightly on the lives of its users. And most importantly, it warns us not to declare victory too soon - the fact that we think something should work is not enough - it needs to work for the people who use them.

Kolaghat power plant fined,"KOLKATA, Aug. 28 -- The state pollution control board (PCB) slapped R10 lakh fine on the Kolaghat thermal power station for pollution the surrounding environment, and affected thousands of villagers in East Midnapore and Howrah./Sources said that the 1260megawatt power plant produces around 5000 metric tons of ash everyday. Meanwhile, the smoke billowing out of the power plant triggers massive air pollution, with the ash settling everywhere, affecting the crops./""A significant portion of this ash is drained into three canals, and the Rupnarayan River, thus leading to water pollution,"" said Nayan Nayek, an environmental activist of Krishna Sangram Parishad./The NGOs file a complaint against the power plant, along with the West Bengal pollution control board in November 2011. A team of experts had come to inspect the power plant, after a hearing the board slapped the fine on the plant./""We have been asked to deposit a sum of R10 lakh and the WBPCB has asked us to upgrade chimneys and plant 5000 trees,"" said R Bose director of the West Bengal power development corporation.

Industrial waste making groundwater toxic,"Noida, Sept. 17 -- The dumping of industrial waste by manufacturing units in Greater Noida is posing a serious health hazard to residents and adding to groundwater pollution. Residents of several villages claim that chemical and other industries are dumping toxic waste without treating them. Villages such as Bil Akbarpur, Sadopur, Acchesa, Kheda Dhrampura and Bisnoli are among the worst sufferers. The villagers claim that the water they drink is highly polluted, causing several life-threatening diseases./According to pollution norms, industries should dump toxic substances only after detoxing them. Besides, industrial waste should not be dumped in the open./After local authorities did not pay heed to their repeated complaints, the villagers on Saturday wrote to central and state pollution control boards, the National Human Rights Commission and UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in this regard./""Gautam Budh Nagar district pollution control board did not address our several complaints in the past. Therefore, we have written to the central and state-level authorities on this issue. Villagers' basic right to clean drinking water is infringed upon by these industries' bad practices,"" said Vikrant Tongad, a local environmentalist./People are falling ill frequently due to 'toxic' groundwater. ""In the past five years 29 people have died of cancer in our village. We suspect that highly polluted water is the main reason behind the rise in number of cancer patients,"" said Arun Baisoya, a law student from Sadopur village./""The regular use of polluted groundwater may cause cancer. Heavy metals and pesticides induce nutrition that causes the deadly disease,"" said Dr Gagan Saini, senior oncologist, Fortis Hospital, Noida./Residents of other villages have echoed similar views. ""Some industrial units, which deal in chemical and detergent powder, dump their waste directly into ground through borewell, without treating it. As a result the groundwater in the village has become toxic,"" said Omkar Singh of Bil Akbarpur./Local authorities disagree with residents. ""We had inspected several industrial units in May. Most of them have required sewage treatment plant (STP) and air pollution control system in place. They dump their waste after proper treatment,"" said Parasnath, regional manager of district pollution control board in an RTI reply. The RTI application was filed by Vikrant Tongad./""Villagers have complained about effluent being dumped into ground. We will inspect industrial units along with the media and take appropriate action if any unit is found flouting norms,"" said Rajesh Yadav, sub-divisional magistrate, Greater Noida./On the allegation that local pollution board officials in connivance with industrial units let the waste dump into ground, Parasnath said, ""Several units installed all required system five months back after residents' complaints.

"Delhi cold brings pollution, illness","NEW DELHI, Nov. 2 -- There is chill in the Delhi air and an alarming level of pollution as well. Thursday was the most polluted day for the Capital this year, with levels five times the national limit./The average respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) - measure of pollutants in the air - in Delhi was 571 ug/m3. The national standard is 100ug/m3 for residential areas./RSPMs are superfine particles that are hazardous as they can enter lungs, making people vulnerable to heart diseases, asthma and even lung cancer./""Patients have started coming in with chest infections and respiratory problems,"" said Dr AB Dey, professor of medicine at AIIMS. ""With the sudden drop in mercury levels, the air is also heavy and this is what is triggering upper respiratory tract problems.""/Air at Anand Vihar was the dirtiest - with an RSPM level of 709 microgram per cubic meter of air (ug/m3), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data show./What is worrying is that the winter RSPM levels have more than doubled in the last five years and are higher than they were in the mid-1990s, when diesel was the public transport fuel./And, the pollution is spreading. Until recently central and south Delhi areas were high pollution zones, now Rohini in north and Dwarka in southwest have RSPM concentration of more than 500ug/m3./""The data clearly show that the increasing number of vehicles in the Capital are the biggest contributing factor for rise in the air pollution,"" said Anumita Roy Choudhary of Centre for Science and Environment./Industrial activity is restricted in Delhi and therefore, around 90 cars for every 1,000 people in the city is the prime pollution contributor./""We are advising asthmatic patents to remain indoors for as much time as possible or wear an air filter mask when on the roads,"" said a doctor at Patel Chest Institute.

Govt to act against farm fires in nearby states,"New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- The Delhi government has prepared an action plan to deal with the dense smog that has engulfed the Capital for more than a week now./The government will take up the matter of paddy stubble burning, because of which Delhi's skies are being filled with toxic smoke, with its neighbouring states. NASA satellite images have shown burning activity in Punjab and UP to remove paddy stubbles to prepare the fields for sowing of the wheat crop. The ban on such activity, however, is hardly enforced./The government will also rope in IIT-Delhi to conduct a survey of the Capital's air quality to prepare a road map on how to bring down air pollution./When temperature dips, wind speed goes down but humidity remains high. As pollutants do not spread, there is a toxic build-up in the form of smog. The situation worsens when the smog stays as it traps emissions from vehicles and industries as well as particulate matter./Since larger plans will take time, for now, the government has decided to move against smoke-billowing vehicles and leaf-burning practices in the Capital as well as agricultural fires in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh./""These decisions were taken at a meeting chaired by Bhure Lal, chairman of Supreme Court's environmental pollution (prevention & control) control authority,"" said a senior official./Anumita Roy Choudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment, who was also part of the high-level meeting, said, ""It was decided that the matter (of agriculture fires) will be taken up with the neighbouring states. On its part, Delhi will move against smoke-billowing vehicles and leaf-burning activities right now.""/""The modalities (to check fires) are being worked out. Delhi's environment department may approach the Central pollution control board to get neighbouring states to act,"" said a government official./Pollution levels in Delhi have been going up since 2006.

"Small cities hit by smog, govt hazy","New Delhi, Nov. 9 -- This winter, Delhi and other metropolitan cities are not the only places with smog worries. Data with the Central Pollution Control Board show a sudden rise in particulate matter - a primary cause for smog - in smaller cities such as Lucknow, Kanpur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Ahmedabad and Solapur across Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Maharashtra./""It is spreading like a slow epidemic,"" said a scientist./While the board has failed to suggest any remedial measures to state governments, studies conducted on its adverse effects have been quite conclusive./Kolkata-based Chitranjan Institute has already established that high exposure to particulate matter, especially during the smog period, may result in life-long breathing disorders among children. CPCB data show that smog levels in Punjab towns, including Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Amritsar, were very high - with the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) rising above 500 micro grams per cubic metre, five times the national standard./""The entire region is covered by a thick blanket of smog, showing a steady degradation in the overall environment condition of the state,"" said SS Hundal, head of department of agro-meteorology in the Punjab Agricultural University./Burning of agricultural waste is one of the main reasons for high pollution levels. Stating that the answer to this lay in using the waste to generate biofuel, officials in the ministry of new and renewable energy said that state governments should push farmers to go for that option. Agricultural waste worth R10,000 crore goes up in smoke every year, he added./A spokesperson from the India Meteorological Department said that besides the usual weather conditions, the smog situation was exacerbated by the Cyclone Nilam - which hit southern India last week./Making this worse is the fact that many smaller towns and cities do not even have air pollution monitoring mechanisms in place. The CPCB helps monitor primary pollutants only in 240 locations across the country, which accounts for less than 100 cities. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Delhi can't be blind to what this smokescreen reveals,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 12 -- Like our governments, we too have a short memory. Now that the sun is barely out for three days, not many recall the thick grey blanket that hung low over the city most of the last two weeks and left us gasping for breath./Delhi gets smog every winter. But last week it persisted for too long. On November 9, Delhi had already clocked 207 hours of smog cover, just 38 hours less than 245 hours recorded during the entire month of November in 2008. Scientists at the Met office say this could be the worst onset since 1989 when fog data was analysed for the first time./First, the government dismissed it as a weather phenomenon. Burning farm waste in the neighbouring states was contributing to Delhi's soot-laden air. So were the smoke-spewing thermal plants and industries on the city's borders./The Supreme Court issued a warning and, finally, the government got around to discussing the problem. The neighbours agreed not to burn their farm waste. The Delhi government warned of strict penalties for those who burned leaves and garbage, and stringent action against polluting vehicles entering the city./Like dengue casualties and power lines tripping, the blame for this one too was conveniently passed on to the neighbouring states. But Delhi cannot deny its own pollution, said the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) last week. Respirable particulate almost all expert studies commissioned by the government have recommended congestion tax and road space rationing. It does not matter if the cars are run on petrol or diesel; it's their sheer numbers that choke our roads and lungs./One glitch has been the absence of a cohesive public transport system. But now, the 10-year-old Delhi Metro ferries 20 lakh passengers daily. Yet at least 700 new cars hit Delhi's roads every day. Clearly, not many of those who can afford to buy cars are using the Metro. The absence of last-mile connectivity - means to commute to and from Metro stations- is a major reason for that. We need more feeder buses, 'share' autos and taxis and a well-regulated non-motorised vehicle system and cycle tracks./The United Kingdom's first air pollution law was enacted soon after the great smog of 1952 killed thousands. It took London more than four decades since banning coal fires to introduce congestion fees charged from private motor vehicles operating in city centre between 7 am and 6 pm on weekdays./This not only helped reduce pollution and congestion but also helped the state raise investment for the city's transport system./London's fight, however, is far from over. Air pollution costs the UK an estimated £20bn a year and is recognised by the government as the second-biggest public health threat, after smoking. In Delhi, we haven't even started our fight. This smog is Delhi's last call to action. If we further delay the basic reforms, time will leave our side. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Awareness steals cracker thunder,"New Delhi, Nov. 12 -- Delhi is likely to celebrate a quieter and less polluted Diwali this year with the sale of fire crackers at an all-time low./Many neighbourhoods still do not have stalls for selling fire crackers. Suppliers are blaming the police for their business not picking up. ""There are a lot of issues about the licences with the police curtailing the distribution, which is why the sales are not picking up,"" said Dinesh Aggarwal, a fireworks supplier based in west Delhi./Inflation also seems to be a big factor in curtailing the sale of crackers./""Fire crackers are expensive and we will eventually have to give in to the demand of our children but we will try and ensure that they do not buy too many crackers,"" said Shailender Sharma, an MNC employee from Mayur Vihar III./Thanks to increasing sensitisation over environment pollution among children and the growing concern over the layer of smog enveloping Gurgaon as well, the firecracker stalls this year are not being thronged with as much fervour as compared to previous years./The administration this year allowed the dealers to set up cracker stalls for three days at - Leisure Valley Grounds, Sector 5 ground and Ghaushala ground./The sale began on Sunday but dealers felt the usual rush for buying crackers was missing this time./""As compared to last year, the sale seems dull this year. People have become more aware about air pollution and the environment,"" said Anil Kumar (35), who has been in the firecracker business for last 10 years./Some felt the three-day period allotted for the purchase of crackers was insufficient./""We stopped bursting firecrackers seven years ago. It feels like we are burning money. I know how bad the smoke is because I am asthmatic. I spend that money instead on sweets,"" said captain Savita Chhillar of Sector 23./Moreover, schools too are advising children against bursting crackers, keeping in mind the rising pollution levels in the city.

Indoor pollution: The enemy within,"Lucknow, Nov. 14 -- If you thought only outdoor air pollution was hazardous, then think twice. The atmosphere within your house itself could lead to respiratory infections, lung cancer and heart disease. Air pollution indoors can at times be worse than outside. Reason: Paints, carpets, upholstery, plywood, particle-board furniture, and computers let off poisonous gases. As most of the houses are well insulated, these poisons are trapped inside for us to breathe./A study by a Tel Aviv University researcher has concluded that indoor air pollution may lead to repeated episodes of cardiac ailments in the long term. Pollen, fungal spores, dust mites, dust may trigger asthma, allergies and sinus infections./Bacteria (1 to .03 micron in size), virus (.001 micron) usually spread in rooms to spread influenza, tuberculoses, pulmonary diseases and H1N1 flu. Similarly, paint solvents, automobile exhaust cleaning and industrial chemicals from cooking appliances may lead to headache, fatigue, dizziness, irritation in the eyes, nose and throat, says the study./Second-hand smoke is the third leading cause of lung cancer and responsible for an estimated 3,000 cancer deaths every year./Children are the most vulnerable to this as they are exposed to the risk of ear infection, asthma attacks, which affect their respiratory tract./Common culprits/Formaldehyde is used in plywood, particle board and glues. It's found in most cabinets, carpets and walls. Formaldehyde is regularly brought into homes in grocery bags; it's even in some tissues and paper towels. Formaldehyde is also released in cigarette smoke and from fuel burning appliances./Benzene is a petrochemical; it's used in detergents, latex paints, oils, foams, dyes and rubber. It's common in building material, exhaust fumes, and especially in cigarette smoke. Benzene is even found in some pharmaceuticals and it's known to induce leukemia./Trichloroethylene, a central nervous system depressant, is found in paints, lacquers, carpet shampoos, spot removers and adhesives. It's also used in dry cleaning, although this is becoming less so. Since trichloroethylene has contaminated some of the water supply, it can also enter the air of your home from shower vapours./Carbon Monoxide is found in homes with gas stoves, and is regularly found in high concentrations with worn or poorly maintained furnaces. Carbon monoxide also enters homes with attached garages from car exhaust. In high levels, carbon monoxide can cause sudden death. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

IT College researcher's unique study,"Lucknow, Nov. 14 -- An Isabella Thoburn College researcher has undertaken a first-of-its-kind study in the city - she is monitoring pre and post Diwali indoor air quality to facilitate the way for safer ways to celebrate the festival. Nishat Fatima, a research assistant working under IT college assistant professor Alfred Lawrence, is engaged in this work./The air pollution during Diwali has been measured time and again. But, indoor air quality assessment will be done for the first time. It is relevant because mostly the children and the elderly spend a major part of their time inside the house and the data analysis will show the risks indoors./The firecrackers, when burnt, release various gaseous, toxic and metal polluters which make the air unfit for human respiration./""Inhalation of smoke from fireworks causes cough, fever and other complications and leads to acute eosiophilic pneumonia. The pollutants stay in the atmosphere for many hours and days which affect the indoor air. Keeping all the risk factors in mind, we have undertaken the project whose findings will pave the way for precautions and solutions,"" says Fatima, who did M Tech from Integral University./In this study, they will be monitoring carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, carbon dioxide, etc in houses of Lucknow during Diwali. She said, ""Before selection of the house for monitoring, we have drawn November- specific wind diagram from the data of wind speed and direction for the city as the wind carries pollutants into the houses through doors and windows. We have selected a house near Thakurganj in the direction of wind."" Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Diwali smoke likely to trigger health problems,"New Delhi, Nov. 15 -- Delhi failed to learn its lesson yet again./The deadly fog that had enveloped the city a week in advance did not deter Delhiites from bursting crackers and adding a deadly mix of soot, metals and chemicals into the already polluted air./The fireworks Delhi witnessed this Diwali are unprecedented in terms of increase in air pollution and are likely to cause serious respiratory and cardiac disorders./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Wednesday said the quantum of particulate matter less than 10 microns in size or PM 10 doubled this Diwali compared to last year. SK Tyagi of CPCB said the quantum of nitrogen oxide also went up by 50 to 75 per cent./Dr Randeep Guleria, head of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, said, ""The increase is significant. These (PM 10) are fine particles. People inhaling such air are likely to suffer from acute bronchitis, asthma and heart troubles.""/PM 10 particles are small enough to be inhaled and accumulate in the respiratory system./""Thick, black smoke from vehicles, dust particles picked up by the wind, ash and soot are all particulate matter. They could be anything - iron, zinc, lead, nickel. The rise this Diwali is certainly alarming. The elderly, children and those suffering from breathing and cardiac disorders are most vulnerable,"" Tyagi said./After the smoggy conditions - from October 27 to November 8 - led to increased pollution levels, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) concluded that the Capital cannot afford more pollution./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director in-charge of the air pollution and transportation programme at the CSE, said, ""There is no room for more pollution this winter. We need focused and aggressive action to control air pollution to protect public health.""/Having studied data prepared by Central Pollution Control Board and Delhi Pollution Control Committee, she said, ""According to CPCB data, overall sulphur dioxide levels show a decline but the peak level has increased.""/""DPCC data shows that the levels of particulate matter less than 2.5 micron in size are 6 times higher than the standard level. There is no data to show how toxic chemicals and metals in crackers have added to the toxicity of the air. Diwali pollution has happened when Delhi's air is already saturated after the recent severe smog episode,"" she said./""Don't mistake the bright sunny morning - an unusual phenomenon a day after Diwali - for improved pollution levels in the Capital. Crackers have caused more pollution this year. The share of less noisy ones has gone up,"" she said./There's, however, good news on the noise front. Of the nine locations at which CPCB monitored noise levels, Mayur Vihar phase II and Dilshad Garden have registered decrease. At all other locations, noise levels have remained the same compared to last Diwali./DPCC undertook real time ambient air quality monitoring at six locations - RK Puram, Mandir Marg, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Civil Lines and IGI Airport.

Happy days in village that didn't burn stubble,"ANSA, Nov. 23 -- Bhai Desa, a village in this district, has tried cutting the level of air pollution instead of burning its paddy stubble after harvest./When smoke from the fields on fire had been causing smog up to Delhi, Bhai Desa ranked on top in the district for playing it safe with the environment. ""Bhai Desa didn't burn more than 95% of its paddy stubble this season,"" said chief agriculture officer Paramjit Singh Dutt. Impressed, the agriculture department decided to teach farmers how to protect their wheat seeds from diseases before sowing./On Wednesday, district chief agriculture officer Dutt, assistant plant protection officer Jagtar Singh Brar, and other officers were at the village, to give training to more than 70 farmers. They now know how to protect the wheat crop from fungus-by dipping the seeds in a medicinal liquid before sowing./The deputy commissioner and a team including the chief agriculture officer (CAO) had selected a few villages, including Bhai Desa and provided them with the Happy seeder machine to collect the stubble for sale instead of burning it up. Farmers then gathered the stubble from Bhai Desa, Jhanda Khurd, Nandgarh, Smao, Beroke Khurd, and Rali villages./""Bhai Desa didn't burn more than 95% of its paddy stubble this season, and looking at it, we started training its farmers about the safe techniques of sowing wheat,"" said CAO Pa ramjit Singh Dutt. ""We could manage only one Happy seeder, that too with the efforts of the deputy commissioner.""/Farmers from many other villages, on their own, managed to sell paddy stubble at the Moga biomass plant./Mansa's biomass plant at Khokhar Khurd is yet to open but on request from the agriculture department, it purchased stubble for Rs 120 a quintal from the farmers who had received training and the services of Happy seeder.

Centre terms smog as extreme pollution,"New Delhi, Dec. 2 -- The Centre has described the smog that recently engulfed the Capital as ""an extreme pollution episode"" and blamed ""both man and meteorological conditions"" for its effects./The government has admitted such conditions led to ""increased frequency of respiratory-related asthmatic troubles"" in the elderly and children and advised them to ensure reduced exposure to minimise adverse effects during smog periods./The union ministry of earth sciences has done a scientific analysis of the thick smog cover that covered the Capital for 12 days (October 26 to November 8, this year)./""It was due to short-range transport of smoke from Punjab and Haryana. The smoke caused by burning of crop stubble in the harvesting season of 'kharif' moved towards Delhi due to favourable northerly winds as determined from back trajectory analysis and air quality forecasting,"" the study says./At a meeting with the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority, officials from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have decided to enforce a ban on the burning of farm waste./The study says low wind speed in and around Delhi prevented the dispersion of smoke particles. These particles remained trapped in the layer above the ground./""Incrementally, diesel-operated urban transport adds to the air pollution levels that reduces the visibility further,"" it says. But after the wind speed got back to normal, the pollution levels dipped./The ministry has said the government is already taking all possible steps to discourage diesel-run public transport, encourage CNG-run vehicles and enforce stricter emission norms./The Delhi government has already decided to install electronic display boards for air quality index, issue smog alerts and health advisory across the Capital.

Here's how to fight the smog,"New Delhi, Dec. 5 -- Do you of late feel breathless and exhausted the moment you step out?/Well, it's because thick layers of dense smoke and fog have invaded the city. As per the Indian Meteorological Department, this time round the smog - a harmful mixture of smoke, fog and air pollutants - has been thicker and prolonged in the city due to the rising levels of air pollution coupled with lower wind motion. While individually you can't do much to correct either, protecting yourself from the harmful effects of smog is certainly in your own hand./Who are at risk?/Smog is harmful for everyone but can be fatal for people with pre-existing lung ailments. ""It's particularly dangerous for ones with chronic lung conditions such as asthma, bronchitis as well as for those suffering from coronary artery disease. For the rest, there's a risk of chest infections, acute asthmatic attacks, heart attacks and even heart failure in worse cases,"" says Dr Ashok Seth, president, Cardiological Society of India./Symptoms to watch out for/Smog essentially damages your lungs and heart. If you are suffering from any of the following symptoms, it's time to sit up and take charge of your health:/Eye, nose and throat irritation/Difficulty in breathing, coughing and wheezing/Worsening of symptoms for people who have lung diseases like asthma, COPD and sinusitis/Reduced lung capacity, feeling tired and drained out/Lowered resistance to infections/Increased heartbeat, headache/Precautions to take/Don't over exert yourself, avoid rigorous work out./Avoid exposing yourself in heavy traffic for long hours. If you must, then keep your mouth and nose covered with air filter masks./Avoid going out at night in cold weather. If you have to go out then protect yourself well with warm clothing especially covering chest and head./Do not lift or push heavy objects (like pushing a car) in cold weather. Running out of breath can be dangerous./Do not go for early morning walks in extremely cold weather. Shift your walk timing to when the sun is out, like midday./Keep indoors warm at night with heaters. Keep a flat bowl of water in the rooms so that humidity of the air can be maintained by evaporation. Use a purifier and humidifier to clean, purify and humidify the indoor air./Get vaccinations against pneumonia and viral infections before the winter turns worse./Be regular with intake of medicines, and check-ups prescribed by your doctor./(Inputs from Fortis Escorts Heart Institute and Indian Health Organisation)/(Inputs from Indian Health Organisation) Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

DON'T SNEEZE AT AIRBORNE ALLERGIES,"Kolkata, Dec. 5 -- With winter having arrived, rhinitis cases in Kolkata are on the rise. Rhinitis is caused by a number of factors which are triggered by seasonal change and an increased particulate movement in the atmosphere./But what do you do to prevent it? It is important to protect oneself from allergens and irritants that become active in the atmosphere with the advent of winter in November-December. ""Rhinitis is caused by two kinds of factors - allergens and viral infections. Both of these factors start working at a faster pace during winter months because of the change in season. Thus an increased number of rhinitis cases are reported at this time,"" said Dr Alok Gopal Ghosal, director of the National Allergy Asthma Bronchitis Institute./""Compared to the summer season, during winters, the suspended particulate matter (SPL) and respirable particulate matter (RPL) concentrations increase in the air. It affects the children and old people the most,"" he added./While for some people some elements may act as an allergen, for others it may not. Being affected by the disease is dependant on one's body system and sensitiveness of mucous membrane. ""Some people get irritated and fall ill at the slightest contact with allergens like cotton and pollens. For some others, these may not create any problem even when exposed to them in huge quantities,"" said Dr Partha Sarathi Bhattacharya./Rhinitis symptoms begin with irritation in the eyes and nose, suffering from watery eyes and sneezing frequently. Bhattacharya added, ""These symptoms are followed by an acute rhinitis, which may take a lot of time to get cured. Those who are prone to develop these problems must take preventive steps and drugs before the problem sets in. Doctors advise dosages of nasal sprays and medicines to protect those prone to catch illness.""/Sometimes, temperature variation in the immediate atmosphere also may act as a trigger behind such health conditions. ""During November and December, the atmospheric temperature sees a constant rise and fall. People tend to switch on fans and air conditioners when they feel a bit warm even in these months. Thus, they get caught in the weather change and fall ill,"" said Ghosal./Running nose affects many during winter months. While at some places the movement of allergens is increased, at others it does not, due to a range of reasons. Thus, in some places winter creates quite a flutter with its accompanying diseases. Kolkata, and largely West Bengal, is among those places where the allergens become hyperactive. Those prone to winter illnesses especially need to take care and protect themselves./Ghosal said, ""Air pollution caused by smoke and other pollutants play a major role in taking down people with a running nose. Healthy people, who do not have hypersensitive mucous membranes are also affected by pollutants.""/Doctors thus advise people to stay extremely cautious during these seasonal changes and take adequate protective measures. Once rhinitis takes a serious turn, it may lead to problem like choking of the nose and voice and in more serious cases, it may require a person to be admitted in hospital for medical attention.

From autumn to spring,"India, Dec. 16 -- The autumn years of one's life should ideally be those in which you can really do pretty much what you please. But, only if you are in good health. And on this front, the news is not so encouraging. The Global Burden of Disease Study, 2010, reveals that the average Indian man's life expectancy at birth has increased by nearly 15 years and for women by 18 years in the last four decades. While this is a positive sign, the downside is that the number of years they remain healthy is much less. An Indian male can expect to be in good health only till he reaches the age of about 54 years and will have to battle various ailments for the last nine years of his life. The average Indian woman is likely to spend the last 10.4 years of her life in poor health. Household air pollution from chulhas (especially in rural areas), smoking/second hand smoke, high blood pressure, childhood underweight and low fruit intake have been identified as the main factors contributing to poor health./For India whose greying population is likely to double by 2026, according to recent population projections, this study underlines the urgent need to tackle what has till now been largely a grey area really. With an abysmally low doctor-patient ratio - one doctor for 1,953 people, health services in India are not able to effectively tackle even basic illnesses, leave alone the more complex old age ones like dementia or Alzheimer's. What's more, senior citizens are rarely eligible for medical insurance. In the past, the elderly got some care from the family. But with the rise of nuclear families today, the cases of the elderly facing abuse, neglect and exploitation at the hands of family members are on the rise. But such cases often go unreported either to uphold family honour or because they are perceived as domestic matters./Though the National Programme for Healthcare of the Elderly 2010, committed to improve the national response to the health of the elderly, is comprehensive in theory, the elderly are still considered by many as a liability, people who have outlived their utility value. This is why the State has to step in to ensure the protection of those who are no longer able to help themselves. It needs to focus more on geriatric care, assisted living and avenues of employment for the elderly. These will help make old age that much less grey and melancholic.

"Pollution level rising, govt turns a blind eye","New Delhi, Dec. 18 -- The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has expressed ""deep shock"" at the findings of the new Global Burden of Disease (GBD) count. The findings say air pollution has become one of the top 10 killers in the world - a threefold increase in the last 10 years./A CSE analysis says as much as 65 per cent of total air pollution deaths occur in Asia and close to quarter of this in India./A global initiative involving the World Health Organisation (WHO), the GBD tracks deaths and illnesses from all causes across the world. Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE's executive director-research and advocacy and head of its air pollution unit, said: ""We need aggressive and most stringent action to protect public health.""/In Delhi, the level of particulate matter less than 10 micron in size (PM10) has increased by 47 per cent between 2000 and 2011, while the level of nitrogen dioxide has gone up by 57 per cent./The level of particulate matter less than 2.5 micron in size (PM2.5) is also exceeding the standard by 4-6 times./""High levels of carbon monoxide, ozone and benzene levels are also playing havoc,"" said Roychowdhury./Despite all this, the Delhi government has not been quick in implementing immediate winter measures - part of a fiveyear plan to improve the Capital's air quality - which it had announced more than a month ago./By now, the government should have put in place the immediate measures and submitted a status report./Referring to the GBD data, Roychowdhury said: ""Days of complacency are over. We must act urgently to reduce public health risks, especially for children, elderly and poor.""/The Delhi government and the CSE have prepared a 10point draft action plan to meet the desired air quality in the Capital by 2017./""We have discussed the 20page draft and almost finalised it.

MAKE NO BONES ABOUT PLACE IN THE SUN,"Kolkata, Dec. 19 -- More than 70% people in Bengal suffer from some form of Vitamin-D deficiency. Minors in the state seem to be more vulnerable to this deficiency with 82% of those below 15 years of aged suspected to be affected by it. Leave alone the general populace, 92% doctors in India too suffer from vitamin D deficiency syndromes./These facts have come up in a research by a team of doctors from the state-run SSKM hospital. Alarmed by the upward trend in vitamin D deficiency cases, doctors are trying to find out the causes leading to it and ways to control the same before they turn into a larger problem for the masses./""Vitamin-D deficiency is caused mostly because of lifestyle and dietary reasons. Previously, Vitamin-D deficiency affected mostly slum dwellers, as they do not have a good diet. But we were surprised to find that people from affluent sections of society have increasingly started suffering from the syndrome because of their tendency to stay indoors in air-conditioned rooms and move around in air-conditioned vehicles,"" said Deep Dutta, one of the SSKM doctors who is part of the research team./Doctors say that people who wear long robes and keep their head and body fully covered at all times of the day are more prone to vitamin D deficiency. The dark skinned are also vulnerable to this deficiency because of low pigmentation in it, doctors say./""The skin should be exposed to sunlight for a minimum of 10 minutes daily, ideally between 10 am and 3 pm, when sunrays are the strongest. We should avoid applying sunscreen lotions as it reduces the skin's capacity to produce Vitamin-D. The traditional practice of applying mustard oil on the skin ensures that proper amount of Vitamin-D is produced by the skin, leading to strengthened bones,"" said Dutta./Doctors recommend a calcium-rich diet, including milk, fish and egg, to reduce chances of vitamin D deficiency./""It has been seen that vitamin D deficiency syndromes are stronger in communities that do not consume non-vegetarian food items as part of their diet,"" said Nilanjan Sengupta, associate professor of endocrinology at NRS Medical College and Hospital./Vitamin-D deficiency can lead to rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. These are conditions in which bone tissues do not properly mineralise leading to soft and fragile bones. There is thus a high risk of fracture among these people at the slightest pressure on the bones and they also suffer from body pain and skeletal deformities. Ache in muscles is also a result of vitamin D deficiency./Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with diabetes, hypertension, depression, obesity, heart diseases and cancer./""We suspect that Vitamin-D deficiency might lead to colon and breast cancer. But we do not have any definitive data to substantiate this. We are working on it,"" said Dutta./Doctors say that Vitamin-D deficiency also occurs when the kidneys are unable to convert Vitamin-D to its active form or the digestive tract is unable to adequately absorb the vitamin./""Vitamin-D molecules are activated in the kidney, which is not possible if the kidney fails. In such situations, we prescribe active Vitamin-D capsules to rejuvenate the kidney,"" Dutta said./Doctors said that Vitamin-D deficiency also depends on environmental factors like cloud cover and air pollution and can happen because of hereditary disorders, too. It can cause asthma among children./""Pregnant mothers with Vitamin-D deficiency can have premature deliveries or can give birth to underweight baby. Children born to such women should be fed with packaged milk to supplement calcium from mother's milk,"" said Dasarathi Sarkar, former professor of endocrinology in SSKM hospital./Doctors say Vitamin-D deficiency could be identified in minors soon after they start walking./""Vitamin-D deficiency can result in impaired growth and short height. Skeletal deformities in their forearms, ribcage, breastbone and spinal cord are common. Positioning or bracing can completely reverse the syndrome. Some skeletal deformities may require corrective surgery,"" said Sarkar./Surgical costs for skeletal deformities can cost anywhere above R50,000 upwards depending on the type of deformity one suffers.

Deaths due to respiratory illnesses on rise: Report,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 3 -- The bad quality of air, which leads to acute respiratory ailments, was the biggest cause of deaths due to diseases in 2011, a government study released on Tuesday said./The Statistical Handbook of India 2013 says 2,429 people died owing to respiratory diseases in 2011, much more than the deaths caused by water-borne diseases and Japanese encephalitis. However, deaths due to other diseases such as heart ailments and cancer have not been counted./But, other international studies have also cited rising population as an increasing cause of deaths in India./The global burden of disease (GBD) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) released in December says air pollution is the sixth most dangerous killer in south Asia. ""Around 65% of the air pollution deaths occur in Asia and close to quarter of this happen in India,"" the report says./The government study had confirmed the findings, saying 2.63 crore people in India suffer from acute respiratory disease, the causes of which are indoor pollution and rising air pollution levels./A study by Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) on the impact of indoor air pollution has estimated that 51,66084,731 post-neonatal deaths occur in the country every year, which is 27.5% of the total such deaths./The TERI said the deaths are avoidable, if the biomass fuels are replaced by safe fuels and amount of smoke generated is reduced./The Central Pollution Control Board data for 2010 shows that air pollution has risen in all 257 cities and towns where air quality is monitored./In Indian cities, except 10, the air quality was reported to be above the national ambient air quality standards./Although the data is minimal indication, the report said maximum number of respiratory related deaths took place in West Bengal followed by Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh./However, many states such as Bihar, Assam and Chandigarh did not record deaths under this category.

It's a burning issue in Dharavi,"umbai, Feb. 4 -- Winter worsens air pollution in the city, but for Ateeq Shaikh, 44, it's a year-long hazard. Sitting in his sixth-floor flat at Diamond Apartments, Mahim (East), with all windows closed through the day, Shaikh blames the poor air quality for his wife Rehana's asthma, which eventually led to her death./Shaikh, a businessman, is concerned about the effect the pollution has on his 75-year-old mother, whose eyes burn and water. ""I have lived here for three decades, and it is a nightmare. When I open the windows, I get a headache and my mother's eyes water,"" he said./For many Mumbaiites, living in and around Dharavi is nothing short of hell. One of the largest slums in Asia, though Dharavi does not have a major industry, it is home to many scrap recycling units and small-scale industries. It houses tanneries, recycling units, pottery kilns and plastic washing units, making it one of the most polluted places in the city./In the last pollution study of Dharavi by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in November 2010, 551.7 microgram/metre cube (ug/m3) of average suspended particulate matter (SPM) was found, a figure more than five times higher than the permissible limit set by the Central Pollution Control Board./Though pollution is not new, it's getting worse, say residents, pointing to the waste incineration on Sion-Mahim Link Road, which they allege has become acute. Behind a fleet of illegally parked trucks and tempos, an assortment of waste is incinerated, which abuts a huge swathe of mangroves. Every night, the illegal incineration of electronic waste, cable wires, copper wires, PVC pipes, plastic, paper and chemical dyes throws up thick plumes of odorous, toxic smoke around Naya Nagar, Mahim (east), Dharavi T-junction and Shahu Nagar./It's not just the smoke. ""Pollutants from workshops, vehicles and the adjacent scrap yard in Mahim add to the pollution,"" Shaikh said. Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist and head, Neeri, Mumbai, said: ""Studies have showed that the maximum variety of pollutants is found in Dharavi. These are released from tanneries, plastic units, scrap yards and through incineration of solvents and e-waste,"" he said./Pollution from the scrap recycling units and kilns spread to Mahim, Sion and Bandra. A comparison of the January 2012 and January 2013 pollution readings by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board in Sion shows that the average respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) has doubled from 101.53 ug/m3 last year to 208.89 ug/m3 this year./This pollution can lead to recurring instances of bronchitis and other pulmonary disorders, said Dr Jalil Parkar, pulmonologist, Lilavati hospital. ""In an area like Dharavi, where pollutants are not dispersed quickly, asthma patients suffer from frequent attacks,"" he said./The Dharavi Businessmen's Welfare Association (DBWA), a body of traders with around 750 members, many of whom own recycling units, is tired of being blamed for the pollution. ""A lot of electronic waste, cables and chemicals that don't wash off easily from drums are burnt. Our association is fed up as the plastic units are blamed for it,"" said Gireesh Kasat, treasurer of DBWA./Shaikh Abu Khalid, former president of DBWA and long-time resident of Mahim, said that despite repeated complaints, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is doing little. ""The MPCB and BMC should stop the incineration activities. DBWA has also written to the police, but the activities stop for a while and begin again,"" Khalid said./The BMC says it conducts raids and has sent a letter to MPCB for help to stop the incineration. ""Of late, the waste being burnt has reduced,"" said SN Ughade, assistant ward commissioner, G-north ward./""A lot of municipal solid waste is incinerated near Dharavi, but we will look into the incineration of industrial waste,"" said Achyut Nandwate, sub-regional officer, MPCB, in charge of monitoring Dharavi.

"Cars, motorbikes smog up the city","umbai, Feb. 5 -- In a city that's always on the move, it's hardly surprising that vehicular emissions are one of the major sources of air pollution in the city. And even though only 23% of the population uses private vehicles, the number of privately-owned two-wheelers and cars outstrip public transport vehicles./In a span of five years, up to 2012, the city added five lakh new private vehicles to its roads - from 15 lakh to 20.35 lakh - reducing peak hour traffic speed to a mere 10kmph./But the ill-effects of vehicles crowding city roads goes beyond just traffic snarls- it's affecting your health and making the air you breathe hazardous. Rush-hour traffic congestion leads to fuel wastage and increased emission of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM). These pollutants enter your lungs, weaken your respiratory organs and can lead to respiratory illnesses. Experts have warned that the proliferation of private vehicles will only degrade the air further./Recent studies by environmental agencies paint a grim picture of air pollution levels in the city, and highlight the contributory role played by excessive use of motor vehicles./The latest ambient air quality monitoring data recorded by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) at Sion shows that the average NO2 level in January this year - 171.11 micrograms/metre cube (ug/m3) - is twice the permissible level of 80 ug/m3. On January 26, the NO2 levels reached a whopping 229 ug/m3, the highest this year./National Environmental Engineering Research Institute's (NEERI) six-city study on air quality in November 2010 showed that vehicular pollution is the biggest source of NO2 in Mumbai./NEERI looked at air quality at seven locations in the city - Colaba, Dadar, Dharavi, Andheri, Khar, Mahul and Mulund - revealing that Dadar, one of the major junctions with roads leading to the eastern, western and southern parts of the city, witnessed the highest concentration of NO2, CO, particulate matter (PM) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) in a 24-hour cycle./The study also revealed that maximum NO2 and CO2 emission load was contributed by heavy-duty diesel vehicles./Air pollution becomes a bigger concern in winter, when the concentration of pollutants reaches its peak, as the colder air traps pollutants close to the ground and prevents them from dispersing easily. The haze that forms over the city in the mornings is actually a blanket of pollutants, and can be very harmful./""Unlike summer and monsoon, the sea breeze is not as strong during winters. This prevents dispersion of RSPM and dust into the atmosphere,"" said Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist and head, NEERI, Mumbai./The major infrastructural development of the city is also to blame for rising pollution, and this will only get worse in coming years, experts said. ""With several infrastructure projects under construction in the city, the concentration of dust and RSPM levels are bound to increase,"" said Kumar/To help counter this, NEERI is going to experiment with a model called the Diffused Air Pollution Reduction method, to disperse pollutants from small sections on busy roads. Air filters will be fitted on road dividers, to facilitate the dispersion of pollutants./""With the increase in housing societies on arterial roads such as LBS Marg, the vehicular load on these roads will shoot up. NEERI is soon going to run a pilot test of the project. Solar powered blowers are one of the equipment that can be used to reduce concentration of pollutants,"" said Kumar.

Mumbai's mounting pile of trouble,"UMBAI, Feb. 6 -- As night temperatures fall in January, the city is enveloped in a thick haze of dust and pollutants in the early morning./The fires that dot the streets on winter nights may lend some warmth, but the waste burned to light those fires - both the small ones and large-scale incineration at rubbish at dumping grounds - result in poisonous emissions, making these fires one of biggest sources of air pollution./Mumbai in winter is the most polluted metropolis in the country after Delhi, according to a six-city study by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)./Leaf litter, municipal solid waste, roadside refuse, plastic or even highly toxic waste is burnt in the open, emitting carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and hydrocarbons (HC). These gases mix with the atmosphere and enter into our lungs, inviting a host of respiratory ailments./Burning of tyres, wires, battery cells, wood, paper and a host of other things releases toxins that result in bronchospasms. ""Our windpipe gets affected adversely and we can also suffer from upper and lower respiratory tract bronchitis,"" said Dr Jalil Parkar, a pulmonogist from Lilavati hospital, cautioning people to avoid areas where open burning occurs./The Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000, declare open burning to be illegal, but it is being increasingly used at the local community level to burn refuse that the municipal corporation does not collect on time./Studies on emissions from open burning by NEERI, across seven locations in the city, show that the problem is at its worst in Dadar and Dharavi. The November 2010 study, covering Colaba, Dadar, Dharavi, Khar, Andheri, Mahul and Mulund revealed that Dharavi emits 144.70 kilogram/day of CO while Dadar emits 144.09 kg/day of CO./Environmental activists said that even the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) sweepers indulge in open burning of leaf-litter, especially during winters./""Many look at waste burning as a simple solution to get rid of rubbish and BMC sweepers are no exception. There are times when waste from municipal garbage collection bins are burnt, releasing air-borne pollutants into the locality,"" said Rishi Agarwal, environmental activist./The NEERI study reveals that around 3% of solid waste generated from each ward is openly burnt and about 10% of total solid waste is burnt at landfill sites. In a year, open burning releases a whopping 2292 tonnes of CO, 734 tonnes of PM, 164 tonnes of Nitrogen Oxide (NO2) and 1173 tonnes of HC./The Railways also contribute to air pollution. Railway conservancy staff is supposed to collect garbage from tracks and platforms and dispose it in BMC bins, but open burning of waste can be seen on major suburban railway stations on the central line such as Dadar, Thane, Ghatkopar./Vidyadhar Malegaonkar, chief public relations officer, central railways said, ""We don't allow open burning, but it is a fact that it does happen at some places. The Railways is not necessarily responsible for it. We award contracts to rag picker co-operatives to clean tracks.""/Meanwhile Sandeep Silas, divisional railway manager, western railway, Mumbai division, said, ""The no-man's land in Dadar, which does not belong to either the central or western railways, might be used for burning waste. The contractors who pick up waste from stations dump it in BMC bins outside our stations. The waste between tracks on 29 suburban stations is collected in around 300 bags weighing 5 kilograms each.""

Clearing the air on killer pollution,"New Delhi, Feb. 10 -- Just when most of us city folks had come to terms with smog and air pollution doing unspeakable things to our lungs, a massive study conclusively shows that the damage begins even before we are born./Women who live in polluted areas have smaller, lower weight babies than they would have had if they had fed on clean air. The higher the pollution and the longer the mother's exposure to air toxins, the lower was the weight of their baby, showed the study of more than 3 million births across nine countries, excluding India./Apart from delayed development milestones - growth, speech, movement, learning etc - low birth weight babies are more prone to infections and death in the first five years of life. The majority, of course, survive but have a higher risk of developing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease as adults./Though the study, published in the Journal of Environmental Health Perspectives, focused on airborne particulate matter from traffic fumes, several studies have shown that indoor pollution from wood fires used for cooking in rural India is equally responsible for underweight - birthweight less than 2.5 kg - babies that account for one in three births in India./This does not mean that pregnant women and those planning to have a baby should move to a shack by the sea and live on seafood and fresh air. What they need to do is minimise exposure to avoidable pollutants, cigarette smoke and vehicular fumes being some more easily avoidable ones./How air pollutions mucks up your health, both in the womb and in the real world, depends on the nature and concentration of the damaging chemicals and duration of exposure. Air toxins cause stinging and watering eyes, nose irritation , scratchy throat, headaches, nausea and tiredness, signs most commuters are familiar with. Such acute effects, however, are usually immediate and go away when exposure to the pollutant ends./In susceptible people, respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia and aggravation of asthma and emphysema may also occur. Children are at greater risk because their airways are small and they are generally more active outdoors, as are people over 65 years, who have existing diseases generally weaken immunity. Over time, it causes decreased lung capacity, chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys./How each pollutants affects the lungs is different, but together they make a toxic cocktail. Gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO2, from coal fires, vehicles, power plants, petroleum refineries) cause lung irritation, wheezing, chest tightness and lung damage, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2, from vehicles, electric utilities, and fossil fires) causes infections, lung irritation and symptoms of cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Carbon monoxide (CO, from vehicles and fossil fires) causes headaches, lowered alertness, impaired foetal development and in concentrated doses, death. Worldwide, 4 billion people, mostly women, cook on wood, coal and dung fires, breathing in 200 chemicals and 14 different carcinogens./Solid particles (suspended particulate matter from vehicles, power plants and wood stoves) work by settling inside the lungs and paralysing the cilia, small hair-like outgrowth of cells that expel pollutants through coughing and sneezing. This results in pollutants settling inside the lungs and causing permanent damage./Along with heart attacks and cancers, pollution is leading cause of death and contributes to 40% of all deaths, said a study at Cornell University some years ago. The study, on how worsening environment and growing population affected the spread of diseases and infections like malaria, tuberculosis and salmonella, concluded that pollution causes 62 million deaths each year./The numbers may be debatable, but the damage to health is not. Sure, we need clean air laws, but till then, we have to start by avoiding polluting and pollutants as much as we can. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

SOMETHING IN THE AIR,"New Delhi, Feb. 17 -- Breathing cleaner air not only saves you from asthma attacks, bronchitis and other respiratory infections, but also protects you from seasonal influenza, which is the leading cause of cough, colds and fever in the young and old alike./Half of urban India breathes air with pollutants that exceed the permissible limit, with one- third of them living in critically polluted areas. In fact, air pollution ranked as the fifth largest killer in India, killing an estimated 6 lakh people prematurely, according to the findings of Global Burden of Disease report, jointly released by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Indian Council of Medical Research and other agencies in the Capital last week./The polluted air not only aggravates symptoms among people with previous history of chest infections such as asthma, bronchitis, respiratory distress syndrome etc., but also makes healthy people prone to developing various respiratory tract allergies and infections over a period of time./""Air pollution is known to have adverse health effects, but it is impossible to escape it as it is all over, with our general air quality being low. It does increase the risk of respiratory infections and allergies manifold, especially among children. Children with low immunity, low birth weight and other conditions are at a higher risk,"" said Dr VK Paul, head of department, pediatrics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./Continuous exposure to the most common air pollutants - sulfur-oxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter - lowers immunity and increases the risk of seasonal infections, like H1N1, popular known as swine flu./""The number of admissions in our hospital goes up by 20% during winters when pollution levels are higher due to smog and thick air that is difficult to breathe. Mostly we get cases of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia aggravated by air pollution. There is no treatment as such; we put them on anti-allergics and anti-biotics. In extreme cases, intensive care is required,"" said Dr SP Byotra, chairman, department of internal medicine, Ganga Ram Hospital./Since locking ourselves indoors is not possible, doctors advise precautions while stepping out./""Keep your nose and mouth covered when going out during early morning or evenings; avoid dusty and smoky places; keep inhaler always handy and try and have warm liquids as much as possible,"" said Dr Byotra./Same goes for children. ""It's not possible to move kids to cleaner environments and they will not stop going out, so the best would be to let them be. Be a little cautious when pollution is at its peak, and we also manage high-risk children with appropriate medicines,"" said Dr Paul. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Indoor air pollution kills a million people every year in India,"New Delhi, Feb. 22 -- Over a million people in India die every year because of indoor air pollution, among highest in the world, but the country's top advisory body the Planning Commission wants more epidemiological studies to agree for national indoor air pollution norms./Indoor air pollution is bigger killer than outdoor air pollution in India with the recent global burden of diseases report listing the former as second biggest killer and latter as fifth largest. Around 1.3 million people died of indoor air pollution in 2010 whereas death because of outdoor air pollution was around 6.20 lakh. Indoor air pollution is second biggest killer after high blood pressure in India, the report said./Unlike many western countries, India does not have any norm for indoor air pollution, which mandates emission norms for home appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and bread toasters and a limit beyond which dirty air inside homes can be bad for one's health./The World Health Organisation (WHO) has prescribed 20 micro grams in cubic meter (ug/m3) of air for particulate matter as a norm for indoor air pollution. In India, the average indoor air pollution is 375 ug/m3 and the prime contributor for this is burning of solid fuels, says a study done by Indian Council for Medical Research./High indoor air pollution had caught attention of policy-makers recently and environmentalists wanted the central government to prescribe national indoor air pollution norms on the lines of national ambient air norms./Country's pollution watchdog, the Central Pollution Control Board, and public health research body, ICMR wanted the planning commission to agree for national indoor air pollution norms during the 12th five year plan./The plan panel rejected the idea. ""They (plan panel) wanted more epidemiological studies to be done to confirm the adverse health impact of indoor air pollution,"" said Kalpana Balakrishnan of the Sri Ramchandra Medical College and Research Institute, an ICMR affiliated body./There is no dearth of Indian studies on adverse impact of indoor air pollution on one's health, especially the women. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in a recent study said that 27.5 % of under-five infant mortality in India is because of indoor air pollution. Another study said that about 80 % of women in India are affected by indoor air pollution./Rise in air pollution has direct co-relation with death. The ICMR study in Chennai on around 1,200 people showed an increase of 0.3 % to 0.6 % in mortality with rise in particulate matter pollution by 10 ug/m3. When half of Indian homes still use smoke-filled chullas, imagining its adverse health impact is no rocket science. That is not the plan panel's view.

India staring at killer lifestyle epidemic,"New Delhi, March 5 -- We have a killer lifestyle. Today, more Indians are dying of lifestyle diseases than of infections - a reverse of the situation 20 years ago. Heart ailments are the biggest killers, followed by lung disease and stroke, show data from Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2010 (GBD 2010) being released Tuesday morning./Unhealthy diet and indoor air pollution, mostly from cooking with wood fire and charcoal in poorly ventilated homes, are the two biggest disease and death risks./And if bad diet and pollution don't get you, roads will. Indian roads are the most dangerous in the world, with road injuries among the leading causes of death, show the data from 187 countries./""The menace of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, lung disease, depression, and road injuries is mounting in the form of premature deaths and disability,"" said Dr Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. ""Much of this is avoidable through policies that promote healthy living.""/Gender violence has battered women's health. Suicides among young Indian women have doubled in the last 20 years, with deaths attributed to ""self harm"" among 15-49 year olds rising from under 5% in 1990 to 10% in 2010./Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the GBD 2010 is a collaborative project led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington./India's big success has been in more than halving children's deaths from infectious diseases. Deaths from diarrhoea, lung infections, measles, malnutrition, and meningitis among 1-4 years old fell from 8 lakh in 1990 to 3 lakh in 2010./More and more children are eating better. Childhood underweight, which was the third biggest death risk in 1990, dropped to number 11 in 2010./Despite the gains, India lags its South Asian neighbours on some parameters. Though life expectancy at birth jumped to 65.2 in 2010 from 58.3 in 1990, people in neighbouring countries are living longer.

"Air pollution levels critical, small cities take the lead","New Delhi, March 7 -- India's high economic growth has given its cities a major health concern - rising air pollution. It is no more a concern for big cities alone. Smaller towns are getting affected by the malaise at a much faster pace, says the latest report of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./The pollution regulator's new data for 2010 shows that smaller cities such as Solapur in Maharashtra, Rajkot in Gujarat, Yamunanagar and Faridabad in Haryana, Ghaziabad and Meerut in UP, Paonta Sahib in Himachal, Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh and Nagaon in Assam have followed the footprints of bigger cities when it comes to air pollution./This time, Delhi is not ranked most polluted city in any of the three parameters of pollutants - sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) - measured. Delhi, within two years, has been replaced by Gwalior in case of particulate matter and Howrah for NO2. In 2008, Chandni Chowk in Delhi topped the chart./This doesn't mean that air in the national capital is getting cleaner. The rise of particulate matter pollution in smaller cities is faster than that in Delhi./Only two cities - Malapuram in Kerala and Madurai in Tamil Nadu - of the 190 cities monitored for air pollution across India could claim to have clean air in 2010, the report said. All other cities have either high or critical level of one of these pollutants, mostly particulate matter. In fact, 99% of 400 locations under scanner in 2010 reported high or critical levels of particulate matter. In 2008, the percentage was around 70./Anumita Roy Chaudhary of the Centre for Science and Environment pointed out that in majority of the cities' air pollution levels had increased at a rapid pace. ""The cities, earlier with low levels, now have moderate levels and those with moderate have high or critical levels of particulate matter,"" she told HT. The trend in India's air pollution level has been reported in studies with the recent Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) report that stated that air pollution was the fifth biggest reason for deaths in India./Aaron Cohen, who led the expert group on air pollution, described the situation in India as ""grave"" and said air pollution causes about 20% of deaths due to lung cancer and 6% deaths due to high blood pressure./The report shows Delhi's satellite towns - Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad - were following in the Capital's footsteps with rising levels of particulate matter pollution in the last four years. In fact, Ghaziabad has more particulate pollution than Delhi, the feat it achieved between 2008 and 2010. Noida and Faridabad are behind Delhi but are fast catching up./Chaudhary said most cities have failed to invest in its infrastructure and public transport leading to vehicular congestion, causing higher air pollution, a view concurred in the report.

Low-grade plastic affects health of workers: experts,"Navi Mumbai, April 14 -- Most people fail to realise that not only does plastic affect the environment, but also those who living near landfill sites or dumping grounds because of the air pollution it causes./""Low-micron bags are not even collected by rag pickers because they do not have a resale value. These are instead burnt near residential areas thus giving rise to health issues,"" said Suresh Patil, deputy municipal commissioner, zone 2 of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation./Direct handling of waste also affects the health of workers, as they often contract infections and chronic diseases./""Rag pickers contract skin infections while scavenging through waste. Disposal of waste requires special attention since it can lead to major health hazards, such as Hepatitis B and C, through wounds caused by discarded syringes,"" said Vrushali Mugdam of Stree Mukti Sanghatna, a non-governmental organisation that works with rag pickers./Experts asserted that waste must be segregated into dry and wet waste and then be disposed properly./""It is essential that at the household-level, proper segregation of waste is done. It should also be ensured that all organic matter is kept aside for composting,"" Mugdam added. Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Mumbai.

The clean air act on your lungs and mind,"New Delhi, April 28 -- For my teenage son, the perfect life is having free wi-fi everywhere - not just at hotels, airports, trains and museums, but also at sidewalk cafes and cabs. Apart from keeping you connected with work and friends, it allows you to download apps on the go that make it impossible for you to get lost even in a country like the Czech Republic where street names are unpronounceable and people take a while to understand you if you ask for a ""cheque"" instead of a ""bill""./My needs are more basic. The good life for me is being able to walk around past midnight unmolested and breathing in crisp, clean air in the middle of town. Of course, beer being cheaper than coca-cola is yet another plus - a Czech told me he'd rather his young son had beer than cola because at least he knew what went into a beer - but we won't go onto that just yet. We'll stick to clean air, which helps me pack in a lot more into my day and night and still get up rested the next morning./As much as outdoor air, it's polluted indoor air that does us in. The biggest trouble with poor indoor air quality is that you don't realise how bad it is till you're breathing clean air that clears up your head faster than stimulants. Unlike Delhi's more visible outdoor air pollution - the horror of its lung-wrecking potential hits you hardest when you spot the brown smog cloud hanging low over the city from your airplane while landing -- bad indoor air hurts you subtly. Most of us who work in closed offices are used to unexplained headache, eye, nose, or throat irritation, dry or itchy skin, difficulty in concentrating and tiredness, all of which disappear soon after you step out. I've experienced this firsthand, when the headaches I thought were stressinduced magically vaporised even when leaving office meant driving through roads choked with fumespouting traffic./The cause for sick offices is usually poor ventilation caused by too many people cramped together in air-conditioned spaces with little fresh air. This adds to carbon dioxide and humidity levels, which make you feel tired and sluggish. Add to that dirty ventilation ducts, pest dander, mould, lead in painted surfaces, and secondhand smoke and you have a toxic mix that slows you down both mentally and physically./Offices and schools are also the hotbeds of airborne infections, which is the reason why they are the first things shut down at the first threat of an outbreak. Influenza viruses can survive on hard surfaces such as desks, doorknobs, shared keyboards and books for two to eight hours, which means one infected person or child can infect up to a dozen others in one day./Then there are the long-term effects of breathing in stale air. Continuously breathing in unclean air slows the normal cleansing action of the lungs and results in pollutants embedding deep inside the lungs and reducing lung capacity. Over time, pollutants also damages the immune system, making you more prone to infections and allergies. Others at higher risk are people over 65 years and pregnant women./The solution, as usual, takes effort and time. For one, try to spend as much time as you can in open spaces, preferably near greenary and away from traffic. Next, work at building stamina and lung capacity by running, walking, swimming or simply going up and down the stairs several times a day. Quitting smoking lowers exposure to pollutants drastically -- it's stupid to spend money to add to lung trouble. The best option to clear your airways, of course, is a break away from work and traffic, even if it's for a weekend. And at the risk of offending your child, choose a wi-fi free destination to give your mind a break too. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Burning of leaves continues despite high court ban,"India, May 7 -- In spite of a high court ban on burning leaves, the practice continues unabated in the Millennium City. On Monday morning, the illegal practice led to a fire in the green belt along Devi Lal Park in Sector 22./With the onset of summer, leaf burning adds to air pollution. With the rising mercury, the practice is also a fire hazard. The smoke from burning leaves contains several toxic gases and other irritants - a major cause for concern for those suffering from asthma and other breathing disorders./""We do not know who is responsible for the nuisance. Gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide are released from burning leaves that trigger respiratory problems,"" said an official of the Haryana state pollution control board./""Awareness is the key to resolve such issues. We have carried out awareness drives across Haryana, covering villages and urban spaces, to inform residents about the harmful effects of burning leaves. Since insects are also burnt in the process, it also adversely affects the ecological balance,"" the official added./Bhawani Shankar, a resident of Sector 23A, said, ""It is the responsibility of the horticulture department to take action. For the past 15 days, frequent fires have been reported due to burning of leaves.""/Shankar added that sweepers employed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority often burn garbage collected from different households in violation of norms.

"No end to burning of leaves, 2 fresh cases reported","India, May 10 -- Law prohibits burning of leaves but the practice continues unabated in the city. One such incident came to light on Thursday morning where leaves along with plastic and garbage were seen burning in two different areas of Gurgaon./One was spotted in the green belt on Sunset Boulevard road, near Kachra Chowk and the other was near Supermart-I, DLF City phase 4./Burning of leaves along with garbage causes respiratory problems as gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide emanate from its smoke. It also add to air pollution./Earlier, on May 7, HT had published a story 'Burning of leaves continues despite high court ban' highlighting the rampant illegal activity across Gurgaon./Environmentalist, Harish Capoor has a solution for this problem. ""With the administration's consent, within DLF City phase-1, I along with other environmentalists worked on making trenches, five-foot-deep and four-foot-broad, where leaves are collected and put. These leaves are left in the trenches for six-seven months. This keeps the roads clean and one can also make manure in the trenches,"" said Capoor. ""One needs to remember that while putting the leaves in the trenches, polybags and garbage need to be meticulously removed,"" added Capoor./""Such activities are a nuisance and we do not know who is responsible for this.

Blame it on TV: more kids suffering from cornea disease,"India, July 15 -- City ophthalmologists are treating an increasing number of children suffering from kerataconus, a degenerative disease of the cornea, which is more common among young adults./Doctors claim that constant television viewing and computer usage may be one of the factors behind the increase in the cases./In kerataconus, there is a thinning of the cornea, which gradually hampers vision and is an irreversible condition. Thinning of the cornea occurs as a result of the weakening of the protein fibres (collagen), which hold the cornea in the eye./In the past 6 months, Dr Vandana Jain, director of Advanced Eye Institute and Hospital, Navi Mumbai, has treated 30 children between nine and 15 years of age for keratoconus. According to her, dryness in the eyes on account of constant television viewing and computer usage also triggers keratoconus./""It's alarming that children as young as eight and nine years are being diagnosed with the condition we saw in young adults,"" said Dr Jain./""The sudden rise could also be a result of heavy pollution which leads to allergic conjunctivitis, a condition which triggers the thinning of cornea. Rubbing of eyes is predisposed to keratoconous,"" said Dr Hijab Mehta, Infiniti Eye Hospital at Opera House./Doctors suggest regular eye check-ups for those children who have had repeated episodes of allergy conjunctivitis because of high air pollution levels./""Last week I saw a 10-yearold boy with very high cylindrical powers. We are waiting for his test results to confirm keratoconus,"" said an ophthalmologist from south Mumbai./Doctors say the incidence of keratoconus is one in 2,000 people, but with younger children being detected of the disease, doctors are worried about a rise./""At present we can only reduce the progression of the disease. If the patient comes at a very advance stage, the only option left is to conduct a corneal transplant, which is not an advisable treatment in children,"" added Dr Jain./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Emissions improve, but air can still kill","New Delhi, July 27 -- Better emissions introduced in 2000 has possibly saved around seven lakh lives in India between 2000 and 2010 but many lives are still at risk because of rising air pollution in Indian cities./The latest Lancet report on disease burden has attributed particulate matter pollution as the fifth biggest cause of deaths in south Asia, including India and the latest Central Pollution Control Board data shows that air pollution is rising in many cities./Exposure to air pollution can cause breathing problems leading to asthma attacks. According to recent studies, particulate matter upto 2.5 micro grams can even cause a heart attack./""India has lost ground on management of air pollution even though its vehicles were as efficient as the European ones when emissions norms were introduced in India,"" Anup Bandivadekar of the International Council on Clean Transportation said at a workshop organised by the Centre for Science and Environment./India's emission policy expired in 2010 with the introduction of Bharat stage-III emissions norms for the entire country, except 13 cities where Bharat stage-IV norms were made applicable./What concerns environmentalists like Sunita Narian, CSE's director general, is that the policy delay was impacting the common man's health./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Once just like heaven, now dirty picture","Gurdaspur, Sept. 16 -- District headquarters since 1852, Gurdaspur has failed to develop the basic civic amenities in more than 150 years./Nature had given it the bounty of thick forests, orchards and gardens, besides big banyan and peepal trees in each locality; and its roads and pathways were lined with shady trees such as sheesham, kikkar and mango. In the olden days, it also had big ""chhappars"" (ponds) to collect rainwater, and natural and planned drains to carry away the sewage./The attractive town in the foothills of the Himalayas, a favourite spot of the British colonial masters and the summer retreat of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, lost its beauty to the increase in population. The jungles, orchards and gardens disappeared and up came unplanned new colonies in the outer parts. Almost all trees, big or small, were cut to clear land for new permanent settlers from the villages nearby./(With more garbage around than inside, the bin on Geeta Bhawan Road in Gurdaspur is a/waste. HT photo)/The municipal committee (now municipal council) cleared the city of trees in the name of widening the roads. It has installed 15 tube-wells in Gurdaspur, yet the water supply is irregular in some wards. The digging of new drains is incomplete, and there aren't enough sweepers to maintain sanitation. At every turn, there's garbage and foul smell, and more refuse around than inside the MC-placed waste containers./Choked with plastic waste from houses, the drains have become the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, and the risk of malaria and other vector-borne diseases hovers over the city. Several metres of shop fronts are encroached upon, and the iron rods, logs, sand and shuttering material dump there have laid obstacles for traffic./Long rows of illegal kiosks have come up even in the busy markets of Sadar Bazar, Library Road, Geeta Bhavan Road, Tibri Road, Trimu Road, Kahnuwan Road, Kalanaur Road and GT Road, congesting the space. ""The town's main garbage dump is at Mann village,"" said MC administrator Tejinderpal Singh Sandhu.

"Work stress affects fertility, which in turn influences personal life","Kolkata, Sept. 18 -- he reason behind the increasing trend in infertility among both men and women can be blamed on lifestyle changes like stress, obesity, pollution, lack of physical exercise and change in eating habits. Offending agents in products used by us can affect an individual, while in the mother's womb, after taking birth, during childhood or when a person attains adulthood. Stress affects fertility which in turn influences personal life./While, in men, such elements lead to diminished sperm count, in women, they affect egg formation, cause premature puberty, premature menopause, dysfunction of fallopian tubes, recurrent abortion, stillbirth and defects in newborns. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in foetal life can lead to vaginal cancer, childlessness, problem in pregnancy and uterinetu mourin later life. Phthalates in shampoos, perfumes and some other products can cause gynecological and obstetric problems. Heavy metal solubles like lead, mercury, etc. can lead to infertility. Pesticides on the other hand can lead to reproductive failure. These environmental toxic elements are present in water, air and soil. Therefore, all of us are exposed to them./Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was used in the US to prevent recurrent abortions and premature labours in the late 30s, but it was found to give rise to vaginal tumours and failure in reproduction in offsprings. Therefore, from 1971, it was banned in that country./Plastic containers containing Bisphenol A and Phthalates can also cause problems in women health. Air pollution affects fertility in both men and women. Smoking has direct effect on conception and childbirth. Heavy metal fumes found in paint factories also affect fertility./In recent days, a new concept is emerging about hormonal disruptors - Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs). These are found in toiletries products. They can disrupt the metabolic homeostasis, leading to disruption of reproduction and developmental process. In women, EDCs are also responsible for the onset of early puberty, abnormal period, endometriosis and loss of pregnancy, and they also cause infertility in men. In recent days, a condition in men has been found called Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome (TDS), which is the outcome of disturbed development of testis in foetal life, leading to decease in sperm quality, a handful of congenital malformations, etc./Using recreational drugs, drinking alcohol and smoking also cause infertility. Cadmium and cotinine present in recreational agents affect sperm and ovum qualities. Both over and underweight women suffer from diseases like polycystic ovarian syn-drome (PCOS), hormonal dysfunctions, recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSAs), Diabetes Mellitus (DM) as well as hypertension./Psychological factors may also be the cause of infertility. Forty percent women suffering from infertility are found to have psychiatric disorders as compared to 3% of infertile ones. Stress of childlessness as well as the treatments to alleviate them results in disturbed relationships with life partner, family and friends. Sex lives of such women are also affected. Poor job performance and financial insecurities also add to the problem of infertility to a large extent./Treatment procedure of such patients should be well thought out. It is very much important to go deep into the problem, understand it thoroughly, handle it carefully and then plan a solution./Discussing personal experiences and case histories of successful couples in the form of storytelling also helps to build confidence in the patient. Watching light entertainment programmes also cheers up the mind. Discussing infertility problems and treatment details with other couples, especially senior family members disturbs ones mind./Couples should understand the causes of their own infertility and must be guided through discussion about alternative ways like adoption, donor oocyte programmes, or third party reproduction (surrogacy)./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Kolkata.

Deafness rising; who cares to listen?,"Amritsar, Sept. 25 -- This is the International Week of the Deaf, opportune time to listen to the advice against noise pollution. Yet while the cases of deafness are rising, no one is willing to hear./Even in the holy city, people are deaf to the din that is bringing hearing disorders to them silently. Doctors are worried, for the see the problems growing in every age group because of pressure horns, DJ music, fireworks, and loudspeakers./The banned pressure horn continues to blow free especially in the walled city area popular among visitors. Same goes at Lawrence Road, Mall Road, Queens Road, and GT Road, around the railway station, bus stand, schools and other institutions. ""The pressure-horn noise disturbs sleep and mental peace,"" said government physician Dr Sartaj Singh./Because law sleeps during all-night DJ parties, the residential neighbourhoods, especially patients and senior citizens, can't. ""During festivals such as Diwali, when people burst crackers even past the 10pm deadline, why does no one stop them?"" said housewife Charanjeet Kaur Bal, adding: ""The crackers create not only noise but also air pollution, and scare the animals.""/""More than 5% of the world's population, 36-crore people, have hearing loss. World Health Organisation (WHO) has counted 6.3-crore hearing-impaired people in India, and most of them are young. It's a loss of productivity, both physical and economic,"" said Dr Dinesh Kumar, assistant professor of ENT (ear, nose and throat) at Government Medical College, Amritsar. Hearing loss may be inherited or caused by complications at birth, certain infectious diseases, chronic ear infections, ageing and exposure to noise./Even keeping mobile phone to the ear for 60 minutes a day can do lasting damage to the hearing ability. People with high-frequency hearing loss (attributed to mobile phones) cannot hear sounds ranging from 2,000 to 8,000 Hertz, which can affect the ability to understand speech./""To keep the ears functional, we have to control our exposure to noise, or by and by, our ears will start to suffer,"" said Dr Jagdeepak Singh, another professor from the college, advising people to avoid dirty swimming pools to keep away the ear infections. In general, all doctors have only one message: ""Prevention is better than cure.""/Municipal commissioner DPS Kharbanda says his team makes regular efforts to curb noise pollution in the city.

Industry: boon or bane for Ludhiana?,"LUDHIANA, Sept. 27 -- Already infamous for being the world's fourth mostpolluted city as per the World Health Organisation (WHO), Ludhiana has now come under the scanner of the union ministry of environment, which has imposed a ban on setting up of new industries in the city./Going by the 75.72 Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index ( CEPI), wh ich was revealed in a recent report of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ludhiana is also the sixth most-polluted city in the country. With no clear cut policy on setting up of industry in industrial areas and focal points - the ""earmarked areas"" for industrial units - small industrial clusters were set up in the residential areas./The problem started surfacing with the expansion of industry in mid 80s and early 90s, which in absence of action from the departments concerned increased manifold./The situation has become worse with blatant, gradual violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, Environment Protection Act, and Public Liability Insurance Act./Having failed to act against the industrial units violating the laws, the government agencies, including Punjab State Industrial Exports Corporation (PSIEC), Punjab State Industrial Development Cor poration (PSIDC) and Punjab Pollution Control Board ( PPCB), are equally accountable for the grim situation that Ludhiana is currently facing./However, in a wake-up call given by the union ministry of environment, the state government has finally started making a move towards the shifting of industry operating in the residential areas. Whether green or red category, industry will have to shift out by 2017 as the Master Plan of Ludhiana has to be implemented by then. In addition to this, even in the mixed-land use areas, the red-category units will also have to move out of the city./CITY'S POLLUTION AND ITS GENESIS/Industrial expansion increas-ed the city's population, as a large number of labourers came from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan to work in cycle, knitwear, electroplating and dyeing units. But the government failed to formulate policies to cater to a mammoth population of more than 30 lakh (recent census figures). As a result, the city grew haphazardly with a large number of unapproved dwellings coming up near the industries where the inhabitants started laying down illegal sewerage system and water connections that gradually got out of control. Insensitivity of the owners of industrial houses in addition to the ignorant residents augmented the problem./Traffic is another major contributor to the pollution levels in Ludhiana. In addition to the registered vehicles, there are thousands of unregistered or outdated auto-rickshaws, vans and mini buses plying on the roads as commercial transportation. The adulterated fuel used by these vehicles is the cause of toxic emissions like carbon monoxide, a health hazard./Dealing with multidimensional responsibilities, the district transport office and the traffic wing of the police commissionerate have ignored the problem of fuel adulteration, a common practice in Ludhiana./Despite the regular monitoring of the air pollution through air pollution control devices, the respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) is more than double the permissible limit of 100 micrograms/metric cube in the city./Dr Satpal Verma, scientific officer with PPCB, while giving details, said the sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen with their annual permissible limit 50 micrograms/metric cube and 40 micrograms/metric cube was well in control as had been ascertained during the data of the past four years./CRITICALLY POLLUTED AREAS/According to data available with the PPCB, residential areas adjoining Tajpur Road, Sunder Nagar and areas on the banks of Budha Nullah, such as New Madhopuri, Sundernagar , Basti Jodhewal, Shivpuri, Chander Nagar and Vishnu Puri, are among the worst- af fected areas of the city. Areas adjoining Industrial Area A, near Cheema Chowk and Manju Cinema, which has mixed land use are other parts of the city, which are high on air pollution. Also areas near Sherpur Chowk, which have various industrial units, high traffic and poor quality of roads, are categorised as polluted areas of Ludhiana./ADVERSE IMPACT ON HUMAN, ANIMAL HEALTH/Deteriorating environmental conditions in and around Ludhiana have adversely affected the human and animal health in the past one decade. The air is polluted because of industrial and vehicular emissions./Similarly, with the industries disposing of effluent waste in the underground drains, the ground water has become polluted to an extent that there is hardly an area in the city that does not have failed water samples. The city has witnessed major gastroenteritis outbreaks in the past 15 years, wherein hundreds have lost their lives. Garbage disposal is still a problem in the industrial city as heaps can be seen dumped on the roadsides, an open invitation to various diseases./Dr Sandeep Puri, medical superintendent at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), said there was a steep rise in the cases of bronchitis, asthma, allergies and skin problems due to pollution./""Also, more and more people are experiencing deficiency of Vitamin D, which is mainly due to pollution layers that do not allow the sun's rays to penetrate our atmosphere,"" he added./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Chandigarh.

"City's air too polluted, noise deafening","LUDHIANA, Sept. 30 -- High level of air and noise pollution is what the residents of Ludhiana, irrespective of their social status, have learnt to live with. Despite the improved figures of the ambient air quality measured in Respiratory Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) in the last three years, Ludhiana remains one of the most polluted cities across India as well as the world./The situation is even worse when we take a look at noise pollution in the city as one can't get rid of the deafening sounds whether on highways or inner city roads. Bikes without silencers, trucks/buses/SUVs with pressure horns, along with nonstop honking of horns is an never-ending affair which seldom invites criticism as majority have become immune to the nuisance./AIR POLLUTION/Presence of industries and high number of vehicles are the main reasons that city's air has high residues of carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, mercury emissions and carbon dioxide, leading to increase in respiratory disorders like allergic cold, bronchitis, asthma and various other lung diseases./Despite stringent measures taken by the PPCB, a number of industries, including dyeing units, burn straw as fuel, which is a major source of air pollution. Bad condition of roads and incomplete projects add to the air pollution as more dust mars the ambient air quality./Due to corruption, contractors use poor quality material in construction of roads, resulting in early 'wear and tear' of completed works./Burning of stubble after the harvesting of crops escalates the pollutants in the air and also aggravates the allergies among people. Though the district administration issues prohibitory orders against bur ning of stubble, still the fields in and around Ludhiana are reduced to 'black patches' after every harvest./Auto rickshaws, cabs and mini buses use adulterated fuel which is a source of carbon monoxide. There are very few auto rickshaw drivers who carry a pollution check certificate./NOISE POLLUTION/What would be the 'mental health' of the people who are subjected to 100-plus decibels while commuting on road? Against the permissible limit of 65 decibels, a large number of areas in Ludhiana has noise level up to 104 decibels, which in addition to affecting the concentration and efficiency of an individual also cause hearing/impair ment. Also, it is extremely harmful for pregnant women, can lead to temporary or permanent deafness and has bad effect on animal and crop health./As per the findings of a study conducted by Bharat Jan Gyan Vigyan Jatha (BJGVJ), a city NGO in 2010-11, pressure horns and vehicular traffic is the main cause of noise pollution in Ludhiana which varies between/70-104 decibel (db) against the permissible limit of 65 db. Similarly, the noise caused by the industrial sources like machines and generators measured near some factories varied from 75-90 db, hazardous for humans in more than one way./Hammers being used in forgings create vibrations that result in creating cracks in the adjoining buildings but none of the departments are ready to take the responsibility to tackle the problem./However, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) is not measuring the noise pollution except for one day that is ""Diwali"" so as to check the noise created by the bursting of crackers. Also, there is no check on the sale and use of pressure horns. The challaning of the vehicles by the traffic wing will not make any difference till the time their sale is not banned./Hundreds of shops selling accessories of vehicles have different pressure horns that create ""horrible sounds"" like scream, siren , dog bark and on the tunes of famous Punjabi numbers./(Roles and responsibilities for bringing about a positive change)/Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Chandigarh.

Beware of the air you breathe!,"Kolkata, Oct. 1 -- Kolkata and Delhi have ranked the two most polluted mega cities in India, according to reports of a Delhi-based NGO./However, what is perhaps more alarming is that smaller towns and cities are fast catching up with the two metros in pollution stakes and could wrest the dubious tag in the foreseeable future./""The overall air quality in Kolkata shows that both particulate matter and nitrogen oxide levels are among the highest in the city, with annual levels being double the permissible limits. Levels of other cancer-causing agents such as benzene have also been found to be very high in the city,"" Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) of Centre for Science and Environment, said./The study on air pollution was conducted across all megacities and other major cities and towns a few months back./Among the mega cities covered in the study were Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad./""Nearly 785 cities in India have particulate pollution count that exceed the standard level. Only two cities-both from Kerala-meet the clean air benchmark of the Central Pollution Control Board for particulate matter measuring less than 10 microns,"" Roy Chowdhury said./Particulate matter less than 10 microns (one-fifth the size of your hair breadth), is deemed most harmful as they go deep inside the lungs and trigger all types of bronchial ailments and other fatal diseases./""Several cities and towns in Bengal, including Howrah, Asansol and Durgapur are showing increasing signs of this small particulate matter. The level of nitrogen dioxide has also been going up in these cities. Almost all cities in Bengal have fallen foul of the standards prescribed for both nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter,"" Roy Chowdhury said./According to the study, the top ten sites recording alarming levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter are in Bengal./These include areas in Howrah, Bar rackpore, Durgapur, Asansol, Sankrail and Raniganj./She said rampant vehicular pollution is one of the reasons behind the rising count of noxious elements in the air in the metros./Kolkata logs one of the highest levels of vehicular pollution among all the mega cities in the country./""To add to the woes, Kolkata Police has banned cycles and rickshaws on more than 170 roads between 7am and 11pm. Kolkata is the only metro where cycle trips outnumber cars. Such decisions will hurt the city's air and increase risk of diseases manifold,"" Roy Chowdhury said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Gloomy smoke signal from polluted Ludhiana,"LUDHIANA, Oct. 3 -- The turning of Buddha Dariya into Buddha Nullah, from a river to sewer, is the story of Ludhiana's transformation into an overflowing polluted centre after three decades of industrialisation./In the absence of using the barriers of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, Environment Protection Act, and Public Liability Insurance Act, the industrialisation wave took its toll on the city's environment./The world's fourth most-polluted city in 2011 and now sixth on this scale in the country, Ludhiana has attracted a union ministry of environment ban on new industrial development. For failing to act against polluting factories, the government agencies such as Punjab State Industrial Exports Corporation (PSIEC), Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation (PSIDC), and Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) should take the blame, and so should its residents, who have ignored their duty./WATER POLLUTION/Industrial expansion flooded the city with workforce from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, which took up jobs in the bicycle, knitwear, electroplating, automobile parts and dyeing units. With no provision of housing, the migrants developed own dwellings called ""vehras"", urban slums, across the city./Of the 262 dyeing units in Ludhiana, 10 industries are large and the rest medium. The factories at Tajpur Road, Rahon Road, Focal Point, and Industrial Area-A have captive effluent-treatment plants but non-transparent treatment procedures./Of the 675 electroplating units, most empty their toxic wastewater into the Buddha Nullah, adding to the waste that households toss into the drain. As a result, the ""dariya"" turned into a ""nullah"", running through Ludhiana from east to west, originating from Koom Kalan and joining the Sutlej river at Wallipur Kalan./The construction of dams in the past 15 years first reduced and then stopped the fresh water inflow into the nullah from the Sutlej. The sewage, slush and industrial effluents still released into the drain accumulated./The PPCB data shows Tajpur Road, Sunder Nag ar, New Madhopuri, Basti Jodhewal, Shivpuri, Chander Nagar and Vishnu Puri to be worst-affected residential areas. Most are along the nullah. Industrial Area-A, Cheema Chowk, and Manju Cinema mixed-land-use zones have high air pollution. The Sherpur Chowk industrial units have contributed to the worsening of traffic and roads./AIR AND NOISE POLLUTION/Environmental law violation, bad roads, incomplete flyovers, emissions from outdated autorickshaws and the burning of crop stubble have destroyed the ambient air quality of Ludhiana. The city is among the four most polluted in the world in terms of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the atmosphere./Ludhiana has more industries and vehicles than any other city in Punjab but don't be jealous. Its residents breathe an air rich in toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and mercury. The result is respiratory disorders. The noise recorded in some areas of Ludhiana is 104 decibels, almost the sound of thunderstorm. It is enough to cause permanent deafness, and harm foetuses, animals and crop./SOLID-WASTE MANAGEMENT/Even after 46 years, sewerage facility is unavailable to 100% of the population. The municipal corporation has 30-year contract with A to Z for the collection, disposal and treatment of solid waste. For two years, the company has been collecting garbage from 62 wards but the treatment of it remains a dream. The delay in shifting dairies out also has contributed to the problem./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Chandigarh.

SGPC inaugurates eco-friendly shed at Golden Temple,"AMRITSAR, Oct. 29 -- Taking another step towards the introduction of more eco-friendly cooking methods at the Guru Ram Dass Lang ar ( community kitchen) at the Golden Temple, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Monday inaugurated an ecofriendly shed, where food will be cooked for devotees./The shed - equipped with the state-of-the-art technology - has already been given the green signal by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB)./SGPC chief Avtar Singh Makkar inaugurated the shed in the presence of Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Avtar Singh, members of the clergy and SGPC staff./Meanwhile, the shed has been constructed over a period of five months by Baba Labh Singh and Baba Harbhajan Singh Pehlwan through 'kar sewa' (voluntary service) for the benefit of devotees./WATER-FILLED TANKS INSTALLED AT CHIMNEYS TO PREVENT AIR POLLUTION/The shed will have four largesized hearths on which chapattis will be cooked. Firewood will be used to prepare food. Four water tanks, each with a capacity of 250 litres, have been installed close to these hearths. The remnants of the burning firewood will be used to heat water, thereby saving fuel. The shed will also have four mud ovens (batthis) on which pulses, vegetables and 'parshad' will be cooked. Two chimneys have been installed to let out smoke from the ovens and hearths. A 700litre water tank has been fixed on each chimney. The water used for cooking purposes will be heated by the smoke, that escapes through the two chimneys. With this, 2,400 litres of hot water will be available in the kitchen. Two water-filled tanks have been installed at the end of the two chimneys to sprinkle water on the smoke. This will prevent air pollution and only 'clean' smoke will be released. SGPC officials said, ""It takes usually four hours to cook pulses. But, now, they will be prepared in half the time."" Though the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee was using solar energy to get hot water for cooking purposes and cleaning utensils, the quantity was insufficient. However, langar will be prepared through LPG gas and firewood at the old kitchen. This is because over 1 lakh devotees daily partake 'langar' at the Golden Temple. A team of the PPCB and the Punjab State Council for Science and Technology led by Pritpal Singh also visited the shed. ""We hope the SGPC will initiate more steps towards more ecofriendly measures at the Golden Temple,"" said the team members. SGPC has also installed solar lights in some of the inns (sarai) in the temple complex./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Chandigarh.

Repeated plaints of air pollution in Deonar go unheard,"umbai, Nov. 1 -- The polluted environment at Annabhau Sathe Nagar and Municipal Colony, Deonar, is making people ill, residents of the area have claimed, with the smoke stack of the civic body's biomedical waste (BMW) incineration plant spewing out black and white smoke round the clock./The residents of these densely-populated localities have sent several complaints to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) regarding the air pollution from the plant, run by SMS Envoclean Private Ltd./The complaints sent to MPCB by Deonar resident Sameer Lalzare states: ""The incinerator near Deonar dumping ground is generating tremendous pollution and affecting the health of citizens. There is no action being taken despite numerous complaints.""/Suresh Salve, a resident of Annabhau Sathe Nagar that directly faces the smoke stack, said: ""Tuberculosis and respiratory disorders are common in our neighbourhood. We were shocked to find that we spat out black sootlike particles when we rinse our mouth in the mornings.""/""As plastic is a major component of BMW, the smoke can be toxic. We have been treating many cases of respiratory disorders,"" said Dr Rahil Qamar Siddique, general physician, Rajiv Gandhi Medical Centre, Shivaji Nagar./Responding to the complaints, Chetan Bora, director of SMS Envoclean, said: ""The smoke from the plant usually does not blow towards the settlements and the plant is mostly active in the night.""/MPCB officials said they had not found anything amiss with the incinerator's operations.

"On Diwali, don't ignore environment","CHANDIGARH, Nov. 3 -- Sector 22 is the most polluted area in the city when it comes to noise on Diwali. This has been underlined in statistics of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC). Air pollution also goes up several times./On Diwali eve, a press release issued by the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) quoted various studies conducted by the CPCC that show constant increase in noise pollution in various areas of Chandigarh. The traffic is primarily to blame through the year, but on Diwali it's the worst. Firecrackers usually cross the 125 decibel barrier, and in general the noise level touches 90 dB./As per norms of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the level in residential areas should not exceed 55dB in daytime and 45 dB at night. In commercial areas, daytime norm is 65 dB and night-time 55 dB. In Sector-22 residential areas, the noise went up to 82dB between 8 and 10pm on Diwali night in 2009, as per a CBCB study. In the Panjab University 'silence zone', it went up to 62, though down from 94 recorded in 2007. Manimajra hit 80 in 2009. ""The level of noise pollution in Chandigarh is already high when compared to the prescribed standards laid down by the CPCB,"" said Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, assistant professor, environment health, PGIMER./Air pollution levels rise 200fold of the global norms in some cases. PGIMER experts said crackers increased the level of sulphur dioxide 200-fold of the safety limits prescribed by the World Health Organization. ""This gaseous pollutant along with other noxious gases emitted from the burning of firecrackers aggravates the risk of triggering an attack in asthmatics, and also has the potential to cause new cases of asthma,"" said Dr Meenu Singh, professor, paediatrics, PGIMER./As for the noise pollution, it can lead to hearing impairment at worst, and also hypertension, heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance and decreased work or school perfor mance. On Diwali, patients, the elderly and other sensitive sections of the population also do not remain untouched from the increase in the noise. ""Noise pollution has been linked to severe health problems, including long-term psychological and physiological disorders,"" said Dr Khaiwal./The Environment (Protection) Act 1986 says manufacture and sale of crackers that make noise over 125 dB should be banned. A study conducted by the CPCB and National Physical Laboratory, Delhi, showed that 95% cracker samples exceeded the limits. These included Standard Classic Bomb at 138, 'Hydrogen' Bomb at 135 and the popular Bullet Bomb at 136 dB./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Chandigarh.

However, farmers say they never got any call from the plants to sell their crop./""Not even a single farmer got a call from any plant. Rather, the farmers are not ready to sell the straw on this rate since it costs around Rs. 1,000 in form of labour to collect the straw from one acre,"" Koohli added./Gravity of the problem very serious/Stubble burning is not only injurious to human health due to environmental hazards, but the process is also harmful for farmers as several friendly pests that save crops from harmful pests, are burnt in the process./The yield of paddy straw in combine-harvested paddy field is about 10 to 12.5 tonnes per hectare for high-yielding varieties. The yield of standing stubble and loose straw is about 40 and 60% respectively./This huge amount of straw is wasted annually either by burning in the fields or due to poor utilisation, which otherwise could contribute to the income of farmers./Also, the heat from burning straw can penetrate into the soil up to 1 cm in depth, increasing the temperature as high as 42.2degC; hence, decreasing the bacterial and fungal populations substantially in top 2.5 cm of the soil. One tonne of straw on burning destroys approximately 400kg organic carbon, 5.5 kg nitrogen, 2.3 kg phosphorous, 25 kg potassium and 1.2 kg sulphur, reducing the fertility of soil/EXPERT VIEW/PAU extension education director Mukhtiar Singh Gill said moving farmers from burning of straw to other alternatives would take time as the problem was deep rooted and needed to be addressed on various levels./""Farmers are resorting to burning since they think it's the easiest way to dispose of the straw.

Blame game over thick smog cover,"New Delhi, Nov. 6 -- As a thick blanket of smog enveloped the Capital and its neighbouring areas on Tuesday, the Delhi government was quick to blame the neighbouring states for the phenomenon./""Smog is caused due to a combination of factors. Paddy straw is still burnt in adjoining states such as Punjab, causing a haze that affects Delhi. We have satellite pictures to back this. There is very little wind to shift the pollution away from the city,"" said a senior government official, who did not wish to be named./Officials said the Punjab government would issue a notification banning the burning of paddy straw. Smoke particles billowing from burning of paddy stubble in the farms of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh move to Delhi and then hang around in the air because of low wind speed - a phenomenon typically witnessed in the winter season - resulting in reduced visibility./The situation aggravates when the haze mixes with Delhi's massive vehicular pollution and becomes heavier and deadlier. Last year, Delhi saw a 12-day long smog spell (from October 26 to November 8), leading to an increase in respiratory and asthmatic complications, particularly among the elderly and children./During last winter, the Delhi government had promised various measures to fight winter pollution. Among the many remedies proposed was a study by one of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) to examine Delhi's air quality. The study has, in fact, just been awarded and will take time to complete./A five-year action plan already prepared to fight pollution in the Capital remains on hold because of the elections./The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), however, warned the government not to dismiss smog as a mere weather phenomenon./The CSE made light of the Delhi government's attribution of smog to the winter season only and pointed out the real reason - a manifold increase in pollution levels. It warned that after the initial smog cover lifted, it would come back stronger as the factors responsible for the phenomenon continued to persist./""Other countries have prevented such pollution episodes through aggressive measures. Why can't Delhi do the same?"" questioned Anumita Roychowdhury, is in-charge of air pollution and transportation programme at CSE./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Stay warm to ward off winter ailments,"Kolkata, Nov. 7 -- Kolkata is now going through its pre-winter days, with cool breezes and warm sunrays. November may perhaps be the best month of the year, but one needs to be cautious not to catch any of the winter ailments ranging from cold to asthma and dry skin problems./Caused by changes in the season and weather conditions, the air also is subject to a lot of change. There is an increase in the particulate movement and stagnation in the air, leading to pollution and thus health problems like asthma, cough and cold and pneumonia./""During the rest of the year, air movement is smooth, thus environmental pollution is not as high as the winter months. There is a rise in the volume of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (RPM) concentration in the air during these months. It directly has an effect on the children and aged population,"" said Dr Alok G Ghosal, pulmonologist and director of the National Allergy Asthma Bronchitis Institute./Dr Partha Sarathi Bhattacharya, consultant pulmonologist further explained, saying, not only is there a rise in environmental pollution, but also in indoor pollution, as people tend to keep their doors and windows shut to avoid the cold winds./""The air concentration level increases and people tend to stay indoors, thus leading to indoor pollution as well. People light up heaters and fires to keep warm, thus generating more heat and smoke to pollute the indoor air,"" said Bhattacharya./He added, ""One can control indoor pollution in order to reduce the chances of respiratory problems and cough and cold among children. Those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are also at a risk, as their coughing and breathing problems tend to aggravate during this season.""/While for some, few elements may act as allergens, for others it may not. It all depends on the body system and the sensitiveness of the mucous membrane. ""Some people get irritated and fall ill at the slightest contact with allergens like cotton or pollens, among others. For some, it may not create any problem even if they are exposed to such elements in huge quantities,"" said Bhattacharya./Symptoms start with irritation in the eyes and nose, watery eyes and frequent sneezing. Bhattacharya added, ""These symptoms are then followed by an acute rhinitis (running nose), which may take a lot of time to stop. Those that are prone to developing these problems must take preventive steps and medicine before the problem sets in. We advise nasal sprays and medicines to protect the already prone individuals.""/Sometimes, the temperature variation in the climate may also act as a trigger behind such health conditions. ""During the months of November and December, the atmospheric temperature sees a constant rise and fall. People tend to switch on fans and air conditioners when they feel a bit warm even in these winter months. However, it is because of such practices that they get caught in the weather fluctuations and fall ill,"" said Ghosal./Running nose is that irritating problem which affects almost each and every individual some time during the winter months. The environment in some places develops such conditions that the movement of allergens is high. Thus, in some places, winter creates quite a flutter with its accompanying diseases, and in some, there is no effect at all./Kolkata and West Bengal being among the places where the allergens become hyper active during the winter months, people who are prone to such illnesses must take adequate care./Ghosal added, ""Normal people, who do not have hyper sensitive mucous membranes, are also affected by this pollutant. Air pollution caused by smoke and other pollutants play a large role in taking down people with a running nose.""/On the other hand, skin dryness and infections are other major problems that occur during these months, apart from the usual cough and cold. ""During the summer and rainy seasons, the relative humidity in the atmosphere prevents water evaporation from the outermost layer of skin. Whereas, during the winter months, it is just the other way round, and there is evaporation of water from epidermis of skin because of very less relative humidity in the atmosphere,"" said Dr Sandipan Dhar, consultant pediatric dermatologist./Among children and young adults, skin drying and scaling are the two most common problems identified by skin specialists. ""Skin dryness is often a genetically determined skin disease which often runs in the family. The basic defect of the skin in atopic dermatitis is 'dry skin'. Another problem is a skin condition known as 'ichthyosis', which is a hereditary skin problem that results in fish like scales over the skin,"" he added./Apart from these two, 'psoriasis' is another common skin problem where red scaly patches develop over the body and there is excessive dry scaling over scalp, which is usually labelled as 'dandruff '. ""Children suffering from malnutrition, hypothyroidism or diabetes can have very severe dry skin in winter,"" said Dhar./According to general medicine practitioner Dr Subrata Maitra, apart from regular health issues like runny nose, pneumonia and skin problems, those suffering from heart problems and age related issues like arthritis also suffer during the winter months./""Due to the chill in the weather, most aged people develop health issues of all sorts. Those who have arthritis suffer more during the winter months. Also blood pressure tends to be on the higher side, as blood vessels start contracting due to the cold,"" said Maitra. He suggested, ""There is no other way to get rid of such problems other than keeping warm with woolens and room heaters. One must try to maintain a warm temperature at home.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Kolkata.

That morning air ain't good for you!,"Kolkata, Nov. 10 -- All of you who take the pains of getting up early on a frosty, cold morning to go for a jog to stay fit may actually be inhaling poison. With winter approaching, the levels of pollutants in the city's air are fast shooting up. And matters are likely to worsen over the next two months when the cold sets in./Air quality data of the government's pollution watchdog, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), for 2010 - the last one in the series of such reports on air quality across the country - has already shown that Kolkata and Delhi are among the worst-affected cities in terms of air pollution./Data with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) revealed that, with the approach of winter, the city's air is gradually becoming denser and the amount of pollution in the air is also shooting up. Even though it is still within permissible limits for now, on the first three days of November, when innumerable fireworks were lit, the situation had become worse./""Unchecked vehicular pollution is nullifying the effects of a reduced level of industrial pollution in Kolkata. Vehicular pollution contributes 50% of the air pollution in the city, while industrial pollution contributes 48%. The remaining 2% can be attributed to domestic and other sources,"" SM Ghosh, a green expert and automobile analyst, said./At about 5am on November 1, the level of nitrogen dioxide shot up to 117 micrograms per cubic metre - much beyond the permissible limit of 80 micrograms per cubic metre - at Victoria Memorial. The level of particles less than 10 microns (PM10), which include metals, smoke, diesel soot, acids, dirt and pollen rose 229 micrograms per metre cube at the same spot. The permissible limit for PM10 is 100 micrograms per metre cube. The amount of carbon monoxide, too, was much higher than the permissible limit. ""Coarse particles, PM 10, can invade the lungs' natural defences and harm cardiovascular and respiratory health. These particles are often embedded with such toxic substances as organic hydrocarbons, metals (such as lead) and pesticides,"" S Chanda, director, Asthma and Allergy Research Centre, said./Just to give an idea how much worse it will get once the winter sets in properly, the WBPCB data of 2012 shows that, on December 31 that year, the level of nitrogen dioxide was more than double the permissible limit. PM10 had shot up to more than 300, which is almost three times the permissible limit inside Victoria Memorial./""Nitrogen dioxide can trigger increased inflammation of the airways, worsened coughing and wheezing, reduced lung function, increased asthma attacks and increased susceptibility to respiratory infection, such as influenza. The number of patients with respiratory diseases increases during winter,"" Chanda said./Green activists, such as Subhas Dutta, said that the air quality in other parts of the city would be much worse if this was the scenario at Victoria Memorial, where there is a lot of greenery. The Maidan, considered the lungs of Kolkata, is also close by. The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer has recently claimed that air pollution is a major cause of cancer./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Kolkata.

Diwali fog is warning for car capital draped in perpetual haze,"New Delhi, Nov. 11 -- Yet another Diwali turned out to be a smoky, ear-splitting celebration last week. The pollution control board monitoring the air quality levels on Diwali night found that the sulphur dioxide range was 35-114 microgram per cubic meter this year. Last Diwali, it was 20-88 microgram per cubic meter. With both the minimum and maximum levels of SO2 on the higher side, we are probably still breathing the toxic sulphur from the fireworks launched last Sunday./As expected, smog followed soon after. The thick grey blanket that hung low over the city last few days left us gasping for breath. Scientists at the Met office attributed it to the Diwali fumes and the daily pollution that could not disperse due to calm weather conditions./The government's response was predictable. While there was no word on the rising Diwali pollution, officials first dismissed the smog as a weather phenomenon. Then, they blamed the neighbouring states for burning farm waste and thus polluting Delhi's air./In early November last year, when Delhi clocked 12 days of continuous smog, the Supreme Court intervened, extracting promises of reforms and regulations from the government. Our neighbours agreed not to burn their farm waste. The Delhi government warned of strict penalties for those who burned leaves and garbage, and stringent action against polluting vehicles entering the city. It also promised to put in place an air quality index on display boards, recommending motorists to use public transport and warning people about the ill-effects of smog./But the promises were forgotten as soon as the sun came out. Satellite imagery from NASA shows stubble is still being burnt in farmlands across north India. But like dengue casualties and power lines tripping, the blame for this one can't be so conveniently passed on to the neighbouring states. Delhi has to look within./The capital's biggest problem is its seven million vehicles. One in every 10 vehicles of India is registered in this city and the number is growing by 10% every year. So the advantages of turning the fleet of 100,000 buses, taxis and auto rickshaws to Compressed Natural Gas-mode in 2002 have been squandered. Today, the air pollution in Delhi is comparable to the pre-CNG days./Surprisingly, the government didn't have a cleanup plan till last year when the smog persisted for too long. It is clearly not short of ideas. For years, almost all expert studies commissioned by the government have recommended congestion tax and road space rationing. It does not matter if the cars are run on petrol or diesel. The sheer volume of private vehicles is choking our roads and lungs./Technology upgrades and urban transportation planning can bring down air pollution levels that have grim consequences for human health. Only last week, Xinhuanet, the website of China's official news agency, reported how an eight-year-old girl who lived near a busy road in the eastern province of Jiangsu became China's youngest lung cancer patient, with doctors blaming air pollution for her illness. The hospital, however, denied the report later./But the Xinhuanet report coincided with the choking smog enveloping the northeastern city of Harbin two weeks back, bringing flights and ground transport to a standstill and forcing schools to shut for several days. Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the smogdraped Beijing, a city with 5.67 million vehicles. The number of lung cancer patients per 100,000 people was 63.09 in 2011, compared with 39.56 registered in 2002, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, Xinhuanet reported on November 9. It quoted health experts with the Beijing Cancer hospital saying smoking was the top reason for the disease, followed by passive smoking and air pollution./China's environment department has declared a smog emergency, but Delhi, that sees similar air pollution levels as Beijing on most days, is yet to clear its clean-up plan as the state cabinet is still mulling over it. We may not expect great vision in this city of haze but this suffocation demands some urgency./<a href=""mailto:shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com"">shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Man who keeps an eye on city's air,"New Delhi, Nov. 24 -- Mohan P George's job is to keep track of the air you breathe./As a scientist in charge of the air lab of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), his job is to collect, analyse and validate real time data of ambient air quality in Delhi./These days, he spends most of his time peering into the computers in the DPCC's air control room at his 5th floor office at Kashmere ISBT. It was during this period last year that a thick blanket of smoke had settled over the capital, raising serious environmental concerns./""I really get worked up the day I notice a little haze or smog. I rush to our monitoring stations to see what is causing it,"" says the soft-spoken George, who has been working with DPCC as a scientist since 1993./The DPCC's air lab runs a network of six Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations - at IGI airport, RK Puram. Punjabi Bagh, Mandir Marg, Civil Lines and Anand Vihar. These stations measure air quality for the presence of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants. The stations, set up by DPCC in 2010, are equipped with state-of-the-art gas and dust analyzers. Before the network was put in place, DPCC used to monitor air pollution manually at various locations across the city./""The air quality data is transmitted to the computers at air control room, and then uploaded on to DPCC's website. ""Unlike in the past, we now have real time, reliable data regarding the concentration of particulate matter (PM) and toxic gases in Delhi's air. This helps us better understand air pollution phenomenon such as haze and smog in the city,"" says George./The winters, especially the months of October and November when the Capital is prone to haze and smog, keeps George on tenterhooks. He explains that unlike fog which is a natural phenomenon caused by high humidity, low temperature coupled with low wind velocity, the haze occurs due to high concentration of particulate matter such as PM 10 and PM 2.5 and photo chemical reaction between nitrogen dioxide and ozone in the air./""Dense smog is the result of the presence of high levels of particulate matter and sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, which is released into the air by burning of fossil fuel and biomass,"" he says./According to the 51-year-old scientist, Delhi is particularly prone to air pollution due to its geographical location - in summers, a lot of dust is carried to Delhi from the deserts of Rajasthan; and in winters, inversion conditions do not allow the dust particles to disperse./Delhi has earned the dubious distinction of being one the most polluted cities in the world, with extremely high PM levels in the air - about 261 ug/m3 in 2010, according to a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report./""The construction and road resuspension dust and vehicular emission are the main causes of high PM levels in Delhi's air. Areas close to the Ring Road are the most polluted in the city,"" he says./During the 20-day-long smog last year around this time, he says, he had hard time explaining the phenomenon to Delhiites. ""We got a lot of calls from worried citizens during the 20 days that smog lasted; suddenly everyone was interested in knowing the chemistry of air pollution,"" he says./But is it not possible to make predictions about the formation of haze and smog in the city? ""Not as of now, as it requires much wider network of air quality monitoring stations so that we can know how pollutants behave in the air. But we hope to soon strengthen our system and make accurate predictions for haze and smog,"" he says./The air lab undertakes different kind of air quality monitoring --- source monitoring (monitoring at the source of emissor); point monitoring (manual monitoring at a particular location; episodal monitoring (monitoring air quality during a particular time in a given situation) like on Diwali night./""Compared to last year, the particulate matter concentration - PM 10 and PM 2.5 - showed no measure increase, but the concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2) showed a significant increase, especially between 8 pm and 12 midnight due to excessive use of fire crackers whose major constituent is sulphur.""/""It is very harmful to those suffering from respiratory diseases,"" he says./In fact, George talks about respiratory diseases like a pulmonary expert. ""As a scientist monitoring air quality, I must know the impact of every pollutant on human health,"" says George./And the pollutants in the air are playing havoc with human health in Delhi. According to Delhi government data, an average of 23 people die every day due to respiratory diseases in the Capital, a number that has doubled in the past few years. Respiratory diseases have emerged as the fastest growing killer the city./As we talk, he gets a call from a well-known pulmonary specialist wishing to see him. ""I get a lot of calls from doctors, embassies who want to know the pollution levels in the city. Our data is also used by various government agencies, organizations, and educational institutions for research purposes,"" says George./But does not the fact that he is constantly in the know about high pollution levels in the city he lives in, affect him personally? ""Yes, it does when I see the pollution data in isolation. I face the toughest questions from my two sons. But my job is to generate the scientific data about pollution levels; there is not much else I can do. Delhi's air quality can improve a lot if people switch from individual transport to the mass rapid transport,"" says George, who hails from Kerala./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Vehicle emissions spurring pollen pollution in Kolkata,"KOLKATA, Nov. 28 -- The city's rising pollution levels from increased vehicular emissions have always been held as one of the major culprits for your respiratory diseases. But now, scientists claim this culprit is also triggering some changes in plants that grow in your locality, which, in turn, could not only aggravate those diseases, but also affect new individuals who were earlier immune to such problems./Scientists with the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) claimed that high vehicular and other kinds of emissions and pollution are somehow related with the rising incidence of polleninduced respiratory allergy./""It's been reported that such gases as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide affect pollen grains and these pollutants are capable of modifying the morphology of these antigen-carrying agents, and also alter their allergenic potential,"" said GSV Murthy, a palynologist with the BSI based in Coimbatore./Winter is the time when not only the pollution levels in the city's air shoot up alarmingly, but this is also the time when several plants, which are known to cause allergies, throw up pollen grains. These pollens are known to trigger several seasonal allergies, such as seasonal rhinitis, asthma, hay fever and atopic dermatitis./Pankaj Kumar Pal, one of the seniormost palynologists in the department of botany, Burdwan University, said, ""Such gases as SO2 and NO2 which pollute the air also increase their carrying capacity. So, the polluted air can carry more suspended particles, which include pollen grains and, hence, the incidence of pollen-induced respiratory allergy also increases."" He also explained that pollen grains contained a lot of lipids and proteins. When such pollutants as SO2 and NO2 react with these lipids and proteins, the former, sometimes, changes the chemical composition of these pollens./""Our immune system produces antibodies - a protein that detects harmful substances, called antigens. Each individual develops antibodies, which fight particular types of antigens. So, if one individual can fight a specific antigen, others may be prone to diseases from the same antigen. But, when the chemical composition and morphology of these pollen grains get altered, these antibodies lose their ability to fight them. So, new individuals who had developed antibodies to fight a specific type of pollen antigen can no longer fight them and get affected,"" he added. It has already been reported in the media that air quality data of the government's pollution watchdog, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), for 2010 - the last one in the series of such reports on air quality across the country - show that Kolkata and Delhi are among the worst-affected cities in terms of air pollution./""Aero-biological studies in different parts of the country to ascertain concentration and seasonality of pollen grains have been conducted by various scientists. These studies have pointed out that winter is also the time when several plants in and around Kolkata known to cause respiratory allergies spread their pollen grains in the air,"" said eminent palynologist and former director of the BSI, MS Mondol. Doctors claimed that an estimated 10%35% of the population suffer from allergenic diseases in various seasons. This percentage shoots up during winter. Pollen allergens also cross-react with other pollen allergens among the same family, as well as food./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Kolkata.

MEGA TOXI CITIES,"umbai, Dec. 1 -- Outdoor air pollution caused 6.2 lakh premature deaths in India in 2010, which is a six-fold jump from the 1 lakh deaths in 2000. This makes polluted outdoor air the largest killer in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution (mainly from smoking chullahs), tobacco use, and poor nutrition, says the Global Burden of Disease 2013, which tracks deaths and illnesses from all causes every 10 years./One in three people in India live in critically-polluted areas that have noxious levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and lung-clogging particulate matter larger than 10 micron (PM10) in size. Of the 180 cities monitored by India's Central Pollution Control Board in 2012, only two - Malapuram and Pathanamthitta in Kerala - meet the criteria of low air pollution (50% below the standard). Driven breathless: Vehicles are the biggest air polluters. ""In Delhi, for example, 1,400 vehicles are added to the roads each day and contribute to more than 70% of air pollution. Barely 20 Indian cities follow Euro IV emission standards for new vehicles, most follow Euro III. Euro IV is seven years behind European standards and Euro III is behind by 12 years,"" says Anumita Roychowdhury, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). In Delhi, one death takes place every hour due to air pollution./Though air quality monitoring has doubled between 2005 and 2010 from 96 to 180 cities, the number of cities with low pollution has fallen from 10 to 2, while criticallypolluted cities have risen from 49 to 89./Water woes: No one quite recalls exactly when the non-perennial natural drain across Ludhiana called Budha Dariya (river) came to be called Budha Nullah (drain), but most people who live along its banks vouch for its toxicity. So choked is the drain with industrial effluents and sewage that calcium, magnesium, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide make both ground and tap water unfit for drinking, found a study by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in 2008./Compared to the other 65 wards in Ludhiana, 1.2 lakh people living in the 10 wards along Budha Nullah have much higher incidence of chronic stomach disorders, hepatitis A and cancers of the bladder, kidneys, lung, skin, colon and liver. Rickshawpuller Sunder Lal, 50, died in October this year after battling liver cancer for two years. His wife Rano blames it on the water. ""Water is a major problem in our neighbourhood and has claimed many lives,"" laments Rano. Agrees her neighbour Darshan, who was recently hospitalised for two months for hepatitis treatment: ""The doctors asked me to move home or get a reverse-osmosis water filter, but I can't afford to do either,"" he said./Pesticides, heavy metals and antibiotics leeching into the water table also find their way into our bodies through farm produce, poultry and dairy products. In the absence of Maximum Residual Limit for several crops, pesticide residues can go through the roof. ""Guidelines for pesticides in farming are not stringent and many farmers don't even know the maximum limits, they use pesticides at will to protect their crop,"" says Amit Khurana, food safety and toxins, CSE. Most of these chemicals are neurotoxic and carcinogenic. Smart samaritans: There are some trying to stem the toxic assault. All through July this year, Chandra Bhushan Tiwari, 43, gave away 11,000 saplings to people Lucknow, saying ""Take 'her' (sapling) with you. She is my daughter getting wedded into your home. Take care of her, because she cares for people from birth to cremation.""/Tiwari has been distributing and planting saplings every monsoons since 2006. He is close to his target of planting 1 lakh trees in his lifetime, having already planted over 85,000. ""I think, now when I am almost ready to attain the target, I can push it further up"", says Tiwari, a former Central School teacher, who chucked his job to take up his tree crusade full time./VK Bharadwaj, 55, took to cycling on the busy roads of Mumbai in November 2010 for three reasons. He had crossed the age of 50 and didn't want to be what he describes as a ""low hanging fruit"" for doctors, he wanted to reduce his dependence on fossil fuels, and lower expenses. ""The coal crisis got me to think of wanting to reduce my carbon footprint which in turn will reduce my fuel expenses,"" said Bharadwaj./""I bought a cycle for 30,000. That amounts to 1/km over three years as against 10/km had I used the car."" And he doesn't need to stop for refuelling./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Mumbai.

"Mumbai gasps, no breeze to blow pollutants away","umbai, Dec. 4 -- It is December and temperatures should have ideally started dipping. Instead, Mumbaiites have been experiencing sultry days, sluggish winds, and worse, inhaling air thick with poisonous pollutants./Experts have blamed a ""calm wind situation"" - an indication of climate change - for the spike in pollution levels as recorded by the state pollution control board, which has resulted in unseasonal incidences of infectious diseases and spurt in dengue cases./""Calm wind situation is unusual for this time of the year, which normally witnesses mild winds. This could be signals of climate change when sudden unusual and erratic weather patterns emerge; something that needs to be studied,"" said Gufran Beig, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. ""This is a difficult situation for the city as the climate is supposed to be cooler.""/This week started with a rise in minimum temperatures at five to six degrees above normal. And the absence of winds over the city is preventing nitrogen dioxide (NOx) and respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) from dispersing, resulting in smog./According to data by the MPCB, air pollution levels were twice the normal values all through November. NOx levels peaked at 268 micrograms per cubic meter of air (ug/m3) on November 28 at Sion and 175ug/ m3 at Bandra on November 14. While, RSPM levels were maximum 242ug/m3 on November 25 at Sion, it was 189ug/m3 at Bandra on November 14./The permissible limits for NOx and RSPM are 80ug/m3 and 100ug/ m3 respectively./""Increase in vehicular traffic, rise in temperature and lack of wind is creating heat islands in the city as result of which pollutants are getting trapped. This is an unusual situation,"" said Rakesh Kumar, Mumbai regional head, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Worli./Doctors also attributed unpredictable temperatures and manmade pollution for the spread of infectious diseases.

"Destroying water bodies, brick by brick","Kolkata, Dec. 29 -- Just outside our city without common people's knowledge, a huge change is taking place that will gradually result in an ecological disaster. Thousands of tons of topsoil, which supports plants and crops, is being dug up everyday from fertile farm lands to support the mushrooming brick kiln industry. Bheris (fish farms) are fast giving way to brick kilns under the watchful eyes of politicians, police, local mafias and brick kiln owners. The riverbed is being stripped off the sand and alluvium soil that could have supported vegetation to operate these kilns. The smoke billowing out of these kilns is polluting the air in the rural areas, which was once thought to be clean and free of pollution. And if this was not enough, rampant child labour is another cause for concern./HT brings you some shocking details about these brick kilns in a two-part series revealing how they are polluting and damaging our ecology and environment and the government is turning a blind eye to these problems despite repeated appeals by NGOs and locals./THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE/Even a few years back sights of large bheris flanking the Basanti Road on both sides were a common feature before one could reach Dhamakhali, Sonakhali or Godhkhali to go to Sunderbans. All one could see was large water bodies on the two sides of the road with thatched huts and trees dotting the horizon. Even two years ago a ride down the Basanti Road in a car was a pleasant experience, but the scene is fast changing and could change completely within a few years from now./Now, one is greeted by empty dried up bheries on the two sides of the road with puddles of water still trapped in some portions. Sometimes one gets to see scores of villagers - mostly women and children half-bent and searching for something in these puddles./""The bheries have dried up and would be sold soon. The water has been drawn out through pumps. We are digging the mud and searching for fish that have got trapped in the puddles. We usually get small-sized prawns, bhetkis and tilapias. They make a good lunch,"" said eight year-old Amanullah./As the car moves further, one could easily confuse the activities on the two sides of the road with archaeological excavation. Labourers THE LARGEST COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, AIRBUS A380, HAS A CARGO SPACE OF AROUND 6,500 CUBIC FEET. THIS MEANS IT WOULD NEED AT LEAST 60 SUCH AIRCRAFT TO LIFT THE AMOUNT OF SOIL REQUIRED TO PRODUCE JUST 40 TO 45 LAKH BRICKS seem busy searching for some treasure troves or finding the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Villagers could be seen digging up soil and removing them in carts to some other location. They have already dug up several feet and are still digging down further. But soon the truth is unfolded. Conical chimneys standing around 100 feet tall and jutting out of the fields, thick black smoke billowing out from them, stacks of unburnt bricks lying under the sun and piles of freshly backed reddish brown bricks indicate that all is not well in the Sunderbans./""The bheris and agricultural fields are fast giving way to an industry which is thriving in the area - brick kilns. Hundreds have come up over the past two to three years and more are being built regularly. Of the 70,000-odd hectares under fish cultivation, over 2,000 hectare has already been converted into brickfields, a majority in Minakha, Haroa, Sandeshkhali and Hingalganj,"" said Subhash Acharya, former joint director of the Sunderban affairs department./WHY THE CHANGE?/Dinabandhu Mondol, secretary of the Joygopalpur Youth Development Centre, gives an explanation for the change. Earlier the prawn cultivation in the bheries was mainly done with tiger prawn seeds collected from the rivers that flow through the region such as Bidyadhari and Raimangal. But in the early 90's, a private firm started fish farming in the area with the help of prawn seeds that were mainly brought from Chennai and Vizag. Medicines, fertilisers, pesticides and fish feed were rampantly used to increase the production. The results were startling. The produc- tion increased by at least 30 times and more and more bheri owners joined the race. Everything was going on in a picture perfect manner till one day a mysterious virus attacked the far ms and everything went haywire. Hordes of fishes died everyday and the lucrative business started incurring huge losses. The export fell as countries such as Japan stopped importing the prawns in which pesticides were detected. The firm abandoned its business and left the Sunderbans./""Then came the brick field owners. They took up the opportunity and coaxed the landowners to give away their land on lease for operating brick kilns. The offer was enticing. While the bheri operators were offering ' 5,000 per bigha for a year, the brick kiln owners were ready to shell out ' 10,000 - ' 12,000 a bigha for the same period,"" said Harun Al Rashid, secretary of DISHARI, a local NGO./The result was obvious. Landowners started giving away their land to brick kilns on lease instead of bheris. Over the past two to three years, hundreds of such brick kilns have cropped up in these areas and now they are everywhere./THE POWER GAME/A nexus between brickfield owners, panchayats and political parties is allowing rampant alteration in land use. Muscle power that once controlled the fisheries is now backing the brick business./""You need to get a number of licences to start a brick kiln. The first licence that you require is a trade licence to run the kiln. This is given by the local panchayat pradhan. Thereafter you need a firing licence which is issued by the BDO, a pollution certificate, which is given by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board among others,"" said Shahjahan Mondol who owns the Five Star Brick Field near Dhamakhali./Here comes the power play and the money game. The panchayats which are run by political parties issue these licences rampantly just for the sake of money which goes into the party's coffer. The rest is 'managed'. Sometimes even if a landowner declines to give away his land for setting up a brick field, he is forced to give in following pressure. Here comes the nexus between political parties, police, brickfield owners and local henchmen./""Sometimes, it has also been seen that when a bheri owner refuses to budge, pesticides such as folidol is used to kill the fishes overnight. The next day the bheri owner is forced to part with his business,"" said Rashid./A brickfield owner said they have to give royalty to the state government for the soil they use - ' 20 for 1,000 cubic feet of soil. This apart, they have to pay income tax and VAT to keep everything clear on paper./THE DAMAGE/Shahjahan Mondol, who is also the secretary of the Sandeshkhali Brickfield Owners' Association, said: ""Huge quantities of soil are required along with sand. While the soil comes from the abandoned bheris and agricultural lands, the sand comes from the adjacent Bidyadhari River and also the Raimangal River, which is a bit far off.""/But how much soil is exactly needed? He said: ""My brickfield produces around 40 - 45 lakh bricks every year. For this around four lakh cubic feet (cft) of soil is required,"" said Mondol./Now, for a better understanding, the largest commercial aircraft, Airbus A380, has a cargo space of around 6,500 cubic feet. This means it would need at least 60 such aircraft to lift the amount of soil required to produce 40 to 45 lakh bricks./""Now, imagine that amount of soil being dug up every year by just one brickfield. There are hundreds such brickfields in just one portion of North 24-Parganas,"" said Acharya, former joint director of the Sunderban affairs department./Ajanta Dey of Nature Environment and Wildlife Society (NEWS) said, ""In a few years from now when the soil gets exhausted brickfields will be deserted, leaving behind a scarred earth with gaping holes. These plots of land will be irrecoverable with no fish no paddy just barren lands.""/And it is not just soil. Sand is also needed for manufacturing bricks. In a 100 cubic feet mixture, 90 cft of soil and 10 cft of sand are mixed./""This entire sand comes from the river bed. Tons of sand are dug out of the riverbed and loaded in trucks to be taken to the brickfields. It's free money and a huge racket is involved in this. The entire racket is controlled by local mafias who have a nexus with politicians and police,"" said Rashid./ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AT STAKE/Thick black and white smoke billowing out of the conical chimneys standing high in the fields have triggered enormous environment pollution in the areas which were once thought to be free of air pollution./Being one of the biggest consumers of coal, these brick kilns have turned out to be one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide in the districts of South 24-Paragans and North 24-Parganas. Suspended particulate matter, ash, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and dust that these kilns give off pollute the air triggering all sorts of diseases./""My three-year-old son Sakil has already been detected with asthma. The smoke from the brickfields is to be blamed for this because one such kiln has recently come up within a few hundred metres of our house. When the smoke comes out we have to keep our doors and windows shut otherwise he gasps for breath,"" said Asraf Ali Mollah, a resident of Dhamakhali area./But Sakil is not the only one. The ash and smoke coming out of the kilns have led to an alarming rise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and tuberculosis cases among other respiratory problems./""In a recent survey on basic healthcare and support programme, we stumbled upon some shocking results. In one subcentre at Noapara in Taki, the number of tuberculosis patients jumped to 327 in 2013, up from 270 in 2010, 276 in 2011 and 290 in 2012,"" said Satyajit Maity of Hasnabad Rural Lokdeep Society./But it is not just human health that is under threat. It may be recalled that in 2005 the state pollution control board had ordered shutdown of at least 60 brick kilns during the mango season in five districts - North 24-Parganas, Malda, Murshidabad, Hooghly and Nadia. The reason being smoke and ash from the brickfields posing hazards to the mango orchards when they were about to bear fruits. A section of the brickfield owners had moved the Supreme Court, but even the apex court had dismissed the petition./WHAT SAY BRICK KILNS OWNERS?/Repeated attempts to reach Uttam Kumar Roy, the president of the Bengal Brick Kiln Owners' Association, failed./A senior representative of the association, however, claimed that though several brickfields have mushroomed in the districts over the past few years, most of them are not under the banner of the association. They act individually./""Our members have always adhered to rules and regulations. We pay taxes, have trade licences and even NOCs from the state pollution control boards,"" claimed the official./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Kolkata.

India down 32 ranks to No. 155 on environment protection list,"umbai, Jan. 29 -- It's no surprise that pollution is a perpetual problem in India. But it's definitely disheartening to hear that India has slipped 32 ranks in the global Environment Performance Index ( EPI) 2014 to rank a lowly 155 and its capital Delhi has earned the tag of being the world's most polluted city./A comparative study of 178 countries on nine environmental parameters released earlier this month by Yale University in the US shows that one of the world's fastest growing economies is a disaster on the environmental front./What's worse, India's pollution levels could be playing havoc with the health of citizens. ""A bottom performer on nearly every policy issue included in the 2014 EPI, with the exception of forests, fisheries and water resources, India's performance lags most notably in the protection of human health from environmental harm,"" said a statement issued by Yale./The study described India's air pollution as the worst in the world, tying with China in terms of the proportion of population exposed to average air pollution levels exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds./A deeper look at the data gathered by a Nasa satellite showed that Delhi had the highest particulate matter 2.5 pollution levels followed by Beijing./Delhi, with 810 million registered vehicles, has repeatedly beaten the Chinese capital on particulate matter pollution. The high PM2.5 pollution caused by high vehicle density and industrial emissions is the reason for the dense smog that has been engulfing Delhi during the winter months in the last few years, with adverse health implications. And while Beijing's infamous smog has hogged headlines and prompted government action, even led to the announcement of rewards for cutting back on pollution, the dangers in Delhi have been largely ignored. According to a study by the Harvard International Review, every two in five persons in Delhi suffer from respiratory ailments. The Lancet's Global Health Burden 2013 report termed air pollution the sixth biggest human killer in India. The WHO last year termed air pollution carcinogenic. Particles smaller t han 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5 in shorthand) are fine enough to lodge deep in human lung and blood tissue and cause diseases ranging from stroke to lung cancer, the Yale study said. Anumita Roy Chaudhary, executive director of Delhi-based advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment, said policymakers have failed to take the kind of action needed to check phenomenal growth in air pollution in India. ""The gains of the introduction of CNG in 2000 have been lost. We are heading for dark days if policy-makers fail to wake up to the growing environmental health hazard,"" she said. The Central Pollution Control Board's report of 2011 said only two cities, Kochi and Coimbatore, met the national ambient air quality standards, which are six times higher than WHO standards. Air pollution in half of the 280 Indian cities monitored has been termed critical or hazardous for human health. ""Air pollution levels in almost all cities are on the upward trend,"" said a CPCB scientist./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Mumbai.

"Centre in denial, data finds Delhi air worse than Beijing","New Delhi, Jan. 30 -- Delhi might be the most polluted city in the world but the government insists that the Capital's air is not as bad as that of Beijing - contrary to the real time data available in public domain./The air-quality monitoring wing of the ministry of earth sciences has claimed that Delhi's particulate matter 2.5 pollution levels never crossed 350 microgram per cubic metre (m/cum) while for Beijing, it was higher than 500 microgram and even reached 650 microgram./The data is based on information collected from the ministry's nine monitoring stations and doesn't take into account records of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board./Had it done that, it would have found that pollution levels on January 24 at Shahdara and Mandir Marg were alarming - more than 900m/cum during evening rush hour. On Tuesday, the levels dropped to average between 230 m/cum and 430 m/cum at places such as Mandir Marg, Anand Vihar and Punjabi Bagh./The WHO, which last year termed polluted air as a carcinogen, says PM2.5 at 10 m/cum is safe. India's safety mark is 60 microgram./HT on Wednesday did another check on PM2.5 data and Delhi again beat Beijing flat. While Chinese's capital recorded a pollution level of 275 m/cum, Delhi University's PM 2.5 level was 500 m/cum and ITO's 360 at 7pm./Moreover, the daily PM2.5 levels available for Beijing for 2013 showed that these varied from less than 50 m/cum to as high as 400 m/cum but largely remained below 250 m/cum, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said./But for Delhi, where air pollution is higher in winter than in other seasons, the daily average for November 2013 and January 2014 period shows that pollution has hovered around 240 m/cum -almost four times higher than the Indian standard. It even went as high as 575 m/cum, CSE said. Even at its highest, Beijing's winter level didn't go beyond 400 m/cum./The results of Yale University Environment Perfor mance Index ( EPI) giving Delhi the worst ranking may differ from India's stations monitoring air pollution. Yale findings are more reliable as the data is collected from independent sources and environmental satellites fitted with sensors./Station monitoring provides correct exposure level only at a particular place, while satellite-based measurements are more universal, helping draw a clearer comparison between cities./Particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5 in shorthand) are fine enough to lodge deep in human lung and blood tissue and cause diseases ranging from stroke to lung cancer, the Yale study said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Breathing hard in Delhi's winter,"New Delhi, Jan. 31 -- Each winter, 15% of the patients with moderate to severe breathing problems at the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) are healthy persons with no diagnosed respiratory illness./""We notice a sharp increase in respiratory and cardiac cases within 24 to 48 hours whenever there is an increase in pollution levels, especially during winters,"" says Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders, AIIMS./Air pollution not just causes lung cancer but also wreaks havoc with people's cardio-pulmonary system, which involves the heart and the lung. To provide clinching evidence of how poor air quality affects health of people, Dr Guleria is spearheading a study to track the hazards of air pollution./Though it is too premature to talk about the findings, Dr Guleria acknowledges that it does establish a direct correlation between rising pollution levels and immense stress on the heart and the lung./Air pollution is the fifth largest killer in India, causing 620,000 premature deaths, said the Global Burden of Disease Report released in 2013./""Air-pollution is as bad for the heart as smoking - in patients with cardiac history, symptoms become worse and for a healthy young person it is a high-risk factor,"" says Dr KK Talwar, director - cardiology, Max Healthcare./The World Health Organisation has classified air pollution as a Class-1 carcinogen because it is directly linked to lung cancer./Apart from the heart and the lungs, doctors warn against equally serious side-effects of air pollution on the reproductive system, eyes, bones and even causing mutation in certain genes./Over the last five years, not only are more people reporting symptoms but the the duration and severity of symptoms has also seen a rise./""Mild health gains of improved air quality after CNG was introduced in Delhi in 2002 have been negated in the last five years. With the rising vehicles on the roads, the pollution levels are significantly higher. Delhi now needs an on-going plan to curb pollution, as short-term ones are redundant,"" Dr Guleria added./Long- ter m ef fect causes irreversible damage. ""There is a rapid decline observed in the lung capacity and lung function of people living in heavily polluted cities like Delhi./It is almost like smoking-a person may have never smoked but his or her lungs are like that of a heavy smoker,"" said Dr Guleria./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.
