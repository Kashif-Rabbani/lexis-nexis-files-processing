Brooms fuelling pollution," NEW DELHI, India, Dec. 23 -- THE AGE-OLD practice of sweeping roads with brooms significantly adds to morning haze in the Capital, reducing visibility that motorists struggle with almost everyday during winters, says a new study on air pollution./  Close to one lakh Municipal Corporation of Delhi workers sweep the streets of the Capital in the morning hours, contributing 25 per cent to the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the air during that time, said Professor Arun Attri at Jawaharlal Nehru University's School of Environmental Sciences./  The presence of RSPM in excess of 50g in one cubic metre of air increases the risk of cardiopulmonary diseases, stressed respiratory physiology, mortality and morbidity. This winter, its level has hovered up to three times the 50g mark in Delhi's air. The study turns on its head the long-held belief that the main sources for morning smog were vehicle emission and industrial pollution./  The study, to be published in the next issue of global journal Atmospheric Environment, found a sudden jump in RSPM levels in the Capital's air at the time when the roads are manually cleaned in the morning. In cold winter mornings, the fine pollution particles remain suspended in the air we breathe for a longer time, causing low visibility and fuelling asthma attacks. ""It is only when the sun filters through the thick morning smog and it becomes little warmer that the RSPM level goes down,"" Attri said./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
SOS! Delhi's polluted air is killing people," NEW DELHI, India, Dec. 25 -- Like all other girls her age, four-year-old Sanchali Srivastava goes to nursery school and loves her Barbies, the colour pink and Cartoon Network. Unlike most of her friends, however, she carries an inhaler in her schoolbag every day to control her frequent wheezing and asthma attacks./  Her wheezing keeps her parents Sanchal and Rupali up most nights. The mother has asthma as well. ""I cough a lot in class and all my teachers know I'm not well. At times, I can't breathe at all,"" said Sanchali, who studies in nursery class at the Aravalli International school in Faridabad. ""It is not nice but I can't help it. I don't like it when I can't swim like my friends,"" she says./  Delhi's air pollution did this to her. Across the national capital and its suburbs, polluted air is killing people, bringing down the quality of life, and leaving people feeling ill and tired. A survey by the Central Pollution Control Board and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences survey showed that a majority of people living in Delhi suffered from eye irritation, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and poor lung functioning./  One in 10 people have asthma in Delhi. Worse, the winter months bring respiratory attacks and wheezing to many non-asthmatics who are old, who smoke, have respiratory infections or chronic bronchitis./  At Sanchali's home, there is something within quick reach, something more important than her Barbie - her nebulizer, a device used to deliver medication quickly into the lungs in the form of a liquid mist. ""She hasn't been sleeping well. The doctor used a nebulizer last night as the breathlessness was making it impossible for her to eat or sleep,"" says her father Sanchal Srivastava, who works as a human resources manager for Tata Consultancy Services in Gurgaon. He has informed the school about her asthma. The teachers keep a close watch. It is a constant battle./  ""She gets chest infections eight to 10 times a year which usually develop into full asthmatic attacks. Some doctors have told us she may get better once her lungs develop and her airways get bigger. Right now, we are keeping our fingers crossed,"" says Rupali./  The couple chose to shift to Faridabad from Delhi two years ago after their daughter was diagnosed with asthma. ""Delhi's air is very polluted, and Gurgaon is as bad. My wife developed asthma after she got married and moved to Delhi from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh at the age of 23. We moved to the suburbs because we thought the air would be cleaner, but Faridabad's proximity to Delhi and the development boom is making things as bad here,"" says Sanchal, who drives three to four hours each day to reach his Gurgaon office. ""Commuting is a pain, but I think things would have been worse for her in Delhi or Gurgaon. My daughter's health is far more important.""/  Rupali is a full-time mom because she has to keep an eye on her daughter. ""I worked part-time for a while after Sanchali was born but had to give it up because I was needed at home to ensure she was okay. I don't really mind,"" she says./  According to the World Health Organisation, pollution causes 777,000 deaths worldwide every year, 531,000 of them in Asia. ""The cold combined with chest infection worsens symptoms of breathlessness and can cause respiratory failure even in people who are not chronic asthmatics,"" says Dr J.N. Pande, former head of the Department for medicine, AIIMS, and currently with the Sitaram Bhartia Institute./  ""The winter smog is back this year. What do you expect? Delhi has 4 million registered vehicles, with another 1,000 being added to the roads each day,"" says Sunita Narain, director of Centre for Science and Environment. Efforts to control air pollution by introducing tighter Euro II standards for vehicles, lowering of sulphur content in fuel, introducing compressed natural gas for public transport and re-routing trucks outside the city did make some difference, but not for long./  ""Despite all these moves, the sheer number of new vehicles drown all the gains. We need to \x85 address new challenges such as the boom in the number of private vehicles, and in particular, diesel vehicles,"" says Narain./  Until then, Ishan Jain, 5, will have to live with this at his Gurgaon home. He still cannot hold a pencil right but effortlessly uses an inhaler and a nebulizer. He began wheezing within days of his parents moving from Chennai to Delhi three years ago. ""I cannot breathe most of the time, it is as if an elephant is sitting on my chest,"" he says./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air Pollution reduces foetus size during pregnancy: Study," Washington, Jan. 8 -- Researchers from Brisbane have given the world yet another reason to curb pollution levels by finding that it plays an important role in shrinking the size of the foetus during pregnancy./  In the study, the research team led by Dr Adrian Barnett, senior research fellow Queensland University of Technology, based at QUT's Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, compared the foetus sizes of more than 15,000 ultrasound scans in Brisbane to air pollution levels within a 14km radius of the city./  ""The study found that mothers with a higher exposure to air pollution had foetuses that were, on average, smaller in terms of abdominal circumference, head circumference and femur length,"" said Dr Barnett./  According to Dr. Barnett, the 10-year-old study examined foetuses between 13 and 26 weeks duration. /  ""To our knowledge this is the first study of its kind as it uses ultrasound measurement as a direct estimate of growth, rather than using birth weight as a delayed measure of growth. When analysing scans from women at different distances to monitoring sites, we found that there was a negative relationship between pollutants such as sulphur dioxide found in diesel emissions, and ultrasound measurement. If the pollution levels were high the size of the foetus decreased significantly,"" said Dr Barnett.""/  He also said that foetus size during pregnancy was important as it was shown by research that bigger babies were healthier in childhood and adulthood,./  ""Birth weight is a major predictor of later health, for example, bigger babies have been shown to have higher IQs in childhood and lower risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood,"" he said./  Dr. Barnett advised that it was wise for pregnant women to try to reduce their exposure to air pollution, most of which is caused by vehicles./  The study is published in the international journal Environmental Health Perspectives./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Ultra fine particles in air pollution cause heart disease," Washington, Jan. 18 -- It's not only fatty foods and smoking that can be detrimental to your health, but air pollution as well, for a new study has revealed that the most minute particles of vehicle emissions may trigger plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke. /  The researchers also found a way in which pollutant particles can promote hardening of the arteries -- by inactivating the protective qualities of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, known as ""good"" cholesterol. /  The study was led by Dr. Andre Nel, UCLA's chief of nanomedicine and a researcher at UCLA's California NanoSystems Institute. /  ""It appears that the smallest air pollutant particles, which are the most abundant in an urban environment, are the most toxic. This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of nano-sized air pollutants to promote atherosclerosis in an animal model,"" said first author Dr. Jesus Araujo, assistant professor of medicine and director of environmental cardiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA./  Less than 0.18 micrometers, Nanoparticles are the size of a virus or molecule, or about one-thousandth the size of a human hair. These particles are too small to capture in a filter. /  ""We hope our findings offer insight into the impact of nano-sized air pollutant particles and help explore ways for stricter air quality regulatory guidelines,"" said Nel, principal investigator and a researcher at UCLA's California NanoSystems Institute.  / He added that air pollution and secondhand smoke had similar consequences on cardiovascular health. Pollution particles emitted by vehicles and other combustion sources contain a high concentration of organic chemicals that could be released deep into the lungs or even spill over into the systemic circulation. /  In the study, mice with high cholesterol were exposed to one of two sizes of air pollutant particles from downtown Los Angeles freeway emissions and compared them with mice that received filtered air that contained very few particles. /  It was found that mice exposed to ultrafine particles exhibited 55 pct greater atherosclerotic-plaque development than animals breathing filtered air and 25 pct greater plaque development than mice exposed to fine-sized particles. /  ""This suggests that ultrafine particles are the more toxic air pollutants in promoting events leading to cardiovascular disease,"" said Araujo. /  The findings of this research appear in the recent online edition of the journal Circulation Research./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Mobiles, deodorants and coffee won't cause you cancer"," Melbourne, Feb. 4 -- People can now breathe a sigh of relief for a new report designed to combat urban myths has found that mobile phones, coffee and deodorants are not likely to cause cancer./  The report was compiled by Australian cancer specialist Professor Brendan Stewart at the University of New South Wales and has been published in the academic journal Mutation Research Reviews./  Titled ""Banding carcinogenic risks in developed countries: A procedural basis for qualitative assessment"", the article looked at all available research not only to determine which chemicals or activities were most likely to cause the dreaded disease, but also to find out which are the greatest risk to people./  Based on his findings, Professor Stewart said that coffee, artificial sweeteners, deodorants, dental fillings and breast implants were extremely unlikely to cause the disease./  However, those most likely to cause cancer are smoking, drinking alcohol and deliberate exposure to sunlight./  ""In terms of most deaths caused and the potential to save the most lives, cigarettes are number one,"" News.com.au quoted Prof Stewart, as saying./  ""Cigarettes are the only consumer product which are lethal when used in accordance with the manufacturer's intention. In terms of proven risk, tobacco smoking and asbestos are equal in terms of the nature of the evidence; but in terms of numbers of people dying, tobacco is far worse."" /  Also likely to cause the disease are air pollution, solarium tanning, smoking marijuana and some chemicals in processed meats./  He also said that the media reports were leaving people confused and alarmed unnecessarily./   ""People are incredibly confused. When they read stories in the media about different studies in isolation it is difficult for them to know how much concern they should attach to it,"" he said. /  ""I found a way of ordering the evidence in terms of carcinogenicity and the evidence of the circumstances of exposure. It is important to ensure that attention given to proven means of preventing cancer is not reduced by unnecessary public concern about risks that may have no impact at all.""/  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Satellite data to provide unparalleled air quality information," Washington, Feb. 6 -- In a move to provide 'state-of-the-art' information on air pollution causing millions of premature deaths around the world, The European Environment Agency (EEA) has finalised an agreement with an ESA-led conglomerate./  As per the agreement, EEA will use a service that combines and processes satellite data with surface measurements from 29 European countries to deliver accurate information on air quality everyday, to support the implementation of European air-quality policies./  ""Sophisticated processing and satellite data from ESA will combine to deliver state-of-the-art information on air quality. This will allow EEA to get the most from ground-based measurements collected through its networks. I am excited about the opportunity that this service creates to help us provide timely information on Europe's environment at an unprecedented level,"" said EEA Project Manager Tim Haigh. /  The 'Integrated Air Quality Platform for Europe' service, part of the ESA GMES (Global Monitoring for the Environment and Security) PROMOTE (PROtocol MOniToring for the GMES Service Element) project, was developed to provide end-users information about air quality and is currently providing forecasts for up to 72 hours at a resolution of 50 km. /  This service comprises of data on ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (the sum of all particles suspended in air, including dust, smoke, pollen, etc.). According to Wold Health Organisation (WHO), exposure to these pollutants can lead to adverse health effects like decreased lung function, increased respiratory symptoms and allergic responses. /  The service takes into account an ensemble approach by combining three different and thoroughly validated air-quality models: MOCAGE (Meteo-France), EURAD (RIU), and CHIMERE (INERIS). All these models combine together with satellite data using different data assimilation techniques and generate consistent information about air quality./  The Service Level Agreement (SLA) was signed between EEA and the French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks (INERIS) and the German Space Agency (DLR). /  ""A median model ensemble provides air quality forecasts and analyses that are superior to any single model simulation, combining the strengths of different models, and allows [for the] representation of the range of variability of the model responses that is a part of their inherent uncertainty. Therefore, decision makers and regulatory-purpose applications will benefit from this PROMOTE service,"" said Laurence Rouil from INERIS. /  With supporting air quality policies, the service also offers the wider public ability for a better protection of their health by avoiding exposure and taking measures to reduce air pollution./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Car exhaust fumes may damage the heart," London, Feb. 19 -- Breathing car exhaust fumes can trigger heart disease and increase the risk of strokes, say researchers./  The study found that the chemicals released during the burning of petrol and other fuels weakened the heart's ability to pump effectively and can lead to irregular heartbeats./  Dr John Incardona, a biologist and toxicologist at the West Coast Centre for Oceans and Human Health, in Seattle, said that the research suggests that millions of people living in large cities are effectively ""breathing an aerosolised oil spill""./  In the study, the researchers exposed zebrafish embryos to the most abundant PAHs found in oil and petrol, and found that smaller PAHs caused the developing heart to beat more weakly and with an abnormal rhythm. A failure to pump properly caused fluid build-up./  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are compounds released during the combustion of fossil fuels./  ""The available data suggests that these PAHs are present in burning oil in levels high enough to result in pharmacologically active levels in the human blood stream,"" the Telegraph quoted Incardona, as saying./  ""Once in the bloodstream, they are likely to be toxic to the human heart, and should be considered prime suspects for the health effects of urban air. In essence, people in big cities are breathing an aerosolized oil spill./  ""A physician who knowingly gave an aerosolised particle toxin to a patient with coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure would probably be sued for malpractice. But the air in our cities is doing just that to millions every day unknowingly,"" he added./  Dr Incardona added: ""It turns out that fish hearts even in the embryo function more like human hearts than even mice or rats, the usual test animals in human health studies./  ""Every time your burn something you generate PAHs. The smaller PAHs have been largely ignored because they are not carcinogenic./  ""Here is this relative mystery of how air pollution could possibly start a heart arrhythmia in humans. This is a very simple hypothesis and I think these compounds need to be looked at as a source of cardiovascular impacts of air pollution.""/  The study was presented at the Annual Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conference in Boston./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Diesel exhaust inhalation 'alters brain function'," Washington, March 11 -- An hour of sniffing diesel fumes in a busy city street may not just give you headache - it can alter the way your brain functions, says a new research which shows that inhaling exhaust induces a stress response in the brain's activity./  The research, led by Paul Borm from Zuyd University in The Netherlands, has for the first time demonstrtated that inhalation actually alters brain activity./  In the study, 10 volunteers were made to spend one hour in a room filled with either clean air or exhaust from a diesel engine. They were wired up to an electroencephalograph (EEG), a machine that records the electrical signals of the brain, and their brain waves were monitored during the exposure period and for one hour after they left the room./  The analyses after 30 minutes found that the diesel exhaust began to affect brain activity. The EEG data suggested that the brain displayed a stress response, indicative of changed information processing in the brain cortex, which continued to increase even after the subjects had left the exposure chamber./  The concentration of diesel exhaust that the subjects breathed was set to the highest level that people might encounter in the environment or at work, for example on a busy road or in a garage./   ""We believe our findings are due to an effect nanoparticles or 'soot' particles that are major component of diesel exhaust. These may penetrate to the brain and affect brain function. We can only speculate what these effects may mean for the chronic exposure to air pollution encountered in busy cities where the levels of such soot particles can be very high,"" Borm said./  One link to understanding the mechanism of this effect is that oxidative stress is one consequence of particles depositing in tissue and oxidative stress has also been implicated in degenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease./   ""It is conceivable that the long-term effects of exposure to traffic nanoparticles may interfere with normal brain function and information processing,"" Borm said. /  ""Further studies are necessary to explore this effect, and to assess the relationship between the amount of exposure to particles and the brain's response and, and investigate the clinical implications of these novel findings,"" he added./  The study is published in the journal Particle and Fibre Toxicology./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Using sunscreen can be injurious to health," NEW DELHI, India, March 30 -- Wearing sunscreen does not automatically protect you. At least that is what the American advocacy group, Environmental Working Group just discovered. The EWG studied the ingredients in sunscreens and found that 84% of the 588 branded sunscreen products they studied contain oxybenzone./  The problem with oxybenzone is that the CDC-Centre for Disease Control-has just recently found it toxic and linked it to hormone disruption, cell damage and allergies. In fact, a survey of 2500 Americans, released last week, showed that 97% of them had absorbed oxybenzone in their bodies. A related new study makes the impact more complex : it shows that women who absorbed this chemical actually give birth to girls who were underweight./  What compounds this problem is callousness- the chemical has not been studied for safety since the 1970s. Science of course, progresses and we learn new things over time. But policies have to keep up with that too. There is not much we can do at once, because it will take several years before we get safe sunscreen in the market. But we can read labels and use other devices to buffer the skin from the sun./  Earth Hour in absentia/  The good thing about Earth Hour, even in absentia in India was it forced a lot of people to talk about global warming. When my home page, which is google, opened on Saturday, the backdrop was inky black for an hour. The darkness reminded users to switch off the lights. In that instant, many of us realized how privileged we were to have electricity at all. In this peak summer season, we usually know that the power shortage can be as high as 15 per cent./  Google also spoilt the fun by informing us that the reason it didn't do this permanently was that it wouldn't matter at our end-screens use the same amount of power, whatever they display. But then, at home, you don't have to opt to switch off the lights. Powercuts do the job everywhere. Although most of us should cut down our use and protest against commercial decorations that use lights everywhere, we are enmeshed in a larger problem./  It is that we have a shortfall that will be made up for by setting up ultra mega coal run power plants. These plants are expected not only to displace a few million people, but create even more greenhouse warming, not to mention air pollution. But if we don't, then how can every village ever have electricity? It's not only a matter of demand, it's a need. What do you think are our options?/  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
NASA begins airborne probe into pollution's impact on arctic atmosphere," Washington, April 2 -- NASA is starting a field campaign to investigate the chemistry of the Arctic's lower atmosphere this week to discern how air pollution contributes to climate changes in the Arctic. /  The NASA Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) aircraft mission is the most extensive field campaign ever to investigate the atmosphere's role in the climate-sensitive Arctic region./  ""It's important that we go to the Arctic to understand the atmospheric contribution to warming in a place that's rapidly changing. We are in a position to provide the most complete characterization to date for a region that is seldom observed but critical to understanding climate change,"" said Jim Crawford, manager of the Tropospheric Chemistry Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. /  During the campaign, which begins in Fairbanks, Alaska, NASA's aircraft will serve as airborne laboratories for the next three weeks. The aircraft will be equipped with instruments to measure air pollution gases and aerosols and solar radiation. /  Experts say that of particular interest is the formation of the springtime ""arctic haze"". The return of sunlight to the Arctic in the spring fuels chemical reactions of pollutants that have accumulated over the winter after travelling long distances from lower latitudes./  ""The Arctic is a poster child of global change and we don't understand the processes that are driving that rapid change. We need to understand it better and that's why we're going,"" said Daniel Jacob, an ARCTAS project scientist at Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass./  The researchers hope that the data collected during the project will help improve computer models used to study global atmospheric chemistry and climate, and, eventually, provide scientists with a better idea of how pollutants are transported to and around the Arctic and their impact on the environment and climate./  ""We haven't looked at pollution transport in a comprehensive fashion. We can see Arctic haze coming in but we don't know its composition or how it got there. One goal of ARCTAS is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the aerosol composition, chemistry and climate effects in the Arctic region,"" said Hanwant Singh, an ARCTAS project scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California./  The new aircraft observations will also help researchers interpret data from NASA satellites orbiting over the Arctic, and thus provide scientists with a better understanding of the atmospheric side of the climate question./  ""We're interested in data that will help models better characterize the current state of the atmosphere, to set a benchmark for them so we can gain confidence in their ability to predict future warming in the Arctic,"" Crawford said./  A second phase of the ARCTAS campaign takes place this summer from Cold Lake in Alberta, Canada, where flights will focus on measurements of emissions from forest fires./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Excess pneumonia deaths linked to car exhaust fumes," London, April 15 -- High levels of pollution from vehicle exhaust fumes and other types of fuel combustion are closely linked to excess deaths due to pneumonia, say researchers./  In the research, scientists from Birmingham University studied atmospheric emissions in England for the period 1996-2004 and attributed some 4,000 extra pneumonia deaths each year to engine pollution./  The study reports a ""strong correlation"" between high levels of pollution and the deaths of thousands of people in England./  In total, 390,000 people died of pneumonia during the eight years examined. Researcher also linked pollution to higher rates of some cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and rheumatic heart disease./  Further analysis, allowing for the effects of the social factors, showed that pneumonia deaths were strongly and independently linked to emissions, with the exception of sulphur dioxide from coal burning./  The primary culprits were emissions associated with oil combustion, including vehicle exhaust fumes./  During the eight years of the study there were almost 390.000 deaths from pneumonia./  ""Total annual losses as a result of air pollution probably approach those of the 1952 London smog,"" the British Medical Journal quoted the study's author, as saying./  Because the links were so strong across all categories of exposure and deaths were so much higher than would be expected, this suggests that these pollutants directly damage lung tissue, the author said./  The study is published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
A dose of dirt to boost your immunity," NEW DELHI, India, May 3 -- Everywhere you go, you run into people wheezing, sniffing, coughing or gasping, which makes you wonder whether anyone is really safe from asthma. Apart from the usual triggers such as air pollution and pollen, research has consistently shown that food colour, food additives, obesity, secondhand smoke, poorly ventilated homes and workplaces (10 per cent of adult asthma is work-related), fumes, stress, cold weather, domestic violence and even relationships breaking up, become asthma triggers in people with sensitive (hyperallergic) airways./  So what makes airways sensitive? It's all about how your immune system reacts to what it considers an assault on the body. An asthma attack occurs when an allergen or another stress factor causes an immune reaction that leads to inflammation (swelling) in the airways./  The airways get constricted, narrowing air passage and reducing air flow in the lungs. This causes wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Asthma attacks can last for a few minutes to days and can/  become life-threatening if not treated./  It's perhaps not surprising that more and more airways are buckling under the combined attack of so many new triggers. But then again, no one has convincingly explained why people in more sterile environments have higher incidence of asthma than others who live in badly ventilated hovels that they share with dust, mites, pets and people with suspect hygiene./  There is a popular hygiene hypothesis that blames increasing asthma cases to the growing lack of exposure to bacteria and viruses in early childhood, which it says prevents the body from developing a healthy immunity./  I don't quite buy this, mainly because this theory should mean that children who have been ill very often in early childhood would have a lower risk of asthma in later life. The reverse is true. Overuse of antibiotics in early childhood actually increases risk of asthma in later life./  What is more convincing is the modified hygiene hypothesis, which says that more than exposure to germs and organisms that cause disease, it is exposure to harmless bacteria and fungi found in dirt and vegetation that makes the immune system healthy and prevents it from overacting to allergens./  Earlier this week, two large studies supported this theory. One, from the University of Columbia in the US, found asthma cases went down by 25 per cent among children who lived in neighbourhoods with lots of trees. Another, from the Institute of Epidemiology in Munich in Germany, used blood test reports to confirm yet again that having a dog in the house boosts children's immune system, as opposed to children suddenly exposed to inhaled allergens such as house mites and pollen./  Earlier studies have also shown that living in farms among animals, having many older siblings and attending day care at an early age offer protection against asthma, most likely because all these situations translate into more exposure to germs - both good and bad - in early childhood./  This celebration of germs and dirt is likely to make you wonder, how dirty is too dirty? It is premature to advocate giving children dirt or germ pills for breakfast, but don't worry about an occasional slush football or romp in the park0 with the family pet as long as they wash up -the children not the dogs - before meals. Whenever you feel squeamish, just remind yourself it's all about strengthening up their immunity./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Biofuel blunder creates smoky blanket over Bihar,"NEW DELHI, India, May 4 -- Inefficient burning of a variety of biofuels by rural women in Bihar during cooking and other domestic use, specially those living on either side of Ganga, is leaving concentrated pool of particles over large rural areas with high population density./Scientists have now found that this has created an immense pool of pollution over Bihar, blanketing around one crore people primarily in the Ganga Valley. The pollution levels in this arc around Patna have been found to be about five times higher than those typically found over Los Angeles./This can affect both human health and local climate. Airborne particles can damage delicate lung tissues and by altering the radiative heating profile of the atmosphere, the particles may change temperature precipitation patterns and alter the ecosystem radically./""Particles in the smoke remain close to the ground trapped by valley walls and unable to mix upward because of a high-pressure system that dominates the region during winter,"" Larry Di Girolamo, a co-investigator and professor of atmospheric sciences at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, USA has observed./The discovery over the Ganga near Patna was made by researchers under him analysing four years of data collected by the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) onboard the Terra satellite, lofted into orbit on December 18, 1999. Terra is the flagship of NASA's Earth Observing System Program./Girolamo said, ""The study is most comprehensive and detailed examination of industrial smoke and other air pollution particles over the Indian subcontinent to date. It reveals how topography meteorology and human activity help determine where these particles are concentrated"".

Indoor pollution: A lurking health hazard," NEW DELHI, India, May 11 -- POLLUTANTS IN the safe environs of a house are equally dangerous if compared to those in the open. According to experts, indoor pollution is proving to be a potential health hazard for the masses. But more serious is the fact that almost 90 per cent of people are oblivious to this health risk./  Former principal of Ganesh Shanker Vidhyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College and tuberculosis and respiratory disease expert Prof SK Katiyar has carried out a detailed study on indoor pollutants./  The report says that poor ventilation in houses is adding to the danger of indoor pollutants. ""The smoke inhaled by a housewife during cooking and other members due to poor ventilation is more or less the same as smoking 20 packets of cigarettes a day,"" said Prof Katiyar./  He said the environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) within the four walls of a house is manifold and more dangerous than smoking in a public place. The report states that dust mites are the most common agents producing allergy not only in Kanpur city but also throughout the country./  Dust mites are minute living organisms, which breed in carpets, furnishing and mattresses. Prof Katiyar said volatile chemicals like paint and varnish are also a major source of household pollution./  The professor's report states that vehicles contribute to 72 per cent, industries 20 per cent and domestic chores 8 per cent of overall air pollution. ""The respiratory tract is the most challenged frontline of the body being exposed to 15,000 litres of air each day,"" he said./  Exposure to air pollution can cause lung cancer, faster decline in pulmonary functions and altered host defence which may also lead to increased infections like pneumonia, tuberculosis and asthma./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air pollution linked to deep vein thrombosis risk," Washington, May 13 -- Researchers at Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, have found that long-term exposure to air pollution appears to be associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, blood clots in the thigh or legs./  Exposure to particulate air pollution has been associated with the increased risk of developing or dying from heart disease and stroke. /  And recent studies have suggested that this relationship may result at least in part from the effects of particulate air pollution on blood clotting./  For the study, Andrea Baccarelli, M.D., Ph.D., of the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, and colleagues assessed exposure to particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter among 870 patients who had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in Lombardy, Italy, between 1995 and 2005. /  These patients, along with 1,210 controls who did not have deep vein thrombosis, were assigned to one of nine geographic regions based on where they lived at the time of the study. /  The researchers then used the average concentration of particulate matter for each area, obtained by monitors located at 53 different sites throughout the region, to estimate the level of exposure over the year before diagnosis (for cases) or examination (for controls)./  Researchers found that individuals with deep vein thrombosis tended to have a higher exposure to particulate air pollution than controls. /  After taking into account other environmental and health factors, for every increase in particulate matter of 10 micrograms per square meter the previous year, the risk of deep vein thrombosis increased 70 percent. /  In addition, researchers found that the blood of patients in both the case and control groups with higher levels of exposure to particulate matter took less time to clot, as measured by a test given in the clinic./  The link between particle exposure and blood clots was found to be stronger in men than in women, and disappeared among women taking oral contraceptives or hormone therapy. /  ""Such hormone therapies are independent risk factors for deep vein thrombosis, which is also confirmed in this study by the higher prevalence of oral contraceptive and hormone use in the cases compared with the controls,"" the authors said./  ""Given the magnitude of the observed effects and the widespread diffusion of particulate pollutants, our findings introduce a novel and common risk factor into the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis and, at the same time, give further substance to the call for tighter standards and continued efforts aimed at reducing the impact of urban air pollutants on human health,"" they added./  The study is published in the May 12 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives journals./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Harvesting natural gas from rotting manure can help rural families in India," London, May 13 -- A new study by a scientist of Indian origin, has determined that by harvesting natural gas from rotting manure, rural families can slash their energy costs, improve their health and help preserve local forests./  According to a report in New Scientist, Govindasamy Agoramoorthy of Tajen University and Minna Hsu of National Sun Yat-sen University, both in Taiwan, surveyed 125 rural households in India that use biogas plants./  The researchers have said that the use of biogas plants, which store the decomposing manure and capture the natural gas it releases, could improve rural farmers' livelihoods, while protecting the environment./  Biogas digesters are used across the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and Latin America, but few rigorous studies have been done of their overall costs and benefits./  These plants, also called digesters, typically take the form of a sealed brick-lined pit, in which the manure ferments. /  The biogas that escapes from the manure is half carbon dioxide, but about half methane, the main component of natural gas, and is piped off to be burnt in stoves or gas lamps./  Many families in these rural Indian areas own several cows and buffalo, supplying them with a few dozen kilos of manure a day - enough to keep the digester well supplied./  After investing in biogas plants, families were found to cut back consumption of both firewood and kerosene by about 60%, Agoramoorthy and Hsu found. /  The savings on fuel mean the plants, which cost about 250 dollars to install, pay for themselves in about 2 years./  Before having a digester, many families scavenged firewood illegally. Afterwards, villagers saved more money and also had less negative impact on the forests, according to Agoramoorthy./  Replacing kerosene and firewood with cleaner-burning biogas also greatly reduces indoor air pollution, a leading cause of death for rural villagers, especially women and children./  After starting to use biogas in the home, the study found, families made about half as many visits to the doctor for smoke-related problems such as respiratory infections./  The farmers also spread the leftover slurry from the biogas plant on their fields, reducing their need for chemical fertilizers, and saving them even more money./  ""People want biodigesters because of the cost-savings benefits and energy production,"" said Peter Haas of the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group, a non-profit organisation that operates in Guatemala and Haiti. ""The health impacts are really just an added bonus,"" he added./  ""The usage of biogas plants is still low in villages, so governments need to promote biogas in villages of not only India, but also in other countries,"" said Agoramoorthy./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Air pollution, smoking play role in triggering latent tuberculosis","Washington, May 14 -- Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) have found that a toxic gas present in air pollution and tobacco smoke plays a significant role in triggering tuberculosis infection./For the study, researchers study focused on carbon monoxide (CO), a colourless, odourless gas present in tobacco smoke, and vehicle and manufacturing plant emissions./CO is also produced naturally in brushfires and volcanic gas./In the study, researchers showed that CO triggers Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, to shift from active infection to a drug-resistant dormant state./This is called latency, a global problem that results in tuberculosis escaping detection and treatment, and which contributes to overall tuberculosis transmission./""This is the first description of a role for CO in mycobacterial pathogenesis, and may explain why smoking and air pollution contributes to TB,"" said Adrie Steyn, Ph.D., assistant professor in UAB's Department of Microbiology and lead author on the study./During the study, the researchers worked with Mtb cells under biosafe laboratory conditions and found Mtb proteins 'sense' CO at the molecular level, much like the bacteria's proteins sense other gases in the lungs./The CO interaction is what led to a series of biological steps that sent Mtb into latency./According to researchers, the finding holds political and social implications for speeding up clean-air measures as a way to improve public health, in addition to the environmental significance./They said that the study holds promise for helping to discover new ways to fight extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR TB./""We're talking about huge socio-economic and public health implications,"" Steyn said./The finding contributes to a growing understanding that exposure to high levels of CO through air pollution and cigarette smoke plays a role in tuberculosis infection rates./Besides this, the study showed that low levels of CO present in the body are capable of triggering tuberculosis latency./Inflammation, infection and oxidative stress are among contributors to CO in the body./The findings were published online in The Journal of Biological Chemistry./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

"Chinese guards, farmers train their guns on clouds to ensure dry Olympics","London, June 28 -- Believe it or not, China has a Home Guard shooting at the sky to ensure that the forthcoming Olympics in Beijing stay dry/In the Fragrant Hills northwest of Beijing, a stone's throw from the Temple of Azure Clouds, a group of villagers is preparing to do battle with the gods./As soon as the order comes - day or night - eight farmers will rush to a battery of 37mm anti-aircraft guns installed in a courtyard in the village of Beixing. Four will carry the shells to the guns, two will load them and two will take aim and open fire at the enemy in the sky./Their mission is to protect the honour of a nation. But their targets are the rain clouds and smog that threaten to spoil the Beijing Olympics./The Beixing gunners are among 100 villagers around the Chinese capital who are on standby to ""seed"" clouds - forcing them to shed or retain their rain - before the opening ceremony of the Games on August 8./Guided by the Beijing Meteorological Bureau, they will fire shells containing silver iodide and other chemicals into any clouds seen heading towards the roofless Bird's Nest national stadium./As concern mounts over air pollution in Beijing, they could also be ordered to induce showers during the Games to clear a toxic haze of dust and vehicle and industrial emissions. /Beixing is one of 21 sites around the capital where the Government has set up man-made hail-prevention and rain-increasing work stations, each with up to four anti-aircraft cannon from the 1960s./They will be backed up by three aircraft, which can also scatter rain-inducing chemicals, and by hundreds of experts who will use radar and other equipment at the Beijing Meteorological Bureau./The rainmaking army is just one illustration of how far China has gone to ensure that nothing will spoil the Olympics, an event that it hopes will showcase its staggering economic progress in the past three decades./It also serves a longer-term purpose: to combat the water shortages that plague northern China and represent one of the biggest threats to continued economic growth./Cloud seeding was pioneered in the US in the 1940s and was first tried by Chinese scientists in 1958.

Scientists urge more careful sperm selection for IVF procedure,"Washington, July 9 -- US researchers have warned that carelessness during sperm selection for the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure, where a single sperm is injected into an egg to fertilise it, may decrease the chances of pregnancy./Conrado Avendano and his colleagues at the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk, Virginia, say that though the sperm chosen for the procedure may appear quite normal, many of them actually have DNA damage, and thus may reduce the likelihood of pregnancy./The researchers studied a group of infertile men with moderate and severe teratozoospermia, where most of the sperm looks abnormal./While making a presentation at the 24th annual conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology on Tuesday, Avendano said that embryologists would normally select the 'best looking' sperm for injection./""This would typically be done by analysing the sperm's shape under a microscope. A 'good' sperm by this criterion would have a regular oval head and a long straight tail. However, our research has shown that appearances can be deceptive,"" he said./He said that studying ten infertile men, his team had discovered that many sperm had DNA damage, even though they seemed to be completely normal./""In routine ICSI procedure, the embryologist chooses the best-looking sperm under the microscope, but it could be damaged. DNA-damaged sperm has a highly deleterious effect on the ability to achieve a pregnancy. Even if damaged sperm are used and the woman becomes pregnant, the chances of miscarrying are significantly higher,"" he said./The researchers compared levels of DNA fragmentation in sperm from the infertile group with that from fertile men, and found that sperm with normal morphology from the latter group showed no evidence of DNA fragmentation./However, in the infertile men, between 20 and 66 per cent of normal-looking sperm had DNA damage./""The origin of DNA fragmentation can be multi factorial. Oxidative stress (mainly due to reproductive tract infections) and apoptosis are the most studied, but other factors as age, smoking, exposure to air pollution and abnormal testicular warming are believed to increase the proportion of sperm DNA fragmentation,"" said Avendano./He revealed that his team would apply DNA fragmentation evaluation to couples with male factor infertility./""Our preliminary results using this new evaluation method show a clear negative correlation between the percentage of DNA fragmented sperm and the embryo quality and pregnancy outcome,"" he said./""Different research groups have shown that in addition to affecting normal embryonic development, fertilisation with damaged spermatozoa resulting in a live-born infant can be associated with increased chromosomal abnormalities, minor or major birth defects, and even childhood cancer. Our work has shown that normal sperm morphology alone should not be used as the unique attribute for the selection of sperm for ICSI. New methods that allow an accurate separation of sperm with intact DNA should be sought,"" he added./According to the researchers, sperm biology has received less attention since the introduction and success of the ICSI technique./""While the ICSI procedure bypasses the natural sperm selection, we believe that the deleterious effects of injecting a DNA-fragmented sperm should and can be avoided.

Living near busy traffic streets ups kids' allergy risk,"Washington, July 15 -- Children living near busy traffic streets are at an increased risk of developing allergic diseases, a new study suggests./In the study led by Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, a German research group has found that increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution leads to allergic diseases in kids./The researchers tracked 3,061 six-year old children from Munich and its surroundings, and studied behavioural and environmental risk factors for allergic diseases./They based their analysis on the corresponding distance of the parental home to streets busy with traffic and air pollution with fine dust, diesel soot and nitrogen dioxide./They found that an increased exposure to fine dust led to asthmatic bronchitis and allergic sensitization to pollen. Moreover, exposure to nitric oxide was linked to an increase in eczema./The study led by Dr. Joachim Heinrich of the Institute of Epidemiology of the Helmholtz Zentrum München showed that children who lived less than 50m from a very busy main road were between 1 pct and 50 pct more likely to contract these diseases, while the risk lowered with increasing distances to the main roads./The results are published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Closing coal-burning power plant benefits cognitive development in kids,"Washington, July 15 -- A new research at Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health has cited that by closing coal-fired power plants can positively influence children's cognitive development and health./In the study, researchers tracked and compared the development of two groups of children born in Tongliang, a city in China's Chongqing Municipality ?(EURO)"" one in utero while a coal-fired power plant was operating in the city and one in utero after the Chinese government had closed the plant./The researchers discovered that in the first group of children, prenatal exposure to coal-burning emissions was linked with significantly lower average developmental scores and reduced motor development at age two./On the other hand, in the second unexposed group, these adverse effects were not visible anymore; and the frequency of delayed motor developmental was significantly reduced./""This study provides direct evidence that governmental action to eliminate polluting coal-burning sources benefits children's neurodevelopment. These findings have major implications for environmental health and energy policy as they demonstrate that reduction in dependence on coal for energy can have a measurable positive impact on children's development and health ?(EURO)"" in China and elsewhere,"" said Frederica Perera, DrPH, professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health, director of the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health, and lead author of the study./For the study, the investigators followed two successive cohorts of Chinese newborns through age two in Tongliang. The first cohort involved 107 women whose children were born in 2002, prior to the plant closing. The second involved 110 women whose children were born in 2005, when the coal plant was no longer in operation./""This is a unique environmental intervention study using molecular techniques to demonstrate the relationship between a cleaner environment and healthier children,"" added Deliang Tang, MD, DrPh, associate professor of clinical Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School, director of the Tongliang Project, and co-author of the study./The researchers measured prenatal exposure to plant emissions by a biomarker of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure in umbilical cord blood. They then controlled for exposures to other pollutants, such as tobacco smoke and lead, which might have contributed to neurodevelopment problems./It was observed that children in the first cohort had varying exposure prenatally to PAHs emitted by the coal-fired power plant. This exposure was recorded by monitoring the levels of PAHs in air during the mothers' pregnancies and in measuring a marker of PAH exposure in cord blood- specifically the levels of PAHs bound to DNA, known as ""PAH-DNA adducts""./Significant associations between the marker of exposure in cord blood and delayed motor and average development at age two was found among these children. The second group of children, who were conceived after the closure of the plant, had significantly lower levels of the marker in cord blood and their incidence of delayed motor development was one-third that of the first cohort./In earlier research, it was shown that exposure to air pollutants are linked with an increase in risk for developmental delays among children living in New York City and the new findings contribute to a further understanding of how air pollution impacts child health./The study findings are published in the July 14th Environmental Health Perspectives./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
DECONGESTING CITIES: MORE EFFORTS NEEDED,"Guwahati July 17 -- Over the next 40 years, India will experience one of the most dramatic settlement transitions in history as its urban population grows from 300 million to over 700 million. By the year 2025. an estimated 70 Indian cities are expected to have a population exceeding one million. These mega regions: Mumbai-Pune (50 million), the National Capital Region of Delhi (30 million+) and Kolkata. (30 million) is expected to be among the largest urban conglomerations in the world./India's urban population has expanded nearly five-fold over the past decades even as the overall population has increased by 2.5 times. Population is set to triple in the next two decades. according to a report Integrated City Making, of the London School of Economics & Political Science. The influx of people from the rural areas to the urban centres, in search of employment has aggravated the problem as most of the population finds its place in slums and squatter settlements, which are already overcrowed./Thus, there is a need to upgrade the quality of life in these places where the poorer segments of the population live. While the government has realised the need to make available the basic necessities of life through the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission JNNURM there is also a realisation to make cities liveable by focusing on environmental aspects and upgrading of parks and lakes./Besides, the Centre is formulating a policy for the development of 35 satellite towns around large cities to decongest these places. The process has already started. Delhi's suburbs such as Gurgaon and Noida are highly developed and now the stress would be on improving Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Chandigarh's suburbs, Panchula and Mohali./In Kolkata, Salt Lake is already congested and the city is being further extended to Rajarhat on the eastern side, while in the west a township is being planned near Dankuni. While Navi Mumbai cannot deal with the congestion in the main city, development of Thane and Nasik is being planned and in Bangalore, the focus is on Mysore./As the outer areas of most mega cities have already been developed, the emphasis is shifted to build satellite townships in the peripheral areas to ease congestion. Around Rs 9,000-10,000 crore will be spent in the next five years, according to the Union Ministry of Urban Development. Of these, 28 towns would have a population of over a million and the rest seven a population of at least four million. This apart, the Ministry is also considering inclusion of a few cities from the North East./As for investment, for cities of at 'least our million, it is suggested that the union government' should contribute 50 per cent, and both the State and local bodies 25 per cent each. For cities with a population of over a million, the Centre would contribute 75 per cent of the investment, the State 15 per cent and local bodies 10 per cent./All these measures are expected to deflect immigrant population from the parent city, decentralise economic activity and ensure effective connectivity with an integrated transport system. This has already happened to a large extent in Kolkata, wherein administrative activity along with IT offices and parks, have shifted to Salt Lake. Similarly, Bangalore has witnessed dispersal of IT activity to its suburbs, while in Delhi most industrial centres and offices have shifted to Gurgaon and Noida. So is the case in Mumbai, wherein steady dispersal of industrial activity has already been accomplished./However, experts have pointed out that most suburbs have not been properly planned as these lack meaningful waste disposal system. proper drainage or public transport. Besides, there is both power and water shortage. This apart. smaller cities such as Patna- Siliguri and Guwahati in the east, Ghaziabad and Aligarh in 'the north, Mysore and Coimbatore in the south and Thane and Nasik in the west, need to be further developed and equipped with proper infrastructural facilities/Given the above, there is an ongoing debate on how Asian cities would be able to balance economic, environmental and social needs of its people. Urban transformation is a favourite subject, whereby experts the world over are deliberating to formulate strategies for the future. On the one hand, there is all-round pressure to upgrade the living standards of the poor segments of the population and, on the other, the ecological aspects of a city need also to be developed./The environmental chaos of cities, compounded by air, water and sound pollution have created serious problems along with increasing number of diseases, intrinsic to high pollution levels. Global climate change may exacerbate outdoor air pollution in all Asian cities, including our metros. Urban environmental problems such as air pollution have, in general, been increasing steadily in low-income countries due to heavy traffic and exhaust as well as industrial emissions. affecting human health. In Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, the level of urban pollution is high because of the existence of small-scale industries located in residential areas./Water availability and water pollution is another big problem for cities like Delhi and Kolkata. While the former faces a shortfall of 200 'million gallons a day or more than its 32 per cent production, arsenic contamination is a severe problem in Kolkata. Experts believe that rising temperatures and energy demand for cooling, increasing precipitation variability, erratic rainfall, unsustainable mining of groundwater could all make mega urban regions highly unsustainable in spite of growth of income and wealth./Apart from this, flooding has been accentuated in most urban centres due to poor drainage systems. Recall that the floods in Mumbai in 2005 were exacerbated by blocked canals and drains. Besides, the increased risk of infectious diseases among the poor after floods is also a cause of concern./The Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR), Habitat International Coalition (HIC), Holcim Forum for Sustainable Construction and many other organizations have been organizing campaigns the world-over for making cities sustainable and providing adequate shelter facilities for the poor, as agreed at the Habitat-II international conference at Istanbul. While living conditions of the poor in slums and squatter settlements need to be upgraded, so far city development has concentrated more on beautification and improvement of places, where the rich and the middle income sections reside./Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./-734879/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

""Decisive action is needed if we plan on preserving functioning ecosystems for future generations,"" he added./Pollutants poison areas far from their point of origin./The pollutants assessed - sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, and ground-level ozone - largely originate from smokestacks, tailpipes, and agricultural operations. While initially airborne, these pollutants eventually return to the landscape, where they contaminate the soil and water. /Airborne emissions can travel long distances before making their way back to the ground./Because the eastern United States is downwind from large industrial and urban pollution sources, it receives the highest levels of deposited air pollution in North America./This is bad news for vulnerable wildlife, forest productivity, soil health, water resources, and ultimately, economies./According to Co-author Dr. Timothy H. Tear, of The Nature Conservancy, deposited pollutants have tangible human impacts./""Mercury contamination results in fish that are unsafe to eat. Acidification kills fish and strips nutrients from soils. Excess nitrogen pollutes estuaries, to the detriment of coastal fisheries. And ground-level ozone reduces plant growth, a threat to forestry and agriculture,"" he said./New air quality standards are critical to protecting natural resources./Currently, U.S. air quality standards are determined by direct impacts to human health, with regulations targeting emission levels - what leaves tail pipes and smoke stacks. They do not take into account where airborne pollution is actually deposited in the landscape or how this pollution compromises our soil and water resources and resident plants and animals./""To safeguard ecosystem health, we need a new way of thinking about air pollution - one that moves beyond measuring what is put up in the air, and captures actual impacts to natural areas, wildlife, and the services they provide,"" said Lovett./The authors urge US policymakers to establish air quality standards that are based on critical loads. This is defined as the maximum level of deposited pollution that ecosystems can tolerate before harmful effects occur./By establishing thresholds, pollutants can be regulated in a way that preserves functioning ecosystems./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./-740474/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Staying indoors wouldn't offer you protection from air pollution,"Wellington, Aug. 11 -- A new research has determined that shutting the door and staying inside the home does not offer any protection from the effects of air pollution, as the indoors is just as polluted as the outdoors./According to a report carried out in /<a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz"">www.stuff.co.nz</a>/, the research was conducted by Christchurch-based researchers working for Otago University in New Zealand./""Essentially, pollution reaches people's lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days,"" said lead researcher Michael Epton./""There is no escape from wood smoke pollution, particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in Christchurch, or anywhere else,"" he added./Dr Epton and his team studied the effects of air pollution on 93 boarders at Christchurch's Christ's College./Each boy measured his lung function morning and evening throughout the winter, and the 26 asthma sufferers noted the use of their reliever./The team concluded that serious air pollution in the city did have an impact on the respiratory health of young people, particularly those with asthma, but the immediate effect was not too serious./""Although the health impact isn't great, there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma,"" said Dr Epton./Among other findings, the researchers proved that exposure to wood smoke pollution could be directly measured in urine./""This is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood-smoke pollution in New Zealand,"" according to Dr Epton./""This test could be used as a ""biomarker"" in the future for exposure to significant wood smoke, as exists in Christchurch,"" he added./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
How pollution influences the weekend weather,"London, Aug. 12 -- A team of researchers has pinned down how pollution is changing the weather at weekends in some of the countries in Europe./It's been known for years that man-made pollution affects weather patterns./But, according to a report in Nature News, in the first survey of weekly weather cycles to cover Western Europe, researchers have found that pollution seems to be giving the Spanish milder winter weekends./Interestingly, summer weekends are correspondingly colder and wetter./Arturo Sanchez-Lorenzo, a climatologist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, and his colleagues studied 44 years of climate data from 13 weather stations across rural and urban areas of Spain, and extended their research by surveying sea level pressures for western Europe./Scientists think that the patterns are caused by changes in the amount of particulate air pollution that build up over the week thanks to traffic and industrial activity./Indeed, weekly cycles in weather have been reported for several areas. Parts of the United States have less rainfall on weekends, while Germany gets more rain at the end of the week./The pollution also tends to give the United Kingdom and western France drier, cloudless weekends in winter, whereas Iceland and Greenland are also experiencing wetter winter weekends./The emission of smoke and gases has been known to affect rainfall since the 1920s./Airborne pollution particles can seed raindrop formation - but it can also change how rain clouds develop, potentially delaying rainfall to create fiercer summer storms as has been seen in the United States./This complicated interaction means that scientists are unsure exactly how the cycle develops./""We suggest that (these weekly cycles) are related to changes in atmospheric circulation over western Europe, maybe due to some indirect effect and interaction of aerosols with atmospheric dynamics,"" said Sanchez-Lorenzo./David Parker, of the UK Meteorological Office in Exeter, agrees that the anthropogenic emissions of aerosol particles, through their impacts on cloud dynamics, can affect the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth's surface and therefore atmospheric circulation./But, according to him, more detailed experiments on the effect of weekly-varying aerosols on weather and climate are needed to confirm this mechanism./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Air pollution hits not only lungs, but heart and blood vessels too","Washington, Aug. 14 -- If you think that the harmful effects of air pollution are just confined to lungs, then here's something you should know: bad air can have toxic effects on the heart and cardiovascular system./In a new article, researchers have said that air pollution has both short- and long-term toxic effects that injure the heart and blood vessels, increase rates of hospitalisation for cardiac illness, and can even cause death./""We used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs. We now know it is also bad for the heart,"" said Robert A. Kloner, M.D., Ph.D., director of research at the Heart Institute of the Good Samaritan Hospital./When pollutants are inhaled, they trigger an increase in ""reactive oxygen species""-superoxiding molecules that damage cells, cause inflammation in the lungs, and spark the cascade of harmful effects in the heart and cardiovascular system./Recent research suggests that ultrafine air pollutants, such as those coming from car exhaust, may pass into the blood stream and damage the heart and blood vessels directly./According to studies conducted at the Heart Institute, direct exposure of ultrafine air pollutants to heart shows an immediate decrease in both coronary blood flow and the heart's pumping function, as well as a tendency to develop arrhythmias,./In both humans and animals, it was shown that exposure to air pollution can affect heart rate, blood pressure, blood vessel function, blood clotting, and heart rate variability (a factor in developing heart rhythm disturbances), and speed the progression of atherosclerosis./Large populations study of people over time have indicated that increased levels of air pollution are linked to emergency hospital admissions for heart attack, chest pain, and congestive heart failure and even to death from heart disease, arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiac arrest./The elderly and patients who have already been diagnosed with heart disease or diabetes (which damages the blood vessels) are mainly prone to the cardiovascular effects of air pollution./""Patients with cardiovascular disease shouldn't exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels. On very polluted days, they should consider staying inside, and during the winter, they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke.

Dirty smoke from ships degrades air quality in coastal cities,"Washington, Aug. 19 -- Chemists at UC (University of California) San Diego, US, have found that dirty smoke from ships degrades air quality in coastal cities./According to the scientists, the impact of dirty smoke from ships burning high-sulfur fuel can be substantial, on some days accounting for nearly one-half of the fine, sulfur-rich particulate matter in the air known to be hazardous to human health./International rules requiring clean-burning ship fuels are set to take effect in 2015, intended to minimize the potential hazards dirty ship smoke may pose to human health and the environment./Some researchers have estimated that these hazards may be responsible for as many as 60,000 deaths worldwide and a cost to the US economy of 500 million dollars a year, no one knows the actual impact of ship smoke./The reason is that air quality experts have been unable to quantify the specific contribution of ship smoke to the air pollution of coastal cities, until now./""This is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere,"" said Mark Thiemens, Dean of the Division of Physical Sciences and a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSD, who headed the research team./""Ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards. What we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in San Diego. And what we found was a surprise, because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur-rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high,"" he added./Most of the sulfur emitted by ships burning bunker oil is released as sulfur dioxide, or SO2, a gaseous pollutant which is eventually converted to sulfate in the atmosphere./But, according to scientists, although SO4 may be a smaller component in ship emissions, these primary sulfate particulates are particularly harmful to humans, because they are especially fine microscopic particles, less than 1.5 microns or millionth of a meter in size. /As a result, they can travel extremely long distances because they stay in the atmosphere for longer periods and, unlike bigger dust grains and particles that are removed by the body when breathed, remain in the lungs./According to Gerardo Dominguez, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSD, the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles./""But our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future. Knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships,"" he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air pollution can lead to impairment of the heart's electrical functioning,"Washington, Sept. 9 -- A recent study of 48 people with coronary artery disease in Boston has revealed that tiny particles in polluted air can adversely affect the heart's ability to conduct electrical signals in such patients./Appearing in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association, the study involved the use of 24-hour Holter monitors to examine electrocardiograms for the conductivity change called an ST-segment depression, which may indicate inadequate blood flow to the heart or inflamed heart muscle./Senior researchers who worked on the project have revealed that the average 24-hour levels for all pollutants included in their analysis were below accepted or proposed National Air Quality Standard thresholds, meaning patients were breathing air considered healthy./""We found that an elevation in fine particles, from non-traffic as well as traffic sources, and black carbon, a marker for traffic, predicted ST-segment depression. Effects were greatest within the first month after hospitalization, and for patients who were hospitalized for a heart attack or had diabetes,"" said Dr. Diane R. Gold, the study's senior author and an associate professor of medicine and environmental health at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts./The researchers highlighted the fact that previous studied had already established that exposure to road traffic and particulate air pollution increase the risk for cardiac death or heart attack./""When coal sales were banned in Dublin, Ireland, and black smoke concentrations declined by 70 percent within the next 72 months, cardiovascular deaths fell by 10 percent,"" said Gold, citing a study published in 2002./""Our study provides additional rationale to avoid or reduce heavy traffic exposure after discharge, even for those without a heart attack, since traffic exposure involves pollution exposure as well as stress,"" she said./The study's 48 participants had been hospitalized for either a heart attack, unstable angina or worsening symptoms of stable coronary artery disease. Forty percent of them had suffered a heart attack, and 25 percent diabetes./The researchers visited the patients two to four weeks after their discharge, and then three more times at approximately three-month intervals. At each visit, a portable electrocardiograph called a Holter monitor recorded the patients' heart activity for 24 hours. All participants were monitored on the first visit, and 35 had monitoring on more than one visit./They averaged monitor readings over each half-hour, providing 5,979 half-hour observations, and then examined the relation of these ECG measurements with levels of several pollutants./It was observed that increased levels of particular pollution - PM2.5 and black carbon (a marker for traffic exhaust) - were associated with ST-segment depression in the study participants./The team also observed that sulfur dioxide, a pollutant that can have non-traffic sources, was also associated with ST-segment depression./They did not find any significant correlation was found between ST-segment depression and increased levels of carbon monoxide, but levels of this pollutant were low in this study./According to them, patients recovering from a heart attack had greater changes in ST segment depression on electrocardiograms compared to other participants./""Further research is needed to evaluate whether the pollution-related ST-segment depression that we see is related to increased heart muscle inflammation, reduced oxygen flow, oxidative stress, or increased risk of arrhythmias,"" Gold said./""We think that our findings, which are definitely subclinical, may represent a process that increases clinical risk for people with symptomatic coronary artery disease,"" she added./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Monitoring exhaled nitric oxide does not improve asthma control,"London, Sept. 20 -- Monitoring levels of exhaled nitric oxide in teenagers having asthma and adjusting treatment accordingly has no influence in improving the course of the condition, according to a new study./Conducted by the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), the study of almost 550 adolescents from 10 cities across the United States, was led by Stanley Szefler, M.D., of National Jewish Health in Denver./The study aimed at examining whether in addition to treating asthma based on national guidelines, measurements of exhaled nitric oxide would allow even better control of the disease./The new study was the largest till date for testing exhaled nitric oxide as a biomarker for asthma management. /Asthma is a chronic disorder of the airways and its is believed that allergens, air pollution and infections can provoke its symptoms, which include wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath and coughing./Asthma symptoms occur when the tissues of the lungs become inflamed and the muscles in the airways contract, making breathing difficult./High levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the breath are a measurable marker of asthma-related inflammation. It is known that the higher the exhaled NO, the greater the inflammation of the lungs. Equipment is now available to easily measure exhaled NO./Popular asthma treatments, like inhaled corticosteroids, reduce both lung inflammation and exhaled NO. Exhaled NO would potentially be a good biomarker for the severity of asthma inflammation./""A biomarker of airway inflammation could be a useful clinical tool for gauging medical needs and clinical responses in asthma patients. Although this study reinforces the importance of the NIH asthma guidelines for disease control, it did not find that measuring exhaled nitric oxide provided any additional clinical benefit,"" Lancet quoted Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of NIAID, as saying./In the study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two equal-sized groups. While one group received treatment based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines alone, the other received treatment based on the guidelines plus measurement of exhaled NO./The researchers compared participants' symptoms and asthma exacerbations in the year-long study./""The hypothesis was that adding exhaled NO monitoring to the NIH asthma guidelines-based approach would improve asthma control over the guidelines-based approach alone,"" said Szefler./It was believed that exhaled NO would indicate if there was a need for increased treatment dosage in the participants having few asthma symptoms but who had ongoing high levels of lung inflammation./However, the study found that the group whose treatment was guided by exhaled NO did not end up with fewer or less severe asthma symptoms or fewer asthma exacerbations compared with the group that received treatment based on the NAEPP guidelines alone./Majority of patients in each group showed marked improvement in their asthma initially and throughout the study, highlighting the importance of optimizing asthma treatment according to the NIH guidelines./According to Dr. Busse, the upside of the study is that ""good adherence to the current guidelines [for treating asthma patients] can mean good disease management without the need for a biomarker.""/The study is published in the latest issue of The Lancet./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

AGRO-CHEMICALS AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,"Guwahati Oct. 13 -- The Green Revolution technologies in the country have resulted many fold increase in crop production, but simultaneously have made heavy demands of agro-chemicals, mostly fertilisers and pesticides. These have created pollution of soil, water, air and agricultural produce. Agricultural pollutants include pesticides, herbicides, fertilisers and some other agro-chemicals. In comparison to many developing countries, the present level of fertiliser use in India is not so significant. But due to faulty method of application of agro-chemicals, soil, water and air have been contaminated alarmingly. Moreover, water pollution comes from agro-chemicals than from any other single source./Fertiliser is a component of agro-chemical which can create poor environmental quality. Of course, fertiliser leached from fields is less directly toxic than pesticides. Nitrate pollution of underground water or drinking water is cause of concern expressed by the World Health Organisation. Nitrous oxide emission from nitrogenous fertilizser into the atmosphere is another matter of concern./Nitrous oxide influences the integrity of stratosphere layer of the atmosphere. This layer has properties of shielding the biosphere against ultraviolet radiation which otherwise can cause severe skin disease. The contamination of surface water bodies (pond, river, and lake) due to abundance of nutrients like phosphorus, nitrogen, silicon, cobalt and molybdenum is termed as Eutrofication. This phenomenon leads to overgrowth of unwanted algae resulting in oxygen deficient condition in water which poses problem for aquatic life like fish etc. Phosphate being extremely immobile in soil, maybe added to surface water bodies through erosion and runoff only. Surface water bodies in India will not be enriched by phosphorus if it is applied at low quantity (almost 18.0 kg/ha) to soile. The presence of excess quantity of chloride in crops like grapes, tobacco, bean, potato, lettuce, etc and of heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, nickel, lead and arsenic in soil has created hazards to plants and humans. In traces, though, some heavy metals are present in phosphatic fertiliser; their availability in soil is too low./Pesticide, which is generally used for increasing agricultural production is another component for affecting environmental quality in more negative ways. Crop production is reduced due to pesticidal air pollution as the photosynthetic activity is also reduced. Various types of crop injuries have been reported from areas which are in the vicinity of agro-chemical industries. It had been reported that total DDT ranged from 3.5 nanogram to 232 nanogram per meter cube volume of air present around metropolitan area of Delhi. Rain sample collected also contained DDT with an average of 12.5 parts per billion. The Bhopal gas tragedy is a living example of agro-chemicals related hazard. There are many evidences which indicate that several of the commonly used pesticides bring about significant changes in the biological ecosystem. They initiate a chain of non-target reaction and exert influence on soil micro-organism against which these microrganisms are not targeted. Intensive use of pesticides leave permissible reserves in fruits, vegetables and animal product. It has also been observed that farmers do not often observe proper waiting periods after pesticide spray and also the banned pesticides such as DDT and BHC are still in use in vegetable plots./Herbicide application started since 1944. Herbicides applied in large quantities from air craft can easily spread beyond their targets, killing beneficial insects and wild life directly and slow poisoning farm workers indirectly. The pesticides that make their way into streams, rivers and lakes and lastly the ocean can have serious implication on aquatic ecosystems. Although persistent organo-chloride pesticides are being used less now-a-days, the low persistent replacements are often much more toxic. Pesticides also enter ground water thereby causing contamination of drinking water supplies. Almost in all the states of the country, ground water has been contaminated in different degrees./Seeing the more toxic effect of pesticides, as many as 25 pesticides including hexachloride, endrin, heptachlor, nitrofen have been banned from being manufactured, imported and used. Nicotine sulfate and captafol 80 per cent powder - these two pesticides had been banned for use, but their manufacture is allowed for export. Seven pesticide formulations have been withdrawn as pesticidal use; and Aluminum phosphide, DDT, lindane, methyl bromide, methyl parathion, Sodium cyanide, methoxy ethyl mercury chloride (MEMC) and monocrotophos have been notified for restricted use in India./Poor environmental quality resulting from application of different agro-chemicals in modern agriculture to some extent is almost inevitable. The intensity at which the different environmental forms remain safe, however, can be maintained by adopting the recommended packages of cultivation practices. If observed correctly, the main reason of pollution is not actually modern agriculture, but practicing it in a faulty manner. Faults in adoption of modern agriculture remain in application - methods, time, quantity and chemical selection. If right chemical is rightly applied at right time with right quantity, the quality of environment and food we consume will remain safe. As there is no alternative to meeting the demand for food and other agricultural raw materials except in high agricultural production per unit land per unit time through adoption of modern agriculture; the most appropriate way of getting this is perhaps emphasis on scientific use of non-renewable inputs like fertilisers, pesticides and other energy. More governmental intervention in this aspect is extremely necessary./Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./-840076/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Notices are served to civic bodies and other agencies too,"" said a senior official of DPCC not wanting to be named./Traditionally, burning of leaves in the winter has been an integral part of the maintenance of parks in the city, in order to prevent the huge heaps of dry leaves from adding to the municipal solid waste stream./But what makes this a huge problem is that there around 3,700 ornamental parks, almost 10,000 ordinary/neighbourhood parks and about 80 children's parks across Delhi. ""So the amount of leaves that burn in winter is just enormous. They are usually burnt in the mornings, mostly filling the area with smoke and soot,"" he said./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in its soon-to-be published Source Apportionment Study, which pinpoints the sources and the amount of each air pollution component, has mentioned burning of leaves as a source of winter pollution in Delhi and elsewhere./""When burned, the leaves inject a huge amount of respirable suspended particles and soot, which settle in the lungs, worsening pulmonary diseases. We have studied this as a major source (of pollution),"" said S.D. Makhijani, member secretary, CPCB./That apart, burning of leaves and woods also release the cancer-causing organic compound called benzene and toxic gas carbon monoxide in large amounts, said Dr T.K. Joshi of Centre for Environment and Occupational Health at Maulana Azad Medical College. ""Small children are at graver risk. Joggers and all who inhale more air in the morning are also greatly exposed to it,"" he said./A UN report had recently called Delhi one of the most polluted Asian metropolises.

SWEDISH CREMATORIUM TO HEAT HOUSES IN SURROUNDING TOWN,"London, Dec. 21 -- (ANI): A Swedish crematorium has come up with a novel way to harness its furnaces to heat buildings in the surrounding town, instead of letting the energy escape into the environment and cause air pollution./Lennart Andersson, the director of the cemetery in the town of Halmstad, has revealed that the idea was conceived after a recent environmental review conclusded that the crematorium's chimneys were pumping far too much smoke into the air./""It was when we were discussing all these environmental issues that we started thinking about the energy that is used in the cremations and realised that instead of all that heat just going up into the air, we could make use of it somehow. It was just rising into the skies for nothing. For starters we will heat our own premises. But I hope we can connect to the district heating network in the future,"" the Telegraph quoted Andersson as saying./The newspaper said that the new strategy may also help the crematorium save money because it will not only eliminate the facility's own heating bill, but also allow the crematorium to save money on cooling the smoke before it is released into the environment./Anderson revealed that, so far, the idea has met with approval from locals in the town of 55,000./""Of course it's possible that there will be some discussion about the ethics of this, but from our side, this is a purely environmental idea. There will be no difference in the ashes,"" he said./Town officials say that they may tap into the new energy source by 2010, should the new heating system prove to be successful in the crematorium's own facilities.

LOOK INSIDE TO CONTROL ASTHMA,"NEW DELHI, India, Dec. 28 -- The year-end is here, and with it, the peaking of many people's asthma. As a wheezer myself, people around me, even my doctor, always blamed the smog, air pollution and other outdoor reasons for my worsening situation in this part of the winter./Then , in December this year, a new study from Johns Hopkins University, carried out in Baltimore, threw more light on the issue. In a nutshell, what it said was that indoor air pollution, specifically particulate matter- impacts severity and incidence of asthma./This may seem like commonsense to many of us, but the linkages were not well established. Moreover, the study suggests that while it is ideal to clear out the air outdoors, cleaning indoor air in our homes may be most useful if children tend to spend substantial time indoors. The study was carried out on pre-schoolers, who do spend time at home, and whose home micro-environments were increasing their need for medicine./What can be done, especially if you have young children in your home? Lots: eliminate all forms of smoke-don't even allow your neighbourhood to burn leaves-it all comes indoors. Close the windows on a bad sky day. If you can afford it, use humidifiers. And remember, diesel fumes from your car-and that of others-will be present when you start the car or park it, especially near your home or in it./You have to shift to a CNG kit. But take the effort to see what the domestic help uses. It's likely to be coal or twigs, and cooking may be indoors. It's slowly choking their children. Work with them (and your neighbours) to cook outdoors, shift to other fuels if they can afford, and ensure their indoor heating is not from bio-mass. Protecting children-our own or not-is everybody's business./Let's re-discover commonsensebr /While we are learning about children suffering indoors, there is less space being allowed to them outdoors. Parks are being made into parking lots (something predicted in this column recently) and what remains is being captured as an ornamental patch of green./Old people need spaces too, but they use the park at different times of the day, so the elderly and children can use the same spaces. Most parks don't have rich ecological systems so calling them green patches is inaccurate. For parks to serve the public, they should be designed to include both the elderly and children and planted with indigenous trees and shrubs on the peripheries. And yes, let's stop this obsession with fountains-there isn't even enough water to drink!/The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./-937712/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
10PCT FAMILIES IN KOREA SUFFER FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DISEASES,"Washington, Dec. 28 -- (ANI): A new research has revealed that 10 percent households in Korea have at least one member suffering from an environment-related disease./The research, conducted on 1,000 adults nationwide by the Ministry of Environment, found that one out of every 10 local households has an environmental disease such as eczema, hay fever or asthma./Pollutants in the air and man-made structures, which build up in the human body, are responsible for the diseases, reports Environmental News Network./Some 50.3 percent said they suffered from eczema while runny noses, chronic respiratory ailments and asthma followed. Most picked air pollution as the main cause of the disease./The study participants said the government needs to label toxic materials used in children's goods, and use environmentally-friendly products in playgrounds and other children's facilities to prevent a prevalence of the ailments among children./11 general hospitals have been designated by the government to study environment-related disease mechanisms through 2011.

A BOOST FOR BRITTLE BONES,"NEW DELHI, India, Jan. 18 -- Despite a diet seeped in milk and its byproducts, many Indians have bones that are more brittle than cola-guzzling Caucasians, and researchers have come closer to understanding why. ""A study done in PGI Lucknow and published in Osteoporosis International linked low bone mineral density in healthy Indians with severe vitamin D deficiency,"" said Dr Ambrish Mithal, one of the study authors and a senior consultant of endocrinology at the Apollo Hospital./Fat-soluble vitamin D helps maintain normal levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. It also helps in calcium absorption, which explains why its deficiency makes bones brittle, soft or misshapen. Vitamin D is found in food such as fish and grains but is also synthesised naturally under the skin by the body under the effect of UV rays in sunlight./""You don't expect to be deficient in vitamin D in sunny India, but south Asians need more sunlight to synthesise the vitamin because of higher skin pigmentation. In the winter months, the deficiency may be more pronounced as there is inadequate exposure to sunlight because of air pollution and smog,"" said Dr Mithal./Bone clinics are now routinely reporting osteomalacia, a disease in which the bones become weak and misshapen. ""I just got a 45-year-old man with such a bad case osteomalacia that he could barely walk. While some cases of osteomalacia are caused by fat mal-absorption - a condition called steatorrhea -the more common cause is vitamin D deficiency,"" says orthopaedic surgeon Dr Yash Gulati. Some causes are pancreatic enzyme deficiency, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, sprue, liver disease, surgical removal of part or all of the stomach, and small bowel disease. Kidney disorders may also cause a deficiency./Osteomalacia initially leads to difficulty walking and frequent fractures and as the disease advances, and the patient gets progressively bed-ridden. Unlike osteoporosis which occurs with advancing age, osteomalacia can strike people young, more so now with erratic eating schedules and fad diets becoming the norm./Apart from blood tests to measure the amounts of calcium and phosphorus, X-rays of the affected bones and bone biopsy help diagnosis. Calcium and vitamin D supplements can help treat the problem, but in advanced cases, bone deformities may require surgical correction. A calcium intake up to 1.5 gms a day is prescribed along with high doses of vitamin D. ""Treatment leads to rapid bone recovery, especially in the spine and hips,"" says Dr Gulati./Vitamin D is found in animal sources such as fish, fish oils, milk and egg. The vitamin D found in milk leads to optimum calcium absorption, making dairy the best source of calcium. A healthy adult needs 500-800 ml of milk (2.5-4 glasses) a day, but most have less than 500 ml./""In India we drink milk, but not enough. The PGI study showed that 75 per cent of the participants had less than 500 ml of milk a day,' says Dr Mithal. Milk products apart, good vegetarian sources of calcium are ragi and legumes, but since the mineral is not absorbed as readily from plant sources, prescribing vitamin D becomes a must./Diet apart, there is the sun to contend with. Increasingly, people stay in closed environs and do not step out in the sun because of fears of UV rays. ""Half an hour outdoors combined with some aerobic exercise to strengthen the muscles, which in turn offer support to the bone, is the best way to strengthen your bones,"" says Dr Gulati./The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./-962891/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Use of popular inhalers increases pneumonia risk,"Washington, Feb. 11 -- A popular class of anti-inflammatory inhalers enhances the risk of pneumonia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, according to the latest study./COPD is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. It can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and other symptoms. Wake Forest University School of Medicine researchers reviewed 18 randomized clinical trials, involving nearly 17,000 patients. They compared the incidence of pneumonia in patients who had taken inhaled corticosteroids for at least 24 weeks versus patients who had taken a placebo, or patients who had taken combination inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-antagonists versus patients who took only the long-acting bronchodilator. Analysis of the results showed that inhaled corticosteroid use, alone or in combination with bronchodilators, for at least 24 weeks was associated with a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and serious pneumonia (60 to 70 percent increase); however, it was not associated with an increased risk of death. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD, and most people who have COPD smoke or are former smokers. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as air pollution, chemical fumes or dust, also may contribute to COPD. It is estimated that more than 16 million Americans have COPD; however, that number is rising rapidly and the disease often goes undiagnosed, so some estimates put the actual number of Americans afflicted with the disease as high as 24 million, said a Wake Forest release. These findings appeared in the current issue of Archives of Internal Medicine.

'Government projects polluting Lucknow',"Lucknow, March. 10 -- The Mayawati government is turning a blind eye to the ""suffocating"" levels of air pollution in the Uttar Pradesh capital, says the chief of an environment body set up by the Supreme Court, while pointing to the large-scale stone-cutting work being undertaken for official projects./Environmental Protection and Conservation Authority (EPCA) chief Bhure Lal cited ""the suffocating atmosphere created on account of such heavy presence of dust particles in the air that could pose serious threat of spreading lung-related diseases like asthma or tuberculosis"". Citing the stone-cutting work for official projects worth more than Rs.25 billion across the city, he said the respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in Lucknow's air has been found to be more than four times the permissible limits. ""As against the laid down upper limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre, it was found to be 475 in and around those parts of Lucknow where a lot of stone-cutting is going on,"" Lal told IANS during a visit to Lucknow. ""I have raised this issue at a seminar organised by the Club of Lucknow when I sought to draw the attention of local officials also to the rising levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the air in Lucknow,"" he said. A retired IAS officer widely known for his uprightness and high integrity, Lal is the man who succeeded in pushing for CNG-run public transport in Uttar Pradesh's two top cities - Lucknow and Kanpur - as the fuel is considered environment-friendly. He was however unhappy about the implementation of CNG conversions here. ""It is a matter of concern that not more than 30 percent of public transport vehicles in Lucknow had converted to CNG so far,"" he lamented. Lal also said that official neglect and apathy had led to unabated pollution in the Gomti river in Lucknow. ""I remember going to Egypt where I was told not to forget to take a bottle filled with the water of the Nile; I wish we could do the same for Lucknow's Gomti, which is full of filth and solid waste,"" he said. ""Isn't it shocking that even as the Gomti receives more than 440 million litres of discharge every day, the sewage treatment plant installed by the government has the capacity to treat only 40 million litres a day?"" he asked.

Long-term ozone exposure 'ups fatal lung disease risk',"Washington, Mar. 12 -- Long-term exposure to ozone-one of the most widespread pollutants in the world and a key component of smog-significantly increases the risk of dying from lung disease, says a new study./The study found that the risk of dying from respiratory disease is more than 30 percent greater in metropolitan areas with the highest ozone concentrations than in those with the lowest ozone concentrations. ""Many studies have shown that a high-ozone day leads to an increase in risk of acute health effects the next day, for example, asthma attacks and heart attacks,"" said George D. Thurston, Sc.D. who directed the air pollution exposure assessment part of the study. ""What this study says is that to protect the public's health, we can't just reduce the peaks, we must also reduce long-term, cumulative exposure,"" Thurston added. For the study, researchers analyzed data on some 450,000 people who were followed from 1982 to 2000 as part of an American Cancer Society study. Over that period 118,777 people in the study died. The data, which included cause of death, were linked to air pollution levels in 96 cities using advanced statistical modeling to control for individual risk factors, such as age, smoking status, body mass, and diet, as well as for regional differences among the study populations. By statistically controlling for the other major component of smog-fine particulate matter, particles smaller than 2.5 microns-the researchers were able to tease out the cardiovascular impact of the pollutants and still see ozone's effects on respiratory health. Ozone data collected between 1977 and 2000 showed that California had both the city with the highest and the city with the lowest concentration of ozone pollution in the country. The researchers estimate that the risk of dying from respiratory causes rises 4 percent for every 10 parts-per-billion increase in exposure to ozone. Based on that result, Thurston said that the city with the highest mean daily maximum ozone concentration over the 18-year period of the study, was Riverside (104 ppb). This long-term cumulative exposure corresponded to roughly a 50 percent increased risk of dying from lung disease compared to no exposure to the pollutant. The lowest ozone concentration was seen in San Francisco (33 ppb long-term average daily maximum), which had an associated 14 percent increase in risk. The study has been published in the March 12 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

"Global warming killing 150,000 more people in poor countries: WHO","Copenhagen, March. 12 -- Around 150,000 deaths now occur in low-income countries each year due to climate change that causes crop failure and malnutrition, diarrhoea, malaria and flooding, says the World Health Organisation (WHO)./""Almost 85 percent of these excess deaths are among young children,"" WHO spokesperson Sari Setiogi said Thursday. Health hazards from climate change are diverse, global and difficult to reverse over human time scales, WHO experts said at the Climate Change: Global Risks, Challenges and Decisions conference here, according to Setiogi. ""They range from increased risks of extreme weather events, to effects on infectious disease dynamics and sea level rise leading to salinisation of land and water sources."" The experts also pointed out that the health impacts of climate change are felt unequally. ""Whether it's the 70,000 excess deaths from the heat wave in Europe in 2003, or new malarial deaths in the central African highlands, the people at greatest risk for climate-related health disorders and premature deaths are the poor, the geographically vulnerable, the very young, women and the elderly,"" Setiogi said. ""The populations considered to be at greatest risk are those living in small island developing states, mountainous regions, water-stressed areas, megacities and coastal areas in developing countries, particularly the large urban agglomerations in delta regions in Asia, and also poor people and those lacking access to health services."" On the brighter side, improvements in environmental conditions could reduce the global disease burden by more than 25 percent, the experts said. A large part of the current burden is linked to energy consumption and transport systems. Changing these systems to reduce climate change would have the added benefit of addressing some major public health issues, Setiogi said. These include outdoor air pollution (800,000 annual global deaths); traffic accidents (1.2 million annual deaths); physical inactivity (1.9 million deaths); and indoor air pollution (1.5 million annual deaths), she added. The spokesperson said putting these three health arguments at the centre of discussions at the climate change summit scheduled here this December ""would ensure that in the new post-Kyoto agreement we will all share in the health and economic benefits that can accrue from countering climate change"".

Long-term ozone exposure linked to higher death risk,"Washington, March. 12 -- Long-term exposure to ground-level ozone, a component of smog, may result in increased risk of death from respiratory ailments, according to a new study throughout the US./Ozone, a gas made up of three oxygen atoms - forms a protective layer from the sun's ultraviolet radiation when located in the Earth's upper atmosphere. However, that same gas is toxic at ground level where it can be breathed by humans. Ground level ozone is formed through a complex chemical reaction in sunlight between nitrogen oxides (NOx), commonly spewed from vehicle exhaust, and industrial factory emissions. The study found that for every 10 parts-per-billion (ppb) increase in ozone level, there is a four percent increase in risk of death from respiratory causes, primarily pneumonia and chronic pulmonary obstructive pulmonary disease. The study analysed the risk of death for both ozone and fine particulate matter, two of the most prevalent components of air pollution. It followed nearly 450,000 people for two decades and covered 96 metropolitan regions in the US. University of California-Berkeley (UC-B) researchers found that people living in areas with the highest concentrations of ozone, such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area and California's Central Valley, had a 25 to 30 percent greater annual risk of dying from respiratory diseases compared with people from regions with the lowest levels of the pollutant. ""This is the first time we've been able to connect chronic exposure to ozone, one of the most widespread pollutants in the world, with the risk of death,"" said Michael Jerrett, UC-B associate professor of environmental health sciences. ""World Health Organisation data indicate that about 240,000 people die each year from respiratory causes in the United States,"" said Jerrett, who led the study. ""Even a four percent increase can translate into thousands of excess deaths each year. Globally, some 7.7 million people die from respiratory causes, so worldwide the impact of ozone pollution could be very large,"" he said. The findings come a year after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) strengthened its National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone from an annual average of 80 ppb to 75 ppb to reflect growing evidence of the harmful health effects of ozone. A month after the EPA released its new standards, a National Research Council report concluded that premature deaths related to ozone exposure of less than 24 hours are more likely among those with pre-existing diseases, said an UC-B release. These findings were published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Traffic advisory: watch your heart,"New Delhi, Mar. 16 -- Most people I know are convinced their daily commute is slowly and surely killing them. Now there is scientific evidence to prove them right./Exposure to traffic has been identified as a trigger for heart attacks for people with heart disease, more so in women, elderly men, the unemployed and those with a history of angina (pain or discomfort in the chest). A person is said to have heart disease if he or she has two or more risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, among others. The finding has created a buzz at the ongoing American Heart Association's Annual Conference on Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention, with a large survey of heart attack patients in Europe showing that most of them had been in traffic within an hour of the start of their symptoms. Overall, using any mode of transportation - cars, public transportation (bus, train and metro) and bicycle - in traffic led to a 3.2 times higher risk than time spent away from this trigger. What worried me about the findings was that air quality in western Europe - the study was done at the Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum Muchen, Germany - is far, far superior than the air polluted with fumes from diesel-guzzling vehicles in most parts of India. Unlike in India, most of Europe - including Germany - not just has strict vehicular emission norms but also the will and infrastructure to implement them. If we start factoring in the noxious fumes most of us reathe in, the risk would be certainly higher. The impact of stress on heart disease is part of popular culture in India, with countless bad actors having died clutching their hearts in Bollywood films. Stress puts pressure on the heart by constricting blood vessels, causing blood clots and raising blood pressure. At greatest risk are people with heart or lung disease and older adults. Air pollution has increasingly been linked with disorders other than lung diseases, with airborne particulate matter and ground-level ozone being the greatest threats to health. Made up of microscopic solids and liquid droplets, particulate matter can go deep into the lungs and trigger disorders as diverse as heart and asthma attacks. The other threat is ozone - more commonly referred to as smog - which causes symptoms of cough, wheezing, throat irritation and a burning sensation in your airways. Ozone can aggravate asthma and reduce lung function, triggering attacks. Since most of us cannot wish away commuting or air quality in our town or city, we should consider reducing risk by using the relaxation response - which is the opposite of the stress response - to calm the body. Choose whichever method makes you feel calmer, from listening to music, doing meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, walking, playing with children or your dog, or working out. As long as you keep calm, the traffic, the stress and the smog cannot get you.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air pollution increases heart attack risk,"Washington, Mar. 23 -- Heart disease is not only a product of genetic factors or lifestyle choices, air pollution also puts people at an increased heart attack risk, suggests a study led by Aruni Bhatnagar of the University of Louisville./Evidence has shown that increase in particulate air pollution is also associated with an increase in heart attacks and deaths. During the study, Bhatnagar found that risk of heart attack increases in parallel with time spent in traffic. In animal experiments, she has found that aldehydes -- a toxic class of chemicals present in most forms of smoke, including cigarette smoke and car exhaust -- can increase blood cholesterol levels and activate enzymes that cause plaque in the blood vessels to rupture. When the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that may, in turn, block an artery and lead to a heart attack. In another study, researcher Robert Brook of the University of Michigan found a link between air pollution and hypertension. He said that fine- and ultra-fine particles that get into the lung might make their way into the blood vessels, and within 15 minutes of inhaling pollutants, there is a very rapid increase in blood pressure. For people living in areas with high levels of air pollution, Brook recommended to exercise indoors, because indoor air is filtered. He also advised to avoid peak traffic times. The researchers are trying to find out which pollutants are harmful, and how the harmful pollutants work to damage the cardiovascular system. They have focused on smaller, microscopic particles that can get into the lungs, and may gain entrance to the blood stream.

"Vehicular pollutants stick to the lung more than other smoke, dust particles","London, April. 2 -- In what may lead to a change in the way air pollution is evaluated, scientists at Lund University in Sweden have shown that the tiny particles from traffic fumes are far ""stickier"" than other smoke and dust particles./Research leader Jakob Londahl came to this conclusion after measuring how many airborne particles stay behind in the lungs. For that purpose, the researchers used a new device called RESPI, which brings air being inhaled in through one chamber, and exhaled air out through a second chamber. The device helped the researchers analyse particle number and size in both chambers. Londahl asked nine healthy adults to breathe into the RESPI device while standing on the kerbside of a six-lane Copenhagen boulevard, which sees around 65,000 vehicles pass by on a typical weekday. ""We found most traffic fume particles to be very small and hydrophobic (having little affinity for water), meaning they did not grow bigger once inside the wet lung. But small particles get deposited in the lung more easily,"" New Scientist magazine quoted the researcher as saying. Having noted the street measurements, the researchers compared them with the deposition of particles inhaled from an open fire and a biomass burner, which was measured in a previous study. The team observed that for each microgram of particles inhaled, 16 times as many of the tiny traffic particles got retained in the lung than either the larger soot particles from wood smoke or the moisture-sensitive salts from the biomass burner that clump into bigger particles once inside the lung. According to them, the traffic deposits also had three times the surface area of those inhaled in the biomass combustion study. ""There is some debate as to what characteristics of particles make them unhealthy ? if it is mass or surface area or number. Our results support that it is the latter two, but at the moment, most air quality policies limit amounts by mass,"" says Londahl. The researchers next plan to study how the deposition of traffic exhaust particles differs between healthy people and those with respiratory diseases. A research article on this study has been published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.

10-minute exposure to smoke enough to unsettle your heart,"Washington, April. 17 -- All it takes is a 10-minute exposure to smoke from tobacco, cooking oil or wood to send your heart into an overdrive, according to a study./Accumulating evidence indicates that an increase in air pollution is linked with a surge in heart attack cases and deaths./These pollutants, including tobacco and cooking oil smoke, contain fine particles that evoke responses from heart and blood vessels indicating effects on their function./The study, led by Joyce Mcclendon Evans of the University of Kentucky, briefly exposed people to low levels of common pollutants and measured their cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory responses./Forty healthy non-smokers (21 women, 19 men) with average age of 35 participated in the experiment./The researchers exposed the participants to second hand cigarette smoke, wood smoke and cooking oil smoke in separate trials as they sat in a 10-by-10-foot environmental chamber. The researchers cleared the air in the chamber after each trial./They measured respiratory and cardiovascular function, including heart rate variability, breathing and blood pressure. The study found that, particularly among men, exposure to smoke changed breathing patterns, raised blood pressure oscillations in peripheral arteries, said a Kentucky release./?I was surprised we got statistically significant results with this low level of exposure,?

A Burning Solution,"India, May 11 -- After cooking on wood fires all her life like her mother and grandmother before her, Lakshmi Devi, 50, was thrilled when she got a new gas stove and LPG cylinder free from the Uttarakhand government in November last year. The state government scheme even allows her a free refill every three months, a prospect that continues to delight the Below Poverty Line card-holder, a resident of Chamoli district./?The gas stove saves me the trouble of going in search of firewood. Till last year, we would go to the forest in the nearby hillside to collect firewood thrice a week; now I go once a week,? says the wiry woman. ?With the government ban on cutting trees, looking for dead wood was taking longer each month. Five years ago it took us six to eight hours, how we have to leave at 4 am to make it home by 4 pm.? What Devi doesn?t realise is that apart from making her life and that of several other poor women like her easier, the state government?s free LPG scheme is striking a blow against global warming, which is melting glaciers and changing the microclimate in Uttarakhand at an alarming rate. With 16 glaciers and 64.8 per cent of its 53,483 square kilometre land under forest cover, Uttarakhand is bearing the brunt of global warming. Scant rainfall over the past year has changed the hillside from green to amber, led to a spate of forest fires and dried several mountain streams, affecting not just the lives of the 10 million people who live in the state but also the 500 million who depend on the 15 rivers, including the Ganga and Yamuna, that rise from its glaciers. Villagers living under the shadow of the mountains don?t need experts to tell them that the glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate of about 10-15 metre (33-49 feet) each year. The Gangotri glacier, 30.2 km long and between 0.5 and 2.5 km wide, has retreated more than 850 m in the past 30 years ? 76 m from 1996 to 1999 alone. Like the rest of Uttarakhand, the ski slopes of Auli in Chamoli district got no snow last year. ?There was no snow and not much rain last year. All the small mountain streams around the village have dried up and now we walk to a spring 3 km away to get water. It?s ironical that the Ganga flows down this mountain,? says Nivali Devi, 30, the Pradhan (head) of Mahila Mangal Samiti, a women?s self-help group in Paini, a village in Chamoli located 6,000 feet above sea level. The LPG cylinders may help buck the change in the microclimate by reducing the air pollution generated by wood and coal cooking, a major source of soot (elemental carbon) in India. According to Dr Veerabhadran Ramanathan, distinguished professor of climate and atmospheric sciences at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, ?Black carbon travels and gets deposited on snow and glaciers, making the ice dirty and reducing reflectivity. This makes glaciers absorb more heat and melt faster.? The soot combines with outdoor air pollution to form atmospheric brown clouds over most of south Asia and the Indian Ocean, which causes atmospheric heating. The exposure to smoke with black carbon particulates was directly responsible for about 5 lakh premature deaths from lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ?Women and children are at greatest risk as they stay indoors more and inhale the maximum soot from smoke released from cooking stoves,? says Dr J.N. Pande, former professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. An average household in Uttarakhand uses 3-4 kilogram of firewood a day, and consumption doubles in the winter when fire is also used for warmth. ?If you say LPG saves our rivers, it is good. All I know is that the stoves have made the life of villagers much easier. The demand has been so high that they have to wait five months for the free refill, instead of three,? says Mohan Singh Rama, supply inspector, Joshimath.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Even short-term exposure to pollutants can increase cancer risk,"Washington, May. 18 -- Exposure to environmental pollutants even for a short period can prompt genes to undergo reprogramming, and thereby increase an individual's risk of developing cancer and other diseases, say Italian scientists./University of Milan researchers have shown that inhaling certain environmental pollutants can damage DNA as early as three days. ""Recently, changes in gene programming due to a chemical transformation called methylation have been found in the blood and tissues of lung cancer patients,"" said investigator Dr. Andrea Baccarelli, assistant professor of Applied Biotechnology at the University of Milan. ""We aimed at investigating whether exposure to particulate matter induced changes in DNA methylation in blood from healthy subjects who were exposed to high levels of particulate matter in a foundry facility,"" Baccarelli added. The researchers compared the blood samples of 63 healthy subjects who worked in a foundry near Milan, and found significant changes in four genes associated with tumour suppression.

Red Cross Day observed in Dimapur,"DIMAPUR, May. 19 -- 'Your World, Our Move: Come together for Climate Change' was chosen as the theme for this year's observance of World Red Cross Day. Nagaland joined hands with their counterparts globally to observe the day and to create awareness recently./With growing human activities like Green House effect, land use, fossil fuel, gases, pollution there is immense threat to the climate condition of the world that we live in today, Nagaland Governor K Shankarnarayanan, said in his message as the State president of Nagaland unit of Indian Red Cross Society. The theme is the most appropriate and befitting theme, the Governor said. As the Red Cross movement has been in the forefront towards humanitarian services, the global concern about climate change and its effects is definitely the biggest concern for the movement. He also emphasised that this catastrophe can be prevented by restricting adverse human activities against the nature. Dr KS Sashidhar, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, Nagaland made a power point presentation. He expressed concern over global warming and climate change and explained about the impacts of these two factors in the next few years. Dr Sashidhar disclosed that climate changes have been noticed worldwide, temperatures have risen by 0.6C over the past 40 years and predictions that it will go up by 2-6 C. He also added that Co2 concentration in the atmosphere have risen by 40 per cent over the past two centuries. In 2005, the Co2 concentration increased by 2.6 ppm in volume making the biggest annual jump ever recorded. He explained that these changes are attributed to three main causes, Green House Gas emissions in industrial nations is very high; emissions are also rapidly increasing in the developing or emerging nations and rampant razing and burning of tropical forests. Talking to The Assam Tribune, about North East India, Dr Sashidhar disclosed several studies have predicted significant changes in the weather-climate and water regimes of the Himalayan region in the coming decades because of impacts of global climate change. The consequent social, economic, livelihood and environmental implications in the eastern Himalayan region are also of immediate concern to scientists and policy makers, he pointed out. About his observations of changes in Nagaland, Dr Sashidhar said that it is found that summers are becoming warmer and there is a considerable increase in number of pests like locusts and mosquitoes; ill distributed rainfall with longer dry months between October- March; shortage of drinking water; delay in sowing of crops and non germination and onset of pests and disease on crops and vegetables. To fight the climate change, he suggested that one needs to understand the impact of climate change on forests, biodiversity and livelihood, follow conservation practices, give emphasis on energy conservation; promote renewable energy sources; abate air pollution, afforestation and wasteland development and have fuel substitute policies. The use of CFL bulbs and uses of bicycles can be the small contribution from the youths towards the conservation, he said. Dr Sashidhar said the direct visible impact of the climate change is the long dry spells of rains and its un-uniform distribution is slowly creating more hardships to the people. Giving examples of the change of weather conditions at Kohima and Dimapur in the last few years, said the phenomenon of climate change is affecting the lives of the people of the northestern region even. Deforestations, burning of jungles and other aspects are the main cause. Among the preventive measure he suggested for the people of the region to plant as many trees as they can. On the occasion, Deputy Commissioner Dimapur Maongwati Aier exhorted the youths to join the Red Cross Movement to serve the mankind in large number. He said Red Cross is a good platform for the young people to work for the betterment of the mankind.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Assam Tribune./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
A bus ride can help you breathe easy... here's how,"India, June 5 -- Seven years ago, Indore Municipal Corporation surprised its citizens ? even drew jeers ? by raising the 'Clean Indore, Green Indore' slogan. For, this city, the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh in the western part of the state, like 54 per cent of Indian industrial townships, was known for its high air pollution levels and no effective public transport system for its 14 lakh residents./Now Indore has shown the way. And how! It has India's only bus transport company, Indore City Transport Services Ltd (ICTSL), to have appointed a Norway-based firm ? Det Norske Veritas Certification AS ? to get its clean development mechanism (CDM) certified. Delhi was the first introduce a public transportation project - the Metro rail system - to earn carbon emission credits in 2007. Every year, the Delhi Metro claimed to have saved more than one lakh tones of carbon emission. ICTSL, set up in 2006, is India's first public transport company to have claimed certified emission reductions (CER) for a bus service. It now plans to even generate revenues by trading in emission reduction. Indore's is a success story that can be easily emulated in other parts of the country, provided there is administrative zeal and political will. The Central Pollution Control Board data for 2007 said air pollution levels in the busy parts of two out every five big cities and one out of every five towns is higher than the national standard. On May 27, the Norwegian validator posted the Indore CDM report on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website to invite objections and suggestions from stakeholders and experts. UNFCCC is a global treaty to reduce carbon emissions. India has the mostnumber of CDM projects (1,275) in the world registered with UNFCCC. In the report, ICTSL claimed to have cut down 36,502 tonnes of carbon emission annually. According to UNFCCC, companies that have reduced pollution levels can sell certified reduced emission at Rs 600 a tonne to those who've failed. The laggards pay the performers to avoid hefty fines. ICTSL is also widening the BRTS network to keep smoke-spewing three-wheelers off city limits and encouraging people to leave their vehicles at home and board a bus. What's more, work on the state's first dedicated corridor for high-speed BRT buses has began along a 14-km-long stretch to further reduce vehicular pollution. The BRT corridor is expected to be over by the year-end.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Doc's advice in Kanpur: Cover your face, always","India, June 6 -- The scene at a major crossing in the city was chaotic. A young man in his twenties was pushing a 180 cc motorcycle through spaces between vehicles. People then saw him gasping for breath. The man slumped, his head almost brushing the uneven edges of the road-divider. He was rushed to a hospital where he soon recuperated. But before he went home, doctors had a piece of advice for him: cover your face. Always./What happened to Rameez Rizvi who was so healthy? ""I was unable to breathe. I thought an unseen force had sucked the entire oxygen around me,"" says Rizvi, a student of PPN College. Doctors felt (felt? Another word can be used. It is quite doubtful) he was breathing a soup of pollutants - ultrafine particulates, carbon monoxides and sulphur oxides. This is something that six million people living in Kanpur do every day. ""The quality of air makes Kanpur one of the dirtiest cities in the world,"" said tuberculosis and chest specialist Dr SK Katiyar. As the principal of Kanpur's Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College, Dr Katiyar had undertaken a comprehensive project with IIT Kanpur to study the air quality, particularly the nano-particles of 2.5 microns. The studies done earlier dealt with particles of 10 microns and the results were depressing on all counts. The level of nano-particles in the air was eightfold higher than the permissible limit. ""These particles are near microscopic, easily mix in the blood and reach other vital organs,"" said Katiyar. No wonder Kanpur has the largest population of tuberculosis and asthma patients. Prof Mukesh Sharma, who heads the Department of Environment Science at IIT Kanpur, has been studying the air quality. His conclusion is that the awful quality heavily contributes to respiratory and cardiac diseases. Sulphur dioxide causes severe broncho-constriction, shortness of breath, fatigue and cold. Carbon monoxide reduces oxygen in the body and leads to physiological stress and heart diseases. In his studies, Prof Sharma has found interwoven factors- vehicular traffic, unceasing crisis of electricity and poor road infrastructure, adding enormously to the estimated air pollution load. ""Not only humans, it has an adverse impact on plant and vegetation,"" said A.K. Mishra, professor at the Harcourt Butler Technological Institute.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Beijing's claims of clean air called into question,"London, June. 18 -- The Chinese environment ministry has called into question Beijing's claims that its air has been drastically cleaned up, from last year's Olympic Games till the present day./Beijing spent the run-up to last year's Olympic Games claiming that the city's air had been cleaned up, but according to a report in Nature News, those measurements are now being called into question. Using an air pollution index (API) in which a score of 100 or lower indicates air quality as 'good', all 17 days of Olympic events in Beijing made the grade. Overall, the city hit an all-time high of 274 good air days in 2008. APIs can be calculated in various different ways. Beijing's includes measurements of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particles smaller than 10 micrometres across - dubbed PM10. Controversially, it has not previously used low-level ozone measurements to calculate APIs, and it does not report on the level of particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres across (known as PM2.5). Both ozone and PM2.5 have potential negative impacts on health. Now, Jian Wang of the Chinese environment ministry's pollution-prevention division has admitted that visibility in eastern cities in China is deteriorating. He said that the cause is ozone pollution and, especially, PM2.5. ""PM2.5 is to blame for the haze,"" said Wang. ""Vehicle exhausts that contain black carbon, sulfates, and nitrates contribute a lot to the density of PM2.5, which is more damaging to the respiratory system than PM10,"" he added. He added that the ministry will soon start to include ozone and PM2.5 in its API calculation, with pilot projects to monitor the pollutants expected to start in the deltas of the Yangtze and Pearl rivers next year. ""This is quite a turnaround,"" said Steven Andrews, an environmental consultant who spent 12 months in Beijing from September 2006 as a Princeton-in-Asia fellow. Andrews said that the attention to ozone and PM2.5 is welcome, but is concerned that the data might not be reported openly. He said that the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau previously listed ozone readings, but stopped in 2002. Last year, Andrews had accused Beijing's environment bureau of moving some of its seven air-monitoring stations to improve the API results. Andrews said there is now no way to prove this because data from individual monitoring sites, which had previously been available online since January 2003, have now been removed. Despite the criticism surrounding the API, Beijing has said that it was halfway to its goal of having 260 days with excellent or fairly good air quality this year.

"Beware, a killer could be lurking in your home","India, June 29 -- THERE COULD be a killer lurking in your home. And, possibly, you're blissfully unaware of it. Whether it's the radiation emitted from your television set, smoke billowing from your stove or chullah or the clouds of dust blown by building construction material. These could cause cancer, permanent damage to lungs - so what if you're not a smoker - and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease./A team of doctors from Sir Hurkisondas Hospital, Girgaum, led by allergist Dr Pramod Niphadkar, conducted the study, which was published in the Journal of Association of Physicians of India in June. ""Shockingly, use of chullahs in the city was found to be widespread despite availability of cheap gas stoves,"" said Dr Niphadkar, especially in areas like Bhendi Bazaar, Mazagaon and Dharavi. The worst kind of indoor air pollution is from chullahs followed by dust from construction material and radiation from television sets, especially when watched from close distances for too long a time. The study was carried out on 754 subjects, including 489 asthma patients, who were asked to respond to a detailed questionnaire about indoor air pollution awareness and factors responsible for it. The study revealed that Mumbaiites were at a risk of developing cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, permanent damage to lungs besides other ailments due to over-exposure to indoor air pollution. Just one in 100 Mumbaiites has any knowledge of such pollution. Experts say this is a cause for worry as India accounts for 80 per cent of premature deaths due to indoor air pollution in South-East Asia, according to the World Health Organisation. In Mumbai, residents spend about 90 per cent of their time in an enclosed environment with restricted air circulation. ""The study has pointed out that citizens are exposing themselves to all kinds of indoor air pollution with no awareness of risks,"" said Dr Niphadkar. ""It suggests that rather than spending money on research for new treatments, a little should go to create awareness,"" Dr Niphadkar added. Premature deaths due to indoor air pollution are totally unavoidable, he said.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.For more information on news feed please contact Sarabjit Jagirdar at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Need for wasteland development,"Guwahati, July 3 -- Forests have a very important role to play in solving many of the environmental problems./Environmental services rendered by forests are many and invisible, such as production of oxygen, providing leaf protein, controlling soil erosion and soil fertility, recycling wind erosion, stabilising climate, providing shelter to birds and animals, controlling air pollution and mitigating green house effect and protecting watersheds, among others. According to forestry scientists, plants both absorb and exhale carbon dioxide, but healthy forests, especially those in the Tropics take up far more greenhouse gases than they give off. When they are damaged or dead, carbon that is stored is released. Rise in temperature has already slowed regeneration of tropical forests and made them more vulnerable to fire, disease and insect infestations. Due to increase in violent and frequent storms, huge areas of forests are devastated every year. Many studies on tropical forests show that they absorb about 18 per cent of the carbon-dioxide added by fossil fuels, thus buffering some effects of global warming. The floral scene in India is not at all satisfactory for being below the national requirement. According to the National Forest Policy, the minimum desired area which is considered safe for a tropical country like India is 33 per cent. About 60 per cent of land areas of hills and about 20 per cent in the plains should be under forest cover to strike a balance and save the environment from deterioration. The total forest area of India is about 23 per cent of the total geographical area, while actual forest cover is about 19 per cent. Of this, 10 per cent is closed forests, over 8 per cent open forests, about 0.12 per cent mangrove forest and 1.10 per cent comprise coffee plantations. Furthermore, the per capita forest area in India is only 0.08 hectare against the world average of 0.8 hectare. However, the existing forests in India do not satisfy the ecological and economic requirements of the country. So the Government of India is trying to have more areas under forests inspite of many hurdles. Since there is no chance of increasing area under forests, the only alternative is to bring as much wastelands under forests as possible. The National Wasteland Development Board (NWDB) estimates 120 million hectares as wasteland. The main objective of wasteland development is to bring more areas under forest cover with people's participation. Wastelands are those areas where production of biomass is less than its optimum productivity. These lands are economically unproductive and ecologically unstable. The life supporting systems are under tremendous pressure. Waste land includes such type of land mass which cannot be used for agriculture and other cultivation practices. It amounts to (30-35) per cent of total landmass of India. How is waste land formed? If the forests are cut indiscriminately and grass land overgrazed, the land becomes unproductive and wasteland is formed. The dumping of city waste on any land turns it into wasteland. In addition to these, there are other causes which turn good land into wasteland. These are desertification, salinity, alkanity, soil erosion, shifting cultivation, excessive use of fertilizers and agrochemicals in agriculture, big dams, water logging, urbanisation and industrialisation, etc. India having 2 per cent of the world's geographical area and 1 per cent pasture land is supporting 18 per cent of the world's population and 15 per cent of livestock respectively. Therefore, there is tremendous biotic pressure on forests. This is also one of the causes of deterioration of land status in the country. The NWDB has classified wastelands into two categories. One is culturable and the other unculturable wasteland. Culturable wastelands are those lands which have potential for the development of vegetative cover. These lands remain unproductive for various reasons such as water logging, salinity, non-availability of water or aridity and unfavourable terrain, etc. Large waste land areas are found in hills, arid, ravine and flood-prone areas of north western Himalayan states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, North Eastern states, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Unculturable wastelands are those lands which cannot be developed for vegetative cover. These lands are barren and cannot be put to significant uses. However, some of the areas of such lands can be converted/changed into pasture land. These lands are deserted areas near snowline areas with high degree to slope, etc. Non culturable wasteland can be turned into grasslands which can improve the ecological balance by protecting soil from rapid erosion and soil moisture decline. It can also enhance supplies of fodder and fuel at the same time. Thus, it can support pastoral activities, which is one of the areas of major concern in India. However, to address the problem of land degradation, the Government of India initiated the Wasteland Development Programme in 1985. The programme was to be implemented through the NWDB. The major objectives of the Board are: (i) to check land degradation, (ii) to put waste lands to sustainable use, (iii) increase biomass availability, specially fuel wood and fodder, and (iv) to restore ecological balance. Grassroots initiative is required in the afforestration programme and local communities have to be both the implementors and beneficiaries. The wasteland development programme should not be completely left to the forest department. This is an area where people's active participation is crucial. The forest department and other external agencies are required to provide only consultancy and support. Government officials along with the local NGOs must assist the farmers by demonstrating improved methods of cultivation and arranging loans for the farmers and the people from the weaker section of the society. Since most of the wastelands in the non-forest areas are privately owned, it would be effective if villages panchayats and local communities are involved in implementation of the programme. Local communities should be educated on the immediate and long-term benefits of the programme. For immediate benefits, emphasis should be given to raise species yielding intermediate products such as grasses, legumes, fodder, fruits, fuel wood and minor forest products. Benefits of these products should be shared by the concerned members of the community. This will be a great relief to the community to meet the requirements of fuel wood and fodder. Because acute shortage of fuel wood and fodder continues to persist throughout the country. The total demand for fuel wood alone is about 201 million tonnes. Implementation of afforestration programme can be successful if local communities establish their own organisations and assure equitable distribution of benefits to every member of the community. The principle of equity in distribution of local resources will contribute greatly to the success of the programme. But there should be credibility in implementing the programme. This arrangement of equity will make the people realise that it would be to their advantage if the project is made successful. Local people must be brought to the management process of the programme. They should be made active participants in planning, monitoring and reviewing, etc. Wasteland development being labour intensive, can also provide gainful employment. Now, forests are not viewed as a source of revenue, but as an ecological necessity. According to the National Forest Policy, forests are not to be commercially exploited for industries, but these are to conserve soil and environment and to meet the requirements of local people for subsistence. There is growing awareness all over the world that waste land utilisation will protect the environment from degradation and will also lead to sustainable development. Unless we adequately safeguard our 'good' lands and check further increase of wasteland, we may eventually face acute shortage of foodgrains, fodder and fuel etc in the near future. It may also devastate the livelihood of people dependent on forests.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Assam Tribune.For more information on news feed please contact Sarabjit Jagirdar at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Ship smokestacks may cause 87,000 deaths worldwide each year by 2012","Washington, July. 9 -- A new study has suggested that rising levels of smokestack emissions from oceangoing ships will cause an estimated 87,000 deaths worldwide each year by 2012, which is almost one-third higher than previously believed./The study said that government action to reduce sulfur emissions from shipping fuel (the source of air pollution linked to an increased risk of illness and death) could reduce that toll. Scientist James Winebrake and his team note that most oceangoing ships burn fuels with a high sulfur content that averages 2.4 percent. Their smokestacks emit sulfur-containing particles linked to increased risks of lung and heart disease. A 2007 study by the researchers estimated that about 60,000 people died prematurely around the world due to shipping-related emissions in 2002. The new study estimates that the toll could rise to 87,000 by 2012, assuming that the global shipping industry rebounds from the current economic slump and no new regulation occurs. Policymakers now are considering limiting ships emissions by either restricting sulfur content in fuel or designating air pollution control areas to reduce air pollution near highly populated coastal areas. Requiring ships to use marine fuel with 0.5 percent sulfur within 200 nautical miles of shore would reduce premature deaths by about 41,200, the study concluded. Lower sulfur reductions could reduce deaths even further, the study said, adding that designated emission control areas will also have a positive impact.

Kids of stressed out parents at 'increased air pollution-related asthma risk',"Washington, July. 21 -- Children of stressed out parents are at an increased risk of developing asthma associated with environmental triggers such as high levels of traffic-related pollution and tobacco smoke, says a new study./The study, led by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC), appears this week in the Online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study found that the risk of asthma associated with traffic-related pollution was significantly higher for children of parents reporting high levels of stress. Stress, as well as low parental education, was also associated with larger effects of exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy. ""We found that it was children exposed to the combination of air pollution and life in a stressful environment who were at highest risk of developing asthma,"" says principal investigator Rob McConnell, M.D., professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and Deputy Director of the Children's Environmental Health Center at USC. The study drew upon data from the USC Children's Health Study, a longitudinal study of respiratory health among children in 13 southern California communities. Researchers followed 2,497 children with no history of respiratory problems over three years, tracking whether they developed asthma starting in kindergarten or first grade. They also measured parental stress and parental education-as an indicator of socioeconomic status-using a questionnaire, and collected information on exposure to traffic-related pollution and whether the children had been exposed to tobacco smoke in utero. The results showed that parental stress alone did not increase the risk that children would develop asthma. However, when children had a combination of parents with stressful lives and also lived near high levels of traffic-related pollution, their risk of asthma increased compared with children only exposed to pollution. ""Air pollution can promote inflammatory responses in the airways of the lung, which is a central feature of asthma,"" McConnell says. ""Stress may also have pro-inflammatory effects and this may help explain why the two exposures together were important,"" the expert added. Children whose parents perceived their lives as unpredictable, uncontrollable, or overwhelming were susceptible to the effects of pollution, the authors noted.

Prenatal air pollution exposure reduces kids' IQs in later life,"Washington, July. 21 -- Prenatal exposure to high levels of a common airborne pollutant compound can adversely affect a child's intelligence quotient or IQ, claims a new study./According to the research, by the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) at the Mailman School of Public Health, fetal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can hit kids' IQ's in later life. PAHs are chemicals released into the air from the burning of coal, diesel, oil and gas, or other organic substances such as tobacco. In urban areas motor vehicles are a major source of PAHs. The study, which is published in the August 2009 issue of Pediatrics, found that children exposed to high levels of PAHs in New York City had full scale and verbal IQ scores that were 4.31 and 4.67 points lower, respectively than those of less exposed children. High PAH levels were defined as above the median of 2.26 nanograms per cubic meter (ng/m3). ""These findings are of concern because these decreases in IQ could be educationally meaningful in terms of school performance,"" says Frederica Perera, DrPH, professor of Environmental Health Sciences and director of the CCCEH at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and study lead author. ""The good news is that we have seen a decline in air pollution exposure in our cohort since 1998, testifying to the importance of policies to reduce traffic congestion and other sources of fossil fuel combustion byproducts,"" the expert added. The children were followed from in utero to 5 years of age. The mothers wore personal air monitors during pregnancy to measure exposure to PAHs and they responded to questionnaires. At 5 years of age, 249 children were given an intelligence test known as the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of the Intelligence, which provides verbal, performance and full-scale IQ scores. The researchers developed models to calculate the associations between prenatal PAH exposure and IQ. They accounted for other factors such as second-hand smoke exposure, lead, mother's education and the quality of the home caretaking environment. Study participants exposed to air pollution levels below the average were designated as having ""low exposure,"" while those exposed to pollution levels above the average were identified as ""high exposure."" A total of 140 children were classified as having high PAH exposure.

Early exposure to ultrafine air pollution linked to lung disease in adulthood,"Washington, July. 23 -- A new study has revealed that early exposure to environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, and respiratory viruses might put infants at an increased risk of lung disease in adulthood./It can lead to pulmonary inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma later in life. The researchers from Louisiana State University, New Orleans showed that early exposure to ultrafine pollutants caused genes to produce a number of proteins, including one associated with COPD and steroid-resistant asthma, and also caused proteins to misfold, rendering them dysfunctional. These genetic defects are linked to structural changes in the lung, airflow limitations, and permanent changes in immune responses. ""It is no surprise that elevations in airborne particulate matter (PM) are associated with increased hospital admissions for respiratory symptoms including asthma exacerbations,"" said lead researcher Stephania Cormier, PhD, Associate Professor of Pharmacology at LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans. ""What has come as a surprise is that early exposure to elevated levels of PM elicits long-term effects on lung function and lung development in children,"" she added. The findings were presented at the 11th International Congress on Combustion By-Products and Their Health Effects at the Environmental Protection Agency Conference Centre in Research Triangle Park, N.C.

Global environmental degradation,"Guwahati, July 24 -- The global climate change is attributable to a variety of causes, both natural and man-made./Among the natural causes, mention may be made of gradual increase in temperature, among others, on the earth's surface as also sea beds over the last century what in scientific parlance known as 'global warming' as a result of increase in concentration of naturally occuring greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, etc which prevent some of the heat radiation from the earth escaping into space affecting the energy-storage capacity of the atmosphere and oceans. The depletion of Ozone layer in the atmosphere may also affect the climate which may be manifested in plants, animals, and human beings. These phenomena create geologically cataclysmic events like dust winds, hurricanes, cyclonic storms, high tidal waves causing damage of unprecedented scale. It may be recalled that the 1992 Earth Summit at Rio De Janeiro (UNCED) recommended the adoption and implementation of Integrated Coastal Management Plans (ICZMP) highlighting the vulnerability of the coasts to natural hazards, like pollution resulting in resource depletion leading to poverty and hunger and the consequent user conflicts. However, the importance of the coasts in India' their human and resource potential and consequent vulnerability to natural hazards has been increasingly recognised by the Governments as also Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and concerted efforts have been made in this direction to avert any calamity of this magnitude in future. India has a long coastline of 5,422 km and island coastline of 2,094 km (Ramachandran, 2001). The coastal areas of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, West Bengal and Orissa are subjected to natural hazards of varying intensity depending on the topography and geomorphology of these States. Inundation in the event of cyclonic storm surges, global warming or tidal impacts is mostly confined to low-lying areas of the coasts, which are the habitat of the fishermen communities. In the even of any untoward natural calamity like tsunami of recent years, fishermen communities of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, etc were the worst hit, not only losing their household properties but also their fishing boats and fishing nets, which are their only means of livelihood. Coast is the meeting ground of land and water. Hence coasts are subjected to geological actions of the air, water and all the landward processes including human actions. The coastlines are endowed with rich renewable resources, accessibility of communication network. The infrastructure development coupled with economic activities are attracting more population into the coastal domain. Today, 50 per cent of the world's population (about 3.2 billion) lives along the coastline spread over 80 per cent of the world's sovereign States. In USA, over 80 per cent of the people live within 50 miles of the coast while in India, over 250 million (about a quarter of the country's population) live within 50 km from the coast. India's Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) is a uniform 500m, whether it is for the known tidal impact zones of Rann of Kachchh, Sunderbans or the minimal impact zone such as Kovalan in Kerala. The recent tsunami should serve as an eye opener to the need for the scientifically defined parameters for the Indian coasts. This will help keep our costly infrastructures in relatively safer locations and suggesting indications of risk to the population. Way back in November 27, 1981, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi wrote a letter to the Chief Ministers of all coastal States directing them to ensure that the entire coastline of India should be protected from environmental degradation. Gandhi also stated that 500-metre strip of coastline should be kept free of all unnecessary development. The CMs were also asked to prepare Coastal Zone Plan for their States and get it approved by the Central Government. Unfortunately, since the Prime Minister's directive had no legal statutory basis, it was not seriously enforced anywhere. As long as, Indira Gandhi remained in power, there was semblance of enforcement, but the moment, she was out of power, her directive was thrown to the winds. In almost every State, indiscriminate setting up of industrial complexes, residential buildings, commercial buildings, luxury hotels continued unabated. For example, in Maharashtra, the 'Kharlands Board' continued to reclaim coastal wetlands for the cultivation of salt resistant varieties of paddy. In the process, thousands of mangrove ecosystems were destroyed. Mangrove plants are those that can survive in areas of high salinity, tidal extremes, strong wind velocity, high temperature and muddy anaerobic soil, which are generally hostile for other plants. Mangroves not only protect the coastal communities from the fury of cyclones and coastal storms, but also promote sustainable fisheries and prevent sea erosion. Due to rapid change of life-style of the population, especially in cities and urban fringe, the demand for automobiles, cars, refrigerators, computers, and other electronic gadgets for luxury and comfort has increased phenomenally. Concomitantly, the use of fossil fuel like gas and oil has increased enormously leading to air pollution, causing respiratory diseases. The power sector is also responsible for significant environmental impact, such as half of carbon dioxide emissions in the country, land use pattern of open cast mining and deterioration in air quality around power plants. Lakhs of people are displaced by power projects every year, especially the large hydro projects. The investment for establishment of power projects for generation of additional electricity is mind-boggling. There is urgent need to conserve electricity by way of lighting efficiency. The peak demand of electricity in the evening is largely driven by use of Incandescent Bulbs for lighting. If replaced by suitable fluorescent lamps, such as Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs), then power usage would reduce by three quarters without reducing the light output.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Assam Tribune.For more information on news feed please contact Surit Das at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>/For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

"Skies turn red in NSW, Queensland's worst ever dust storm in history","Sydney, Sep. 23 -- A dust storm covered the New South Wales and southern Queensland on Wednesday and blanketed the states in an eerie red haze and pushed air pollution levels to 1500 times their normal levels - the highest in the history of the states. According to reports, the dust cloud covered almost the whole of New South Wales, and the states were hit with strong winds and low visibility. The dust also caused cancellation of flights from Sydney Airport, traffic jam, the closure of the M5 tunnel and the suspension of Sydney ferries./Dr John Leys, principal research scientist at the NSW Department of Climate Change and Water, said that the initial estimates revealed that the dust plume stretched 600km along the NSW coast from Sydney to the Queensland border and Brisbane, dumping up to 75,000 tonnes of dust per hour into the Tasman Sea, News.com.au reports. 'It's travelled about 1500km to get to Sydney,' Dr Leys added./Health authorities also advised people with respiratory illnesses to stay indoors and to avoid exercise until the dust cleared./'The measurements taken in Sydney today showed the highest level of particle concentration on record. A normal day would see around 10 micrograms of particles per cubic metre of air and a bushfire might generate 500 micrograms,' said Chris Eiser, Manager of Atmospheric Science with the department./Weather officials have further warned of another severe storm to sweep across the southern and eastern parts of the country tomorrow and Friday with the potential to create another dust storm.

New Patsari stove improves women's lung health,"Washington, Sept. 23 -- Using a vented stove instead of the traditional indoor open fires might improve respiratory health of women, according to a new study./An estimated two billion people around the world rely on biomass fuel for cooking, typically over unvented indoor fires./These indoor fires generate high levels of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide./One recent analysis put exposure to indoor biomass smoke among the world's top ten environmental causes of mortality and morbidity./The ""Patsari"" stove designed to address this problem has been found to reduce indoor air pollution concentrations by an average of 70 percent./During the study, lead researcher Horacio Riojas-Rodr'guez, of the Instituto Nacional de Salud P'blica, followed women in more than 500 households from Central Mexico, who had been randomized to receive the new Patsari stove./The study showed that fewer than a third of women assigned to receive the Patsari stove reported ""mainly"" using it, and another 20 percent reported that they used it in conjunction with the open fire, and fully half reported mainly using the traditional open wood fire, despite having been assigned to the intervention group./When the researchers analyzed those who used the Patsari stove versus those who did not, they found strong evidence that use of the Patsari stoves was associated with marked improvements in respiratory health./""Over 12 months of follow-up, the use of the Patsari stove showed a protective effect on respiratory and other symptoms, and a trend to improve lung function that was comparable to smoking cessation,"" said Riojas./In fact, women using the Patsari stove had half the decline in a key measure of lung function-forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1-than women using open wood fires. Among those who used the Patsari stove, the loss was 31 ml over a year, versus the 62 ml over a year for the open fire users, a similar effect as what is seen in tobacco cessation./""These findings each help support the notion that stove intervention programs in the developing world can improve health when the women adhere to the intervention,"" wrote Luke Naeher, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Georgia, in an accompanying editorial./He added that the study ""helps to highlight both the tremendous potential of these programs in the developing world to improve health and the quality of life, and also the great need for continued research to help us understand how to best implement these programs.""/The study appears in American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

Air unhealthy in 70% areas in urban India,"New Delhi, Sept. 28 -- The air above urban India is worsening. And the Capital is leading the way with its old city recording the highest pollution level in the country, said a report of the Central Pollution Control Board./The report, accessed exclusively by HT as it has not been made public yet, said there has been a 19 per cent increase in air pollution in urban areas with 70 per cent of locations above critical levels./Chandni Chowk topped the list of 10 most polluted areas, moving up five positions from the previous list. Janakpuri debuted in the list, making it two for Delhi./The environment watchdog measured respirable suspended particulate matter - whose presence in the air beyond a certain level causes respiratory diseases like asthma - at 357 locations in the country in 2008./""Particulate matter level in most locations showed an upward trend,"" said pollution control board chairman SP Gautam. The watchdog blamed it on rising vehicular population, congestion and increasing industrial activity./Car and two-wheeler sales are increasing at an annual rate of around 15 per cent but every year, increase in road capacity is of less than one per cent, said Anumita Roy Chowdhury of the advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment./""The Ring Road in Delhi was built with a carrying capacity of 75,000 vehicles during peak hour,"" she said.

"Human activities can worsen 'blue haze', says researcher","Washington, October. 7 -- Human activities can worsen 'blue haze''a common occurrence that appears over heavily forested areas around the world due to natural emissions of chemicals'to the point of affecting the world's weather and even cause potential climate problems, says a Texas A&M University researcher./Renyi Zhang, a professor of Atmospheric Sciences who has studied air chemistry for over two decades, says that blue haze'tiny particles or aerosols suspended in the air'can be negatively affected by human activities such as power plants or fossil-fuel burning./He highlights the fact that man-made activities, mainly large power plants that emit huge amounts of particles into the air, can worsen blue haze and cause previously unforeseen problems./'The study shows that the natural way of blue haze formation is rather inefficient and that human activities make blue haze conditions worse,' he says./'What happens is that a mix of natural and man-made chemicals speeds up the formation of these particles in the Earth's atmosphere, and there, they reflect sunlight back into space. The results can affect cloud formations and ultimately, much of the world's climate,' he adds./The research team'including experts from Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, the Molina Center for Energy and Environment in La Jolla, California, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology'point out that when man-made activities emit sulfur dioxide into the air, they contribute to blue haze, usually in a negative way./Zhang notes that aerosols can be produced by many different processes that occur on land and water or in the atmosphere itself./'Weather patterns can be affected worldwide and the blue haze can worsen the breathing problems of many people, such as those who suffer from asthma or emphysema,' he says./'The chemistry of Earth's atmosphere can be directly affected by these aerosols. From cloud formations to health problems and air pollution, much of it can be traced back to these aerosol particles,' the researcher adds, noting that aerosol particles can influence the size and rate of cloud droplets, directly affecting cloud cover and precipitation./According to Zhang, coal plants often produced sulfur dioxide, a highly toxic substance that reach the Earth's atmosphere, and helps the formation of aerosol particles./He stresses that this problem is not new, for former President Ronald Reagan once mentioned it during a speech about three decades ago./Zhang also stressed the need for more research 'study the full extent of how blue haze is affected by human activities, and perhaps to look at ways to control the situation. It's a problem that can have global consequences.'/A research article on his team's study has been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

New mobile lab allows scientists to study damaging health effects of air pollution,"Washington, October. 8 -- A new mobile air research laboratory will help a team of researchers led by a Michigan State University professor better understand the damaging health effects of air pollution and why certain airborne particles - emitted from plants and vehicles - induce disease and illness./Jack Harkema, a University Distinguished Professor of pathobiology and diagnostic investigation in the College of Veterinary Medicine, will deploy the new 53-foot, 36,000-pound center - dubbed ""AirCARE 2"" - throughout southern Michigan, including metropolitan Detroit./""The mobile laboratory allows us to analyze 'real-world' pollution in communities that may be at risk,"" he said./""We can study why certain ailments, such as asthma, cardiovascular disease and even obesity, may be more pronounced after exposure to particulate air pollution,"" he added./With about 450 square feet of indoor laboratory space, the 400,000 dollars center helps researchers study fine and ultrafine particles in air pollution./These small particles have been found to increase mortality and morbidity among susceptible people with pre-existing health conditions such as heart disease./Housed in a converted semitrailer, the mobile laboratory pulls air from the surrounding atmosphere through an air-particle concentrator, allowing the scientists to selectively collect the particles and analyze for chemical components that may be responsible for damaging health effects./Researchers can study the subtle effects of controlled particle exposure on both laboratory animals and human subjects, providing clues on why and how pollutant particles are so harmful to the heart and lungs./""We know particles in the air can exacerbate pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease in people,"" Harkema said./""We need to understand why. There are many different components to air pollution, and we want to determine which of these are most harmful and where there come from,"" he added./The addition of the new mobile laboratory allows Harkema and U-M collaborators Robert Brook, a cardiologist, and Gerald Keeler, an atmospheric scientist, to conduct a new study funded by the Environmental Protection Agency./As part of the project, Harkema, Brook and Keeler will deploy AirCARE 2 in rural southeastern Michigan to study the cardiovascular health effects of transported air pollution originating from distant emission sites in Michigan or adjacent states.

Airport gears up to tackle smog cover,"umbai, Oct. 29 -- As Mumbai battles with flight delays the ongoing runway revamp at the airport, the city's worsening air quality could bring more bad news for fliers./Apprehending thick smog (a combination of smoke and fog) cover to affect visibility at the airport this winter, weather sensors installed along the runway will now also convey data on smog presence to the air traffic control (ATC)./Air-borne pilots have also been allotted codes to access the weather data./The weather sensors, installed in May, are already conveying data on wind speed, rainfall and visibility. Though Mumbai does not feature in the fog-prone zone like Delhi and other northern cities but increasing air pollution is likely to cause smog leading to further flight delays this winter, said climate scientist./""We are not equipped like Delhi airport to tackle smog because the winter season here is very different. The problem could send morning peak hour schedules off gear,"" said an ATC official requesting anonymity, as he is not authorised to the talk to the media./""Thick smog cover is likely to affect visibility throughout this winter,"" said R.V. Sharma, deputy director (western region) of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). ""Air pollutants cling to the sky when temperature drops leading to drop in visibility,"" he added./Worried by the disturbing projection, the weather bureau for the first time would be sending smog updates to the ATC officials at Mumbai airport./""We will send them regular updates to keep pilots informed on fluctuating visibility,"" added Sharma./A study released by the New York-based Desert Research Institute in August showed that Mumbai tops in vehicular emission amongst 20 other Indian cities because of congested roads and fewer vehicles running on compressed natural gas. The study also revealed that the city's vehicle population jumped by 10 to 12 per cent last year./Already 80 per cent flights leaving the city are running late by 35 to 40 minutes since October 1 when the airport's secondary runway shut for maintenance till January.

Both genetics and environmental factors determine asthma risk,"Washington, Nov. 7 -- It's not just genes, environmental exposure too determines if a person would develop asthma, says a leading expert./Dr. Fernando D. Martinez, director of Arizona Respiratory Center, said that 39 potential ""asthma genes"" have already been identified./But, for nearly every gene found to be negatively associated with asthma in one study, other studies have failed to replicate the findings./""This suggests that the effect of these genes on allergic diseases is not direct and simple. Many genetic variants associated with asthma will not increase the risk of the disease in all persons. Most will modulate the effects of environmental exposures, making certain subjects more or less susceptible,"" he said./With respect to environmental exposures worsening asthma, Martinez highlights viral infections, passive smoking and air pollution./But the impact of all environmental factors is not necessarily obvious, as some exposures play a protective role./""For example, in farming communities where exposure to microbial products is high, children have significantly less asthma and allergies,"" said Martinez./In some cases, an allele (part of a gene) found to be a higher risk factor for allergic asthma in some individuals might be associated with less risk of developing asthma in others./Martinez has pinpointed the CD14 gene as one such example, saying that when people with a variant of this gene are exposed to high levels of endotoxin (a product present in bacteria), it protects them from developing an allergic response./But people with this same gene variant who are exposed to low levels of endotoxin are at higher risk of an allergy./Research is going on to identify and understand the genes related to asthma./""We have identified many genetic variants associated with asthma and allergies. However, only a fraction of the variants have been discovered. A lot of work still needs to be done to uncover how these diseases are inherited,"" said Marteniz./Martinez suggests that the expectation that doctors will someday be able to predict asthma at birth should be replaced with an expectation that experts will be able to identify which children should or should not be exposed to certain environmental factors to lessen their risk of developing asthma./""The hope is that by combining information on genetic markers and exposures, we will be able to identify even more accurately children at high-risk for different forms of asthma in the future,"" he said./The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Miami Beach, Fla.

Air pollution takes a toll on blood vessels,"Washington, Nov. 18 -- Air pollution apparently has short and long-term ill effects on the health and resiliency of blood vessels, a study has found./In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Air Pollution Study, the researchers used ultrasound-guided measurements of blood-vessel diameter and responsiveness in 3,501 participants./They recorded air pollution levels in six urban U.S. regions the day before the blood vessel measurements were taken and estimated annual exposure to fine particulate air pollution./The results link long-term exposure to air pollution with both forearm-artery narrowing and a reduced ability of these arteries to adjust to normal changes in blood flow./On the other hand, short-term exposure to air pollution only appeared to affect artery narrowing./The study suggests that both types of changes may be early cardiovascular disease risk factors affected by the environment.

"How air pollution, cigarette smoke trigger coughing","Washington, November. 24 -- Researchers have found how environmental irritants, such as air pollution and cigarette smoke, trigger coughing./In a study conducted by experts from Imperial College London and the University of Hull, it was found that irritants activate receptor proteins called TRPA1 on the surface of nerve endings in the lungs./Subsequently, sensory nerves trigger a cough reflex./The researchers insisted that blocking TRPA1 receptors could treat coughing./Professor Maria Belvisi, co-author of the study from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, said: ""For some people, chronic coughing can be annoying and uncomfortable, but for others it can be distressing and can have a severe impact on their quality of life./""Many people say that certain things in the air can make them cough and we are very excited that we have shown, for the first time, exactly what is probably happening inside the lungs.""/The researchers observed the sensory nerves from mice and guinea pigs as part of the study./They also noted a number of irritants, including a key compound in cigarette smoke (acrolein) and a chemical called cinnamaldehyde./But when they blocked the receptors, the substances no longer activated the nerves./Maria concluded: ""Now that we think we have cracked the mechanism, we can start investigating whether we can stop people from coughing excessively by blocking the receptor protein that triggers it.""/The study was published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

Metals and diesel emissions linked to respiratory symptoms in kids,"Washington, Nov. 24 -- A new study has shown that exposure shortly after birth to ambient metals from residential heating oil combustion and particles from diesel emissions are associated with respiratory symptoms in young inner city children./The study by researchers at the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health is the first to analyse the effects of exposure to airborne metals in this very young population and the findings could have important public health implications./The study also contributes to a further understanding of how specific sources of air pollution may impact child health./The study compared pollutant levels with respiratory symptoms of children between birth and age two living in Northern Manhattan and in the South Bronx, and found that the airborne metals nickel and vanadium, were risk factors for wheezing in young children./Residual oil combustion for heating is a major source in New York City of these metals. Elemental carbon, an indicator of diesel exhaust, was associated with increased frequency of coughing only during cold and flu season (September through April)./""It appears that exposure to ambient metals and diesel-exhaust particles in our air may lead to several respiratory symptoms for young children living in urban areas,"" said Rachel L. Miller, associate professor of Medicine and Environmental Health Sciences (in Paediatrics) at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center and co-deputy director of CCCEH at the Mailman School of Public Health and senior investigator on the study./""The effects of exposure to airborne metals had not been studied previously in children so young, and these findings could have important public health implications for members of inner-city communities in New York City and elsewhere,"" Miller added./Molini M. Patel, lead author and previously a research scientist in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and a CCCEH investigator, said: ""These findings increase our understanding of the effects of specific pollutants from heating oil combustion and traffic on respiratory health in very young children.""/""Our results are of concern especially because levels of nickel in our study area, Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx, are among the highest in New York City and in the U.S., as are the rates of pediatric asthma.""/The investigators controlled for exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, sex, ethnicity, and seasonal trends, all of which have been linked to increased respiratory symptoms and asthma in other studies./The study has been published in the December 2009 issue of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

Fuel vapour exposure increases road rage,"Washington, November. 24 -- Exposure to fumes from leaded and unleaded gasoline while refuelling cars could lead to increased aggressive behaviour, says a new study./Amal Kinawy, Cairo University, Egypt, based the research on rats divided into three groups with each leaded-gas fumes, unleaded-gas fumes or clean air./The expert found that rats exposed to either kind of fuel vapour became more aggressive, such as more time spent in belligerent postures and increased numbers of actual attacks, as compared to the clean air group./Kinawy said: ""Rats exposed to unleaded gasoline showed indications of increased damage caused by free radicals and altered levels of neurotransmitters in the brain cortex region, in comparison with the control or leaded gasoline groups./""Furthermore, inhalation of both fuels induced significant fluctuations in neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum""./Kinawy concluded: ""Heightened aggression may be yet another risk for the human population chronically exposed to urban air polluted by automobile smoke""./The study was published in the open access journal BMC Physiology.

Karnataka villagers reduce carbon emissions by using biogas,"Doddapalli (Karnataka), Dec. 5 -- At a time when the world pressure is on India to rein in its 'carbon intensity', a non-descript village in Karnataka has set an example by choosing biogas over the conventional firewood hence, unknowingly pitching in its bit towards reducing carbon emissions./The lives of the residents of Doddapalli village located in Bagepalli sub-division of Kolar district in the state have changed drastically after opting for biogas./At present around 80 biogas plants are operating successfully in the village and more are being set up./Earlier the women in Doddapalli had to go to the nearby forest area everyday to collect firewood for cooking but today, after the installation of biogas plants in their backyards, they are happy with this cleaner fuel and also to help save the environment./""Well, the government has been extending all assistance to us in setting up of these bio-gas plants. Thanks to the biogas, no more the trees are felled for firewood and thus they are saved. As for the hygiene and health aspects, we do not have smoke bothering the eyes,"" said Gowri, a villager./""Earlier we had to endure lot of problems, ranging from headache and burning of eyes due to smoke from the burning of firewood. But now all those worries are over. Back from working in the fields, be it coffee or meals, every item is prepared in a neat way. The utensils are soot free. A great benefit, I must say,"" said Kamala, another villager.Apart from the cooking needs, the residue of the livestock dung from the biogas plant is also ideal manure for the fields./It also reduces the risk of diseases like pneumonia, cataract, tuberculosis which are quite common in households using firewood stoves./After switching to biogas and getting rid of smoke from the conventional stoves, the health of the villagers has also improved tremendously./Presently around 80 biogas plants are functioning at Doddapalli and more residents from here as well as other villages are eager to set up similar non-conventional energy plants.Subsidies extended by the government have further encouraged the villagers to come forth to set up the biogas plants in the backyards of their abodes./Central Government has also initiated a project to equip the rural households with efficient cooking stoves in an effort to reduce air pollution.

Rising air pollution levels choke city,"umbai, Dec. 14 -- Pravin Shukla (37), an Andheri resident, took two hours longer to reach his Worli office last Thursday because poor visibility had reduced traffic to a crawl on the western express highway./Shukla, a marketing executive, and many others were held up by smog - an unhealthy mix of smoke and fog. But weathermen dismissed the smog cover as a common winter feature in Mumbai. ""Air pollutants floating high in the atmosphere move closer to the surface with a dip in temperature,"" said RV Sharma, deputy director (western region) of the Indian Meteorological Department./Mumbai's air pollution data shows that levels of respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM), the main ingredient of smog, are currently double the permissible limit. According to data collected by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), the average RSPM in November this year was 200 pg/mg3. The permissible standard set by MPCB is 100 pg/m3. Last year, RSPM levels stood at 203 pm/m3 during November./From 1999, when the RSPM levels were at 101 pm/m3, the pollution level has increased marginally every year. ""This year, we have not seen any significant increase in air pollution compared to last year,"" said Indrani Gupta, who monitors air quality at the Worli-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute./Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director with the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, said: ""We haven't seen any increase in pollution levels. But the smog presence could be felt for a longer duration if the wind speed is less and allows pollutants to settle down.""/Rapid construction growth could be a contributor to rising air pollution. According to environmental body, Toxic Link, 3000 metric tonnes of concrete waste is dumped in the city daily. ""Dust particles and smoke from biogas are main causes of smog,"" said Pradhan Parthasarthy, a climate scientist with The Energy and Resource Institute. But there has been no study to prove that concrete waste directly causes smog./Scientists said a sharper drop in temperature or rise in air pollution could worsen the situation. The average minimum temperature from November to December has been around the 22-degree Celsius mark, far above last year when the temperature dipped to 16 degree Celsius.

Asthmatics find it difficult to breathe in smog-filled air,"umbai, Dec. 14 -- Bouts of breathlessness have been waking Rekha Advani (42) at 4 am almost everyday for the past week. For the severely asthmatic Chembur resident, this is a sign that winter has begun./""I feel completely drained out after the attacks,"" said Advani, an administrator in a Bandra nursing home./Advani is not alone. The dip in temperature coupled with the morning smog has affected many asthma and chronic bronchitis patients./Healthy individuals are also coming down with viral infections, colds and sore throats./""I have been treating four to five such cases daily instead of the usual one or two,"" said Dr A.G. Ballani, consultant physician at Lilavati Hospital./The doctor had to get two asthma patients hospitalised in the past week./Smog carries a high concentration of dust and aerosols, which easily enter the respiratory tract and cause infection./""Exposure to smog is known to trigger breathlessness,"" said Dr Amita Athavle, who heads the Environmental Pollution Research Centre at KEM Hospital in Parel. ""Air pollution levels tend to rise with the onset of winter and peak after December,"" she added./Bombay Hospital physician Dr Ashish Tiwari said the ground-level ozone, which is a primary component of smog, damages the inner lining of lungs. People with asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - narrowing of lung's airways - should consult their doctors, said Dr Athavle. ""They may need to increase the dose of their medicines or take pneumonia vaccine.""/Advani has been using the nebuliser (device used to give reliever medicines to patients during an emergency) twice a day./""My doctor has asked me to keep an oxygen cylinder handy so it can be used in case I get a severe attack and it takes too long to reach the hospital,"" she added.

Spurt in respiratory diseases likely in State,"GUWAHATI, Dec. 18 -- Rising pollution is likely to increase respiratory diseases among the people of the State. With air pollution beginning to make an impact in the last couple of years, more people would be at risk from a range of maladies like bronchitis, TB and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A substantial section of those affected would comprise the aged, the young and the poor./According to doctors, a comparative analysis of pollution related physical disorders would show incidence in Assam to be lower than those in some other states. However, pollution levels are rising, and without strategic interventions the situation is poised to deteriorate fast./A recent study conducted by the Department of TB and Respiratory Medicine, Gauhati Medical College, and sponsored by the Indian Council of Medical Research has indicated that two to three percent of the State's population already stand affected by diseases like asthma and allergy./The study signalled that people in rural areas were affected by respiratory diseases as much as residents of urban areas. Elderly people formed a large chunk of those affected, and people already suffering from respiratory diseases could endure even more difficult times./'Abiding by the precautionary principle Assam Government has to act tough on pollution. Not just the economic cost, the human cost of unabated carbon and other gas emissions in Assam would be immense,' said a senior physician based in Guwahati./Various toxic elements in polluted air from vehicles and industry are responsible for allergies, hyper tension, eye diseases, and even cancer, he asserted./According to Dr Pranab Baruwa of GMC's Department of TB and Respiratory Medicine, links between pollution and respiratory diseases have been clearly established by medical research. Apart from pollution, prevalence of smoking has also resulted in rise of diseases like asthma and COPD, not to mention cancer./Referring to smoking as one of the biggest causes of respiratory diseases, Dr Baruwa said that quitting the habit was a sure way to regain better health. Emphasising the point, he mentioned that it was never too late to quit smoking./On smoking and women, the doctor revealed that the problem was particularly worrying in the rural areas of the State. Studies have shown that a large number of women were hooked to bidi, thereby increasing their vulnerability to a host of diseases./With a view to empower doctors with the latest medical know how, a 'Respiratory Update' is to be held at Guwahati on December 20 under the aegis of the Indian Chest Society. Seven senior consultants from different parts of India will speak on select topics and some would provide hands-on training in pulmonary medicine.

Pollution and health,"Guwahati, Dec. 23 -- The dots were always there, now they are getting connected to form a picture of serious concern. Pollution levels in Assam are rising and along with it incidence of diseases associated with various pollutants. Across the State, once known for low emissions, toxic elements are beginning to foul the atmosphere, soil and water. Not surprisingly the cases of maladies like respiratory disorders, skin ailments, and even cancer are witnessing a steady climb. A recent study conducted by the Department of TB and Respiratory Medicine has affirmed that parts of the State have two per cent of their people suffering from some form of allergies. The number of cases is considerable in rural areas as well as in urban pockets, proving that pollution has not spared anyone even though their physical locations could be quite different. Those acquainted with the study have appropriately pointed to the need for better control over pollution, and especially vehicular emission, which is a source of pollution in a state where industrial pollution is relatively low. Some time back, this newspaper also carried reports about the high incidence of cancer in Kamrup Urban area, which could have connections with the increase in pollution./Experts in air pollution observe that the State is under siege from lax implementation of pollution laws. Although the Pollution Control Board and the Transport Department have the mandate to monitor and take action, both have been found wanting in acting against polluters. The latter has failed in monitoring emission from old vehicles which continue to ply on the State's roads. Over loaded goods carriers, poorly maintained vehicles, ignorant drivers continue to multiply, contributing to rising pollution near arterial roads, and even amid densely populated urban areas. In such a backdrop, with the Government departments proving their ineptness, the people are left to suffer. Diseases from pollution could be chronic, and also lead to death and thus the human and economic cost is immense. The tragedy is that due to apathy a large section of the poor, the aged and the young are among the worst sufferers. Especially in remote areas, deaths due to pollution related factors go mostly unreported. It is time the Government took the issue seriously and planned interventions to confront the very real challenge. Otherwise, a situation is not far off when the magnitude of the problem would be too large for interventions to be really effective. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Assam Tribune.

Air supply,"New Delhi, Jan. 23 -- Living with pollution has become a sad reality of our lives, especially if we live in the metros. Air pollution is a big part of this scenario. Every day, we breathe in toxic pollutants that lead to coughs, allergies, lowered immunity, upper and lower respiratory infections, sinusitis, headaches and lowered concentration and performance./If you think that you can escape this by staying indoors, you're wrong. Many studies have demonstrated that 'the indoors can be several times more polluted than the external environment'./But do not worry. There are many ways to improve your working and living environment and make it healthy and safe. Here's how:/Use fewer carpets and clean them frequently. Carpets are storehouses of dust mites and organisms./Use fewer chemicals and sprays in your environment. It is not always necessary to clean with chemical sprays. Simple soap and water will often do just as well./Whenever a surface is freshly varnished or painted, ventilate the place thoroughly before switching on your air conditioning unit./Chemical room fresheners may be convenient, but it is preferable to use natural room fresheners. Rooms that are completely sealed need to get the air conditioning units cleaned from time to time. Smoking in office rooms should be discouraged./Particle boards and other smaller materials contribute to air pollution within buildings. Clean the air with plants placed inside the office. Benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene are some of the common pollutants indoors./Plants are the green lungs of the earth. Though we may not have the luxury of having large trees, we can get some benefits from bringing some of nature's lungs into our spaces. These include improved oxygen levels, improved concentration, improved productivity and better spirits and a better-looking environment. Low maintenance plants include money plant, areca palm, peace lily, Boston fern, bamboo palm, lady palm and rubber plant. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

New asthma program to specifically help teens,"Washington, March 9 -- A teen-specific asthma program could help people in rural areas to manage their disease and avoid potentially fatal complications, Medical College of Georgia researchers say./Black males have a death rate from asthma that is six times greater than their white counterparts./According to Dr. Dennis Ownby, chief in the MCG School of Medicine Section of Allergy and Immunology, asthma rates are as bad in rural areas as they are in inner cities./""The prevalence is probably the same in rural areas. But teens from those areas already face a number of other problems that can complicate their disease - poor housing quality, air pollution, more trouble getting to doctors and smaller, less-equipped hospitals,"" he said./Forgetting to take medications or carry rescue inhalers only exacerbates the problem, as does exposure to tobacco - either from smoking or second-hand smoke./Ownby said previous studies have shown smoking is more prevalent in rural areas than inner-cities./The researchers think that Puff City, a culturally-tailored intervention program aimed at three key areas - reduction of tobacco exposure, adherence to medication and attack readiness - could help at-risk teens better manage their asthma./Over the next three years the researchers will work with 300 Ninth- to 11th-graders with asthma from Burke, Jefferson and McDuffie counties./Half of the teens will be exposed to traditional educational asthma Web sites; the other half will use Puff City./Puff City uses a ""hip"" character known as DJ Puffman to reach teens through a multi-session, Web-based program./Each time students log on, the character gives advice that is individually tailored to each student's asthma condition based on previously provided information about how the student already deals with the disease./""The program really comes alive for them. It may ask a question, for instance, about how they can best remember to take their medication, maybe by placing it next to their cell phone at night. The next time they log in to the program, DJ Puffman will ask how that strategy is working for them,"" said Dr. Martha Tingen, a nurse researcher at the Georgia Prevention Institute./In each group, teens receive four computerized asthma management sessions that are accessed on computers at school./Users also can problem solve asthma-management issues and hear educational information on the disease./The program has already proven useful in other populations./Teens in inner-city Detroit, where it was originally tested, made 50 percent fewer visits to emergency departments, required 50 percent fewer hospitalizations and had 60 percent fewer school absences./""We are hoping that this is a program that can be easily disseminated world-wide at a relatively low cost,"" said Tingen.

Brick kilns polluting air in Azara area,"AZARA, March. 14 -- Azara and its adjoining areas like Dharapur, Khanamukh, Garal on the outskirts of the city are reeling under air pollution caused by brick kilns since a couple of years. There are about twenty brick kilns which are causing pollution in the said areas./Smoke emanating from the brick kilns is affecting human lives and the standing crops as well as the flora and fauna of the Deepor beel, the water bodies, 10 km west to the city. The number of crop and fish production has been alarmingly decreasing due to pollution caused by these brick kilns in the area./Though the people of the affected areas has repeatedly urged the Pollution Control Board to check the rising pollution, the board has not taken any positive step in this regard./Orientation prog: A one-day orientation programme on disaster management was held recently at SIRD extension centre, Kahikuchi under the aegis of Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA)./The programme was attended by about 100 representatives of gaon panchayats, youth clubs, CBOs, NGOs and rural volunteers.

Heart abnormalities diagnosed in World Trade Center workers,"Washington, March 17 -- The World Trade Center collapse has caused potentially dangerous heart problems in responders on-site, according to new research./Researchers from Mount Sinai School of Medicine conducted the analyses of 1,236 WTC workers./Their study showed that responders have impaired diastolic function of both the right and left ventricle, meaning their hearts do not relax normally, which can put them at risk for heart problems such as shortness of breath and heart failure./More than 50 percent had abnormal relaxation of the left ventricle compared to only seven percent of people of a similar age in the general population. Greater than 60 percent had isolated impaired diastolic function in the right ventricle of the heart, which pumps blood to the lungs./Croft and her colleagues suspect that debris inhaled from the WTC site may have contributed to these heart abnormalities, however, caution that there is no comparison data of people working in a similar urban community plagued by air pollution and life and emotional stresses who were not exposed to the WTC./""We know that inhaled debris may be linked to heart and lung disease. While we still have work to do in determining a definitive connection between heart abnormalities and the World Trade Center collapse, these data are an exciting first step,"" researcher Lori Croft said./The findings are being presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 59th annual scientific session (ACC.10) in Atlanta.

"Smokers aid spread of TB, say experts","umbai, March 24 -- Anti-smoking activists have another reason to demand a smoke-free city./Medical experts claim that the rising number of smokers is abetting the spread of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that claims over three lakh lives in the country each year, as cigarette smoke lowers the body's immunity./Medical practitioners say the fight against the killer disease has become much harder due to rising pollution levels and the large number of smokers in the city./""At least 70 per cent of Mumbai is infected by the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (the causative organism of tuberculosis). It is when their immunity drops that they contract the disease. Smoking and air pollution reduce the immunity of the respiratory system, making it easier for the disease to manifest and spread,"" said Dr Ashok Mahashur, chest physician at Hinduja Hospital./Dr R.S. Birla, a physician at Tata Memorial Hospital, said passive smokers were worse off than smokers./""A passive smoker is 100 times worse hit by the effect of the smoke. This makes them far more vulnerable to infection. So even if a person is a non-smoker, having friends who smoke can increase the risk of their developing tuberculosis,"" he said./Doctors claim that apart from weakening a person's resistance to the disease, smoke and pollutants also lower the body's response to the drugs used to treat the disease, making treatment longer and far more expensive./""We definitely need to have strict governance to bring down pollution in the city. This includes enforcing the ban on smoking and planting more trees for starters,"" said Dr Arun Bamne, deputy executive health officer (TB)./""Good hygiene and awareness are necessary to fight this disease, but we won't get anywhere if we continue to live in an environment in which the organism thrives,"" he added.

Commercial cooking large source of hazardous pollutants in environment,"Washington, March 24 -- Scientists in Minnesota, US, are reporting that commercial cooking is a surprisingly large source of a range of air pollutants that could pose risks to human health and the environment./According to Deborah Gross from Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, commercial food cooking is a known source of air pollutants, including gases and tiny solid particles - as is cooking in the home./""While that mouth-watering smell may whet our appetites, it comes from the emission of smoke from the cooking process into the air that we breathe,"" Gross said./Research conducted in the US during the past decade has shown that cooking is by far the largest source of respirable particles generated in the home, as well./""Exposure to high concentrations of these particles is common,"" said Gross./Gross has been working with colleagues Tom Kuehn, Bernard Olson, and Dabrina Dutcher of the University of Minnesota to define the specific contribution that commercial cooking makes to air pollution./The project, also involving Carleton undergraduate student Lisa Wang, already has resulted in two air quality management districts in California implementing restrictions on commercial cooking emissions./Gross and Wang set out to get the chemical signature of the mouth-watering aroma from the cooking process./They used a novel combination of chemical and physical measurements of the aerosol particles - solid and liquid droplets - emitted from food being cooked./They did the study with typical commercial cooking appliances in a kitchen laboratory at the University of Minnesota during cooking of pizzas in an oven, steaks in a broiler, and hamburgers on a griddle, clamshell broiler, and charcoal fire./They found that the foods that created the most emissions in commercial kitchens were fatty foods cooked with high heat, especially with open flames, such as cooking hamburger patties on a conveyor broiler./Kuehn's previous research has found that for every 1,000 pounds of hamburger cooked on conveyor broilers, 25 pounds of emissions are created./The same weight of pepperoni pizza cooked in an oven created just three pounds of emissions./The use of certain oils also could increase emissions./For 1,000 pounds of chicken cooked in a wok with peanut oil, 45 pounds of emissions were produced./""These experiments help us to assess what needs to be replicated in standardized laboratory tests, and to suggest better methods of emission control,"" Gross said./""In combination with other measurements, we can provide a relatively comprehensive chemical and physical signature of the emissions from various cooking operations,"" he added.

A cure for acidity,"umbai, April 22 -- Have you wondered why fatigue, frequent colds, indigestion, headaches and other illnesses have become so common now? Air pollution, cigarette smoke, alcohol consumption, pollution and faulty diets are to blame. Gone are the days of simple, home-cooked meals, when eating out was a rare indulgence./Today, fast food dominates our diet. Untimely food habits, combining alkaline and acidic foods such as milk and meat, fizzy drinks and junk food weaken the digestive system, causing hyperacidity./Acid based balance/Distilled water has a pH of 7. Anything below this indicates acidity and higher levels indicate alkalinity. Alkaline foods contain higher amount of minerals, like calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Acidic foods contain phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine and iodine. It is said that people with a predominantly alkaline body are less prone to diseases and tend to heal faster.Foods like eggs, meat, chicken, tea, coffee, bread, oily, fried and spicy foods are considered acidic. Fruits, vegetables, almonds, coconuts and leafy vegetables are considered alkaline./Green is the way to go/Alkaline fruits and vegetables should constitute about 80 per cent of our food intake, while acidic foods should make up the remaining 20 per cent.Alkaline vegetables help maintain the pH balance of the body at 7.3. They should become a regular part of your diet and should replace most of the acidic foods. A good rule of thumb to follow is that the greener the vegetable, the more alkaline it is.

Dust pollution worsens in city,"GUWAHATI, May. 11 -- Dust pollution continues to deteriorate in the city, posing a grave health hazard threat to the citizens. The road dust, together with vehicular emissions, forms a toxic haze that hangs over the atmosphere for a prolonged period./Monitoring of the city's ambient air quality by the Pollution Control Board of Assam (PCBA) has revealed that both respirable particulate matter (RPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the air have been found to be high, often crossing the permissible limits./The permissible limits for SPM and RPM are 200 micrograms per metre cubic and 100 micrograms per metre cubic respectively./Degradation of the city hills leading to accumulation of loose soil on the roads following rain, the boom in construction activities and the failure to maintain the norms aimed at checking dust pollution, growing vehicular movement and emission, have combined to worsen the dust pollution in Guwahati./'The trend of dust pollution is certainly worrying as it reveals an increasing trend. We have at present four ambient air quality monitoring stations, with another two scheduled to come up shortly,' a PCBA official said./The official, while attributing the dust pollution to several factors including the city's topography surrounded by hills, said that dust pollution normally showed a rising trend during the winter as there is less rainfall to clean the atmosphere. 'From our ambient air quality checks, the period from November to March shows higher presence of SPM and RPM in the air,' he said./Besides monitoring, the PCBA recommends measures to the offenders for reducing air pollution. 'We ask the Guwahati Refinery to maintain fuel quality and also arrange free pollution check-ups for vehicles. For checking vehicular pollution, however, the administration and the Transport Department should display greater commitment,' the official said./The PCBA recently moved the Central Government to set up a continuous air quality monitoring station. At present it has four ambient air quality monitoring stations at Bamunimaidam, Santipur, Gopinath Nagar and Khanapara while the two new ones are to come up at the Gauhati University campus and at Boragaon./'We had also recommended a 21-point action plan for reducing vehicular pollution in the city,' he said./It may be recalled that the Union Minister for Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh during his recent visit to the city expressed dissatisfaction at the growing dust pollution./Deforestation and earth-cutting in the city hills invariably results in erosion of loose earth from the hills. Rains then wash down the topsoil and deposit it on the roads besides clogging the drains./The MRD Road near Chandmari best illustrates this recurring phenomenon. A single burst of shower is enough to inundate the road and once the waterlogging subsides, it leaves a deep layer of slush which ultimately turns into dust after a day or two and then spread everywhere by vehicular movement./This apart, the haphazard urbanization process that cares little about maintaining even the basic norms of checking dust pollution during construction is another factor aggravating the situation. The public had to endure a harrowing time during the construction of all the flyovers in the city in the past few years with serious dust pollution affecting the construction sites as well as the nearby areas. Dumping of construction materials including sand, stones, cement, in the open without adequate cover is typical of any construction activity in the city. The ongoing boom in real estate in the city has pushed the dust pollution to alarming levels. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Assam Tribune.

Green consumerism in India,"Assam, May 13 -- In these days of information technology, increased media coverage of environmental problems such as acid rain, green house effect, land-degradation, ozone layer depletion, etc, has enlightened the consumers, manufacturers, non-governmental organisations, local environmentalists and government about the threat posed by the human beings to the environment. In response to the rising demand for eco-friendly products and the attention paid by the consumers towards environmental credentials of companies, the companies have started incorporating environmentalism in their policies. Some of the companies have adopted environmental-friendly stance proactively in the wake of their social responsibility, while others have envisaged the opportunities from the growing environmental awareness to explore new markets./Consumerism, a movement to protect consumers against dangerous products, unethical pricing practices and deceptive advertising, has increased in recent years, particularly in respect to certain issues and protection of the environment. The main issues pursued by the consumer movement fall into three categories, viz, environmental protection, product performance and safety, and information disclosure. Major forces driving the movement, in addition to consumers themselves, are consumer organisations and other interest groups, consumer education and consumer laws. 'Green Consumerism' aims at protecting the consumers against environmentally harmful products and practices. It has increased the interest of consumers in environmental impacts of the products they buy. According to David, green consumerism progresses through four stages, beginning with a superficial awareness of green issues (e.g., acid rain) and ending with an acceptance of individual responsibility for the environment and a commitment to buy only green products. Ultimately, the green consumer becomes the green agitator, Joining an environmental group to lobby for change./Thus, the rising consciousness towards the natural environment is a new trait among the consumers that is fast catching up. However, greenness among the consumers is not only difficult to identify, because a consumer may not act green under all circumstances. It is also difficult to measure since all the consumers are not equally green. Therefore, it becomes imperative to identify environmental issues and problems that the consumers are aware of as distinguished from those that are not known to them. Such information can be helpful to the marketers in identifying the target consumers and also deciding as to what environmental features of a product need to be highlighted to satisfy a particular consumer segment./Moreover, marketers as well as non-profit organisations concerned with the promotion of environmental causes can identify environmental issues and problems that need to be propagated among the public. This will enable the governmental and non-governmental agencies promoting environmental ideas to focus their education efforts on those environmental hazards or impacts which the consumers are not aware of, rather than wasting their efforts on issues that are already popular among the consumers. However, not much work has been done in this direction in our country./There has been a lot of hype over environmental issues in our country during the last few years. There have been many agitations to conserve the natural habitats when dams were constructed, like the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Not only this, the American Enron power project at Dabhol had to face agitations against environmental hazards of storing naptha. The Government of India, recognising the severity of these problems, adopted a comprehensive policy to address the environment. India was the first country to insert an amendment in its Constitution allowing the state to intervene and to protect public health, forests and wildlife. Besides, the Central Pollution Control Board that was constituted in 1974, a full-fledged Ministry of Environment and Forests was established in 1985 to implement environmental laws and regulations./Various laws to protect the natural environment, such as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment Protection Act, 1986 have also been legislated. As far as the consumers are concerned, though environmentalism may not have hit the Indian consumers directly, the people are fast adopting an alternative lifestyle by using products like health foods, organic vegetable and fruits, natural textiles, vegetable dyes, herbal cosmetics, handmade stationery, traditional ayurvedic medicines and less polluting fuels./Governmental and non-governmental organisations have been making efforts to educate consumers about environmental issues. For instance, The Bhagidari Programme has been launched by the government of Delhi to create awareness about environmental issues among the citizens of Delhi under which it initiated campaigns like anti-littering and anti-plastic bag campaign, Eco-care programme (Environment and Sanitation Drive), Keep City Clean Drive, Anti Fire Crackers Campaign, Khelo Holi Naturally Campaign, Clean Yamuna Campaign, etc. Besides, ECOMARK scheme was launched by the government of India in 1991 for the labeling of eco-friendly products./In India, rapidly growing population along with increased economic development has placed a strain on the country's infrastructure and the environment. Deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution and land degradation continue to worsen and are hindering economic development in rural India. Rapid industrialization and urbanization in India are also serious concerns. Industrial development has contributed significantly to economic growth in India, however, not without an environmental price. Not only is industrial pollution increasing public health risks, but abatement efforts also consuming a significant portion of India's GDP./One of the major severe environmental concerns in India is air pollution caused mainly by vehicular emissions and untreated industrial smoke. According to the World Health Organisation, New Delhi is one of the top ten most polluted cities in the world./Moreover, much of the nation's water is polluted because of raw sewage and runoff from agricultural pesticides. This is a very extreme problem in India because many of the people bath and get their drinking water from the same rivers they empty their waste into. Soil erosion and desertification are other problems hurting many of the local framers in the country. Many areas once covered by dense forests have turned into deserts due to centuries of overgrazing and agriculture production./Another challenge faced by India is meeting the energy requirements in a sustainable manner. Currently India is ranked sixth in the amount of greenhouse gases that it releases into the atmosphere because of extensive use of coal as a primary source for energy generation. With a rapidly growing population, the demand for electricity generation is on the rise. Alternative sources of energy are being explored in the country. Being endowed with rich water and wind resources, renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric power and wind energy are two of India's primary solutions to meet the needed increase in electricity generation and these are being duly promoted by the government./(The writer teaches in the Department of Commerce, Dibrugarh University).

People living in urban areas tend to have higher BP,"Washington, May 17 -- A new study by researchers from the University of Dusiburg-Essen in Germany has shown that people who live in urban areas where particulate air pollution is high tend to have higher blood pressure than those who live in less polluted areas./The researchers used data from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study of almost 5,000 individuals that focuses on the development of heart disease./They analysed the effects of air pollution exposure on blood pressure between 2000 and 2003./While some earlier studies have shown that acute increases in particulate air pollution, such as day-to-day fluctuations, can raise blood pressure, little was known about medium- and long-term exposure./""Our results show that living in areas with higher levels of particle air pollution is associated with higher blood pressure,"" said Barbara Hoffman, head of the Unit of Environmental and Clinical Epidemiology, University of Duisburg-Essen, and senior author of the study./""Both, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, are higher in people who live in more polluted areas, even if we take important factors that also influence blood pressure like age, gender, smoking, weight, etc. into account. Blood pressure increases were stronger in women than in men,"" Dr. Hoffman added./High blood pressure increases the risk for atherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries, which leads to cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes./""Our results might explain why people who live in more polluted areas are at a higher risk to suffer and die from these diseases,"" Dr. Hoffman said./The results will be presented at the ATS 2010 International Conference in New Orleans.

Particulate air pollution bad for heart health,"Washington, May 20 -- Penn State College of Medicine researchers say that breathing polluted air increases stress on the heart's regulation capacity, up to six hours after inhalation of combustion-related small particles called PM2.5./This high stress may contribute to cardiovascular diseases, said Duanping Liao, professor of public health sciences./The body's ability to properly regulate heartbeat so the heart can pump the appropriate amounts of blood into the circulation system relies on the stability of the heart's electrical activity, called electrophysiology./""Air pollution is associated with cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity, and it is generally accepted that impaired heart electrophysiology is one of the underlying mechanisms,"" said Fan He, master's program graduate, Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine./""This impairment is exhibited through fluctuations in the heart rate from beat to beat over an established period of time, known as heart rate variability. It is also exhibited through a longer period for the electric activity to return to the baseline, known as ventricular repolarization./""The time course, how long it would take from exposure to cardiac response, has not been systematically investigated,"" said He. ""We conducted this study to investigate the relationship between particle matter and heart electrophysiology impairment, especially the time course.""/The team's study amongst 106 people from central Pennsylvania indicated that heart electrophysiology was affected up to six hours after elevated PM2.5 exposure./PM2.5 refers to particles up to 2.5 micrometers in size - released by diesel engine, coal, oil, gas or wood combustion. PM2.5 levels are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency./""Our findings may contribute to further understanding of the pathophysiology of air pollution-related cardiac events, specifically our results indicating elevated PM2.5 exposure is associated with immediate disturbance of cardiac electrical activities within six hours after exposure,"" said Liao./The results were published in recent issues of the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology and in Environmental Health Prospective.

"New link between air pollution, sleep-disordered breathing","Washington, June 15 -- Scientists have established a new link between air pollution and sleep disordered breathing./Antonella Zanobetti, Ph.D., Susan Redline, MD, MPH, Diane Gold, M.D., M.P.H. and colleagues conducted a study amongst 6,000 participants between 1995 and 1998 wherein they studied the link between air pollution levels, temperature increases and sleep-disordered breathing./""Our hypothesis was that elevation in ambient air pollution would be associated with an increased risk of SDB and nocturnal hypoxia, as well as with reduced sleep quality,"" said Zanobetti./To examine the role of seasons, they performed a separate analysis, adding the interaction of season with the level of air pollution in the form of particulate matter under 10 'm, which is commonly associated with traffic./""We found novel evidence for pollution and temperature effects on sleep-disordered breathing,"" said Zanobetti./""Increases in apnea or hypopnea...were associated with increases in short-term temperature over all seasons, and with increases in particle pollution levels in the summer months./""Particles may influence sleep through effects on the central nervous system, as well as the upper airways. Poor sleep [associated with poor health outcomes] may disproportionately afflict poor urban populations. Our findings suggest that one mechanism for poor sleep and sleep health disparities may relate to environmental pollution levels.""/Over all seasons, the researchers found that short-term elevations in temperature were associated with increased in Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), which was used to gauge the severity of SDB./John Heffner, M.D., past president of the American Thoracic Society observed, ""This study gains even greater importance as scientists increasingly demonstrate the critical importance of sleep to health and well being. SDB increases risks for cardiovascular disease, strokes and other major health conditions. Air pollution is an independent contributor to most of these disorders and may produce its negative health effects by promoting SDB as an intermediary step in the pathway toward disease.""/The study appears online ahead of the print edition of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine on the American Thoracic Society's Web site.
