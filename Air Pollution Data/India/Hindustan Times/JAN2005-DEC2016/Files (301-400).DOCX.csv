New Delhi vs Beijing: Whose air is worse?,"New Delhi, Feb. 1 -- A scientific and political battle has broken over reports that Delhi's air quality is worse than the global poster-child for pollution, Beijing. A Yale study reported by Hindustan Times concludes that it does, while local officials insist that it does not, citing their own data from monitoring stations on the ground./Which claim is true? And how can citizens and policy makers best navigate the crucial question of just how bad the air of the capital is? Much of it boils down to the quality of the available data and its interpretation./The Yale University study has used satellite-driven data to show peak levels for particulate matter regularly exceeding dangerous levels. Indian government officials, however, have been anxious to stress that according to their data, average levels are lower./Angel Hsu, lead author of Yale's Environment Performance Index 2014, said they used satellite data in absence of reliable ground station data, especially from Delhi. ""New Delhi's air quality reporting is not as consistent or transparent, making direct comparison on basis of on ground stations impossible,"" she said and added that Delhi has a hand in how it makes air quality information available to its citizens./Gufran Beig of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) contested the claim saying satellite data for India cannot be relied upon./""The satellite-based sensors cannot record particulate matter (PM) content during cloudy days. So, there will be no particulate matter data for three months of the monsoon. The PM pollution level during monsoon is lowest in the year because of the wash down effect of rains. From this we can say that Yale University reached its comparative conclusion on basis of data of nine worst pollution months for cities like Delhi,"" he added./Yale University officials were, however, not available for their reaction to this claim about limitations of the satellite data from Canada-based Dalhousie University. They had earlier expressed eagerness to study India's on-ground pollution data./Both Delhi and Beijing have on-ground particulate matter monitoring stations, except they disclose it in different formats. While Beijing reports PM 2.5 microns pollution on hourly basis, Delhi provides it either on minute-to-minute or daily basis./HT did a comparison of PM 2.5 pollution data of two national capitals provided by Beijing for the past two months and found that on some days Delhi had higher pollution levels and some other days Beijing's air quality was worse. On many days the two cities had similar level of average PM 2.5 pollution level. The Central Pollution Control Board on Friday, however, said that the comparison of pollution level between two cities may not reflect the correct picture./Although this may have triggered a debate on which city is more polluted but has also brought to fore the point that air quality in national capitals of two of the world's biggest economies are very bad. ""It is an issue of debate for us scientists. But, we cannot deny the fact that air quality in the two cities is bad and it needs to be improved,"" said Beig, whose institute runs pollution monitoring stations in the National Capital./While this debate would continue in the scientific corridors, health experts are unanimous that high pollution levels, irrespective of which city earns the dirty air tag, adversely impact's one health./""Prolonged exposure to polluted air, irrespective of the level, leads to inflammation of the airway, chest congestion, persistent cough, sore throat, burning sensation in the eye and cardiac diseases,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head, department of pulmonology and sleep medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)./Unlike Delhi, Beijing has woken up to the emerging health hazard and its steps have resulted in reduction in particulate matter pollution. On the other hand, Delhi's particulate pollution has risen by 20-15% since 2010 mostly because of increase in vehicles and expansion of the power general capacity of thermal power plants. ""We have failed to take corrective steps to check rising in air pollution,"" Anumita Roy Chaudhary of Centre for Science and Environment said./Two things are certain. Delhi's air quality is among the worst in the world, and the capital is urgently in the need of robust policy and enforcement solutions to clean the air./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Smoking stack and lady,"Chandigarh, Feb. 3 -- US regulations governing air and water pollution control are very stringent, perhaps more so for foreign ships, especially those flying the flags of developing countries, including ours. There is sort of impression among the shipping fraternity that the US pollution control authorities are not very impartial and look the other way even when any of their own ship's stack is belching black smoke./Once, after shifting my ship from Richmond to the nearby Oakland port in San Francisco Bay, I had gone to relax in my bedroom on board, when I heard a knock on my cabin door. The duty quartermaster had come to inform me that a 'Mem Sahib' had come on board and would like to see the chief engineer. After instructing the QM to escort the lady to my office, I hurriedly changed back to my uniform, all the time wondering about the visitor waiting in the adjoining office room. Walking into my office, I met a strikingly beautiful woman with a half-smoked cigarette daintily but expertly held in her hand. She introduced herself as a pollution control inspector and informed me that due to my ship's generator smoke visibly coming out from the ship stack, she has to cite our ship for violation of air pollution regulations./I knew from my experience with the US pollution control officials that any explanation regarding the quantum or cause of generator smoke would be useless. I vividly remembered an incident on my last ship in another US port. A deck crew member while painting the ship side, slipped and fell into the dock waters along with his painting brush. He was rescued by the other crew members but the paint brush could not be retrieved. The US pollution control people promptly were on board, and instead of enquiring about the rescued member, they were more worried about the 'oily sheen' on the dirty dock water near the ship, caused by the paint on brush, and they imposed a hefty penalty on the ship for violating the water pollution regulations. They did not bother to listen to our defending reasons. Their real aim was to penalise the ship so that they could impress their department bosses and get good remarks./So I readily said to her that I do agree to be the offender, but in a small way, so are you, ignoring the 'No Smoking' sign outside my office, and just to humour her and lighten the situation, I further added rather flippantly that 'Madam, if a beautiful and young lady can smoke, our generator is but poor 'old machinery'. To my great relief and surprise, she took the matter sportingly and promised to withdraw the dreaded citation, overlooking the unintentional violations of regulations, provided the offending generator was attended to as soon as possible. I sent the instructions to duty engineer and a standby generator was put in operation, no smoke visibly coming out of the ship was readily noted and recorded by the madam which brought a satisfied smile on her lovely face./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Chandigarh.

Your house is a major source of pollution,"New Delhi, Feb. 4 -- Contrary to public perception, air pollution is not just limited to outdoors. It remains even when you step inside. People living in poorly-ventilated homes face the added risk from indoor air pollutants - smoking, cooking fumes, suspended particulate matter, mould, dust-mites and animal dander./""Indoor air-pollution is almost as bad as outdoor air pollution and it affects as much a person who already suffers from respiratory illness as it affects a healthy person,"" said Dr Vikas Maurya, consultant, department of respiratory medicine, allergy and sleep disorder, BLK Superspecialty Hospital./Smoking at home is the biggest health hazard, especially in poorly-ventilated apartments. ""Passive intake of smoke is equally harmful and the bi-products linger on curtains and other articles in the house for very long. One should keep windows open while cooking and taking a shower to maintain healthy air circulation. One needs to be especially careful with pets as they shed hair and leave various micro-organisms in the air,"" he added./Those whose houses are located on the main road with heavy traffic movement can throw windows open very early in the morning for about an hour to let fresh air in, experts advise./Taking precaution is the only way out to stop developing serious respiratory or cardiac diseases./""There is a direct increase in incidence of heart disease and respiratory illness with increased exposure to pollutants in the air. There is a rapid decline in lung function and lung capacity among people who have had prolonged exposure to polluted air. It is a cause for serious concern as it could eventually turn fatal,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine, AIIMS./""As far as possible take preventive measures and don't delay seeing a doctor if symptoms like difficulty in breathing, wheezing and persistent cough appear,"" he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Despite heat and humidity, pollution stayed high in Jan","umbai, Feb. 5 -- Despite the unusually high temperatures and humidity levels recorded in January, ambient air pollution in the city remained well above the standard limits and the skies were consistently enveloped in haze and smoke./Date from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's (MPCB) ambient air quality monitoring stations at Sion and Bandra indicates that the handful of cold days during January, which is usually pleasant, have not reduced the concentration of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the city's air./At Sion, a maximum NOx level of 180 micrograms/metre cube (ug/m3) was recorded on January 29 (the standard limit is 80 ug/ m3), while a maximum RSPM level of 370 ug/m3 was recorded on January 30 (compared with a standard limit of 100 ug/m3). The average NOx level at Sion was 146.08 ug/m3 and the average RSPM level was 206.76 ug/m3, both well above normal/At Bandra, the highest NOx level recorded last month shot up to 267 ug/m3 on January 18, the coldest day of the season. The highest RSPM level (187 ug/m3) was recorded on January 7./The erratic weather, coupled with pollution, also took a toll on the health of residents, doctors said, and led to respiratory illnesses./Environmental experts said that more than temperature and humidity, wind patterns determine pollution levels. ""When the temperature and humidity is low, the pollutants tend to get concentrated in the atmosphere and they hold up close to the surface. But if there is considerable breeze, the pollutants are dispersed faster,"" said Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)./""This month, even on days when the sky was clear and sunny, we could observe hazy conditions. This could be attributed to the dust from numerous construction sites in the city,"" said Kumar./Officials f rom the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the month witnessed varying weather conditions within a short span./""The wind pattern has mainly been easterly and southeasterly bringing on hot winds from land towards the sea,"" KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, IMD, western region. ""We are seeing a local greenhouse effect as cloudy conditions followed by high temperatures have trapped solar radiation and pollutants.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Mumbai.

Agri ministry to frame rules to check smog,"New Delhi, Feb. 12 -- The Union ministry of agriculture will prepare ""composite and complete guidelines"" to prevent and control smog in Delhi, which results from burning of agricultural remnants in open fields of adjoining states during winters./The National Green Tribunal asked the ministry to do so in consultation with states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, besides Delhi-based National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Central Pollution Control board./The NGT has asked the ministry to submit, by March 21, modalities and also a time-frame for implementation of the guidelines. The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by environment enthusiast Vikrant Tongad. It claims burning of agricultural residue in these states pollutes the environment and causes smog in Delhi./Smoke particles billowing from burning of paddy stubble in farms between late October and early November move to Delhi and remain in the air because of low wind speed, typical of winters, resulting in reduced visibility. The situation gets aggravated when the haze gets mixed with Delhi's massive vehicular pollution and becomes heavier and deadlier./This November, a grey-brown cloud of toxic smog hid the sun and the sky from view for several days, causing breathing problems and other ailments. In 2013, Delhi saw a 12-day smog spell (October 26 to November 8), leading to increased respiratory and asthmatic complications, particularly among the elderly and children./A senior of ficial associated with the Supreme Courtappointed pollution control committee said, ""Burning of paddy stubble has been declared an offence in Haryana and Punjab. ""There are two power plants functional in Haryana where paddy stubble is being fed as fuel. Punjab will also follow suit.""/""The idea is to make fertiliser out of stubble. Burning of paddy stubble is not prevalent in western Uttar Pradesh but necessary instructions have been issued to state authorities,"" he said./The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Centre and governments of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, acknowledging air pollution is a serious concern with severe public health consequences./The court has said Delhi has not been able to sustain its air quality gains and air pollution levels are rising again./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

India needs stringent norms to curb vehicular pollution: study,"umbai, Feb. 22 -- If India wants to keep health hazards at bay, it will have to implement stringent emission control guidelines on a par with those in the United States and European Union countries in view of the estimated five-fold increase in vehicles between 2011 and 2030, says a study./By the end of 2015, around 50 Indian cities are expected to adopt the Bharat IV guidelines ensuring stricter pollution control measures and use of cleaner fuel in vehicles. At present, only 17 cities, including the major metros, follow the Bharat IV norms. Other cities follow the Bharat III guidelines./But the study conducted by US-based Desert Research Institute (DRI) and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi says the country needs the enforcement of Bharat V standards, the equivalents of which are already in force in the United States and European Union countries./The number of vehicles is estimated to rise from 90 million in 2011 to 450 million in 2030 in India. Increase in annual emission of fine particles or particulate matter (known as PM2.5) is likely to go up from 2,53,000 to 3,50,000 million tonnes in the same period, adds the study, which was published in energy policy journal of Elsevier earlier this month./Exposure to particulate matter for a long time can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer and heart attacks./The Global Burden of Disease study for 2010 published last year had listed outdoor air pollution among the top 10 health risks in India, with an estimated 6,95,000 premature deaths taking place in the country annually because of PM2.5 and ozone pollution./Another study released by International Council on Clean Transportation in November last year had said particulate emission from vehicles was responsible for 40,000 premature deaths annually in Indian cities./In 2011, the World Health Organisation had named 27 Indian cities among the most-polluted cities in the world./The only way to arrest the rising pollution level, according to the DRI-IIT study, is nationwide implementation of Bharat V standards by 2015./The move, if implemented, would stabilise PM2.5 at the 2011 levels despite the five-fold rise in vehicular density./The government is scheduled to implement Bharat V guidelines in 2025./Clearing the air/Bharat norms pertain to fuel quality and engine emission standards in India. It mandates, for instance, use of cleaner fuel with low sulphur content and improved technology for combustion engines to reduce emission. The introduction of Bharat norms led to the phasing out of the polluting two-stroke engines./Emission norms were introduced in India in 1991 for petrol cars, followed by diesel cars in 1992. India introduced emission standards (Bharat norms) equivalent to European norms in 2000 starting with Bharat Stage II. BS 1 was the earlier Indian standard./Bharat IV fuel (50 parts per million, or ppm, sulphur) is supplied to some 30 cities at present. Bharat III fuel (150 ppm sulphur petrol, 350 ppm sulphur diesel) is used in the remaining parts of India./Moving to Bharat V would mean moving to 10 ppm sulphur fuel. Converting to higher versions of Bharat stage entails investment in better fuel refining process and more efficient motor engines. It is estimated that converting to Bharat Stage III and IV has cost Rs. 32,000 crore in refinery upgradation over the past few years./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Don't let the weather spring a surprise on you,"Kolkata, March 5 -- As winter makes its exit, spring bursts onto the scene with its warmth, colour and signs of new life. However, for a lot of people, spring comes with its own share of problems. With the rise in temperature, incidents of spring dermatitis also increase. Moreover, throat pain, fever, cough and cold are also very common during this time of the year./People, too, are less likely to protect themselves against the virus during mild weather. The vagaries of weather are combined with a rise in air pollution during the season. Toxins affect people with chronic lung ailments./""Take nasal drops for congested nose. Lozenges give relief from sore throat. Consult a doctor if the problem persists,"" Dr Kishore Gandhi, a paediatrician, said./A number of medicine experts say difficulty in breathing occurs when a person comes in contact with allergens. Since the pollen floats in the air, they are often the culprits for asthma attacks. Other diseases that are also causes for concern are chickenpox, measles and mumps./""People suffer from common cold and flu during this time. The aerosol virus spreads infections in the air,"" said general medicine expert Subir Banerjee./""One should not over indulge oneself while drinking during parties. Try to compensate by exercising and detoxifying to help maintain high immunity levels all through season,"" said Gandhi./""Patients could also experience swollen nose and cheeks, rashes and outbreak of acne or pimple. The main cause of having spring ailments is the presence of a lot of allergens in the air,"" added Banerjee./According to dieticians, one should balance his work and rest. Eat more vegetables and fruits and avoid cold and spicy food. Drink boiled water./A number of skin problems occur during this time. People have dry skin, chapped lips and acute dandruff problem. In order to keep skin healthy, one should consume a lot of liquid, especially, boiled water, fruit juice and lots of fresh fruits./""In such weather conditions, the worse affected are children. They suffer from viral infections, gastro intestinal infections and bronchiolitis,"" said Gandhi. Special care should be taken to supply children with sufficient ORS dosage.

Modi as India's PM is a cause for worry for environmentalists,"New Delhi, March 30 -- Narendra Modi as India's prime minister will be a development disaster.

Fever: second most common disease for medical insurance claim,"umbai, April 21 -- Fever has become the second most common disease, after child-birth related admissions, for which people claimed medical insurance in India. The number of Indians getting admitted to hospitals with complains of fever increased by 89% in 2013 compared to 2012, says an in-house study of insurance policies by an insurance company./Overall the number of insurance claimants has increased, especially in the working age group, with claims related to fever, gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infections nearly doubling compared to 2012./""Top claims are no more restricted to critical ailments only with diseases like fever finding a place amongst the top 10 diseases claimed for,"" said Sanjay Dutta from ICICI Lombard which conducted the survey./Across the top ten diseases for which people claimed insurance, fever and other common infections showed the maximum jump between 2012 and 2013 which insurance experts blame to extreme weather fluctuations. ""Delhi and Mumbai witnessed unseasonal rains while Rajasthan recorded extreme cold weather last year. We have observed that any major weather change results in increased hospitalisation for fever-like illnesses,"" said an insurance expert from a private company./Insurance experts said that attribute the sharp rise to air pollution, environmental changes, dietary influence and lack of right nutrition. Though maximum health insurance related claims were filed from Mumbai, Delhi witnessed a 37% increase in hospitalisations in 2013 followed by Bangalore which reported 33% rise in insurance claims during the same period./However Dr Raman Sardanah, head infection prevention and control, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi attributed increased awareness among patients for the rise in hospitalisations. ""Owing to the multi-layered healthcare system, till the patient reaches a tertiary hospital he is resistant to primary antibiotics and has to be admitted as the clinical picture is distorted requiring more investigations,"" said Dr Sardanah./Industry experts believe that the situation may not continue to remain the same with preventive activities. ""As the awareness in a badly affected year increases, many preventive/activities come into force which reduces claims in the next year,"" said Antony Jacob, CEO, Apollo Munich Health Insurance./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

CSE asks govt to cut down on toxic fumes,"New Delhi, May 9 -- A day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) ranked Delhi as the most polluted city in the world, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Thursday asked the government to set up a road map to cut down on toxic fumes emanating from the increasing number of vehicles every day./""This database confirms our worst fears about how hazardous air pollution is in our region. Last year, the Global Burden of Disease study pinned outdoor air pollution as the fifth largest killer in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking, and poor nutrition. About 620,000 early deaths occurred in India from air pollution-related diseases in 2010,"" said Sunita Narain, director general of CSE./""Around 18 million years of healthy lives are lost due to illness burden that enhances the economic cost of pollution. Half of these deaths have been caused by ischemic heart disease triggered by exposure to air pollution and the rest due to stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory tract infection and lung cancer,"" she added./The latest urban air quality database released by the WHO reconfirms that most Indian cities are becoming death traps because of very high air pollution levels./India appeared among the group of countries with highest particulate matter (PM) levels./Of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, 13 are in India, said the database and Delhi is among the most polluted cities in the world./Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air programme, said: ""Indian cities are witnessing a rapid increase in air pollution and untamed motorisation. Cities need to curb pollution from all sources, but vehicles need special attention as they emit toxic fumes within our breathing zone.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mumbai's air may be killing you,"umbai, May 10 -- High pollution levels in Mumbai may come as no surprise to anyone. But consider this. Data collected by the recent the World Health Organization ( WHO) shows that our city has the most polluted air compared to other metros -- Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad - barring Delhi./According to the WHO report, New Delhi has the most polluted air in the world, leaving behind even Beijing, which is notorious for its smog./Land-locked cities such as Gwalior, Patna and Ranchi also figure in the list of the most polluted cities of the world./WHO studied pollution data in nearly 1,600 cities in 91 countries between 2008 and 2012 and found that the annual mean of PM10 - particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometres in diameter - in Mumbai is 136 microgram/ metre cube (ug/m3)./The annual mean of PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter), which are emitted by motor vehicles, combustion, power plants, forest fires, etc, is 45 ug/m3./According to the WHO guidelines, annual mean of PM10 should be 20ug/m3 while that of PM2.5 should be 10 ug/m3./Air pollution exposure killed almost seven million people in 2012, making it the gravest environmental health risk, the WHO claimed on its website./Most of these deaths were related t o hear t diseases, strokes and lung cancer. The lack of a dynamic air quality monitoring system in the city that keeps the citizens informed about pollution is an indicator of the government's stance of tackling air pollution./The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has only two active ambient air quality monitoring stations at Sion and Bandra, while the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute has one at their Worli office./Environmental scientists though are sceptical about WHO's approach on pollution levels in south-east Asia. ""Our climate is different from Europe and North American, as it is tropical, dry and the background particulate matter is quite high. The WHO's current guidelines are not in sync with our climate and need to be changed,"" said Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, NEERI./Kumar added, ""The city's air is definitely highly polluted and vehicular pollution is the main cause. We are trying to work with the MPCB on local area pollution mitigation.""/According to Dr Pratit Samdani, a physician with Jaslok hospital, poor waste disposal and continuous construction activities are also chief causes of pollution. ""Bad disposal of daily waste, metals and batteries leads to many infections, while sand, gravel and cement are allergens triggering asthma attacks. People may soon have to start wearing masks to mitigate ingestion of dust,"" said Samdani./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Mumbai.

Why is there no reaction to WHO's take on Delhi's air pollution?,"India, May 14 -- Why is there no reaction to the World Health Organization's May first-week announcement about Delhi's skies being the most polluted in the world? This collective indifference of a great mass of people to the certainty of their doom has few parallels in world history. It is as if Delhiites have become inured to criticism. After all, what label can be worse than 'rape capital' or 'fountainhead of corruption'?/I think that this culture of apathy to global condemnation as a wholesale environment degrader has much to do with typical Delhiite self-delusion. The last two decades have acted as an opiate, reducing Delhiites to a lot of walking, talking and unthinking victims of marketing strategies. The articulate section of Delhiites like their city to be defined by its symbols of macro prosperity: The shopping malls, car population and fashion shows. In their reaction to rape, corruption and environment degradation, Delhiites tend to disown their own responsibility behind the rise of the phenomena. For the first two, they have the comfort of blaming the government. And the environment? That's for the jholawallahs./The India Against Corruption (IAC) campaign and the movement against the Delhi gang rape showed to the world that Delhi has a heart that ticks. But we are unlikely to see a similar upsurge against rampant abuse of the environment which is by far more intimate with the popular Delhi culture than rape and corruption. Why? Because unlike with IAC and the Delhi gang rape, Delhiites will not have the political system to publicly whip - they would need to turn the searchlight on themselves./This is not the first time that Delhi has been declared the world's most polluted city. We had that dubious distinction up to the mid-1990s. But the regime then in power decided to do something about it. As part of a long-term measure it decided first to focus on the three biggest sources of air pollution - DTC buses, two-stroke engine auto-rickshaws and diesel taxis. Thanks to the advocacy of NGOs, the reluctance of the subsequent regime to implement that policy was smashed by the Supreme Court. Resultantly, by 2005, Delhi's skies became much cleaner and the new generation could look forward to a future without premature visitations by respiratory and heart diseases, cancers, infertility and other consequences of particulate matter bombarding their lungs./The rest was up to the people, but the people failed Delhi. There was no protest to the emasculation of Delhi's once proud public transportation by a government that surrendered to the car lobby. In many progressive nations, common citizens take up the cudgels against the government for policies that fail to address environmental concerns. In the Scandinavian countries, most of Western Europe, Singapore and even next-door Bangladesh, we have instances of vibrant movements demanding an end to mindless consumption.

I don't think that is entirely true of Delhi. Environment education was factored into the curriculum of schools in the early 1990s and it is unreasonable to expect a population so aware of fashion trends to be abysmally ignorant of some the most basic ecological truisms. I think there is a general consensus not to admit to the presence of the elephant in the room - greed./Greed is at the root of civilisational decay. There must come a time when Delhiites will realise that they are foolishly condemning their own children to destruction by emulating unsustainable models of development. Governments rarely take pro-active steps to change consumption patterns. Every piece of statistics flying out of government departments foretells a gloomy picture. The Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of India, recorded between 2006 and 2009 an increase from 11.4% to 20.4% in certified deaths in Delhi due to diseases that affect the cardiovascular system, and a hike from 3.8% to 4.6% in certified deaths due to diseases that affect the respiratory system, both of which have direct linkages to air pollution. Numerous other studies have established the linkage between air pollution and cancer, even infertility./Then why is the government not acting? The rules of party politics demand that the Opposition blame everything on the government. As a medical practitioner who is into politics, I think I understand the delivery deficit. Politicians are aware that Delhi is gasping for breath under the car deluge. The craze for new houses is congesting the air with particulate matter. But they shy away from saying so. So do the people. But this compact of silence is left undisturbed./It's not that politicians don't want to take steps, but legislating against air pollution is not a simple matter. We have learnt from global experience that progressive laws on the environment need to be backed by consensus for sacrifice and self-discipline. The ban on mink coats and ivory was declared only after rich people in the West declared that they will no longer tolerate cruelty to wildlife.

Burning of wheat stubble continues unabated in Faridkot despite ban,"Faridkot, May 21 -- Most of the far mers in the district are daily burning the wheat stubble in violation of the ban imposed by the district administration because no action is taken by the authorities concerned against the violators of the ban./The alternative to burning the stubble is to plough it by disks in the field after making its wheat straw by straw reapers, but still due to the traditional mindset and a small gain, the burning of the stubble is the easiest way the farmers find./""The burning of wheat stubble is leading to the pollution of environment. It generates a lot of smoke that emits poisonous gases into the environment leading to breathing diseases among the people. It has many kinds of long-time consequences also such as global warming. The war ming of the environment leads to melting of ice, that raises the sea level,"" said Dr Amarit Paul Singh Brar, de puty di re c t or ( i n- charg e ) Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Faridkot./""Farmers think only about a short-term gain as they do not want to burn a little more fuel considering it to be very expensive for the long-term benefits. If wheat stubble is ploughed into the fields, it could add to organic matter and improve the quality of the soil while burning damages the quality.

"'Stop burning wheat, paddy straw, use them to grow mushrooms'","LUDHIANA, May 29 -- Punjab known for its sprawling agricultural fields is equally famous for burning of paddy and wheat straw by far mers after the harvesting season. The smoke released from bur ning of paddy straw is extremely bad for our health. Providing a solution to this problem, Harpreet Singh Sodhi, senior mycologist, department of microbiology, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), says far mers should use the wheat and paddy straw for mushroom cultivation post the harvest rather than burning it./Harpreet Singh Sodhi, senior mycologist, department of microbiology, PAU, showing the mushrooms produced by utilising straw at the university in Ludhiana on Wednesday./""Each year PAU spreads the same message, but farmers rarely pay heed to these suggestions. Post the harvest, they can collect the leftover straw and make small bundles that can be used for cultivation of mushrooms which is in high demand these days,"" stresses 53-year-old Sodhi, who has been researching on mushroom varieties from the last 30 years. ""Burning of the straw causes severe harm to soil fertility and create lots of air pollution, inviting health problems,"" he adds, lamenting that farmers should not ignore the fact that mushrooms are in great demand and are nutritiously better than many vegetables./Sodhi says the university had recommended five mushroom varieties for farmers in Punjab. Out of them, three are winter varieties- Agaricus Bisporus, Pleurotus and Lentinula Edodes- while two are summer varieties-Calocybe Indica' and Volvariella. While showcasing the samples of mushroom cultivation on paddy and wheat straw in his laboratory, he admitted that not many far mers were aware that about the method which was very efficient and easy to follow. ""It requires putting seeds on the straw bundles and rest is a natural process,"" he said. In case of Calocybe Indica, 1kg of dry straw, paddy or wheat, gives 500 to 700 grams of mushrooms in 30 days while about 22 bundles of paddy can give around 3 to 4kg of mushrooms in 14 days in case of volvariella./Parampal Kaur Sahota, head, microbiology department, PAU, she says, ""We kee p on encouraging farmers to diversify far ming through various proProduction of mushroom at PAU started in 1972 and as per the data from PAU, currently there are only 400 mushroom farmers and per annum, the production amounts to 42,000 tons out of 1.2 lakh ton of the country's total production. grammes./As mushrooms have high market value, farmers must engage themselves in mushroom cultivation through the recommended method.""Sodhi is also doing research on increasing the shelf life of varieties of mushrooms.

"Govt may link car pollution with insurance, reduce fitness test cap","New Delhi, July 30 -- The Delhi government has planned to reduce the cut-off age of cars to undergo fitness tests by five years - from 15 to 10 years. It has also decided to link pollution compliance to insurance benefits as well as fuel purchase to help check rising pollution levels and ensure more road safety in the city./There are nearly 25 lakh four-wheelers in Delhi and an estimated 1.6 lakh new fourwheelers are added every year to its roads./The four-wheeler boom in the Capital has contributed to the air pollution in a major way. Exhaust from vehicles account for more than 70 per cent of Delhi's air pollution./""We have asked the transport department to explore the possibility of linking PUC (pollution under check) certificates with insurance schemes of cars to ensure more people take emission tests. We're also planning to reduce the mandatory fitness age of private vehicles from 15 to 10 years, hence bringing more cars under the overall scrutiny,"" said a senior government official./A high-powered committee on environment formed by Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung, which came up with these recommendations, has also asked the civil supplies department to allow only those vehicles to tank up that have valid PUC certificates./Jung had formed the highpowered committee in May after a World Health Organisation report called Delhi the world's most polluted city./""To implement some of these changes, we need to amend the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989. We will be approaching the Union ministry of road, transport and highways and also the insurance regulatory and development authority,"" the official, who is part of the panel, told HT./The panel, though, has remained tight - lipped o n whether the periodicity of fitness tests would be changed from the current one-time to annual - as proposed by the transport department recently. Suggestion for outsourcing fitness tests to private workshops has been mooted./The panel suggests emission checks be made censor-based to minimise human interference. ""We plan to integrate pollution and vehicle registration data to be able to catch violators. PUC norms will be made more stringent for old vehicles,"" the official said.

Fight disease naturally,"India, Sept. 19 -- We've all read about antioxidants, but do you really know much about them? Here's a primer./What are antioxidants?/Compounds that protect DNA from mutation and break down, preventing arthritis, nerve disorder, heart disease and cancers. They fight pesticides, chemicals, artificial compounds in foods, chemicals in water, radiation, tobacco and air pollution./Are all antioxidants the same? No. Hundreds, possibly thousands of substances can act as antioxidants. Well-known ones include vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene and other carotenoids, selenium, zinc and manganese. Lesser known ones include glutathione, coenzyme Q10, lipoic acid, flavonoids, phenols, polyphenols and phytoestrogens./They can be found in fruits, vegetables, grains and herbs.

"Despite ban, farmers continue burning wheat, paddy straw","Gurdaspur, Oct. 12 -- Punjab, known for its sprawling agricultural fields, is equally famous for burning of paddy and wheat straw by farmers after the harvesting season. The smoke released from burning of paddy straw is extremely bad for health./""Each year, the agriculture department spreads the same message highlighting the ill-effects of straw burning in the fields, but farmers rarely pay heed to it. Burning of straw causes severe harm to soil fertility and creates massive air pollution, inviting health problems,"" said Dr Lakhwinder Singh Hundal, chief agriculture officer, Gurdaspur./It is estimated that about 40 million tonnes of cereal crop waste -- 23 million tonnes from paddy and the remaining from wheat -- is generated in Punjab every year./While most of the wheat straw is used as dry fodder for cattle, only a small part of paddy straw is utilised in generating power at biomass thermal plants. The remaining is set on fire in the fields. Owing to high silica content, paddy straw cannot be directly fed to animals, he adds./The department is also creating awareness among farmers on how to manage paddy straw without burning it./It has been officially stated that the burning of paddy straw residue causes soil nutrient loss -- 3.85 million tonne of organic carbon; 59,000 tonne nitrogen, 20,000 tonne phosphorus and 34,000 tonne of potassium -- besides severely affecting the quality of ambient air./A government report reads: ""The nutrient content of the soil is adversely affected. Straw carbon, nitrogen and sulphur are completely burnt and lost to the atmosphere in the process of burning."" These nutrients then have to be replenished through organic or inorganic fertilisers, which come at a cost./A study conducted by the National Remote Sensing Agency indicated that paddy burning in Punjab contributed 261 giga gm (1 gg=1,000 tonne) of carbon mono dioxide, 19.8 gg of nitrogen oxide, and other gases to the atmosphere./Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, has estimated that total crop residue (paddy and wheat) contained 6 million tonnes of carbon, which on burning could produce 22 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Open burning of residue in the fields kills micro flora and fauna beneficial to soil and removes a large portion of the organic material, thereby depleting the organic matter in the fields./On the other hand, the suspended particulate matter in the air coming from the smoke aggravated chronic heart diseases and lung ailments, besides causing respiratory problems such as asthma./Highlighting the measures suggested by the agriculture department to address the issue, Dr Amrik Singh, agriculture development officer, said that farmers should incorporate paddy straw in the soil with the help of mould bold plough or rotavator or disc harrows which improve the soil health./He also said that direct sowing of wheat without removing the paddy straw from the fields by using a specially designed ""happy seeder"" and using straw to generate power is also a best option for management of paddy straw./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Indore: Take precautions, don't let Diwali turn into a calamity","Indore, Oct. 21 -- It is that time of the year again when bursting firecrackers is a ritual enjoyed by most as much as munching on sweets and enjoying the light of candles and lamps. But these crackers can sometimes turn into sources of distress if no precaution is taken. A little caution can help stop celebrations turning into a disaster./Also as you stock up on those fire crackers and fireworks to ensure that Diwali is a dazzled affair, do keep in mind the health hazards associated with it. While noise pollution and air pollution are the natural outcomes of the festival, according to experts some serious allergies can be caused due to the high levels of pollution as well./People with respiratory problems and those sensitive to allergies are at utmost risk. ""Due to the high level presence of Nitrogen Oxide and Sulphur Oxide in the air, cases of Asthma, cough, irritation in the throat surface in a huge number,"" says Dr Sanjay Dixit, vice dean MGM Medical College./People with asthma bear the brunt due to excessive exposure to smoke during this season. The crackers that contain chemicals such as sulphur, aluminium, carbon, etc, release harmful particles that can stay in the atmosphere for a longer period of time, leading to longer exposure to the chemicals./For asthma patients, who already have hyperactive airways, these pollutants are further damaging and can trigger asthma attacks especially among the elderly and children./Doctors say prevention is the only way to avoid asthma attacks as Diwali is celebrated at a time when there is already change in season, exposing people to multiple infections and allergens./A study conducted by the department of community medicine, MGM Medical College targeted on finding the levels of pollution at the four major crossings of the city - Bhawarkuan, Navlakha, Palasia, Geeta Bhawan Square - also revealed a similar trend./People residing in these areas were found to be suffering from respiratory ailments and hearing problems more than the ones living in other areas. ""The test was conducted by using the Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR). A number of people featured below the healthy rate in the PEFR chart. Around 20% of people belonged to this category,"" said Dr Dixit./While these tests were conducted on a normal day, it should be noted that during Diwali the statistics are even more alarming. ""Firecrackers increase the pollution level to a large extent. These figures become even more disturbing, what is 20% on regular days rises up to 30-40%.""/However, as air pollution is a major irritant leading to problem in breathing, noise pollution is also a major problem. Senior citizens and newborn are most vulnerable to this./The high decibel of noise cannot only cause them difficulty in taking proper rest but also damage their hearing ability if they have a proximity to the crackers. ""Infants and senior citizens should stay indoors. They should also use ear mufflers or cotton cloth to minimize the level of noise,"" added Dr Dixit./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Wind, rain may clear Diwali pollution","New Delhi, Oct. 25 -- Increased wind speed and possible showers over the next couple of days may help the city rid of higher levels of air pollution caused by bursting of firecrackers on Diwali, say experts./Local weather conditions and lesser use of firecrackers this year brought down air pollution levels. But the concentration of the particulate matter (microscopic particles that remain suspended in the air and cause multiple diseases) was still multiple times higher than the prescribed limit./Concentration of pollutants in the air had started around mid-October itself, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said. Diwali on Thursday only made things worse. But the increased wind speed and a possible light shower over next couple of days is likely to disperse pollutants making the air cleaner and safer to breathe. The meteorological department has forecast very light rain in some areas and mist in the morning./The noise pollution levels, according to the data released by the CPCB, showed an upward trend in various areas, including in Dwarka, Bawana and Dilshad Garden that recorded noise levels of up to 66 dB (A). Last Diwali, the maximum noise level in these areas was 62 dB (A)./The level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which causes smog, varied from 39 Aug/m3 to 194 Aug/ m3. Last year, the highest level was recorded at 110 micro gram per cubic metre (mg/m3). The concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2), a toxic gas with pungent smell, was lower than last year./""SO2 levels are quite low in the Capital otherwise. It's normal concentration in Delhi's air is eight or nine micro gram per cubic metre. Its maximum limit reaching 87 micro gram per cubic metre, shows the sulphurbased firecrackers contributed to pollution on Diwali,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./She said the problem of pollution was as grave as last year even though the comparative figures show a downward trend./The CSE tracked the realtime air pollution data reported on Delhi Pollution Control Committee website on Diwali night. According to the Centre, it showed ""rapid buildup"" of pollution after 5pm and very high levels during night. ""Calm weather with nearly no wind blocked quick dispersal of smoke and pollutants. The pollution levels in residential areas, including RK Puram, Punjabi Bagh, Mandir Marg, and Civil Lines have recorded higher levels than IGI Airport and Anand Vihar that are otherwise the pollution hotspots,"" it observed./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Spike in pollution sends elderly, kids to hospital","New Delhi, Oct. 25 -- Figures released by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Friday showed that the levels of five major pollutants were five to seven times higher than prescribed limits on Diwali. Several city hospitals told HT that their emergency staff were kept busy on Thursday night attending to complaints of respiratory ailments, especially from the elderly and children./Calm weather caused the pollutants to hang in the air for longer, exacerbating the situation despite the levels of pollutants actually being lower than the same period last year./The figures released by the DPCC, one of two agencies monitoring pollution levels in Delhi, are for 24 hours starting 6 am on Diwali. It measured the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and Particulate Matter (PM) 10 and 2.5./The numbers show the maximum level of PM 2.5 was 500 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) at Civil Lines on Diwali, nearly eight times higher than the acceptable limit of 60. Last year, the upper limit was 533 mpcm./The newly-introduced Air Quality Index (AQI) ranked air quality in most residential locations as ""severe (extremely bad for health)"" primarily because of high levels of PM2.5. This pollutant is particularly dangerous because it is so fine that our natural lung filters cannot trap it and it can lodge in our lungs, causing asthma, bronchitis, lung damage and, in the long term, even cancer./As the AQI has been introduced this year, a comparison with previous years was unavailable./PM10 levels ranged between 421 and 790 mpcm, over seven times higher than the prescribed level of 100 mpcm. But this was an improvement from 2013, when it ranged between 528 and 1378 mpcm during Diwali. Similarly, the figure for sulphur dioxide ranged between 8 and 87 mpcm, down from 35-106 mpcm in 2013./Though prolonged exposure to any pollutant is a health risk, doctors say even shortterm exposure is not advisable. ""Firecrackers don't only release major pollutants into the atmosphere but also hazardous trace elements like aluminum, lead and magnesium. Short-term exposure, even for a couple of hours, to these toxic metals can lead to long-term health effects,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine, AIIMS./""These pollutants can har m the heart and brain as well. People with existing heart or lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive hear t disease, or ischemic heart disease are at increased risk,"" said scientist Dr Gufran Beig of SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), jointly run by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department./Though there is no data yet to support this correlation, a drop in the sale of firecrackers is believed to be one of the reasons behind the reduction in the level of pollutants as compared to 2013./""Compared to previous years, the sale of firecrackers has reduced by at least 25 per cent this Diwali. The sale of firecrackers usually touches Rs 150 crore but sales are down this season,"" said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders./An official at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the second agency that monitors air pollution, said this time the police was strict while issuing licences and ensured vendors complied with conditions that crackers meet requisite standards./Retailers also did not stock as many Chinese crackers, known to be more polluting. ""The demand is also not very high because the price of quality crackers is higher than the Chinese ones which we cannot sell"", said Unmesh Sethi, who set up a firecracker shop in Rohini./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Smog alerts will help Delhi fight pollution,"New Delhi, Nov. 3 -- Delhi's air pollution is more than a set of mind-boggling data for those with respiratory ailments or who have a family member suffering from one. On chilly mornings, you wake up gasping for breath. The air smells of charcoal. The skies appear grey with haze. You read some articles in the morning papers on the air quality. In Delhi, that is all you get in terms of a smog alert./There is round-the-clock tracking by pollution control bodies monitoring air quality at 14 locations in the city. Reading this data, Hindustan Times on Saturday reported how pollution had reached toxic levels this weekend. In RK Puram, particulate matter 2.5 or PM2.5 peaked to 16 times the safe limit./The US embassy's Air Quality Index, which converts PM2.5 data and places them on a scale of 0 to 500, was 274 in Chanakyapuri at 9pm - falling in the 'very unhealthy' 201300 range, according to the US standards./The farm stubble burnt across north India to clear land for cultivation coupled with Delhi's vehicular pollution produced deadly air laced with particles fine enough to sit deep in lungs and blood tissues. Constant exposure to this could cause stroke or even lung cancer, the doctors warned./In any other city, these suffocating times would have demanded urgent action./Last year, Malaysia and Singapore kicked off a diplomatic row with Indonesia when fumes from its illegal land-clearing fires in palm oil plantations choked the other two neighbouring countries. The dispute ended only after the Indonesian president apologised to the people of Malaysia and Singapore./But our government could not even get the states and its own departments sit together and draw up a plan to regulate farm fires./Last month, the National Green Tribunal censured the central and the state governments for their failure to stop burning of farm stubble, asking for a comprehensive plan by November 10./In fact, the government didn't even have a clean-up strategy till two years ago when Delhi clocked 12 days of continuous smog./The Supreme Court intervened, extracting a five-year plan that included introduction of cleaner emission norms in Delhi, higher parking rates, improvement in public transport, congestion taxes, road space rationing, and putting up air quality index on display boards, recommending motorists to use public transport and warning people about the ill effects of smog./In election mode, the state government sat on the plan till it was recently revived by the Lieutenant Governor. He has asked for a timeline and budgetary allocations for each of these projects./While regulatory measures and sprucing up public transport are measures that require time, money and a lot of political will, putting in place smog alert that help identify critically-polluted areas is an emergency measure Delhi can't put off./World over, cities issue smog and haze alerts almost instantly when pollution reaches alar ming levels. Beijing has a colour-coded smog alert system since October 2013./A yellow alert prompts increased road cleaning and spraying of water at construction sites. The orange level, sounded out last on October 19, advises schools to stop all outdoor sporting activities and closing down of factories in the vicinity./During red alert, the highest level, schools are shut, vehicles are kept off the road, and the government runs extra buses and extends subway timings. In fact, the Chinese government faces criticism for not declaring red alert even when the air quality deteriorates to dangerous levels./Paris authorities opened up their public transport system to everyone for free for three days when thick smog enveloped the city last year./In June this year, the Chile government urged soccer fans to refrain from traditional barbecues during the FIFA World Cup because the clouds of smoke from charred meat were worsening the capital's smog, Bloomberg reported./Most of these cities use their air quality indexes as indicators of health risk./A smog watch not only warns vulnerable people to take precautions, it raises awareness about the pollution levels, forcing specific and immediate action from authorities./It is time our governments come clean. We have a right to know the quality of air we breathe./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Stop: Danger signs ahead,"New Delhi, Nov. 10 -- The Global Burden of Disease report - a collaborative venture of the World Health Organization, Harvard, John Hopkins university and other institutions - has pronounced that Asian cities have become the epicentre of life threatening air pollution, caused primarily by minute particles of diesel soot and gas emissions by all types of vehicles. This should be a wake-up call for India. In spite of the European Commission introducing many measures to control air pollution, it is still the cause of 400,000 premature deaths in the continent each year. China, which claims to be trying hard to rid itself of polluting industrial units, loses around 500,000 lives each year to the 'airpocalypse,' a new coinage for killer air pollution./Already the world's biggest auto market, more than 20 million new cars hit the road last year further damaging the ambient air quality of Chinese cities. Environmentalists agree that the explosion in car use in China and India is largely responsible for Asia having an alarming 65% share of global deaths caused by air pollution. India, which is excruciatingly slow in enforcing fuel efficiency standards and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission norms for vehicles, has seen a rapid rise in air pollution-related mortality. Doctors are alarmed by growing incidence of respiratory diseases and sudden cardiac deaths due to breathing of poisonous air. The poor are no doubt more vulnerable but the rich are not spared the ill effects of degraded air quality./The German consulting firm Roland Berger Strategy has forecast that Indian car demand will have a compound annual growth of 12% to 5 million units by 2020. But a rapidly growing car population will put the government under increasing pressure to staunch pollution by vehicle emissions. As thousands are hospitalised and die every year by inhaling toxic air, India is burdened with high medical bills and productivity losses running into billions of dollars./Globally, the two major sources of air pollution are coal-fired power plants and automobiles. Take the US, the world's largest per capita user of petroleum based liquid fuel, where the transportation sector is the second largest emitter of toxic gases closely behind power complexes. This acted as the trigger for the US, Japan and the European Union (EU) to urge automakers to go on improving the fuel economy of vehicles./The average fuel economy of vehicles in the US, where over the decades the citizens indulged in riding gas guzzling tank like cars, will now have to be raised to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2012. Even more stringent norms are in place in the EU where cars must not emit more than 95 gram of CO2 per km and must run 100 km on 4.1 litres of petrol by 2021. Compliance is ensured by the penalty for violation of prescribed emission norms. EU rules say if average CO2 emissions of a manufacturer's fleet are in breach of limits set for any year since 2012, then it has to pay an ""excess emission premium"" for each vehicle unit produced. For improving air quality, the focus has to be on the transportation sector which accounts for 25% of world energy demand (from the point of manufacturing means of transport to their running) and well over 60%of yearly oil use./What are the things automakers must do before they are entitled to wear the 'environment badge of honour'? The basic challenge is to effect major weight reduction of vehicles to be able to conform to increasingly stricter fuel efficiency standards. ""Essentially we need to deliver a 25% reduction in the weight of structural components and closures, in other words the body-in-white (BiW) of automobiles. Steel can already do this, and we can do it in a more cost-effective and environment friendly manner than any other material,"" says Lakshmi Mittal, chairman of the world's largest steel producer Arcelor Mittal. Mittal advocating the virtues of steel like never before is seen as an attempt to fight back against the growing use of aluminium in car manufacturing in developed economies. This is despite the best quality auto grade steel, the technology for which remains the preserve of a handful, costing a few times more than aluminium./Armed with closely held rolling technology, groups like Arcelor Mittal, Nippon Steel and Posco are today able to stretch flat auto steel very thinly, which, however, is claimed to be ""ten times stronger than mild steel"" in use till a few years ago. SAIL chairman Chandra Shekhar Verma does not stand the risk of being immediately challenged when he says ""steel will outweigh any other metal when used for making vehicles in terms of safety, cost and environmental performance."" The scrap between makers of steel and the rival metal aluminium came into the open when Ford announced earlier this year that its long best selling pick-up truck F-150 will have an all aluminium body. With around 97 per cent of the body structure in aluminium, Ford claims to have effected a 320 kg reduction in curb weight of the F-150 truck scheduled to hit the road soon. General Motors too have decided to use aluminium body for its next generation of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra and achieve a still bigger weight reduction than Ford's F-150 truck./From Mittal to Verma all steelmakers are feeling the heat since use of aluminium is no longer confined to upmarket models from Audi, JLR and Mercedes. Mass producers keen on reducing the weight of vehicles have found virtues in aluminium. Electric cars like Tesla in the US use aluminium BiW. The fact remains aluminium has one-third the density of steel but it is as strong as the ferrous metal./Kunal Bose is a senior journalist The views expressed by the author are personal/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Warming up to beat winter woes,"Kolkata, Nov. 12 -- With the cold creeping in, dengue and malaria will be replaced by new infections and disorders. Get ready to battle the usual flu, sore throats and runny noses. These infections are airborne and spread through sneezing, coughing and contaminated surfaces. Cold also exacerbates asthma and raises your chances of upper respiratory track infections and lung infections./""Because of dry weather, cold air enters through our nostrils posing health problems. More than 20% of Kolkatans suffer from asthma and lung allergy. These patients often need to be admitted to hospitals,"" AG Ghosal, director of National Allergy Bronchritis Institute, said./Asthma is a condition of chronic swelling of airways. These airways are sensitive to stimulation by infection, cold air and pollens. It is caused by a combination of complex and less understood environmental and genetic interactions. Many environmental factors are associated with asthma's development and exacerbation, including allergens, air pollution and other environmental chemicals./""Patients suffering from asthma can show symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, chest tightness, difficulty in breathing and feeling febrile,"" Ghosal added./He added that weather is not the sole factor, but the fluctuation of the temperatures recorded from November to February and pollution also give rise to these ailments. ""In most cases, children and the elderly suffer from asthma. Healthy adults are not so much affected,"" Ghosal said. ""Use disposable tissues instead of handkerchief to avoid constant infection throught your own hands,"" he said./Asthma patients should avoida chilled water. They shouldsh protect them from coldco during constant fluctuationtu of the temperature. During winter, they should stay indoors. It is advisable tot wear a scarf and wrap a ccloth around the neck and hhead and carry inhalers while going outside. The person should drink and bathe with warm water./Besides asthma, cases of Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are being reported in the city. ""Chain smokers are easily affected by COPD. Excessive smoking increases the possibilty of being infected by the disease"", said Ghosal./COPD is a disease that makes it difficult for persons to empty the air out of their lungs. It can cause difficulty in breathing and feeling of tiredness./""Smoking during pregnancy and post delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma and COPD-like symptoms. Traffic pollution has also been associated with both asthma and asthma severity,"" he said./""Cough, sputum production or breathing problem are all common signs of COPD. People aged over 45 years suffer from COPD alot,"" added Ghosal./COPD patients should always remain under medication since it widens the breathing tubes besides reducing swelling in the tubes. Use of inhaler is recommended as it opens up the airways./Inhaling air pollutants can cause the mucus glands to produce more mucus aggravating coughing. Environmental factors may also lead to the sickness. Some people also develop asthma./""The symptoms may not go entirely but can be reduced if one quits smoking,"" Ghosal added./Another doctor, who specialises in medicine, echoed the same concerns. ""Winter is the best for healthy living for people in our country. But if we fail to take precautions, we become vulnerable to heart attack, arthritis, chronic bronchitis, chest infections, sore throat, dry skin and lung disease,"" Dr Subrata Maitra said./""Inability to walk or use hands, morning stiffness, weight loss, muscleaches and pains are common symptoms of arthritis patients. Normally, adults and elderly suffer from the arthritis,"" said Maitra./According to him, a person suffering from sore throat must gurgle with warm salty water. It won't heal the infection completely but it has anti-inflammatory properties. ""Heart attack occurs due to highblood pressure which puts more strain on the heart. The heart has to work harder to maintain body heat when the climate is cold,"" added Maitra./Moitra said hypersensitivity pneumonitis or HP, a disease in which the lungs become inflamed, is also common among people of the city during winter./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Swachh Bharat? 4,000 people have just one toilet in this slum","umbai, Nov. 24 -- Twelve children have lost their lives since April this year at a slum in Govandi because of lack of sanitation facilities. These children were between the age groups of 0-6 years, according to a report by a non-profit Apnalaya./While the Swachh Bharat campaign is raging across the country, for residents of Rafi Nagar, even clean air is a faraway dream./Surrounded by dirt and filth, thousands live here without basic amenities such as water, food, electricity and proper shelter. ""We have no water supply and hence, have to buy water from tankers every day, paying Rs50 for it. Half of my earnings are spent on buying water,"" said Sheela Sunil Kumar, a daily wage worker./The NGO's survey suggests the growth of the children in the area is slower compared with the rest of the city. Only 68% children here reach the required child growth rate, specified by the health department of the Centre./Infant mortality in the region is 60.80 for a 1,000 live births, which is almost double compared with the rest of Mumbai. The life expectancy in the region is a mere 39 years./While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken of building more public toilets across the country, the slum has only one toilet to cater to 4,000 residents. The residents either walk miles to use the toilet, or defecate in the open./""We received the maximum number of cases of diarrhoea and malnutrition from this area,"" said Ninad Salunkhe, health officer, Apanalaya./A recent Unicef report had revealed maximum children in India die because of diarrhoea and malnutrition./""Open defecation is responsible for diarrhoea. Frequently contracting the disease dehydrates the body, which can lead to death,"" said Dr Anitha Balachander, head-R&D, Jammi Pharmaceuticals./Air pollution is another major cause for worry here.

Panel to submit report on pollution control by Jan 9,"New Delhi, Nov. 28 -- An inter-ministerial committee will submit an action plan early next month to control Delhi's rising air pollution through measures including restriction on car sales and a mechanism for citizens to share vehicles./The Capital, which has one of the highest vehicle densities in the country, has been reporting a sharp rise in air pollution in the last few weeks. Concentration of fine airborne particles - linked with bronchitis, lung cancer and heart diseases - continues to be way above safe levels./""Top officers of pollution watchdogs, environment, transpor t, petroleum and urban development ministries, besides Delhi police commissioner and an IIT-Delhi expert will submit their plan to the National Green Tribunal,"" said a senior government official./When this panel failed to give a 'substantive' report on Wednesday to control vehicular and industrial pollution, the tribunal banned vehicles over 15 years old, and ordered pollution checks for all staterun buses and the installation of 'air purifiers' in busy markets. The new deadline for the panel to submit the plan is January 9./The committee will look at pollution from vehicles, plastic burning, fire crackers and industries and suggest prohibition on certain activities. ""The Supreme Court several years ago ruled no vehicle more than 15 years of age would be permitted on roads. This direction is being observed only in violations,"" the tribunal said in its earlier order./Pollution- control expert Anumita Roychowdhury, said, ""A periodic assessment of the effectiveness of the action plan is needed to ensure peak pollution levels during winter are brought down and the clean air target is met."" She said Delhi needed to scale up walking, cycling and public transport and leapfrog to clean emission standards./The national green tribunal's orders are also applicable to other towns and cities falling in the National Capital Region (NCR)./""Authorities of areas in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan falling in NCR will also ensure compliance of the directions. Chief secretaries of these states are being informed,"" said an official./Noting that air pollution mainly results in morbidity, ""which in turn may lead to mortality"", environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday said the government was focussing on promotion of cleaner technologies./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Take cars off roads, make public transport free: Panel","New Delhi, Nov. 29 -- A Supreme Court appointed committee has suggested a slew of drastic measures, including taking all private cars off the road for a day, to check air pollution in the city./In its report submitted to the SC on Friday, the Environment Pollution (prevention and control) Authority (EPCA) has suggested 'protective and control' measures to tackle 'very poor', 'severe' and 'very severe' pollution episodes./""On days of when air pollution is really high, we have suggested advisories be issued, and stern action against smoke-emitting vehicles,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment that prepared the report with EPCA./Some of the measures include making public transport free, closing of schools, making wearing of face masks mandatory, ban on diesel vehicles, double parking charges and shutting down construction when pollution is very high./The report also calls for taking all private cars - other than emergency vehicles - off the road and a ban on the entry of all commercial vehicles to the city to tackle very severe pollution -which is 8 or more times the standard limit./""The city needs to bring in urgent, drastic and long-term second-generation reforms. The agenda includes restricting growth of use of private transport, limiting use of diesel; greatly augmenting public transport systems and bypassing commercial vehicles, not destined for Delhi,"" the report says./The data on pollution is available from different parts of the city on a real time basis./However, the city does not have a forecasting system for advance warning about air pollution risks./""In this event, the only way is to inform people is during the day or on the day after. Given this situation, another approach would be to provide this warning if there are two days of severe pollution. This is not a satisfactory solution but there are no alternatives in the current situation,"" it says./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi's wait for a much wider, efficient bus service must end","New Delhi, Dec. 1 -- Studying in the United Kingdom in the late 90s, I remember how difficult it was to commute in Central London. One would often get off the bus and walk to the destination because it was faster./This was the time Londoners had voted in favour of electing a mayor to run the capital and candidate Ken Livingstone was talking about a tough roadpricing regime to reduce traffic congestion in the central business district./When elected, Livingstone kept his promise. In 2003, the congestion tax was introduced, covering eight square miles in central London. Motorists were charged five pounds a day for driving through the area./Three years ago, when I visited London after over a decade, I found the city had more breathing space. There were fewer cars and more buses. The tube, buses, London Overground, Dockland Light Railway, trams, a range of cabs, and hired bicycles provided a well-integrated web of public transport. Transport for London, responsible for running all these services, claims some of this investment has come from congestion tax. The charge, now 11.50 pounds a drive, raised more than two billion pounds since it was introduced, which by law has been reinvested in public transport after covering the cost of enforcement./While London has decongested, my hometown, Delhi, is asphyxiating. Every week, the waiting time at every signal on my way to office and back gets longer, sometimes even stretching to two or three signal cycles. The problem is the sheer number of cars that fill up our roads./The foul air from the seven million vehicles on Delhi's roads is leading to overcrowding in the intensive care units of city hospitals, HT reported last week. Studies collated by the Centre for Science and Environment from various sources show that more than 3,000 premature deaths occurred every year in Delhi due to air pollution-related diseases. At least half of Delhi's population lived within 500 metres from arterial roads and was directly affected by vehicular pollution./Last week, the National Green Tribunal announced a host of measures, including banning vehicles older than 15 years. Two days later, the Environment Pollution (prevention and control) Authority, in a report to Supreme Court, suggested raising pollution alerts on the lines of Beijing and Paris, restrictions on vehicle ownership, limiting the use of diesel vehicles and promotion of public transport./These suggestions are not new. For years, almost all studies commissioned by the government, Parliament and the courts recommended congestion pricing and road space rationing. But experts say they can't be enforced till we fix the basic connectivity problems./We can't beat the London Underground's 151 years of history, but Delhi's Metro in its 12th year is already ferrying 2.5 million passengers daily. Yet, at least 700 new cars hit Delhi's roads every day./While a 2010 study by the School of Planning and Architecture showed that 58% of those who commuted by private cars were willing to use the Metro if provided with better feeder service, experts say the bulk of the public transport services in any city has to be bus-based./In London, 3.7 million people use the Underground daily while 6.4 million take a bus. Singapore registers a daily subway ridership of 2.65 million trips and 3.48 million trips by buses. In Delhi, bus ridership is 60% higher than Metro's./But to run to its full potential, the Delhi Transport Corporation needs to double its fleet and reach to ensure lastmile connectivity, improve frequency, install display boards showing routes and timetables and bring the buses under GPS surveillance. Instead, Delhi is busy building more flyovers and widening roads./Summing up the government's short-sighted approach, AK Jain, an expert on HT's panel for the 'Unclog Delhi' campaign, quoted American traffic engineer Walter Kulash: ""Fighting congestion by widening a road is like loosening your belt to fight obesity""./Restraining the movement of the city's seven million private vehicles requires political courage. But Delhi's crawling road traffic demands unpopular interventions. It is time we upgrade our public transport network. After all, there is only so much road space - or so many flyovers - Delhi can have./<a href=""mailto:shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com"">shivani.singh@hindustantimes.com</a>/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Delhi pollution worse during winter, says new study","London, Dec. 2 -- As the cold weather sets in, a quantitative analysis on particulate matter (PM) in Delhi has highlighted that residents are exposed to significantly higher levels of air pollutants in the Indian capital during winter than in summer, researchers from US, UK and India say./A University of Birmingham release on Tuesday said that air pollution continued to be one of the key global environmental challenges and is widespread in India, with Delhi, most notably, experiencing major air quality problems./The largest public health impact from air pollution is due to exposure to particulate matter - very fine dust floating in the air. These dust particles are so small that they can get in to the lungs, potentially causing series health problems./Researchers from the University of Birmingham, the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi), the Central Road Research Institute (India) and the Desert Research Institute (USA) have been collaborating to provide key scientific evidence in this area./The aim of their study is to analyse the composition of particulate matter and to understand its sources in Delhi, which will assist in the development of targeted policy instruments to control air pollution, the release added./Air samples were collected in June 2013 (summer) and December 2013-January 2014 (winter) adjacent to a heavy traffic site on Mathura Road, Delhi. The site is also influenced by industrial emissions from the Okhla Industrial Area and biomass emanations from nearby dwellings./The researchers found that average 12 hour PM2.5 concentrations in winter were significantly higher than the 24 hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard in India (60 mu g/m3). PM2.5 are fine particles, less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter./Normally, these smaller particles can penetrate in to the respiratory system and cause negative health effects. In fact, a majority of the overall particles were found to be in the small size range, which can easily be inhaled and cause irreversible damage./Several harmful components, including lead, zinc and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found to be present in very high concentrations in winter. These particles are associated with respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis, and they can also cause inflammation and exacerbate cardiovascular diseases./The quantitative analysis shows that sources for particulate matter include soil, road dust and tailpipe emissions from vehicles, as well as wood, coal and waste burning. Road dust and soil levels in the air increase in summer when temperatures are high and rainfall is low./Roy M. Harrison from the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham, said: ""Exposure to particulate matter has negative consequences for human health but cost-effective abatement measures depend upon a quantitative knowledge of the contributions of different sources in the atmosphere. This work contributes to the body of knowledge which underpins policy development""./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Of the 80 lakh vehicles registered in Delhi, roughly 29 lakh - 20 lakh two-wheelers and 8 lakh four-wheelers - are to be taken off roads. The tribunal has also ordered no such vehicles, including buses, should enter Delhi from other states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab,"" said a Delhi government official./There are many vehicles that are over 15 years old but have been issued five-year fitness extension./""Problem is this is an accumulative data. T hey kee p adding numbers every year without considering how many vehicles are going off the city's roads,"" said pollution control expert Anumita Roychowdhury./On November 26, the tribunal, which has the powers of a civil court in matters related to environment, barred all vehicles - private cars, motorbikes, commercial vehicles, buses and trucks - over 15 years old from plying in Delhi./""...wherever vehicles of this age are noticed, authorities concerned shall take appropriate steps in accordance with law including seizure of the vehicles,"" the NGT had said./The order is also likely to lead to a drop in the prices of old vehicles, especially those more than 10 years old, in Delhi./The sale of new vehicles may not peak because the average replacement cycle is not more than five years./""Problem is the tribunal has not ordered scrapping of polluting vehicles.

A healthy hearth makes for a healthy life,"New Delhi, Dec. 4 -- India's leaders are engaged in fostering a number of economic and social programmes aimed at improving the lives of its citizens. But with renewed government attention and continued support from the nation's private and non-profit sectors, there is one public health initiative with particular promise to help families in India: A clean cooking movement./Research prepared for the United Nations Foundation's Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves shows that every day, an estimated 166 million of India's households rely on solid fuels as the primary source of cooking fuel, often self-collected and burned using open fires or traditional chulhas in homes with little or no ventilation./Current public health estimates indicate approximately 400 million people in India are exposed to the negative health effects of indoor pollution based on these traditional practices. Equally important, over 90% of those exposed to this harmful pollution are women and girls./The public health costs are staggering. Household air pollution in India is a major cause of premature deaths and the leading cause of lower life expectancy caused by cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, pneumonia, and other acute lower respiratory infections, along with cataracts and blindness. Additionally, unsafe cookstoves are a primary cause of debilitating burns suffered annually by more than 500,000 women./Estimates suggest that every year, India experiences 875,000 deaths and the loss of 16.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to indoor air pollution traced to poor ventilation and cooking methods./Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which include heart and lung disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer, remain the world's leading causes of death, claiming more lives than all other causes of disease combined./Chronic conditions like heart or lung disease are not just about men with 'bad habits', it is also the leading cause of death among women in developing countries, including India, causing over 3.6 million deaths each year. The vast majority of these women do not smoke, are not overweight, are physically active, and do not abuse alcohol. And yet, most of these women share a risk factor common to 150 million Indian households: Air pollution from cooking with solid fuels, often in poorly ventilated conditions./An estimated 140,000 children under five die every year from preventable diseases connected to indoor air pollution./In order to scale up supply and demand for safe cookstoves and fuels, support led by the government is needed in four key areas: Facilitating more partnerships aimed at creating economic incentives for household energy security including clean cookstoves and fuels; providing a wider base of financing for both consumers and suppliers; continued work on developing acceptable standards for stove performance; and, continuing to promote awareness of the positive benefits of clean cookstoves and fuels./India needs to act now to tackle a complex problem that could escalate into a significant drain on the nation, its most vulnerable people and the environmental balance. The first step is to start with leadership and ownership of the issue. An inter-ministerial approach is needed to bring together departments to initiate a programme with clear targets. India must set its sights on the end goal of a focused, targeted, multi-stakeholder drive to ensure that secure household energy options, including clean cookstoves and fuel, are available in every single Indian home./After all, a healthy family starts with a healthy hearth./K Srinath Reddy is president, Public Health Foundation of India and Gro Harlem Brundtland is director general emeritus, World Health Organization The views expressed by the authors are personal/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Premature mortality may rise 3 times,"umbai, Dec. 9 -- As the country is set to treble its coal power generation capacity in the next 15 years, emissions from coal-fired plants across the country will result in lakhs of premature deaths and leave millions more to various respiratory ailments, new data by groups Urban Emissions and Conservation Action Trust (CAT) has revealed./According to the study 'Coal Kills: Health Impacts of Air Pollution from India's Coal Power Expansion', the total premature mortality owing to emissions from coal-fired thermal power plants is estimated to grow up to three times reaching 1.86 lakh to 2.29 lakh annually in 2030./By 2030, asthma cases related to coal plant emissions will increase to 42.7 million./With the highest number of coal-fired plants in the country, Maharahtra is set to undergo a two-fold expansion by 2030. This, according to the study, will translate into 19, 010 premature deaths in 2030 and 410 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions./Uttar Pradesh will top the list of premature deaths at 26,000 followed by West Bengal at 20,440 in 2030./Premature deaths include those from ailments such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, ischemic heart disease and cancer./A similar study by the same group last year had found that exposure to particulate matter from 111 coal plants between 2011 and 2012 across India had resulted in an estimated 80,000 to 1,15,000 premature deaths and 20.9 million asthma cases./""If India only makes the installation of Flue Gas Desulfurization (it removes sulphur dioxide from exhaust flue gases) mandatory, it will bring down premature deaths by 50%. India also needs to set standards for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions,"" said Sarath Guttikunda, director of Delhi-based UrbanEmissions. info, and affiliate associate research professor, division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, USA./Guttikunda, who was part of the team which built India's first air quality forecasting system, piloted during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, added, ""We are not against thermal power plants. We need cleaner power plants, and that is very possible. If countries such as China, US, and Europe are doing it, so can we.""/With coal consumption set to rise three-fold from the current 660 million tonnes a year to 1,800 million tonnes a year by 2030, the study has indicated three-fold rise in carbon dioxide emissions from 1,590 million tonnes a year to 4,320 million tonnes a year during the same period./""With air pollution killing a huge number of people, the social cost of power generation is always overlooked,"" said Debi Goenka, founder, CAT. ""If we make sure that power plants are governed by stringent rules, fossil fuel will get expensive. This is when renewable energy will get competitive and also affordable.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

A combination of emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis, COPD is being reported increasingly across India's towns and villages, with pesticide use and indoor air pollution from cooking over open smoke fires in poorly-ventilated rooms being the leading causes of lung damage in rural areas./The initial symptoms of this progressive lung disease are so subtle that most people don't realise they have a problem, dismissing frequent cough and breathlessness as fatigue, pollution, increasing weight or advancing age. The lung damage is irreversible, but treatment using medication and lung rehab can stop and even slow its progression./Shortness of breath is among the first giveaways, with most affected people complaining of an inability to inhale deeply while doing routine activity that boosts heart rate, such as climbing the stairs or carrying a heavy object. The affected person and people around them are best placed to notice stress-related lung distress because they can compare it with lung-function in the past./A frequent, lingering or chronic cough is the other symptom that appears early on. COPD inflames the bronchial tubes and the air sacs (alveoli) inside the lungs, making them thicker and less elastic/This makes the walls of the airways produce more mucus, which clogs them and results in a phlegmy cough.

Interrupted sleep is a result of posture, as lying flat on the bed forces lungs to work harder. The strain on the lungs makes breathing shallow and interrupted, causing some people to cough through the night. The affected person ends up feeling listless and fatigued all the time.

Back to nature: Turn your home into a healthy zone,"New Delhi, Jan. 13 -- Air pollution is a big killer in India. Just like outdoor pollution, indoor air pollution can be deadly too, with a wide variety of toxic chemicals lurking in your home!/According to a survey by World Health Organisation, indoor pollution in India caused 34% stroke, 26% heart disease, 22% COPD, 12% acute lower respiratory infections in children and 6% lung cancer fatalities which eventually lead to death./Woman protecting herself from the hazards of air pollution (Photo: Shutterstock)/It's time you stopped living in fear. Here are a few DIY ideas to turn your home into a healthy zone./Make an herb garden/In 2014, a study by University of California warned that air pollution in India had a direct, negative impact on grain production. Analysing three decades of data, scientists found that in densely populated states wheat yields were 50% lower than what they could have been in 2010./You may argue that you are not into crop cultivation, and therefore, by extension, you need not bother about this figure. Right? Wrong. Air pollution impacts all, and you'll do yourself a world of good by giving yourself a protective shield with an herb garden./How to do it/First things first! Keep in mind what kind of light comes into your home and its intensity./The best way to make a herb garden at home is to take one rectangular pot and fill the base with 1 inch of gravel. Then, cover the pot with 5 inches of well-drained soil/vermi compost./What to plant/Suggests Shaan Lalwani, director of Vriksha Nursery in Mumbai: ""If you have 2-3 hours of light indoors, then you can grow rosemary, oregano and curry leaves. For areas that have natural sunlight for around 3-5 hours, plants like thyme, tarragon and chives are the best.""/Mamta Bargale, founder of Bengaluru's Orchid Tree, adds Italian basil, mint and cilantro to the list./""These three plants are easy to grow and are pretty useful in the kitchen too.

GPS-based facilities will be included along with basic facilities such as round-the-clock electricity and water besides solving the problem of increasing traffic, he added./He talked about the recent issue of school students hiring goons. He said last week's newspaper reports about some college-going students involved in alleged ""protection money racket"" were startling. The adviser said Chandigarh would finally get the multi-level parking functional in Sector 17 from May. He said another multi-level parking would come up next to the district courts in Sector 43./He said since Chandigarh is a well-planned city, it becomes the joint responsibility of the administration and citizens to maintain it well. ""I wish to make Chandigarh an example of progress and modernisation during my tenure. The co-operation of residents is needed for this.""/He said the safety of women in the city is of prime importance. Efforts should be made so that women could move around the city fearlessly and steps would be initiated to introduce more hostel and boarding facilities for girl students who come here to pursue education, he said. Students from various schools presented cultural items and awardees were also handed over certificates. City MP Kirron Kher, UT deputy commissioner Mohammed Shayin and others were also present./Achievements/The administration has also been appreciated for tackling the recent bird flu scare at Sukhna Lake. The Chandigarh administration has introduced one-time incentive of '1 lakh to those cadets belonging to the Chandigarh administration who join the Indian armed forces, he added. The administration has provided 13% reservation to ex-servicemen in direct recruitment, he informed./Pollutants high in air/Referring to air pollution, the adviser said as per the data available, the quantity of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) is more than the acceptable limit. The administration is in favour of implementing a policy to bring the RSPM level down. Inhaling of RSPM in air is said to lead to pulmonary diseases considered as harmful./Plans/Seven new government schools and 106 additional classrooms are under construction and likely to be completed during the current financial year, the adviser said. Moreover, eight new schools, 274 additional classes and 128 toilet blocks in 44 government schools have also been planned soon, he said./Tricolour hoisted at Burail Jail/The Burail Jail staff and the CRPF contingent posted at the prison hoisted the national flag on the 66th Republic Day.

On offer: Cost-effective measures to rid India of air pollution,"India, Feb. 5 -- Delhi has the dubious distinction of being the world's most polluted city. In fact, the entire country, including the rural areas, is heavily polluted as anyone who has taken a flight in India knows. The fog that engulfs north India in winter is largely a consequence of the smoke particles in the air on which water condenses easily. Why have matters been allowed to reach this state? One reason is that people do not realise how cheap it is to get rid of much of the air pollution that plagues us./In November, the fields of north-western India are set on fire to burn the loose stalks of the harvested rice crop that are left behind by combine harvesting machines.

Paying for every breath you take,"New Delhi, Feb. 5 -- There are several cost-effective measures available in the market that India can adopt to get rid of much of air pollution Delhi has the dubious distinction of being the world's most polluted city.

Alarming air pollution is what Kejriwal must fight,"India, Feb. 15 -- Last Tuesday, even as the votes were being counted in Delhi's elections and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was blowing up its two rivals into smithereens, fragments of a different sort - minute ones, actually - were wreaking havoc in the city's atmosphere. I'm referring, of course, to the particulate matter (PM) suspended in abundance in Delhi's air, especially the PM2.5, which are extremely small particles that can be breathed deep into the lungs where they get absorbed and with whose inhalation comes myriad health risks that include ailments such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, birth defects and, quite often, early death. PM2.5 are particles emanating primarily from the combustion or burning of fossil fuels such as coal and from the emissions of motorised vehicles./In Delhi, last Tuesday, the average PM2.5 pollution was thrice the national standard for the pollutant, making it unhealthy and a potential risk for those who live and breathe the air there. But thrice - a shocking multiple anywhere - is nothing for Delhi, which this winter saw PM2.5 shoot up to 20 times the standard, giving rise to an unprecedented spike in the number of people in the city who suffered breathing disorders. In 2014, the World Health Organisation (WHO) rated Delhi as the world's most polluted city, ahead of Karachi, Peshawar, Xining and Beijing (yes, we've beaten China)./Yet, in the run-up to Delhi's elections the quality of the city's air was hardly the focus in the campaigns of the three political parties. The Congress's manifesto chose to not even mention it; and the BJP's vision document paid lip service to it. Those two documents may be inconsequential now. But AAP's isn't. Buried in its 70-point manifesto were its plans for ""reducing pollution"": the Delhi Ridge would be protected from encroachment and deforestation; there would be incentives for low-emission fuels such as CNG and electricity; and a plan for a holistic transport policy, which includes the induction of 5,000 more buses, would encourage the use of mass transport systems./The problem of pollution in India's cities may be more serious than what governments - at the states and the Centre - acknowledge. Recently, The Economist reported that indoor and outdoor pollution together is the biggest cause of deaths in India, claiming 1.6 million lives annually and causing people to live three years less than they would have had national standards for pollution been met. In last year's WHO rating, of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world, 13 were in India. Delhi tops the list, of course, but Patna, Gwalior, Raipur and Ahmedabad closely follow it. According to a report by TERI, the University of California, San Diego, and the California Air Resources Board, the transport sector contributes 15-50% of the PM2.5 emissions in Indian cities. Delhi, with its 7.5 million registered vehicles (of which just 2.5% is public transport vehicles such as buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws), is the most traffic-congested. And despite an apex court order that bans their entry, high-polluting trucks freely enter Delhi's roads on their cross-country cargo-ferrying routes./As mentioned in his party's manifesto, Delhi's new CM Arvind Kejriwal will likely attempt to get a more efficient mass transport system for commuters. But such things don't happen overnight. A real impetus for something like that can come from the demand side by restricting the plying of private vehicles in the city, along with prohibitive increases in parking costs. Such measures may seem harsh but against the potential deathtraps that pollution could turn our cities into, it will be a small price to pay./For Kejriwal, there could be another pressing reason to tackle pollution in the city that he has just won: politics. The most vulnerable to the risks of urban air pollution are the cities poorest - those who live in slums; and make a living by labouring manually outdoors; plying auto-rickshaws; or vending their fare on the streets - many of whom are the real aam aadmi who've reposed their faith in AAP./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Capital's bad air days continue, pollution level 10 times more than WHO safety limit: Survey","New Delhi, Feb. 17 -- Even as pollution level in the Capital continues to head north at an alarming rate, a new survey conducted by Greenpeace reveals that the deadly PM2.5 levels in Delhi are 10 times higher than the safety limit prescribed by the World Health Organisation./The government's argument that children are exposed to air pollution only during travel has been proven wrong, as the survey conducted in five city schools showed the presence of particulate matter (PM2.5) inside the schools at four times over prescribed Indian safety limits./The survey was conducted in five prominent schools between January 23 and February 12 - Greenfields Public School in east Delhi's Vivek Vihar, Mirambika School in south Delhi, Delhi Police Public School in Safdarjung Enclave, Salwan Public School in Rajendra Nagar and American Public School in Chanakyapuri./""The real-time monitoring data from all the five schools revealed particulate matter PM2.5 to be at very unhealthy levels,"" a Greenpeace release said./PM2.5 is an air pollutant in the air that reduces visibility and has adverse effects on human health. The major sources of such particles are primarily vehicular emissions, burning of fuels and as well as cigarette smoke, cooking, burning candles etc./The survey found at that the PM2.5 (data in micrograms per cubic metre) at Greenfields Public School on January 23 was 253, when the average was 215. At Mirambika School, the PM2.5 on January 27 was 251, with the average recorded at 231./On February 5, at DPPS, the PM 2.5 was found at 246, with the average recorded at 236. While on February 6, at Salwan Public School, it was 243, much higher than the average of 192. Similarly, at American Public School, it was recorded at 209, almost double the average recorded at 155./""When the survey was conducted, it was said that the presence of such matter was more in the corridors and less outside. I couldn't understand that. Now that the report is out, I will be talking to people and will take corrective measures,"" Tripti Nawri, principal, DPSS. Aishwarya Madineni, campaigner with Greenpeace highlighted that the government now needs to issue health advisory the way it is done in Beijing during bad air days./""The results, though conducted towards the end of winter, revealed very high levels of particulate pollution inside the school premises, and during peak winter, these numbers could only be worse,"" Madineni said./""It is clear that children are more susceptible to air pollution. Presence of sulphur dioxide in air causes breathing problems, recurrent nose infection, frequent cold and the frequency of asthmatic attacks also goes up,"" Anant Mohan, associate professor of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorder at AIIMS said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Chinese anti-pollution masks selling like hot cakes in city,"Kolkata, Feb. 19 -- The swine flu scare that has gripped the city over the past few days has led to brisk sales of cheap Chinese anti-pollution masks. However. doctors say the masks offer little protection./""I have sold 300 masks in 20 days. On Monday I brought a fresh consignment from Burrabazar. The masks hit the market last year. This year their demand is higher,"" said Shymal Dutta, a Gariahat hawker./Coming in a variety of six to seven colors including pink, light blue, purple, white and black, they cost between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20./""Mostly school children, bikers, senior citizens and patients with bronchial and respiratory problems are buying them. With quite a few English medium schools located in Gariahat and Ballygunge, the masks are selling out fast,"" said Gariahat hawker A Jha./On Wednesday, six fresh cases of swine flu were reported from various hospitals in the city. The number of infected patients in Kolkata has shot up to 42. Two have already died./""The flu is very infectious and spreads when an infected person sneezes and coughs in close proximity to another person. School children are prone to the virus. You never know who is infected. I don't want my daughter to get infected and have bought her a mask,"" said M Singh, whose daughter Shreya, is a student of Class 2 in an English medium school near Gariahat./However, according to doctors, special masks are required to stop the spread of virus./""The masks which can prevent the spread of swine flu are known as an N95 mask. We have procured them for medical staff, who are treating infected patients in hospitals"" said director of health services Dr B R Satpathi./But it is not just the scare of swine flu, which has helped the sale of the masks. Air pollution worsens during winter. The level of particulate matter less than 10 microns or PM10 shoots up during winter, as they cannot disperse because of low wind velocity and less rainfall. They can get into the lungs and trigger respiratory problems./""Those living along the EM Bypass are having a difficult time because of several projects like the Bus Rapid Transit System, Garia-Airport Metro and flyovers. You cannot walk or drive with your nose and mouth uncovered,"" said regular commuter Sumana Adhikary./Doctors say there is a sudden rise in respiratory ailment like dust allergy, dry cough, asthma and other chronic pulmonary diseases mainly because of rising particulate matter in the air./""But I am not sure whether such masks can prevent particulate matter from entering your lungs. A R 15 mask cannot keep away the virus,"" said pulmonologist Dr PS Bhattacharya./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

US to monitor air quality in Delhi now,"Washington, Feb. 20 -- The US Wednesday announced it was expanding an air-quality monitoring programme it started in Beijing years ago to other cities around the world, starting with India./Under this programme, called AirNow, US missions will monitor air-quality in host cities and countries to help its personnel take better care of themselves./Secretary of state John Kerry announced the initiative - an agreement between his department and the environmental protection agency (EPA) -with India as the first destination. Vietnam would be next, he added./Underlying the stated objective of helping US personnel is an assumption that host countries are not able to monitor air quality - suspended particulate matter - on their own./""Air pollution is a serious and growing health threat worldwide, yet in many areas, real-time air-quality data is not available,"" said a factsheet released by the department of state./China had not responded well to the monitoring. But the US believes, the Beijing experiment worked well, not only for Americans posted there, but also for China, leading the country down the path of pollution control./It was the US monitoring that found that Bejing's infamous winter haze was caused by pollution and not fog as was believed, American officials believe./""Our experts would be taking off in the next few weeks to get this programme started in India,"" said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, at the launch of the programme./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Catch your breath: Here's why you shouldn't choke on polluted air,"India, Feb. 21 -- This is as shocking as it gets. A joint study by researchers at Chicago, Yale and Harvard universities suggests that high particulate matter (PM) pollution causes life expectancy to fall by 3.2 years for 660 million Indians in polluted urban conglomerates, including capital Delhi. In other words, this translates into 2.1 billion life years lost to air pollution! To put it in the right perspective, just a few days ago, the particulate matter (PM) pollution in Delhi crossed 400 unit grams in cubic meter of air (ug/m3) after hovering around 250./This is, without doubt, a substantial price to pay for air pollution. There's more on this time-bomb we are sitting on. According to the latest report on global Environment Performance Index (EPI) 2014, India has slipped 32 places to rank at a lowly 155./Health experts say air pollution is emerging as one of the biggest causes of deaths in our metros, majorly impacting the pulmonary, nervous and cardiovascular systems./How is it really harmful?/Dr Vikas Maurya, senior consultant, Respiratory Medicine & Interventional Pulmonology, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, Delhi says, ""Certain ultra-fine particles (UFP), particulate matter (PM) or nano particles (NP) enter the blood system through lungs and can play havoc with the nervous system by exerting its effect on nervous pathways and vessels. In fact, PM 2.5 (finer PMs) increases the risk of strokes and also deaths, especially in women."" Experts add that there are times when increased association between sulfur dioxide concentrations, carbon monoxide and ozone peak concentrations in the air has also lead to ischemic stroke among people./Air pollution's deadly effect is not limited to your heart. It can also cause major harm to your lungs, leading to various iterations of lung dysfunction such as difficulty in breathing, cough and irritation./Adds Dr Mohd. Shuyeb, chest physician at Delhi's Apollo Clinic: ""Most people tend to gain lung allergy manifestations which leads to diseases like bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People who spent most of their time outdoors are susceptible to these diseases becuase they are continuously inhaling toxic elements in the air. Extreme exposure to air pollution can also lead to malignancy cancer.""/Note to mothers-to-be/The dangers are even bigger for expecting mothers. Experts warn that mercury particles in the air can severely affect the unborn child's brain and its development. A potential neurotoxin, mercury comes from coal-linked power plants, cement kilns and industry boilers. It mostly enters human body if we consume contaminated fish./Says Dr Maurya: ""Pregnant women should be particularly careful as it can affect the baby's growing brain and nervous system, impacting cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, fine motor and visual spatial skills. These could lead to impairment of speech, hearing, walking, peripheral vision, lack of coordination of movements and muscle movements."" Even children and infants exposed to contaminated fish or any other food item can be a victim of neuro-development./Dr Jatin Chaudhary, naturopathy expert at Delhi's Sharnam Healing Centre, says, ""Wheatgrass is a healthy way to fight harmful bacteria, viruses and free radicals. It constitutes chlorophyll that neutralises toxins in the body and boosts immunity system. It can be consumed in the form of tablet or juice.""/Experts suggest other ways to fight toxins in the air:/* Wear a mask when you are travelling in areas known for bad air quality./* Get your health checked regularly to ensure there are no allergies./* Always be mindful of the symptoms of lung problems: These could be coughing, difficulty in breathing, headaches, irritation, among other problems. Get yourself treated immediately as these are signs of high risk and require extra protection./* Do deep breathing exercises like pranayama on a regular basis. A 20-minute walk or run early morning would help increase the lungs immunity capacity./Keep your eyes safe/Air pollution can also hurt your eyes. With increasing pollution, allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation in the eyes resulting from an allergic reaction to chemical substances in the air) is a common ailment./Dr Mahipal S Sachdev, chairman & medical director, Centre for Sight Group of Eye Hospitals, Delhi says, ""The high levels of pollutants like nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide in the air make the tear film more acidic. Tears, which keep the eyes lubricated, are actually a mixture of water, fatty oils, proteins, electrolytes and bacteria fighting substances. Pollutants in the air cause damage to this fragile tear film, leading to redness, itching and inflammation.""/Here's how to fight it:/* Minimise your exposure to possible causative agents by keeping the windows closed, using indoor air purifier and avoiding exposure to harsh chemicals, perfumes and polluted air./* Avoid rubbing your eyes and apply a cool compress to help reduce inflammation./* In more troublesome cases, consult an eye doctor who'd recommend either oral antihistamines or anti-inflammatory eye drops. In severe cases, he could also prescribe steroid eye drops to get relief./Protect your skin/Pollution can create a lot of long lasting damage to your skin, varying from mild to severe side effects. One of the milder side effects is loss of moisture and elasticity caused by collagen breakdown./Says Dr Priyam Kembre, chief consultant dermatologist of Vichy Cosmetics, ""Depleting ozone layer causes free radical particles to exist in the atmosphere which injures skin cells. The more the pollution, more the free radical damage to your skin. This injuring of skin cells causes premature ageing. Moreover, depleting ozone layer causes increased sun damage which in turn can cause skin burning, dark spots and pigmentation.""/Major pollutants in the environment can lead to skin allergies like eczema, atopic dermatitis and erythrodermatitis, inflammations and skin cancer too!/Dr Kiran Lohia, consultant dermatologist, Fortis Hospital, Delhi says, ""Air pollution can worsen eczema, making skin dry, red and itchy. It can also/worsen and weaken the skin's integrity, making it prone to infections.""/But your skin is not the only one to be affected. Your shiny, beautiful locks too can go for a toss./Dr Rameshwar Gutte, dermatologist, Dr. L. H. Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, Mumbai says, ""Environmental pollution leads to premature falling and graying of hair and at times can lead to premature baldness.""/How to keep it intact:/* Sun protection using a broad spectrum sunscreen is the most important step in skin care to prevent and lessen oxidative damage./* Use a moisturiser with anti oxidants. These anti oxidants create a barrier between the skin and the pollutants./* Exfoliate your skin, take lots of vitamin C and drink lots of water./* Maintain a personal hygiene of the skin./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

The poison in the air is slowly killing you,"New Delhi, Feb. 22 -- Long-term exposure to the tiny dirt particles in polluted air chokes your airways and permanently damages your lungs. Gaurab Chakrobarty, 59, learnt this the hard way when he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) last summer./COPD is a chronic lung disease that a decade ago was almost exclusively reported among smokers, people exposed to industrial lung irritants such as pesticides, coat dust and asbestos. Initial signs are frequent, lingering cough and breathlessness on exertion, which most people dismiss until the shortness of breath becomes so bad that walking becomes a struggle./For Chakraborty, shortness of breath was the first giveaway. ""I couldn't breathe deeply while climbing stairs or carrying things and it soon got so bad that I couldn't climb a flight of steps without resting"" he recalls. Chronic oxygen shortage left him tired and lethargic. He thought it was his heart, but it wasn't. His lungs had packed up./""COPD inflames the bronchial tubes and the air sacs (alveoli) that line the lungs, making them thicker and less elastic. This makes the walls of the airways produce more mucus, which clogs them up and leads to phlegmy cough. The phlegm is usually clear, but it may be yellow, green or spotted with flakes of blood, all of which are red flags to the condition worsening,"" says professor S N Gaur, head, pulmonary medicine, Vallabhai Patel Chest Institute. Smokers often don't produce sputum despite advancing COPD, with sputum production increasing only after they quit./SMOKERS' LUNGS/""I always thought it was a smokers' disease. I've never smoked but now I'm told just breathing Delhi air is like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day,"" says Chakrobarty, a construction engineer who left Melbourne two decades ago to ride the construction boom in Delhi and the NCR./The lung damage is irreversible, but treatment can stop or slow its progression. ""I know there's no point whining now but I can't help thinking that my lungs would have been fine if I'd stayed back,"" he says wistfully./Particulate matter (PM-10 and PM2.5) - mostly from the combustion of fossil fuel, including diesel - is most deadly when its small because that allows it to reach and choke the lower regions of the respiratory tract to damage lung tissue, cause cancer and premature death./The other lung-killer is groundlevel ozone, which is the main constituent of smog that hangs low over Delhi throughout the year. Apart from aggravating asthma, exposure to ozone for just six to seven hours, even at relatively low concentrations, triggers asthma attacks, lowers lung function and triggers wheezing in healthy people. People over 65, children under 12 and people with asthma and lung disorders are at higher risk./CHOKED AIRWAYS/Asthma attacks in children under 10 have more than doubled over the past two years than the past decade, with one in seven experiencing at least two wheezing attacks in the winter months./""Children are more vulnerable to airborne pollution for many reasons- their airways are narrower, they have markedly more needs for oxygen relative to their size, they breathe more rapidly and inhale more pollutants per kg of body weight, and they are more active outdoors,"" says Dr Gaur./""Winter smog increases hospitalisations for lung and viral infections because the inflammation (swelling) in the airways worsens both conditions, making breathing almost impossible. It's the leading cause of people needing ventilator support, the demand for which goes up during winter,"" says Dr Neeraj Jain, senior consultant, chest medicine, Ganga Ram Hospital./WIND OF MISFORTUNE/Air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk, exacerbating lung and heart diseases and causing death from stroke (25.48%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.32%), heart disease (48.6%), lung infections (6.4%), and trachea, bronchus and lung cancer (2.02%), reported the Global Burden of Disease 2013, which tracks deaths and illnesses from all causes every 10 years./The lungs also serve as a gateway for hazardous pollutants to enter the body to affect the bone, blood, and the central nervous system. Carbon monoxide, for example, hurts the cardiovascular system the most./Being stuck in heavy traffic can trigger heart attacks. Patients were more than three times likely to have been in traffic within an hour of getting a heart attack, found a study of 1,454 in Germany, with risk being highest for women, men over 65 people and people with existing heart disease./""Like smoking, pollution is a trigger of strokes and heart attacks, with long-term exposure to the tiny dirt particles increasing clotting in the blood, which can block blood vessels and trigger heart attacks, ischemic stroke and deep vein thrombosis in healthy people,"" says Dr Ravi Kasliwal, chairman, clinical and preventive cardiology, Medanta./""Since we can't stop breathing or stay cocooned in air-purified homes, what Delhi needs is strong clean-air laws and a government committed to implementing them,"" says Dr Kasliwal./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Capital's unbreathable air: No clean-up till we own up,"New Delhi, Feb. 23 -- Swine flu has been a big scare this winter. Even those suffering from common cold, cough or fever are taking a long time to recover. Many patients have suffered relapses. Others are complaining how even antibiotics have failed to provide relief. No wonder, Kiran Bedi's throat infection and Arvind Kejriwal's Crocin pill were the top trending topics on the social media during the recently-concluded Delhi elections./Doctors say rising levels of air pollution in Delhi are suppressing our immunity, making us vulnerable to lung infections, heart attacks and cancer. Studies collated by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) show that more than 3,000 premature deaths occur every year in Delhi due to air pollution-related diseases. Half of Delhi's population lives within 500 metres from arterial roads and is directly affected by vehicular pollution./In their latest report last week, CSE found that people in Delhi were exposed to 2-4 times higher levels of toxic air while travelling in public transport such as buses, metro, autos or even walking. With windows rolled up, cars may be safer for those travelling in them but their sheer numbers are asphyxiating the rest who can't afford them./The eight million vehicles on Delhi's roads are not just clogging up the city. They are taking a deathly toll. But the government's clean-up strategy has so far remained on paper, mainly because it focuses too much on long-term, capital-intensive solutions./Delhi's Metro in its 12th year is already ferrying 2.5 million passengers daily. Work on Phase 3 is underway and would give us an additional 150 kms of connectivity by the end of next year. But the city can't bank on just one system to solve its public transport woes. Metro anyway requires huge investments with Phase-3 costing us ' 45,000 crore. And it takes time to build./Experts say the bulk of the public transport services in any city have to be bus-based because it is cheaper and can be pressed into service as soon as the vehicles are procured. In Delhi, bus ridership is already 60% higher than Metro's. But to run to its full potential, the Delhi Transport Corporation needs to double its fleet and reach to ensure last-mile connectivity, improve frequency, install display boards showing routes and timetables and bring the buses under GPS surveillance./The AAP government would need ' 4,000 crore to fulfill its promise of giving Delhi 5,000 additional buses. It also needs to take a call on regulation of e-rickshaws, the best non-polluting, last-mile connectivity option available to commuters travelling on a small budget./Revival of Ring Rail, another promise in the AAP manifesto, needs to be delivered faster. Started during the 1982 Asian Games, it is the most under-utilised transport infrastructure in the capital. With a minor fare revision, cleaning up of its 23 stations, and some publicity, this could be an effective link in the city's transport system./Public transport needs to be integrated not just within Delhi, but across the NCR towns. In the absence of connectivity options, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and Noida have seen the same kind of private vehicular growth as in Delhi. The pollution levels are probably as bad in NCR towns if not worse than Delhi. But there is no proper monitoring of air quality./Delhi, of course, tracks its air pollution levels round-the-clock at over two dozen locations in the city. While one can check the real-time ambient quality on official websites, this data is not processed and converted into health advisories./Beijing, one of the world's most polluted cities, has a colour-coded smog alert system since October 2013, although the city authorities are criticised for not pressing the panic button every time they should. In the last two years, Paris has used its pollution alert effectively, opening up its public transport system to everyone for free on days the air quality worsens./Delhi needs a smog alert system that not only helps vulnerable people to take precautions but also raises awareness about the pollution levels, forcing specific and immediate action from authorities. And it doesn't cost a bomb./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

You are not safe indoors either,"New Delhi, Feb. 25 -- Ira De, 19, a thirdyear graduate student has been mildly asthmatic since she was eight. However, there were hardly any violent asthmatic attacks and the symptoms used to be mostly controlled./It was only recently when she started helping her mother in the kitchen that she experienced typical asthma symptoms./""The moment smoke would rise from the tawa (pan) while making chapattis, I would feel uneasy and within minutes wheezing would start,"" she says./Gradually, she realised she was experiencing asthma symptoms when her father lit incense sticks (aggarbatti) at home and also when she inhaled fumes from garbage dumps that would be set on fire in the morning./""All these immediately trigger breathlessness, wheezing and other symptoms. I never thought I would feel sick inside the house as my mother has always been very cautious with me and not allowed me to go out unless absolutely necessary,"" she said. De is on strong medication, especially during the change of season when her condition worsens./""Many a time, we don't realise how much pollution we face inside the house; people talk mostly about outdoor pollution but out of personal experience I can say that indoor pollution is equally hazardous,"" she says./Clearly, the risk of air pollution does not end once you step indoors. People living in poorly-ventilated homes face the added risk of indoor air pollutants from smoking, cooking fumes, suspended particulate matter, mould among others./""Indoor air- pollution is almost as bad as outdoor air pollution and it affects a healthy person as much as it affects a person who already suffers from a respiratory illness,"" said Dr Vikas Maurya, consultant, department of respiratory medicine, allergy and sleep disorder, BLK Super-Specialty Hospital./Smoking at home is the biggest health hazard, especially in poorly ventilated apartments, that not only affects the smoker but also others who are exposed to passive smoking./""Passive intake of smoke is equally harmful and the biproducts linger on curtains and other articles in the house for very long after a cigarette has been smoked. Ideally, one should smoke outside the house or in the balcony. One should keep windows open while cooking and taking showers to maintain healthy air circulation. Use an exhaust fan if windows can't be kept open. One needs to be especially careful with pets as they shed hair and leave various micro-organisms in the air, so maintaining pet hygiene is very important,"" he added./People who have to keep their doors and windows shut as their houses are located on the main road should open windows very early in the morning for about an hour to let fresh air in, advise health experts. Taking precaution is the only way out to stop developing serious respiratory or cardiac diseases./""There is a direct increase in incidence of heart disease and respiratory illness with increased exposure to air-pollution, both outdoors and indoors. There's a rapid decline in lung function and lung capacity among people who have had prolonged exposure to polluted air. It's a cause for serious concern as it could eventually turn fatal in some cases,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine, AIIMS. ""As far as possible take preventive measures and don't delay seeing a doctor if symptoms like difficulty in breathing, wheezing and persistent cough appear,"" Dr Guleria said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Toxic air puts brakes on auto, bus drivers","New Delhi, Feb. 26 -- Fifty four-year-old Rajkumar, an autorickshaw driver in the city, fell ill a few years ago. After a dozen tests and checkups he got to know that he has a black patch in his right lung and was asked to immediately stop smoking. Surprisingly, Rajkumar is not a smoker, but the doctors were not convinced./""I have never touched a bidi or a cigarette in my life. I am still undergoing treatment at Safdarjung Hospital. After the doctors were convinced that I do not smoke, they asked me to immediately quit my job as the continuous exposure to the toxic air was the reason for deterioration in my health. But how can I starve my family? This is my only source of income,"" said Rajkumar, who is the only earning member in his family of six./A recent study conducted by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) shows a common man who travels via public transport like buses, autos and Metro has the maximum exposure to the toxicity in the air of the most polluted city in the world./Doctors and pulmonary experts say that the plight of people who drive these vehicles is worse. An auto driver usually is out on the roads for eight to 14 hours and has a higher risk of falling victim to lung, heart and even neurological disorders./""A passenger at the maximum makes two to three trips in public transport but a driver is constantly out there. Especially an open vehicle like the auto increases the risk of breathing pollutants like sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and lead. Apart from increasing the possibility of fatal ailments, it also makes the driver vulnerable to cholesterol and blood pressure problems,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, head of department of medicine and sleep disorders, All India Institute of Medical Sciences./Sunita Narain, director general of CSE, which conducted the study, also agreed that the people who are always on the go like auto and truck drivers, traffic constables among others have higher risk of contracting occupational diseases./""People who are driving buses and autos have a reduced life span because of the pollution they are exposed to,"" said Narain./Another study conducted by US based Health Effects Institute and Delhi based The Energy Resources Institute revealed that at least 3,000 people in Delhi die premature deaths every year because of high exposure to air pollution./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Only 70 people fined in two years for smoking in public,"Gurgaon, Feb. 26 -- At least 70 people have been fined for smoking at public places in Gurgaon in the past two years, while hundred others continue to do so without being penalised./Despite the ban being effective since 2008, authorities in Gurgaon have fined not more than 32 people in 2013 and 35 in 2014, collecting about Rs. 2,000 in these two years./Smoking in public is a common sight and various government departments are authorised to fine offenders. However, the rule has not yet been implemented in the city. The state health department has issued 38 challan books for this purpose which sadly have remained largely unused for the past seven years, an RTI response, sought by activist JS Walia, has revealed./Interestingly, the fine amount for smoking in public places had been fixed at Rs. 200. However, the authorities seem to be lenient with offenders, fining each person just Rs. 30-35 on an average./A sum of Rs. 1,120 was collected in 2013 from 32 people who were fined. Similarly, Rs. 1,030 was collected from 35 offenders last year./""The maximum penalty for smoking in public is Rs. 200 and very often people who are caught claim to have no money. Also, in the previous meeting with the district administration, we had asked all other departments to enforce penalties as they are lenient about it,"" said Dr Pushpa Bishnoi, civil surgeon, Gurgaon./Though details were sought from 2008, since when the ban had been enforced, the health department had data only for the years 2013 and 2014./""I can only assume that there were no fines imposed for five years from 2008 to 2012,"" said JS Walia, who filed the RTI. ""It is surprising that while so many authorities are roped in to tackle the menace by a simple fine, one can still see people openly smoking.

One in five cops has respiratory problems,"New Delhi, Feb. 28 -- Traffic police officers who ensure commuter safety and security on the roads are the most susceptible to diseases caused by air pollution./Braving extreme weather conditions and inhaling all kinds of pollutants, thousands of policemen get on to the roads of the Capital daily to ensure smooth vehicular movement./A direct result of this that a number of such officers suffer from respiratory problems and heart, cancer, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders./A study on evaluation of effects of environmental pollutants on Delhi Traffic Police personnel - conducted by the Maulana Azad Medical College in March, 2012 - says one in five traffic police officers have respiratory infections./Constable Manoharlal is one of the many officers who is exposed to the city's toxic fumes daily. Manoharlal stands below the Ashram flyover - one of the busiest intersections in the city - daily for close to 12 hours, ensuring the smooth flow of vehicles across the intersection./By the end of the day, his sparkling white uniform takes on a shade of brown from the dust and the smoke that he is exposed to./""It is a tough job but we have no option,"" said Manoharlal./A study conducted by Hyderabad Police in 2014 had revealed that over 32% of their traffic staff suffer from lung disorders. Doctors and pulmonary experts said that the numbers were likely to be much higher in the capital where the number of vehicles is almost five times than that of Hyderabad./The Delhi Traffic police is a 6,000-strong unit, of which at least 30% is deployed on the roads on any given day./The force has tried introducing anti-pollution masks, which are not mandatory.

Tired? You could be anaemic without knowing it,"New Delhi, March 7 -- Have you been feeling tired and listless for no particular reason? It could be stress, depression or, most likely if you're a woman, the ubiquitous but very fixable anaemia./Stress is fairly easy to measure, you need to accept that your brain is on a multitasking overdrive and look for physiological and psychological ways to wind down. Depression, too, is usually accompanied with other signs such as sleeplessness, anxiety and mood swings, and can usually be discounted if tiredness is the only symptom./This leaves out anaemia, which usually gets missed unless it pops up in a blood test report. In people otherwise healthy, even mild anaemia can cause tiredness, headache, dizziness, fatigue and lack of concentration, with pale skin, nails and gums being the only visible and overlook-able symptoms./Anaemia affects more women than men, with pregnant women, lactating mothers and adolescent girls being at most risk. In India, three in five women have haemoglobin - the oxygen-carrying iron-containing protein in red blood cells - counts below the recommended healthy level of 13 gm/dl. So common is anaemia among women that many physicians regard 12 gm/dl as the ""Indian healthy normal.""/One in seven meet the textbook definition of ""severely anaemic"", with haemoglobin levels below 7gm/dl. Yet, very few women do anything about it. For haemoglobin below 7gm/dl, physicians in developed countries prescribe iron, vitamin B12 and folate supplementation. Some even consider blood transfusion. But not in India. Here we prefer the natural route of a few spoonfuls of honey or an apple a day, which does nothing to push up your haemoglobin counts./Low haemoglobin lowers the blood's capacity to carry oxygen to the cells and organs, leaving you feeling sluggish and tired. In acute cases, the body puts pressure on the heart to compensate for the oxygen deficiency, leading to palpitations, chest pain and aggravation of existing heart problems. Extreme anaemia over time may even enlarge the heart, which can lead to heart failure./It's an easily avoidable cause of maternal deaths. According to the National Family Health Survey 3, anaemia causes one in five pregnancy-related deaths, triples the risk of premature delivery and low-birth weight babies and increases risk of foetal death nine-fold. Anaemia during pregnancy can hurt the baby by causing irreversible brain and developmental damage./Though iron deficiency may be because of an inherited disorder (sickle-cell anaemia); digestive disorders such as Crohn's disease or Celiac disease; worm infestations; chronic dieting; the metabolic stress of pregnancy and lactation; weight loss or intestinal surgeries; certain medications or alcohol abuse; the most common cause is low dietary intake of iron, B12 and folate, which are essential for haemoglobin production in the bone marrow./A lesser known trigger is air pollution from use of biofuel, report researchers in the journal Annals of Epidemiology. This happens because carbon monoxide and other pollutions from incomplete combustion bind to and reduce the available amount of haemoglobin for oxygenation. Some toxic compounds in smoke also directly destroy red blood cells./If the deficiency is not acute, an iron-rich diet is enough to push haemoglobin levels over the recommended 13 gm/dl. The best sources are foods with a high iron content and high iron bioavailability, which means the iron in the food can be easily absorbed by the body./Haem iron - from animal sources such as red meat, chicken, liver, shrimp, oysters and eggs - is best absorbed, with 15-35% being utilised by the body as compared to the 2-10% from iron found in fortified cereals, legumes, leafy vegetables, dried peas, beans, dried apricots and raisins./Cooking in an iron pot or pan pushes up iron-content in cooked food while having vitamin C with your meals - fresh lemon or citrus fruit juice, for example - increases iron absorption from vegetarian food by making the stomach more acidic. Tea, coffee and other caffeine drinks lower absorption, so it's a good idea to say no to coffee right after dinner./Unless you are deficit - found from a simple complete blood count, which should be done once a year - don't take supplementation as an overdose may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, irritability and joint problems. Those with acute deficiency need supplementation for up to one year, so if you haven't already, consider getting your haemoglobin levels tested right away./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

It's really time to clear the air,"New Delhi, April 6 -- From ill-equipped public hospitals to shortage of doctors, India's public health system is in a comatose state, so much so that even tackling common diseases often seems like a challenge. Not surprising then that pollution-related health issues are brushed under the carpet. But statistics show that such an attitude is fraught with dangerous health consequences: Nearly 660 million people, mostly in north India, are living with annual levels of PM (particulate matter) 2.5 that exceeds national air quality standards. /These extremely fine particles are linked with increased rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease. In 2014, a WHO report confirmed India's worst fears. Without mincing words, it said that Indian cities were 'death traps' because of 'very high air pollution levels'. Apart from refusing to accept the WHO report, the government did something even more sinister: It failed to take action on a report done by the Central Pollution Control Board and the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute of Kolkata, which showed that every third child in Delhi had reduced lung function due to air pollution. The report was not even shared with the schools that participated in the study, denying them a chance to take some timely and corrective action. According to the 2014 Global Burden of Disease report, air pollution is the fifth-largest killer in India./One of the key emitters of PM is vehicular pollution but hardly anything has been done to curb such emissions. The Auto Fuel Vision and Policy 2025 report, submitted in 2014, recommended upgrading to Bharat Stage VI auto fuels by 2024. But that still remains on paper. PM is not only injurious to health but also its core - black carbon - is responsible for increasing global warming. Apart from diesel vehicles, the other sources of black carbon are biomass-based cook stoves, cook ovens and brick kilns. Earlier black carbon was considered 400 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period but the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change values put this at more than 800 times./Other than the obvious ill effects on public health, air pollution also hurts India economically. According to the World Bank's Diagnostic Assessment of Select Environmental Challenges, the cost of serious health consequences from particulate pollution is estimated at 3% of India's GDP. The rising air pollution has become a handy tool for the developed world to shift the blame for climate warming on black carbon and other short-lived climate-forcers to buy time for its own mitigation goals. Either way, it's about time that some corrective action was taken even if that means imposing a congestion tax and taxing polluting diesel vehicles./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

It cleanses the air of pollutants and makes the dust settle on the ground./It has been part of the Delhi legend. Every summer, the hot, dry wind blowing from the Thar Desert in the west would hit Delhi like a typhoon of dust. This condition would persist till the monsoon rains lashed the city. Until not too long ago, this used to be only a seasonal phenomenon./Now, you see a shroud of dust covering the skies all year round and long for a surprise shower. No matter how many rounds of dustings, it is just impossible to keep the house dirt-free. It is certainly not the seasonal desert sand we are dealing with./Already the largest urban sprawl in India, Delhi has developed an amazing appetite for the brick and mortar. The city is an unending construction project with more roads, flyovers, pavements, metro lines, shopping malls, and offices coming up every day. In residential neighbourhoods, if it is not a single storey being converted into multi-storey 'builder' flats, there is always an extra room, an extra floor being added somewhere./While it loves to build, Delhi doesn't have a plan to deal with construction waste. According to one estimate, Delhi generates at least 4,000 tonnes of construction debris every day but the sole processing plant can deal with only 10% of it - mostly the more visible pieces such as concrete blocks, discarded tiles and hardware. The rest is dumped just anywhere./Growing up in Delhi, I have rarely seen people bothering to remove the building material - sand, cement, mineralised quartzite (popularly known as the red Badarpur soil) or finer concrete - once the construction was over./Today, much of Delhi's 'earth' is made of construction dust. If you pick up a fistful, you'll see how it slips out of your hand. Those who have a green patch at home would know how sandy and gritty the top soil has become. Many just buy sacks of earth to replenish their gardens./But construction waste is not only in the earth we walk on but also the air we breathe. Last year, the civil engineering department of Jamia Millia Islamia and Central Pollution Control Board released a study on 19 construction sites in Delhi that found that areas where the air pollution index for PM10 was higher, there were more people suffering from respiratory diseases./Exposure to construction dust affects breathing and respiratory systems, and damages lung tissues. Construction workers are at risk of developing silicosis if they breathe high quantities of concrete and rock dust. Demolition sites may release dust from asbestos that is known to cause Mesothelioma cancer and is banned in more than 50 countries, but not in India./Last year, Beijing, which competes with Delhi on top of the global pollution chart, made it compulsory for all construction sites to install cameras so that authorities could assess how it was contributing to the city's smog and punish companies that were using open trucks to ferry material or carried out outdoor construction on heavily polluted days. Contractors were told to place special funds for dust control in government-controlled bank account before construction began. Since last month, Beijing has also started levying construction dust pollution fees./In Delhi, municipal laws to fine those who dump debris on public land are rarely invoked. There is zero monitoring of construction sites to check pollution. For years, the ecologically-sensitive Ridge forests and the Yamuna floodplains have been the city's favourite dumping grounds./Two years back, when the National Green Tribunal took up the matter, government agencies, including Delhi Metro and Central Public Works Department, turned out to be the biggest culprits./Already, Delhi's many ponds and water bodies have died under concrete rubble. The plan to set up more concrete-recycling plants is still gathering dust. The city, in the meantime, is gasping. It can no longer bet on a few drizzles of unseasonal rain to catch its breath./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Rich Noida can't spare 1.5 crore to clean its air,"Noida, April 7 -- Uttar Pradesh's richest city - Noida, which is touted as Uttar Pradesh's first planned industrial town, has failed to put in place ' 1.5 crore facility that can measure real-time air pollution levels every five minutes./Delhi's suburb, the New Okhla industrial development authority (NOIDA), which is state's richest industrial body with an annual budget of ' 13,000 crore has so far failed to provide updates on air pollution./As per Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board(UPPCB), the level of PM 2.5 (particulate matter) is four times higher than the prescribed limit of 60 micro grams per cubic metre in Gautam Budh Nagar on any given day. Also the limit of PM10 is double the prescribed limit of 100 micro grams per cubic metre every day, UPPCB reports said./Despite the fact that the environment ministry of the state falls under Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav himself, in the last three years the government has not sanctioned any money for an automatic monitoring station that can capture real time pollution levels./Gautam Budh Nagar had sent the proposal three years ago to Lucknow for approval and is still awaiting clearance./Out of 12 air pollution measures, Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida and Greater Noida) can only measure four. ""Levels of particulate matter - PM 2.5 and PM 10 - is so high that metrological department compares Noida, Gurgaon and Delhi with desert because dust particles in air are as high as that found in Rajasthan. The reason for high dust particle level is the construction boom and fall in green cover,"" said a senior UPPCB, requesting anonymity./According to the UP labour department, there are 4,000 underconstruction housing projects in Noida and Greater Noida thereby leading to air pollution./Particulate matter is not the only concern for Noida which has also reported high levels of poisonous nitrogen oxide fumes in the air that are going unmeasured owing to outdated machinery. PM 2.5 is more hazardous to health because it causes allergy and asthma among other diseases, said officials./The state's system for weather and pollution monitoring is still manual and the administration is not serious to put up an automatic machine, officials said./For a city just 30 years old and with a population that is one-tenth of the Capital, Noida has PM10 levels of more than 100 and PM2.5 level of over 300, says UPPCB data./Records from January 2013 to 2015 show average PM10 level of 200 micrograms per cubic metre. While the World Health Organisation's standard suggests a limit of 20 micrograms per cubic metre, the national standard is 60./Worried over the rising air pollution, UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan has directed district magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar Nagendra Prasad Singh to take measures to contain air pollution./Singh in turn has assured that he will address pollution issue./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Technical glitches hit new air monitoring system,"New Delhi, April 8 -- A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the air quality index to protect public health and catalyse pollution emergency measures in cities, technical glitches have hit the system./Of the five monitoring stations, two - Delhi College of Engineering and Income Tax Office - were sending data not good enough for computing./At 9pm, the Dwarka monitoring station and the one at Institute Of Human Behavior And Allied Sciences termed the pollution level moderate: breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. At Shadipur, it was satisfactory: minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people./Anumita Roychowdhury, expert at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, ""Even we could not access the data. To make the index effective, they have to ensure the monitoring stations are maintained properly. They have to ensure there are no data gaps when these centres don't function."" The index has been linked to the five monitoring stations run by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). ""There are some back-end issues; we are trying to set them right,"" said a CPCB official./Globally, AQI has been an effective tool to build public awareness and support for aggressive action for pollution control and to bring down daily peak pollution levels./CSE applied the new national AQI to air pollution levels since October 2014. ""We found days with poor and severe air pollution have remained consistently high during winter,"" said a CSE expert./The AQI will be used to inform people about daily air quality and to provide advisories on health consequences. It will tell how clean or polluted the air is and what associated health effects might be of concern. This can help people take precautions on 'bad air' days./The new AQI has been posted on the website of the Central Pollution Control Board. About 10 cities that have the capacity for real-time air quality monitoring are expected to be linked - a 24-hour average data will be available daily from them./AQI has been developed for six pollutants-PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"In Noida, respiratory diseases up eleven times in three years","Noida, April 9 -- Acute respiratory infections in Noida leapt 11-fold over three years because of a toxic cocktail of construction dust, emissions from vehicles and burning of garbage, experts said on Wednesday, quoting an Uttar Pradesh health survey./Ubiquitous diesel generators in almost every housing society, individual home and commercial space, which have become a necessity because of Noida's notorious power cuts, are also responsible for the high levels of pollution in the township on the outskirts of Delhi./The recently-released UP annual health survey data shows 12,675 people in a population of one lakh were suffering from acute respiratory infections in 2012-13 in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district where Noida is located, up from 1,073 in 2010-11. Ghaziabad saw a seven-fold increase during the same period./""There is no proper landfill site in Ghaziabad and Noida. We are taking action and have directed authorities for proper garbage disposal. Improper medical waste disposal was also contributing to air pollution and spreading infections,"" said Paras Nath of the state pollution control board./He added that constructionrelated pollution was higher in Noida than Ghaziabad./The UP report came amid a ra ging debate over the dang erous air quality in Delhi where pollution levels have jumped beyond World Health Organization limits in the past few years largely because of vehicular emissions, prompting green activists to push for a check on cars and commercial vehicles that spout toxic fumes./Central Pollution Control Board figures show PM2.5, or extremely fine particulate matter that goes deep inside our lungs, is 21 times the permissible limit while extremely harmful nitrogen oxide levels have jumped to 4.5 times the acceptable limit./Doctors said air pollution was the prime cause of respiratory tract infections in Noida. ""The air around Noida and Ghaziabad has a lot of dust because of construction activities. Besides, garbage and polythene bags are being burnt openly and the smoke is a health hazard. Vehicular emission is a major culprit, too,"" said Dr Deepak Talwar, chairman, Metro Respiratory Centre at Metro Group of Hospitals, Noida./Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad blamed builders for the air pollution in Noida. ""They are violating norms... heaps of soil at construction sites make the air dusty, causing respiratory infections. Builders are required to spray water regularly on loose soil, but they don't do that.""/The Noida Authority said notices had been sent to several builders. ""We also forward complaints to the environment ministry ... work at projects is allowed only after a builder follows all the norms,"" said Manoj Rai, officer on special duty, Noida Authority./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"A day after ban, cops crack down, seize 96 vehicles","New Delhi, April 9 -- A day after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered diesel vehicles over 10 years old off Delhi-NCR roads, the traffic police impounded 96 such vehicles in a crackdown./In the backdrop of alarming reports about worsening air quality in Delhi, the NGT order - aimed to reduce air pollution - was widely discussed on social networking sites, making it one of the topmost trends on Twitter./Special commissioner of police (Traffic) Muktesh Chander said that officers of the rank of DCPs and ACPs were stationed at various entry points to check vehicles. ""We will have a special drive on the NGT order till midnight. The vehicles will be parked at a yard in the Burari RTO office,"" he said./On Wednesday evening, the air quality index (AQI) across the city showed alarming levels of unhealthy air. The AQI at Dwarka read 179 - moderate (breathing discomfort to those with asthma, lung and heart diseases). At Shahadra, the AQI was again moderate with a reading of 145. The figures for the other three centres were not updated on the government's official website./On Wednesday evening, senior traffic police officers held a meeting at the police headquarters, chalking out plans to effectively implement the order. After the meeting, traffic police personnel across the city were ordered to go to the border areas and stop the entry of such vehicles./The implementation drive began very slowly on Wednesday morning. When HT visited the borders across the city, not a single traffic police officer could be seen implementing the order. In fact, till late afternoon, trucks entering Delhi continued to enter the city without being stopped./At every border, the usual barricades of the Haryana and the Delhi Police were placed on the roads but drivers carefully cut across the unmanned police barricades. A few employees at the toll plaza said they had heard of the order on television but were yet to see any officer acting on it./By Wednesday night, the scene was different. Traffic inspectors were spotted at all bordering areas checking the age of diesel vehicles. Police said that they were checking all diesel vehicles and not just commercial ones./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Govt says ban violates motor vehicle laws, may move SC","New Delhi, April 11 -- The Centre plans to challenge in the Supreme Court the recent ban on diesel vehicles older than 10 years in Delhi-NCR, saying the green tribunal's order was anticonsumer and violated provisions of the motor vehicles act./The Centre's proposal came at a time when the National Green Tribunal (NGT) refused a request Friday to postpone its recent order banning old polluting vehicles by six months. The tribunal noted that diesel-burning vehicles have been the main contributor to Delhi's air pollution, which has reached such dangerous levels that doctors were finding that a person's lungs had started to behave like that of a smoker by the age of 35./But a government official argued that a blanket ban could trigger a domino effect as it would not only violate a consumer's rights but also take off the roads vehicles that meet fitness standards and emission norms./""We are looking into the whole issue,"" road transport secretary Vijay Chhibber said./Officials pointed out that a diesel lorry, bus or car's road worthiness has to be considered in accordance with rules under motor vehicles act. ""If a vehicle is fit and meets emission norms even if has completed 10 years, then banning it would violate provisions of the law. A vehicle might be 10 years old but its engine could be in top condition because it has run only a few thousand kilometres,"" a senior government official said./The second point was consumer rights. ""Most states levy a lifetime road tax on new vehicles. Some states levy a road tax for 15 years. Banning a vehicle after 10 years will violate a consumer's right because he has paid tax for 15 years. Controlling pollution is a complex issue and is dependent on a number of factors, including fuel quality. These aspects should be factored in before banning vehicles,"" the official said./The Centre could also highlight in its petition how the ban could hit essential services in Delhi. ""Delhi gets most of its supplies ... food, vegetables, goods or services from outside. The majority of these goods and services are transported by diesel-run transport vehicles,"" the official said./The Delhi government on Friday put a similar argument before the green tribunal in its appeal for six months to implement the order. The counsel said most services in the national capital depend on diesel vehicles older than 10 years, including Delhi Jal Board water tankers, milk vans, fire engines and MCD garbage disposal trucks./But the tribunal remained firm. ""We understand you can't take off 1 lakh vehicles off the road in one day. Such an order has limitations but we want to see willingness to implement it. We are prepared to accommodate government or private concerns provided they intend to follow the order.""/As the Centre and Delhi government scrambled for a solution, the All India Motor Transport Congress has called a strike from April 13, saying no diesel vehicle would enter Delhi until the ban is reversed. The strike could have far-reaching consequences because the association represents 93 lakh truckers and 50 lakh bus and tour operators./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Slow poision: Hold your breath, the air in Mumbai is toxic","umbai, April 13 -- Four years ago, Ratilal Khandelwal moved from his home near a textile factory in Bhiwandi - where he had lived for 15 years - to Vile Parle. He had just been diagnosed with lung failure./His doctor told him the air in his locality was to be blamed for his illness, and he would have to move to a place with cleaner air, if he wanted to prolong his life./""Doctors told me I had bronchitis from breathing the unclean air around my residence. I was forced to move somewhere with better air quality for the sake of my children, so they would not have to suffer like I did,"" said 48-year-old Khandelwal./Khandelwal moved to breathe cleaner air; but most people living in cities and towns in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region don't have that option. Khandelwal's doctor, Sanjeev Mehta, who is a pulmonologist at Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, said, ""During his stay at Bhiwandi, Khandelwal had repeated attacks of bronchitis and had to keep taking steroids and antibiotics to stop the recurrence of cough and phlegm. After moving out of the place, he is doing much better, and using simple inhalers now.""/The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB)'s Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AAQMSs) measure three air-quality parameters: oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), which is a mixture of minute particles of dust, soot, chemicals, organic substances and other pollutants./An analysis of pollution data for Mumbai in the past one year shows that the city's air quality reached dangerous levels on many days. On June 23, 2014, the levels of RSPM recorded at MPCB's Sion station touched 390 unit micrograms/cubic metre (micro gram/m3). On December 31, 2014 and January 1, 2015 the levels of RSPM were 370 micro gram/m3 and 379 micro gram/m3 respectively. While RSPM levels between 0-100 micro gram/m3 is indicated as 'good' or safe, anything more than 150 micro gram/m3 is considered 'poor.'/The highest level of oxides of nitrogen was observed on September 28, 2014, at 208 micro gram/m3. The acceptable limits for both sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen are 0-80 micro gram/m3. Anything beyond 368 micro gram/m3 for sulphur dioxide, and 181 micro gram/m3 for oxides of nitrogen, is considered 'poor'./According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), a decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels in residential areas, due to the introduction of clean fuel standards, use of LPG instead of diesel in certain vehicles, and de-industrialisation in the city. But levels of RSPM, which can pass through the body's air filtration system to seep into the lungs, has been growing as a result of the increasing number of vehicles, the fine dust released during construction activity, illegal and open burning of fuel and wastes, and combustion of unclean fuel./SC Kollur, scientific officer, MPCB, said, ""There are a variety of reasons due to which levels of RSPM and oxides of nitrogen increased. Specifically, all the dust coming from road construction or road digging around the station at Sion on these days could have affected the air quality. The crushed powder used for road construction is one of the main causes of poor air quality.""/Within the city, there are variations in pollution levels due to geographic reasons. In general, data from MPCB's Bandra station have shown slightly lower levels of RSPM, compared to Sion. On November 28 and 29 last year, the station in Bandra recorded its highest RSPM levels, at 215 micro gram/m3 and 224 micro gram/m3 respectively. ""During this period, a new flyover was coming up at Mazgaon Tadwadi near Kalanagar, Bandra (East). Dust was released from the construction site for the flyover, and most of the traffic was diverted on these days, causing a lot of vehicular emission,"" said Kollur./According to the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Department, there are seven lakh cars on the road in Mumbai, and private vehicle ownership is encouraged by authorities by adding flyovers and expressways, instead of developing mass rapid transit systems. The number of private vehicles has grown by 57% in the past eight years, compared to a 23% increase in public buses./Air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of RSPM during monsoon months, when the rains wash away suspended pollutants in the air. The lowest level of RSPM to be measured in the past year at Sion was 36 micro gram/m3, on August 29, while that in Bandra was 30 micro gram/m3, recorded on July 11./Philip Earis, a scientist and resident of Bandra, said, ""This is possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months, possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. It can be said that Mumbai's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of the monsoon.""/While Delhi was termed the most polluted city in the world by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in its 2014 study, environmentalists are of the belief that Mumbai will match the Capital's abysmal pollution standards soon enough. Environmentalist Stalin D said, ""Concrete structures are built in such a way that the air carrying pollutants get trapped within the city. We are responsible for creating a hot and polluted island with excessive construction, garbage emitting smoke from dumps, digging up of roads. The list goes on. We are on our way to being called the next most polluted city.""/What is air pollution?/According to the Maharshtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB)website, air pollution is caused mainly by transportation, fuel combustion in stationary sources, burning of fossil fuels like coal, wood, dry grass, and construction activity. Motor vehicles produce high levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) and Nitrogen oxides (NOx). Construction activities, bad roads and burning of fossil fuels are responsible for dust (particulate matter) pollution. Residential and commercial activities also contribute to air pollution./Lower levels of sulphur dioxide/According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), a decline has been observed in sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels in residential areas of many cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhopal in the last few years. The decreasing levels may be attributed to the introduction of clean fuel standards and use of LPG in certain vehicles, and a decline in industries in big cities./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution comes with a price tag in Mumbai,"umbai, April 14 -- Air pollution extracts a heavy price - both in terms of health and money. A study published by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) in 2011 put a price tag on air pollution in Mumbai./Pushpa Trivedi, a professor at the department of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT-B, and an author of the study, said, ""Increase in pollutants leads to an additional burden of cases, and a monetary burden on the patients.""/Trivedi estimated the total cost of treatment for diseases triggered by air pollution in Mumbai was set to go up from Rs 1,349.42 crore in 2008 to Rs 1,658.20 crore in 2015./A 50 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3) increase in NO2 (nitrogen dioxide, largely released by the burning of fuel) led to heath complications, the treatment of which cost Rs888.67 crore in 2008, said Trivedi. The cost was expected to rise to Rs1,090.35 crore in 2015. ""The study showed that the burden of diseases caused by 50ug/m3 increase in PM10 (particulate matter 10 - see box) was estimated to rise from Rs460.75 crore in 2008 to Rs567.84 crore in 2015,"" said Trivedi./""Pollution extracts a heavy price from affected individuals, society and the government. During our study, we found many patients were being hospitalised twice or thrice a year because of lung complications. Public hospitals are few in number and crowded, and we found 70% people opting for treatment at private clinics,"" said Archana Patankar, co-author of the doctoral study./According to a 2014 World Health Organisation (WHO) report, the average PM10 level was 136 ug/m3 in Mumbai, compared to 121 ug/m3 in Beijing. The Central Pollution Control Board says the safe limit for PM10 is 100 ug/m3. The average PM10 level in the world is 71ug/m3, according to a WHO report./Doctors in Mumbai said over a period of five years, the number of patients with allergic bronchitis have increased by 30-40%. ""Many times, I have asked my patients to leave the city as a treatment. They go to their village for a few days and their cough disappears. Such cases are a result of increased pollution levels,"" said Dr Shahid Barmare, physician, Kohinoor Hospital, Kurla./Dr Barmare said people who travel in open vehicles such as autos and motorcycles have a higher exposure to pollutants and develop allergic bronchitis because they inhale more particulate matter./Doctors said people who have existing lung conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder are the worst affected. Higher pollutant levels in the city can trigger allergic rhinitis - which causes a burning sensation in the eyes and increases the risk of heart conditions and cancer, said doctors. Recently, the WHO identified outdoor air pollution as a carcinogenic - something that causes cancer - just like tobacco./HT found that patients with lung complications spend between Rs 10,000 and Rs 2-lakh annually for treatment, depending on the severity of the conditions and the frequency of hospitalisation. Thane resident Shruti Mani, 23, for instance, spends Rs 24,000 on her treatment annually. ""I visit the doctor twice a month. I am trying out alternative medication,"" said Mani, who noticed she has more asthma attacks during Diwali, when air pollution levels go up./What is more worrying is the rise in number of people complaining of respiratory infections that rarely respond to common medicines. ""While their lung function test results are normal, their condition does not seem to improve with regular medication. Such respiratory distress could be related to higher exposure to toxic gases inhaled,"" said Dr Samir Garde, pulmonologist, Global Hospital, Parel./Dr Pratit Samdani, physician, Breach Candy Hospital, said, ""Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) also carries virus and bacteria, which infect the lungs and cause lung infections.""/Doctors said people should avoid walking in polluted areas. They should also avoid taking early morning and evening walks, as the pollutants are closer to the ground. ""I always ask my patients to avoid running on the Marine Drive, as they are inhaling vehicular emission at a much faster rate when they are running,"" said Dr Rohini Chowghule from the Indian Institute of Environmental Medicine and a senior chest specialist./Outdoor air pollution is a carcinogen: WHO study/* Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting people in developed and developing countries alike./* The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 80% of premature deaths related to outdoor air pollution were caused by ischaemic heart diseases and strokes, while 14% of the premature deaths were caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or acute lower respiratory infections; 6% of the deaths were caused by lung cancer./* A 2013 assessment by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that outdoor air pollution is carcinogenic to humans, with the particulate matter component of air pollution most closely associated with increased cancer incidence, especially cancer of the lung./* This means air pollution is a human carcinogen, similar to tobacco smoke, asbestos and arsenic - a leading cause of cancer deaths globally./* Health experts have known for years that air pollution increases the risk of a wide range of ailments, including respiratory problems and heart disease. Some compounds in the air we breathe, such as diesel exhaust, have already been deemed cancer-causing. But the 2013 study was the first time the organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified air pollution in its entirety as a cause of cancer./# Health impact of specific air pollutants:/Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)/Emission source: VOCs are a large group of carbon-based chemicals that easily evaporate at room temperature. While most people can smell high levels of some VOCs, other VOCs have no odour. Smell does not indicate the level of risk posed by the inhalation of this group of chemicals. There are thousands of different VOCs produced and used in our daily lives./Health hazards: VOCs can cause irritation of the eye, nose and throat. In severe cases, there may be headaches, nausea, and loss of coordination. In the longer run, some of them are suspected to cause damage to the liver and other parts of the body./Formaldehyde/Emission Source: It is an organic chemical that is present in the environment. Formaldehyde is also found in chemicals, household products, glues, permanent press fabrics, paper product coating, fibre boards and plywood./Health hazards: Exposure causes irritation to the eyes, nose and may cause allergies in some people./Lead/Source: The most common cause of lead poisoning is dust and chips from old paint. However, there are non-paint sources, though less common, like soil and water./Health hazards: Prolonged exposure can cause damage to the nervous system, digestive system, and in some cases, cause cancer. It is especially hazardous to small children./Ozone/Sources: Unlike other pollutants, ozone is not emitted directly into the air by specific sources. Ozone is created by sunlight acting on oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and VOCs in the air. Some of the common sources include gasoline vapours, chemical solvents, combustion products of fuels. Emissions of NOx and VOC from motor vehicles and stationary sources can be carried hundreds of miles from their origin, and result in high ozone concentration over very large regions./Health hazards: Exposure to this gas makes our eyes itch, burn, and water and it has also been associated with increase in respiratory disorders such as asthma. It lowers our resistance to colds and pneumonia./Oxides of Nitrogen/Emission sources: Burning of fossil fuel like coal and wood./Health hazards: This gas can make children susceptible to respiratory diseases in the winters./Carbon Monoxide (CO)/Emission source: Higher levels of CO generally occur in areas with heavy traffic congestion. Other sources of CO emissions include industrial processes (such as metal processing and chemical manufacturing), residential wood burning, and natural sources such as forest fires. Wood stoves, gas stoves, cigarette smoke, and heaters are indoor sources of CO./Health hazards: CO combines with haemoglobin to decrease the amount of oxygen that enters our blood through our lungs. It binds with other blood proteins and causes changes in the functioning of organs such as the brain and the cardiovascular system, and also in a developing foetus. It can impair our concentration, slow our reflexes, and make us confused and sleepy./Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)/Source: The main source of the gas is industrial activity in which materials that contain sulphur are processed, like the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas. In addition, industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulphur can be important sources of sulphur dioxide./Health hazards: SO2 can oxidise and form sulphuric acid mist. SO2 in the air leads to diseases of the lung and other cause wheezing and shortness of breath. Long-term effects are more difficult to ascertain, as SO2 exposure is often combined with that of SPM (suspended particulate matter)./Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM)/Emission source: SPM consists of dust, chemicals, mist, soot and organic substances. The main chemical component of SPM, which is of major concern, is lead, others being nickel, arsenic, and chemicals present in diesel exhaust.

"What's making Mumbai gasp for air? Answer: Construction, vehicular emission, road work","umbai, April 14 -- For the past few years, residents of buildings surrounding a bakery at Bhalerao Marg, between Girgaum and Charni Road, have been choked by thick black smoke from the wood-burning ovens, which are used five times a day./Hemant Sukhathankar, a resident of a building opposite the bakery, said the sea breeze pushes the smoke inside his home, forcing him to keep doors and windows shut. ""It makes breathing difficult, and residents of the area are suffering.""/Burning of fuel, garbage and wood, vehicular emissions due to traffic congestion, dust from construction activity and road development are releasing toxic pollutants into the air, that Mumbaiites inhale every day. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last conducted a large-scale assessment of pollution levels across the country, including Mumbai, four years ago. There has been no data since then, by way of an annual report by either the CPCB or the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB)./The most dangerous components in polluted air are Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), including tiny particles called Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), which can be inhaled into the lungs. Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), which is an important constituent of RSPM, is released by automobiles, power generation plants and road work equipment. Another hazardous component is Carbon Monoxide (CO) which is released by combustion engines. The gas reacts with haemoglobin in the blood, reducing its capacity to carry oxygen./According to the Air Quality Assessment, Emission Inventory Studies in Mumbai conducted in 2010-11 by the CPCB and the National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI), bakeries emitted 11,384 tonnes of Carbon Monoxide (CO) into Mumbai's air in the year of the study. Open burning emitted 2,292 tonnes of the gas, while burning of garbage at landfills released another 9,082 tonnes./The study found that annually, particulate matter (PM) emissions were the highest from roads that were under construction, with 4,761.4 tonnes of dust being released from them, followed by that from paved roads, with 3,163 tonnes being released.

Mumbai: 'We need source-wise mitigation of sources of pollutants',"umbai, April 15 -- Sharad Gokhale, professor of environmental engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, specialises in the study of urban air pollution and environmental noise. He spoke to HT about the role of citizens and the state in reducing air pollution levels./What can people do to protect themselves from air pollution involving dust from construction sites and pavements of roads?/We need source-wise mitigation of different sources of pollutants in Mumbai. A construction site should be enclosed with a cloth or metal screen to prevent dust generated from blowing out of the site. During the clearing of the site, water should be sprinkled to reduce dust./Sidewalks are usually not paved or tiled, and become another important source of dust, which is re-suspended when a vehicle passes. Open burning of tyres and other solid waste should be banned. People need to use bus transport whenever possible and adopt car-pooling. Authorities have to make public transport adequate, comfortable and accessible. To encourage walkers and cyclists, sidewalks need to be safer./Large quantities of pollutants are generated from vehicular emissions due to traffic congestion and crowded parking spaces. What can be done to reduce this problem?/An effective traffic flow management plan can reduce urban air pollution by 15-20%, as traffic speed, frequent start-stop often contribute to more emissions. It is necessary to make traffic flow smooth by minimising interruptions./There is no check on the adulteration of fuel. Cleaner technologies have advanced and less polluting fuels are being sought by policy makers, but fuel adulteration too is bad for air quality. Multi-layer parking spaces near urban centres and banning entry of cars in main urban centres would be the best option. People should also obey speed limits, use cruise control, turn off engines at traffic lights, junctions./What are the primary causes of indoor air pollution at workplaces or residential areas, and their remedies?/We spend most of our time indoors. According to the global burden of disease report, indoor air pollution is ranked the third major cause of deaths. There are sources of pollutants indoors such as paints, used furniture, house-cleaning detergents, cooking and smoking./Certain lifestyle related practices are taking a toll on our health. Nowadays, houses are painted with sprayers instead of brushes, with particles from paints becoming airborne. In offices, replacing old equipment with new ones can reduce ozone levels./Planting trees on both sides of the road arrests pollution significantly. A specific crown size and height in trees can manipulate the dispersion of air pollutants within traffic corridors, to help reduce exposure to air pollutants./Can you give us an example of a city that has adopted unique measures to save citizens from bad air quality?/There is no city where a specific action has changed the pollution scenario drastically. A few cities in the world are regarded as clean and better despite being populated and industrialised, such as Honolulu in the USA or Calgary in Canada, or Singapore. They have adopted use of public transport, well-planned infrastructure, enforcement against smoky vehicles, tightening of air quality standards, over the years. They have also adopted serious mass awareness programmes about the causes of air pollution and its effect on our children and elderly people./What according to you is lacking in the endeavours of state government bodies that calculate RSPM, NOx and SO2?/These bodies need to take greater responsibility than mere monitoring of air pollutants and uploading information on websites. A special cell needs to be introduced for dealing with vehicular pollution in urban centres. They can identify the attainment and non-attainment areas, hotspots, and issue a public warning of harmful effects of air pollution and what people should do./Technological solutions may take a while, but by involving people, the state pollution control board can address this issue.

Pollution check for Mumbai: What you can do to clear the air around you?,"umbai, April 15 -- Air pollution is among the biggest health risks in the world, says the World Health Organisation. Though the problem needs government and community intervention on an emergency footing, Mumbaiites have started taking baby steps in their struggle to check air pollution./With traffic congestion and choked parking spaces releasing large quantities of pollutants into the air, environmentalists said citizens should familiarise themselves with the city's bus and train routes, and start replacing individual car commutes with car-pooling or bus trips, at least once a week./While car pools are quite popular in Europe and the United States of America, they are gradually catching on in cities such as Mumbai./In 2009, Vinod Bhatia started a car-pooling service from his Kandivli residence to Andheri and Powai. In addition to reducing air pollution by taking a few cars off the road, he saves 75% on fuel cost. ""I started a car pool service with four other Kandivli residents to get to work. Car-pooling brings down traffic congestion, accidents and most importantly, pollution levels,"" said Bhatia, a travel agent, who now spends Rs60 every day for 45km, as compared to the earlier Rs300./One of the simplest ways to bring down pollution, according to environmentalists, is to invest in efficient public transport. Cycling or walking to locations which would take only five minutes by car is another alternative that will help improve air quality./""No matter how fuel-efficient your car is, it will emit some amount of pollutants. If we consciously opt for public transport, it will reduce both pollution and traffic,"" said Gautam Kirtane, research fellow, Observer Research Foundation, a city-based think tank./Father Savio Silveira, director of the not-for-profit organisation Greenline, said, ""If the government provides good public transport, people will happily use it.""/Dust from road and building construction across the city accounts for high levels of particulate matter that is responsible for respiratory illnesses such as asthma and bronchitis. Mumbai is in the midst of a construction boom, with old buildings being demolished to make way for high-rises./""Half the pollution will be reduced if contractors only spray water before and during the demolition of a building. Similar to those used abroad, vacuum machines that absorb dust can also be used,"" said professor Arnab Bhattacharya, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research./While most people are aware of outdoor pollutants, there is very little awareness about the contaminants released inside the house. Environmentalists pointed out that pollutants cause as much respiratory problems indoors as they do outdoors. ""Indoor air pollutants released from air fresheners, furniture containing formaldehyde and various household cleaners generate toxic fumes. Cutting marble, granite or aluminium should not be done at home,"" said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation./Citizens are also looking at electrical equipment to protect themselves from the most lethal pollutants such as Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), which is a mix of soot, chemicals and organic substances that can be inhaled into the lungs./While the recent fire at the Mulund dumping ground has been doused, residents unwilling to inhale toxic fumes from the frequent fires at the site have started installing air purifiers./""We have advised patients living close to the dumping ground to keep air purifiers on, especially at night, as breathing is very shallow and can affect the lungs,"" said Dr Vinay Gopalani, resident of Hari Om Nagar and a dermatologist. An air purifier is a device that removes contaminants such as dust, smoke and pollen from the air, and is said to be beneficial to those suffering from allergy and asthma./While some city residents believe increasing green spaces translates to decreasing air pollution, environmentalist Rishi Aggarwal said, ""We need to politicise the issue since we pay taxes and we need to get its worth. While there is little that citizens can do, the 'chalta hain' attitude of the municipal corporation must not be tolerated.""/# What the doctor ordered:/* Avoid travelling during peak traffic hours/* Avoid using insect and mosquito repellents/* Switch off the car ignition when it's not in use (even at traffic signals)/* Don't burn waste, leaves, paper and plastic/* Use masks whenever there is excessive dust in the air/* Close windows if construction work is underway nearby/* Participate in awareness programmes on air pollution/* Undergo lung function tests on a regular basis/~Medical advice from Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist (chest specialist), Lilavati Hospital in Bandra/--> Ways to reduce air pollution/# At home/* Turn off electrical and electronic appliances when they are not in use. Also, recycle paper, plastic, glass bottles, cardboard and aluminium cans. This helps conserve energy and reduce emission from coal-based power plants/* Plant trees, as they improve the air quality. Trees provide shade and filter, absorb and block pollutants/* Use solar lighting, or connect your outdoor lights to a timer/*Test your home for high levels of radon, a dangerous radioactive gas that is odourless and tasteless/* Do not smoke indoors/# Buy smart:/* Buy energy efficient appliances/* Choose efficient, low-polluting models of vehicles/* Choose products with less packaging, or packaging that is reusable/* Shop with a cloth bag instead of taking paper and plastic bags from shopkeepers/* Buy rechargeable batteries for devices that are used frequently/# Drive wise:/* While travelling long distances, plan your trips so as to save fuel/* Keep tyres fully inflated and aligned/* During summers, fill up the fuel tank during cooler evening hours, to cut down on evaporation. Avoid spilling petrol or diesel/* When possible, use public transport, walk, or ride a cycle/* Regularly tune the car engine and carry out maintenance checks/* Report smoking vehicles in your vicinity/* Join a car pool or van pool to get to work/# For your health/Look for regular updates on air quality in your city and report polluting activity such as burning of waste, to pollution control agencies. Check daily air quality forecasts provided by the US Consulate General, on their website (/<a href=""http://mumbai.usconsulate.gov/airqualitydataemb.html"">http://mumbai.usconsulate.gov/airqualitydataemb.html</a>/)./The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board website (/<a href=""http://mpcb.gov.in/"">http://mpcb.gov.in/</a>/) also provides data on major pollutants in your city. Mumbai will be soon getting an Air Quality Index as part of the national air quality index launched by the Prime Minister. AQI will be an important standardised way to measure air quality consistently, allowing direct comparisons with cities across the world./# Use an air purifier:/* Air purifiers remove pollutants from the air. These instruments are said to be beneficial to those suffering from allergy and asthma. Dust, foul smell, pollen, pet dander, mould spores, smoke particles, dust mite faeces, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can act as allergens/* Residents of Hari Om Nagar, which close to the Mulund dumping yard, have started using air purifiers to avoid inhaling toxic smoke released from burning plastic at the dumping ground./# Say no to firecrackers:/* Firecrackers contain poisonous chemicals such as like carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and small quantities of heavy metals, which give the fireworks their colour./* Sumaira Abdulali, environmentalist, Awaaz Foundation said, ""Do not use firecrackers that produce excessive smoke, or without checking their chemical composition. Use firecrackers only in clear areas where there is no risk of accidentally burning garbage, including plastic and thermocol.""/* Dr Ujwala Rajendra Patil, 38, was diagnosed with bronchitis at a very young age. Every Diwali, she makes it a point to shut all doors and windows of her house. ""Due to throat irritation and persistent cough, my family avoids buying crackers,"" said Dr Patil, a Thane resident. ""The use of firecrackers during the festive season of Dussehra and Diwali pose health hazards for people suffering from asthma, bronchitis and other breathing disorders.""/# Sensor-based monitoring system:/* A sensor based monitoring system is a low-cost instrument, which can be used to calculate the air quality at different different areas, within a radius of three kilometres around the sensor. Designed by students at the University of Newcastle along with a Delhi based company, the instrument is available in India for Rs10,000 to Rs15,000./* Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, National Environment Engineering Research Institute, said, ""Different cities across the world are using such small instruments by placing them on top of light poles. People in Beijing have started monitoring the areas around their homes to check the air quality.""/* The system comprises two sensors. A chemical gas sensor measures the concentration of gases such as ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds. The optical gas sensor measures the adsorption of light by the gases, while light scattering is used to measure fine particulate matter such as PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micron) and PM10./# Indoor air quality monitoring instrument:/* Indoor air quality monitoring instruments measure temperature, relative humidity, outdoor air calculations, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and air-borne particles. These factors are some of the primary components that help measure the occupants' comfort level./* In addition to an antenna that provides the air quality readings, the instrument has different buttons to select which kind of gas or pollutant is to be measured./# Quotes:/We must plant more trees. This is the simplest of things that we can do to maintain pollution levels./~ Gautam Kirtane, research fellow, Observer Research Foundation/Ensure your car's PUC (Pollution Under Control) certification is up to date and complain if you see any vehicle producing excessive exhaust fumes./~ Sumaira Abdulali, environmentalist, Awaaz Foundation/Air conditioners (ACs) are a major cause for concern.

Is the air in your home clean?,"Lucknow, April 16 -- The launch of air quality index by Prime Minister narendra Modi has once again highlighted the problem of the ever increasing air pollution in India. And the major cause of concern is that apart from outdoor pollution, the air quality within the confines of one's house is also poor./Alfred Lawrence, assistant professor, department of chemistry, Isabella Thoburn College conducted a study on indoor air quality of urban Lucknow homes for a period of two years--- 2012-2014. The study highlighted that indoor pollution was a common phenomenon in houses, though people remained unaware of it./Homes from prime locations in areas like Chowk, Rajajipuram, Alambagh, Balag anj, Muftig anj, LDA Colony, Bakshi Ka Talab, Triveni Nagar, Gomti Nagar, Indira Nagar, Munshipulia, Jankipuram and Mahanagar were randomly selected and monitored for an entire day to assess major air pollutants like residual suspended particulate matter (RSPM), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). In all the selected sites, RSPM exceeded the threshold limits./""According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), particulate matter (PM) affects more people than any other air pollutant. Even low concentrations of particulate matter can lead to drastic effects on human health. Several metals are also associated with particulate matter making it deleterious,"" said Alfred, quoting his study./Presence of some of the major heavy metals, namely iron, zinc, copper, lead, manganese and cromium associated with particulate matter (PM10) was also monitored. ""It was found that sampling sites located in Alambagh had the highest concentration of all metals and Mahanagar had the lowest concentration,"" he said./""Air quality index (AQI) for indoor samples was also calculated and the highest values were recorded in Alambagh (209) and Chowk (302),"" said Alfred./A survey through a questionnaire was conducted under the guidance of doctors from the top medical institutes of the city to get an idea about the health-related problems of the people. ""The results were quite alarming, as symptoms of acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), headache, depression and dizziness were prevalent among the urban dwellers,"" said Alfred. Approximately 46% of urban people were suffering from one or the other respiratory infection. What was more shocking was that about half of the sampled population was unaware about the health effects of indoor air pollution, indicating the urgent need for awareness programmes. Those who were sensitive to the hazards of indoor air pollution had inadequate knowledge about the broad spectrum of sources like furnishing materials, moulds and bacteria from dampness, animal hair and danders, solvents used in cleansing, paints, building material, plastics, carpets and perfumes, he added./It was found during the study that the common perception associated with indoor sources of pollution was confined to smoke originating from household activities like cooking, warming purposes, mosquito coils, incense burning during religious activities and diesel generators. As for the preventive measures, the sampled population had a vague idea about the importance of good ventilation./""The the bitter fact is that if we do not have cross-ventilation, there will only be infiltration of harmful pollutants from outdoors,"" said Alfred./The questionnaire results also gave a broad overview of the living standards of urban Lucknowites, especially the choice of fuel, as burning of fuel in any form largely releases various kinds of unburned or waste products in the environment as particulate matter./""While surveying the houses it was observed that though people were keen on plantation, the plants were mainly ornamental or artificial.

Delhi's bridge to cleaner air 2 years away,"Gurgaon, April 19 -- For Delhi, enveloped in a haze of exhaust fumes and mired in snarls caused by several thousand trucks passing by daily, a bridge over the Yamuna might just be the answer./This proposed bridge linking the NCR towns of Faridabad and Greater Noida - to be ready in two years - would take the entire truck load from Gurgaon and Faridabad, freeing up the city's congested roads. It would ease traffic in the Haryana border areas of Kapashera, Sirhaul and Badarpur and get rid of perennial jams on Mathura Road and Kalindi Kunj on the Noida side./Over 50,000 trucks enter the Capital every night, according to Muktesh Chander, special CP, Delhi Traffic Police. All of them run on diesel and are a major contributor to air pollution in Delhi - which surpassed Beijing as the city with the worst air in WHO's latest report./In a bid to control growing vehicular pollution, the National Green Tribunal recently ordered all diesel vehicles, including trucks, over 10 years old off the roads of Delhi and the National Capital Region./The Centre-sponsored 24km four-lane road over the Yamuna will be built at a cost of 162 crore and has been approved by Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari. A detailed project report will be ready by the month-end, said Dilbagh Singh Dhanda, PWD Faridabad executive engineer./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Notice to UP govt over ceramic units that are polluting NCR,"Noida, April 21 -- The National Green Tribunal on Monday issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government for allowing ceramic units that are causing air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR)./The tribunal has directed the UP government to file its reply on a petition that demands a ban on these polluting ceramic units that allegedly operate without requisite environmental clearances./Jai Hind NGO in its petition said that nearly 500 ceramic units do not have environmental clearances in Bulandshahr district's Khurja town located adjoining Greater Noida region. Khurja is part of Gautam Budh Nagar parliamentary constituency./Justice UD Salvi bench issued notice to the UP chief secretary, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Bulandshahr district magistrate and others./The NGT directed the authorities concerned to file their replies by May 11./""These ceramic units are causing air pollution in Khurja, Bulandshahr and Greater Noida among other nearby NCR cities because they are functional without consent to establish (CTE) or consent to operate (CTO), which is mandatorily to be obtained from the UPPCB,"" said Binod Prasad of Jai Hind./The NGO in its petition said cases of respiratory diseases, including asthma, skin infections, bronchitis and allergy among others are rampant in Khurja and nearby areas./""Because of poor power supply in Khurja, the ceramic industry is dependent on diesel, kerosene and burning of coal (in kilns) in the area. On top of it, no environmental norm is adhered to in Khurja, which is only 90 km away from Delhi. These industries are causing pollution so much so that it affects Delhi's air too,"" said Gaurav Kumar Bansal on behalf of NGO Jai Hind./On the other hand, UP govt officials said Khurja's pottery business was estimated to be of ' 100 crores annually and 30% comes from the export of ceramic products./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Poor monsoon may worsen pollution,"New Delhi, April 24 -- The weather office's forecast of a weak monsoon this year could lead to a spike in air pollution in many Indian cities, including Delhi and its suburbs, for a second straight year, says a state weather analysis institute./Pollution in Delhi jumped about 20% last year to the highest levels since 2010 partly because of patchy rains during the July-September monsoon season, adding to the woes of residents already choking from the city's toxic air because of noxious fumes belched out by vehicles./""The wash down impact on emissions was low because of lesser rainfall. The extension of dry weather contributed to higher pollution levels,"" said Gufran Beig of the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), which monitors air quality at 10 locations in Delhi. The institute has been monitoring air pollution since 2010./It monitors air pollution under a programme called System for Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and found a link between a weak monsoon and a rise in air pollution levels./It found the overall level of minute particles called particulate matter (PM) 2.5 leapt to 115 Gegagrams (Gg) in 2014 from 94.26 Gg in 2010. During the monsoon months last year the level was around 100 Gg, almost one-third more than the previous year's annual average during the three months./The phenomenon is not limited to Delhi, where doctors say residents develop smokers' lungs by age 35 without ever having smoked because of the toxic air./A Central Pollution Control Board official said many cities in west and north-west India such as Jaipur, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Agra and Chandigarh have also witnessed higher air pollution levels because of less monsoon rain./But the impact of air pollution on monsoon rains has not been conclusively established. ""It is an area of research and debate. But a poor monsoon resulting in a spike in air pollution can happen in many cities, including Delhi,"" the CPCB official said./A 2011 University of Edinburgh study on monsoon data for over 50 years showed higher air pollution-linked human activity had led to drier monsoon, affecting the lives of billions of people in South Asia./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

'We need source-wise mitigation of sources of pollutants',"KOLKATA, May 4 -- Sharad Gokhale, professor of environmental engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, specialises in the study of urban air pollution and environmental noise. He spoke to HT about the role of citizens and the state in reducing air pollution levels./What can people do to protect themselves from air pollution involving dust from construction sites and pavements of roads?/We need source-wise mitigation of different sources of pollutants in Mumbai. A construction site should be enclosed with a cloth or metal screen to prevent dust generated from blowing out of the site. During the clearing of the site, water should be sprinkled to reduce dust./Sidewalks are usually not paved or tiled, and become another important source of dust, which is re-suspended when a vehicle passes. Open burning of tyres and other solid waste should be banned. People need to use bus transport whenever possible and adopt car-pooling. Authorities have to make public transport adequate, comfortable and accessible. To encourage walkers and cyclists, sidewalks need to be safer. Large quantities of pollutants are generated from vehicular emissions due to traffic congestion and crowded parking spaces. What can be done to reduce this problem?/An effective traffic flow management plan can reduce urban air pollution by 15-20%, as traffic speed, frequent startstop often contribute to more emissions. It is necessary to make traffic flow smooth by minimising interruptions./There is no check on the adulteration of fuel. Cleaner technologies have advanced and less polluting fuels are being sought by policy makers, but fuel adulteration too is bad for air quality. Multi-layer parking spaces near urban centres and banning entry of cars in main urban centres would be the best option. People should also obey speed limits, use cruise control, turn off engines at traffic lights, junctions. What are the primary causes of indoor air pollution at workplaces or residential areas, and their remedies?/We spend most of our time indoors. According to the global burden of disease report, indoor air pollution is ranked the third major cause of deaths. There are sources of pollutants indoors such as paints, used furniture, housecleaning detergents, cooking and smoking./Certain lifestyle related practices are taking a toll on our health. Nowadays, houses are painted with sprayers instead of brushes, with particles from paints becoming airborne. In offices, replacing old equipment with new ones can reduce ozone levels./Planting trees on both sides of theroad arrests pollution significantly. A specific crown size and height in trees can manipulate the dispersion of air pollutants within traffic corridors, to help reduce exposure to air pollutants./Can you give us an example of a city that has adopted unique measures to save citizens from bad air quality? There is no city where a specific action has changed the pollution scenario drastically. A few cities in the world are regarded as clean and better despite being populated and industrialised, such as Honolulu in the USA or Calgary in Canada, or Singapore. They have adopted use of public transport, well-planned infrastructure, enforcement against smoky vehicles, tightening of air quality standards, over the years. They have also adopted serious mass awareness programmes about the causes of air pollution and its effect on our children and elderly people./What according to you is lacking in the endeavours of state government bodies that calculate RSPM, NOx and SO2?/These bodies need to take greater responsibility than mere monitoring of air pollutants and uploading information on websites. A special cell needs to be introduced for dealing with vehicular pollution in urban centres. They can identify the attainment and nonattainment areas, hotspots, and issue a public warning of harmful effects of air pollution and what people should do./Technological solutions may take a while, but by involving people, the state pollution control board can address this issue. Collective effort can work wonders./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

New initiative to spread awareness on air pollution,"Kolkata, May 5 -- In a unique drive that is to be conducted by two Delhibased NGOs, children would be seen sporting oxygen masks at traffic signals trying to create awareness on air pollution./Manjari Chandra, a consultant clinical nutritionist associated with the NGO, said, ""We are hoping to change the mindset of people.""/The alarming rate at which the nation's air is getting polluted was highlighted on the eve of World Asthma Day on May 5 when reports released based on lung Health Screening Test (LHST) by a NGO Breathe Blue showed school going children suffering from lung problems./""The LHST determines how lungs are functioning. It can also detect lung diseases and measure its severity. A poor report can lead to pulmonary problems,"" said pulmonologist Dr Parthasarathi Bhattacharya./The initiative, namely 'Clean India Air Movement' (CLAIM) surveyed 2,000 students from 8-14 and mapped the effects of air pollution./""I see many children using nebulizers at an early age. Our mindset needs to be changed. Cutting of trees, rapid urbanization and a dearth of environment friendly laws have led to this problem,"" said environmentalist Subhas Dutta./According to a recent statement by World Health Organisation (WHO), 13 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India. Around 500 children between the ages of 10-15 were tested in Kolkata. Kolkata is the third most affected city among the four. The city topping the group is Delhi./""Around 1.3 millions death every year occurs due to air pollution, especially children in India. Poor air quality is the leading cause for respiratory illness,"" said Anirban Maitra, consultant paediatric pulmonologist, AMRI Kolkata./Parthasarthi Bhattacharya, director of the Institute of Pulmocare and Research, said preliminary results point to a bad situation. Citing reports, he said lung capacity of Indians is 30% lower than that of Westerners./According Maitra, kids suffer more from lung disease in polluted areas./""Air quality and pollution are not the only factors contributing to lung diseases in children. We need more data to figure out how much the damage due to pollution is,"" he said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.
