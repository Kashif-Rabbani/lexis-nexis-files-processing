"After 50,000 deaths a year, UK panel for scrapping diesel vehicles","London, April 27 -- Scrapping diesel vehicles more than 10 years old and introducing a congestion charge in cities across Britain are among key recommendations made by a British parliamentary committee concerned by 50,000 air pollution-related deaths a year./In a new report on air quality, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee of parliament wants the government to have new ""Clean Air Zones"" in dozens of towns and cities to cut the risk of cardiac, respiratory and other diseases caused by polluted air./The congestion charge is currently applicable only in central London, where vehicles have to pay &#163; 11.50 a day for entering a zone marked ""C"". It was introduced in 2003 to reduce congestion and raise funds for London's transport system./Neil Parish, chair of the committee, said: ""Only five cities (Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton) will have new powers to charge polluting vehicles to enter new clean air zones./""Councils in the dozens of other English cities currently exceeding EU pollution limits must also be given the option of using such powers if their communities support action. Communities must be given legal powers to set controls that meet their own circumstances - for example, some might want to charge polluting vehicles to access zones at certain times of day or to target specific bus routes.""/The committee urged the government to consider introducing a diesel scrappage scheme for older vehicles./Parish said: ""Government funding for new refuelling infrastructure and grants to help buy cleaner vehicles such as electric or hybrid cars is welcome. But more action is needed if we are to get older, more polluting diesel vehicles off the road quickly.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Mumbai breathes cleanest air in 11 months on Friday,"Mumbai, May 7 -- Mumbai's air was the cleanest since June 2015, when air quality monitoring and forecasting began, on Friday. Weather experts said strong winds and higher temperatures helped the dispersal of airborne pollutants./The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an air quality index (AQI) - pollutant measuring indicator - of 64 on Friday morning. The AQI was 65 in the evening, falling under the 'good' category. SAFAR estimated the clean air to continue over the weekend as an AQI of 64 was predicted for Saturday./Before Friday, Mumbai had its cleanest air on April 18 when AQI levels were recorded at 89; it was 95 on April 17. However, throughout April and the first week of May, pollution levels were seen fluctuating between the 'good' and 'moderate' categories./As compared to Mumbai, other cities like Delhi and Pune recorded AQI levels at 116 (moderate) and 73 (good), respectively./""Air quality is satisfactory and air pollution poses little or no risk. No caution required for people sensitive to air pollution,"" read the health statement from SAFAR on Friday. Experts said that owing to high mercury levels in Mumbai, pollution levels during this time of the year are at its lowest. ""From most of the data sets that we have got, it has been observed that air quality in Mumbai is good and likely to continue until a sudden drop in temperature is observed. With humidity levels above 60%, high temperatures and fast moving winds, majority of pollutant particles are dispersed from the air,"" said Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI)./For the first time this year, nine out of 10 locations in Mumbai recorded 'good' air quality. The most polluted location was Bandra Kurla Complex that recorded an AQI of 145 on Friday evening, falling under the 'moderate' category. On the other hand, the cleanest air in the city was recorded at Worli with an AQI of 35./Meanwhile, even as interior parts of the state continue to reel under high temperatures, Mumbai recorded the maximum temperature below normal levels on Friday. While the weather station at Santacruz recorded 32.9 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degree Celsius below normal, 33.5 degrees Celsius, 0.2 degree Celsius above normal was recorded at Colaba. Owing to a clear sky during the night, night temperatures were below normal levels in Mumbai./BOX/Nine out of 10 locations record 'good' air quality, first time this year/AQI in Mumbai on Friday morning: 64 (Good)/AQI in Mumbai on Friday evening: 65 (Good)/Expected AQI for Mumbai on Saturday: 64 (Good)/(All AQI levels are in PM2.5 values monitored by the System for Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research)/AQI indicators/Good (0-100)/Health advisory: No cautionary action required/Moderate (101-200)/Health advisory: Unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion and heavy outdoor work/Poor (201-300)/Health advisory: People with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion./Very poor (301-400)/Health advisory: People with heart or lung diseases, older adults and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion, everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion/Severe (401- above)/Health advisory: Everyone should avoid all physical activity, outdoors, people with heart or lung disease older adults and children should remain indoors and keep activity levels low./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Pollution major cause of rising asthma cases,"Faridabad, May 7 -- Pollution has been the biggest cause of rising asthma cases in Faridabad, said experts on the occasion of World Asthma Day on May 3./""In Faridabad alone there has been rise of 15 to 20 per cent in asthma patients because of rising pollution and lifestyle changes,"" said Dr Manav Manchanda, senior consultant respiratory medicines, Asian Institute of Medical Sciences, Faridabad./""Eating healthy food, exercise, doing things that gives a feeling of happiness and relaxation can make asthma patients healthy,"" said Dr Pankaj Chabbra, senior consultant Sarvodaya Hospital and Research Center, Faridabad./Around 300 million people worldwide are reported to suffer from asthma and nearly 10 per cent are in India. According to the Asthma Society of India, approximately 25% of Indians suffer from some form of allergy or the other, 5% of these are triggers for asthma./Due to rising pollution levels in urban cities in India, along with other factors, the number of people suffering from asthma is expected to grow further in India./Industrial pollution, vehicular pollution and burning of garbage and dry leaves also deplete the air quality leading to asthma cases./To check air pollution in Delhi and NCR, National Green Tribunal on April 28 last year banned burning of waste in the open./The Tribunal also announced a fine of '5,000 on any one caught burning dry leaves, plastic, rubber or any other waste material in NCR. However, the civic agency in Faridabad has taken little action despite the NGT order and burning of garbage is still a common sight in the city./On the occasion of World Asthma Day, Fortis Healthcare initiated an awareness campaign on management and prevention of asthma by distributing free anti-pollution face masks to the public across the Delhi NCR./The masks were distributed under the 'Let Me Breathe' campaign that covered 12 major traffic intersections and some Metro stations in the Delhi-NCR region. This was accompanied by dissemination of messages through placards on reducing pollution, preventing asthma attacks and tips to manage the disease./Speaking on the occasion, Col Harinder Singh Chehal, Chief Operating Officer (COO), Fortis said, ""Asthma is a serious health issue that is affecting us as a society. Our initiative is aimed at engaging with people to prevent and manage this chronic disease. We are hopeful that this awareness will yield some change on ground for a better, healthier tomorrow.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

HOW AIR TOXINS HURT IN INSIDIOUS MANNER,"Kolkata, May 8 -- Have you been feeling tired lately? Or irritable? Listless? It's the toxic air you're inhaling. It makes you feel sick and depressed. Air pollution, mostly caused by transport, power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions and heating and cooking at home, raises risks of several illnesses, such as asthma, heart attack and stroke. But it also hurts you in far more insidious ways./DEPRESSION/Air pollutants contain suspended chemicals, toxins and metals that penetrate into lungs and the brain, affecting mood and memory. Outdoor air pollution increases symptoms of depression, making people feel dissatisfied, worthless, bored, unhappy and hopeless, reports a study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. People who lived in neighbourhoods with high ambient levels of suspended dust and carbon particles (suspended particulate matter, or SPM10), nitrogen dioxide and ozone had disturbed sleep and were more prone to alcohol and substance abuse, the study found. Then there's the indirect link to mood degeneration. Studies have linked air pollution to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chronic lung disorders, which are associated with dementia and poor brain health./DEMENTIA/Suspended particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and ozone raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, reports the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. The study, of close to 1,00,000 people, showed that even shortterm exposure to particle pollution more than doubles the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Another study of close to 20,000 women living across the US published in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that over time, breathing in polluted air speeds up brain decline and contributes to the equivalent of about a two-year decline in brain function. Air toxins are particularly damaging for young minds. They lower brain development in 7 to 10-year-old children. Children from schools in polluted neighbourhoods did worse in tests of working memory, superior working memory, and attentiveness, showed the year-long study of 2,715 primary school children across 39 schools in Barcelona, Spain./LOW IMMUNITY/Chronic exposure to pollution warps the immune system and makes it mistake airborne particles for hostile pathogens, such as virus or bacteria, and launch an attack to seek and destroy them. Fine carbon and dust particles (PM II) cause low-level inflammation that disrupts the body's immune response at several levels. A study in the Archives of Environmental and Occupational Health found that women exposed to outdoor pollution tested high for inflammation markers (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6) and functional tests of cellular immunity (natural killer cell cytotoxicity, T-lymphocyte proliferation). This constant state of pressure overworks the immune system and makes it too weak to fight infection when it really occurs, report researchers in Circulation Research./CANCER/Polluted air causes cancer, said the Francebased International Agency for Research on Cancer, after reviewing data that established outdoor air pollution caused 2.23 lakh lung-cancer deaths worldwide in 2012. This puts it at the same toxic level as tobacco, alcohol, ultraviolet radiation. Air pollution also increases the risk of bladder cancer. Particulate matter, a major component of air pollution, was classified as carcinogenic./GUT TROUBLE/Animal models show pollution lowers good bacteria and increase the bad ones in the gut, impairing liver function, causing intestinal swelling, and altering fat and glucose metabolism, leading to diseases such as the gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome and early-onset of Crohn's disease, shows research in the journal Gut Microbes./The new study from Beijing in rats, which was published in The FASEB Journal found pregnant rats exposed to Beijing's polluted air are significantly fatter at the end of pregnancy than those exposed to filtered air. Their offspring exposed to unfiltered air in the womb and after birth were also heavier than those who inhaled clean air. In both continuous exposure to unfiltered air caused airway inflammation in the lungs, increased tissue and systemic oxidative stress, dyslipidemia (abnormalities in cholesterol and other blood fats), and changes in fat distribution, leading to belly fat that raises risk of diabetes and heart disease. With exposure to pollution being among the highest in India and China, with large populations going through rapid industrialisation, controlling it using policy, regulation and technology is the only way to lower disease and death./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Defiant farmers: Ban on stubble burning up in smoke in Patiala,"Patiala, May 8 -- The banned practice of burning wheat stubble to clear the fields for the next crop is on freely across the district./On March 30, the district magistrate had issued these ban orders that seem to have been implemented on paper only. For the past couple of days, burning crop residue can been seen from any road in the district and reduced visibility because of the smoke clouds has made driving risky./Last year American space research agency Nasa had alarmed the world by releasing satellite pictures of burning stubble in northern India, Punjab especially. One of the farmers who had set his field on fire said the stubble invited termites that could affect the next produce. The agriculture department claimed that unlike paddy stubble, wheat residue did not impede tilling and rather acted as fertiliser after decomposition in the soil./""Burning stubble not only kills microbes and destroys helpful nutrients in the soil but also causes air pollution. We have been creating awareness among farmers against it,"" said district agricultural officer Parminder Singh. One of the senior officers said the administration did not want to add to the woes of poor farmers by registering police cases against them, and ""with the assembly elections less than a year away, even the government wouldn't risk annoying them""./Deputy commissioner Ramvir Singh said he would ask the departments concerned to take some action to stop farmers from burning crop residue ""but it would be better to educate and inform them about the negatives of stubble burning""./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Haze over odd-even impact stays,"New Delhi, May 12 -- The impact of oddeven on air pollution remained unclear with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee saying farm fires in Punjab and Haryana might have played spoilsport in the second phase of the car rationing scheme./The report said the air was less polluted a week before the restriction than the weeks during and after the restriction./The peak pollution levels before the scheme, however, were higher compared to the first week of the restriction./The second week saw higher peaks and this was because of the farm fires, said the DPCC report./Pollution peaks are the highest concentration of a pollutant in the air during a set time period./""During the event period (first week of odd-even II, April 15 to April 21) with normal weather conditions the range of concentration of particulate matter was decreased as compared to previous week, despite having same wind speed as before. However, in the second half of the event (April 22 to 30), the pollution level increased due to dip in the wind speed,"" the report says./A closer analysis of the DPCC report reveals that the average particulate matter was lower before the restriction and almost similar after the restriction was imposed. What changed were external factors such as wind speed and farm fires./The average PM 2.5 concentration a week before the restriction was 89 micro gram per cubic metre./This rose to 111 micro gram per cubic metre during the first week of the restriction. In the second week the concentration rose to 154 micro gram per cubic metre. The week after odd-even II ended, the pollution concentration was 114 micro gram per cubic metre./The pollution levels and the wind speed were similar in the first week of May and April 15 - April 21 (odd-even first week) indicating a close relationship between the two./The DPCC acknowledges the relationship./""The analysis of the data generated before, during event and after the event shows that the total period was highly influenced by metrological parameters such as wind speed, wind direction, ambient temperature, etc. It is observed that local and transstate movement of pollutants also influenced the air quality of Delhi.

What can we do?/A lot of circumstances add up to create very high pollution levels. High emissions, number of geographic issues, very large population and increasing number of automobiles together contribute to a city's worsening air quality./We need to quit treating air as a free space to put in your pollution. Industrial sources need to be cleaned up. Clean up vehicles. Use cleaner fuel. Do away with coal-powered plants. Look for cleaner fuel. It won't be easy. You have to go to the various polluting sources and clean them up. For example, one old truck can emit as much pollution as 100 clean ones. It needs to be off the road. You have to identify these sources of high emission and clean them up./What do you think of the recent odd-even exercises in Delhi?/Odd-even has been tried elsewhere too. But it hasn't work. One thing many people do is they get two cars - one nice one and the other a junk one - to drive on both the days. The result is more pollution instead of less.

Get rid of hypertension,"New Delhi, May 19 -- The prime cause of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension is a silent killer. Almost one billion people across the world suffer from hypertension, and yet it's symptoms are most often overlooked. It was World Hypertension Day recently, and we took the opportunity to get in touch with Dr Mohsin Wali, physician to the President of India and Dr KK Aggarwal, Honorary Secretary General of Indian Medical Association, to help us prepare a brief guide on how to prevent yourself from becoming a victim of hypertension. As your heart tends to pump blood, blood pressure is the force of the blood against your blood vessels which circulate the blood throughout the body. This force is required for the blood flow to transport nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. Hypertension is state where and individual experiences high blood pressure for a sustained period, meaning there is excessive pressure on your blood vessels. ""The problem is that when you tell people that they have high blood pressure then don't take it seriously, they tend to shrug it off as its nothing not knowing that 10% of heart attacks are caused by hypertension"" says Dr Wali./""When you measure your blood pressure, the reading should not exceed more than 140/90. From 120/80 to 140/90 is the pre-hypertension range. If you're reading is in this range then you can be prone to hypertension and it's a warning sign for you to make lifestyle changes and not ignore the issue,"" says Dr Aggarwal. ""From a sedentary lifestyle, eating habits to chronic stress and air pollution, all of them can cause hypertension. One can also say that obesity is a major reason for hypertension. Lack of sleep and sleep apnea is also a leading cause,"" says Dr Wali. There are various symptoms of this problem, the key ones to keep in mind are: 1. Unexplained palpitations while doing any routine physical activity. 2. Constant headaches 3. Unexplained variation in urine volume./""Hypertension is called a silent killer because it primarily affects the four major organs in the body, which is your heart, kidney, eyes and brain. Keep in mind, the health of your kidneys is directly proportional to hypertension"" says Dr Wali./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Odd-even formula not the only solution to pollution: Experts,"Lucknow, May 26 -- Delhi's odd-even policy may be a step to check air pollution, but experts feel that it would not lead to long-term results in north India. With people buying two cars to avoid commuting problems in the national capital, the pollution levels would not witness any change and thus the initiative alone cannot solve the purpose, they say./A number of other formulae that have yielded results in the United States and China etc were shared at the Indo-US workshop on combating air pollution in north India hosted by the US Embassy in Lucknow on Wednesday./""It is a myth that development and pollution check cannot go hand in hand. The US economy has grown fourfold in the last few decades and the pollution levels are a quarter of what they were in the 1960s. Cities in the US that formerly had a reputation of being polluted, dirty, and unattractive, have transformed themselves into clean urban centres with growing economies and healthy populations,"" said Jonathan Kessler, north India director, US Embassy, New Delhi./Experts from India and abroad who attended the workshop suggested that better monitoring of air pollution could lead to better planning in Lucknow and yield results. A check on emissions, particularly from vehicles and burning of bio fuels, could alone bring down the levels to a great extent, they said./""For the people of Lucknow and Delhi who are exposed to combustion of bio fuels, the air quality is as bad as that of living with a number of smokers. The effects of emissions from burning of such fuels are as bad as that of being a passive smoker all the time,"" said Arden Pope of Brigham Young University./Sanjiv Saran, chairman state pollution control board said, ""Vehicle emissions and construction activities are said to be the prime factors leading to pollution in Lucknow. But the idea of introducing metro as a mode of transport in parts of UP and promoting CNG vehicles are steps adopted by the government to check the menace in the long run.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Biomass fuels main cause of air pollution in Bihar',"Patna, May 28 -- Bihar ranks first among top consumers of biomass and charcoal, which is one of the major causes of air pollution in the state./Around 90% of Bihar's population uses homemade traditional stoves or firewood for cooking purposes using biomass fuels such as agricultural residue, dung, coal and charcoal. These sources of fuel are highly inefficient and emit copious quantity of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and black carbon./The Centre of Environment and Energy Development (CEED), while releasing a report on cooking practices in Patna that contribute to air pollution, revealed some new figures on the existing use of solid fuels for domestic cooking and lighting purposes for Patna Urban Agglomeration Area (PUAA). The report advocates serious and urgent efforts for transition to sustainable form of energy in Patna./Incidentally, a recent report released by the World Health Organisation ranked Patna as the sixth most polluted city in the world./In Patna, over 831.54 tonnes of toxic particulate matter and 232 tonnes of black carbon are added to the atmosphere, thanks to the use of biomass fuels for cooking./The report also projects a trend of pollution, which reaches 1.32 lakh tonnes (PM 2.5) by 2051. The amount of smoke from the burning of solid fuels is equivalent to consuming two packs of cigarettes a day, as estimated by the World Energy Assessment./R a m p a t i Ku m a r, c h i e f executive officer, CEED, said, ""Inefficient cooking stoves lead to toxic smoke which, in turn, creates environmental health risks. Women and children are exposed to toxic chemicals./Burning of solid fuels emits a complex mixture of pollutants, mainly PM and black carbon."" Talking about Bihar, he said, ""It was shocking to witness during our survey that a large number of households in Patna still depend on solid fuels. The Bihar government should take steps to transform cooking practices for safe and healthy lifestyle."" ""Over 1.38 lakh households in Patna still rely on solid fuels and traditional cooking stoves for domestic cooking despite their negative impact on health,"" said Ankita Jyoti, programme manager, CEED. ""Over 72% of women and children are at a health risk. The predominance of health complaints such as eye irritation, visual impairment, watery eyes, muscles fatigue and respiratory problems were observed in a maximum of such households,"" she added./Talking of remedies, they said, ""If we control the usage of diesel, kerosene and biomass, over 20% of air pollution can be reduced./The Ujjwala scheme of the Union government is a good initiative in this direction but still many families do not use LPG because they cannot pay for it. Even street vendors who cook tea on charcoal are not willing to use LPG in order to maintain the taste and cost of the tea for consumers. Open waste burning should also be stopped.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Five easy ways to go green without actively changing your lifestyle,"New Delhi, May 28 -- If the planet stays healthy, you stay healthy. Which makes World Environment Day on June 5 more significant than a reminder that each passing moment is adding to the irreversible damage inflicted to the earth, water and air around us. Increasing consumption has led to an 11-fold growth to our collective carbon footprint -- define as the greenhouse gases generated by how we live our life -- since 1961, which now accounts for 54% of humanity's overall ecological footprint./Sure, governments need to adopt green policies to cap emissions produced by the expanding need and greed of increasing populations, but till polity gets it right, each of us can do our bit to lower our own carbon footprint to give life on Earth a breather./In a run-up to World Environment Day, here are five easy ways to go green without actively changing your lifestyle. If the planet stays healthy, you stay healthy./Eat fresh food/Imported and packaged foods that have become symbols of globalisation add more than half of the 100,000 tonnes of plastic waste dumped in oceans each year. Apart from the fuel spent in transporting foods from one end of the world to another, chemicals in polythene, packaging and wraps for imported fruit and foods such as chips and biscuits, not only kill marine life but also disrupt the human endocrine system to trigger hormone-related diseases, including cancers. Eating fresh, unpackaged food that is locally produced improves health while lowering your carbon footprint ./Use phones, laptop efficiently/Postpone upgrading your smartphone. On an average, people replace their phones every two years. Greenhouse gas emissions from charging smartphones are expected to double from the current 6.4 megatons to 13 megatons -- equivalent to emissions of 1.1 million cars -- by 2020, estimates a study by Juniper Research./Add to this mobile phone battery contamination -- each discarded mobile battery contains enough cadmium to contaminate 600,000 litres of water -- and non-degradable plastic covers filling landfills and each discarded phone becomes an ecological nightmare. Till manufacturers make their phones more energy efficient, delay swapping your phone for a newer model./Turn off the computer or laptop monitor when you have finished working. You can laser print 800 pages with the energy you waste by leaving on a computer monitor overnight. The money saved on electricity bills will be a bonus./Commute smartly/There are over one billion vehicles on the world's roads today, of which close to 200 million are registered for use in India. Of these, 24.9 million are cars, taxis and jeeps used by people like us to commute./Smooth and efficient driving, where you don't speed, accelerate rapidly, brake hard and switch off the engine at a red light, can raise mileage by up to 33%. Idling at a light alone can use up roughly half a litre of petrol an hour, spending on your engine size and air-conditioner use./Since public transport is mostly unreliable -- Delhi and Kolkata are the only two of India's 53 cities with a population of more one million to have metro tracks of more than 100 km and 28 km respectively, compared to Shanghai's over 500 km of rail network -- opt for bikes and shared transport, whenever possible./Work efficiently/Each year, most of us throw away two trees worth of paper. Reduce the amount of paper you use by avoiding unnecessary printing, using both sides of a paper while printing a document and using recycled paper. Although paper is biodegradable, waster paper releases the greenhouse gas methane during decomposition. Each tonne of recycled paper helps save 17 trees, more than 4,000 kilowatt of energy, 26,000 litres of water, and lower air pollution by 74% compared to paper made from virgin pulp./Replace burned-out bulbs with compact florescent lamps (CFLS) and light-emitting diodes (LEDS) that use less power per unit of light generated to use less electricity. LEDs also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants./Save water, go natural/A dripping tap can waste up to 10 litres of water a day and a running tap five litres per minute. Get dripping taps fixed and don't leave the tap running when brushing your teeth or shaving. When you have the option, don't use piped, drinking water to clean your home, hose cars or water the garden./Avoid synthetic chemical cleaning products, use hot water instead.

Pollution monster breathes poison into Pink City's air,"Jaipur, May 29 -- Air pollution has more than doubled in some parts of the state capital during the past four months posing serious threats to the residents' health, said pollution board and health officials on Sunday./According to the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB), the pollution-intense areas of the city are, Chandpol, Ajmeri Gate, Jhalana, Vishwakarma Industrial Area and Malviya Nagar Industrial Area. Vishwakarma Industrial Area (VKI), however, is the most polluted zone in terms of the particulate matter (see table)./Particulate matter or PM is a compound of small particles, liquid droplets, including acids (such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. The PM is monitored at the time of measuring air pollution./The pollution board figures reveal that the presence of the particulate matter (PM10) in these areas has gone up twice the permissible levels due to vehicular pollution and dust caused by tyre-road friction and on-going construction activities feeding fine dust into the atmosphere./In view of the increasing pollution levels in the city, the state pollution board has decided to reorganize the existing six air pollution monitoring stations and install three new ones by the next month./Data gathered at the six air pollution monitoring stations at different parts of the city indicate not only are the particulate matter levels exceeding the standard of 100 micrograms, in some places it is well over 300 micrograms (more than double)./In April, the PM10 measured at the VKI area was 332 micrograms, two times higher than the standard permissible limit. Similarly, the pollution at much frequented places such as Chandpol was 326 micrograms in January./Pollution board officials said that apart from the dust arising from the friction of vehicle tyres, other factors such as the fine dust particles coming from the cement used in construction and during garbage collection also contribute to the pollution levels./The recent data from the pollution board for these areas have also surpassed the annual average of air pollution in Jaipur for the last six years./For example, the annual air pollution average of the last 6 years at Chandpol has been 179, 148, 143, 209, 164 and 198 micrograms. However, within the first four months of 2016, even the lowest air pollution level that Chandpol has seen is 274 micrograms, higher than any of the annual averages./""The immediate cause behind the formation of particulate matter is the burning of substances such as petrol, diesel, emissions from the automobile industry and biomedical waste products. Additional medical superintendent of SMS Hospital and respiratory diseases expert, Ajit Singh, said, ""Earlier, the particulate matter used to be found in the upper stratums of atmosphere. But, now because of the increase in burning of these substances, they are forming concentrations in much lower levels, affecting humans directly.""/He said that the symptoms such as shortness of breath, heavy breathing and increased heart diseases among the urban population most often result from the inhalation of the particulate matter. The most common disease is pneumoconiosis, Singh said, adding that they might even cause stomach and lung cancer./Experts said the easiest way to check air pollution is to switch to the CNG-run vehicles and adopt a green way of life./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

'Lung cancer incidence higher in men',"Lucknow, June 3 -- Lung cancer is the second-most common cancer among men in India. Over the past few years, incidence of the disease has increased by 7-8% in males and 3-4% in females in Lucknow./Smoking tobacco and exposure to cancer-causing agents such as asbestos, radon, air pollution and diesel exhaust have been major causes of lung cancer in Lucknow, said Dr Vivek Kumar Garg, surgical oncologist at Lucknow Cancer Institute, while addressing a press conference on Thursday./Tobacco consumption, which is common in India, is a major risk factor for lung cancer, incidence of which is higher in men as compared to women, he said./Emphasising on the importance of timely diagnosis of lung cancer, Garg said, ""Lung cancer is one of the most widespread diseases and also one of the hardest to treat effectively. This is because most patients are diagnosed only in advanced stages. In Lucknow, six out of 10 cases are diagnosed in the advanced stage.""/Commenting on the progress in lung cancer treatment, he said: ""Though there is no complete cure for any form of cancer, the treatment for cancer has improved a lot.

City unable to breathe easy,"Lucknow, June 6 -- Indira Nagar, the residential hub of the state capital, has sustained its dubious distinction of being the most polluted area in the state capital for the second consecutive year. The air pollution levels here have been found to be highest among all other residential localities./The most planned and developed Indira Nagar recorded Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) level at 221.5 microgram/cubic metre which is almost four times from what the World Health Organization says is safe limit (50 microgram/cubic metre). Last year it had 197.5 the RSPM microgram/cubic metre which means a jump of 24 microgram/cubic metre. A pre-monsoon random sampling report on Lucknow's air pollution by Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) has recorded second highest levels of air pollutants in Gomti Nagar that registered 204.6 microgram/cubic metre of RSPM (in 2015 183.2 microgram/ cubic metre)./This year, significantly all the areas have recorded higher RSPM in comparison to the previous year. This is important for residents, say experts. ""RSPM are of size 4 to 5 micron that settle i nside human organs such as lungs when we breathe in polluted air,"" said Dr AA Mahdi, HoD, bio-chemistry department, King George's Medical University./""Air pollution can be directly linked to diseases such as COPD, asthma and other respiratory disorders. The secondary result is general weakness and even premature deaths,"" said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Health City and Trauma Centre. The permissible limit as per National Air Quality Standards is 100microgram/ cubic metre and for the past several years, Lucknowites are reeling under high levels of pollutions and breathing in deadly particles with almost every breath in the open. Levels are so high that this year's downward trend would not bring them much respite though monsoon showers might bring down visible air pollution in next few weeks./Experts say this gradual rise in air pollution in all the areas needs to be checked with major efforts such as plantation, removal of encroachment and cheaper and comfortable public transport to reduce pollution levels./Among commercial areas, Chowk recorded the highest levels of RSPM 276.7, Alambagh 209.4 and Aminabad 203.3./Amausi is the only industrial areas where equipment has been set up to record pollution level. It registered a steep rise in RSPM level from last year's 199.4 microgram/cubic metre to 238.3 microgram/cubic metre. The study of air pollution was carried out during the months of April and May to assess the status of air quality by monitoring and assessment of some selected pollutants. RSPM limit as per National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is 100 microgram/cubic metre./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Does your house make you sick? It's time you kept these pollutants out,"India, June 11 -- Air pollution raises risk of stroke, reported a study in The Lancet, highlighting once again on how poor air quality damages more than your lungs. Air toxins use lungs as gateways to enter the body to affect the brain, circulation, central nervous system, endocrine system, blood and immunity. Carbon monoxide, for example, hurts the heart and circulation the most./The good news is that controlling modifiable lifestyle risks -- such as smoking, unhealthy diet, and low physical activity - along with metabolic factors such as high blood pressure, high glucose, high cholesterol, overweight and kidney disease can avert stroke and associated disability in three in four affected worldwide./Unsafe homes/Indoor air pollution, the neglected aspect of air pollution, is far more deadly. Of the annual 7 million deaths-- one in eight of the total global deaths - caused by air pollution around the word in 2012, 4.3 million deaths were from indoor air pollution and 3.7 million by outdoor air, said the WHO. Poor quality outdoor air causes heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and lung diseases and infections, but so does bad indoor air. Cleaning up outdoor air pollution needs strong clean-air policies and public health commitment, but you can do your bit to improve air quality at home./In India, indoor air pollution is the second-biggest cause of death after dietary risks, reported the Global Burden of Disdeases Study 2010, such as over- and undernutrition. While bad outdoor air can affect indoor air quality, there are toxins and allergens other than nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and lead that can make enclosed spaces deadly./Poor air quality often causes no symptoms, and when it does, the signs are too generalized to be directly liked to it. At most, people develop headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, sinus congestion, cough, sneezing, eye, nose, throat and skin irritation, dizziness or nausea, collectively referred to as the Sick Building Syndrome. Since these symptoms are also linked to other factors such as poor lighting, noise, vibration, overcrowding, and psychosocial stress, the only way to identify the cause is by eliminating potential triggers./Cooking up disease/Cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves is the biggest cause of death and disease from indoor pollution, affecting 2.9 billion people worldwide. Smoke from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces contain a mixture of harmful gases and carbon particles that causes asthma attacks, bronchitis, and aggravates heart and lung disease./If you can smell smoke in your home, you need to get the room better ventilated - use a chimney or open the widow while cooking so that the smoke isn't trapped indoors -- to lower risk not only for the person cooking but also for babies, infants, or older persons who spend more time indoors. Burning dry wood that has been stored for at least six months is less polluted than freshly-cut wood./Secondhand smoke and fungi/Secondhand smoke from cigarettes, cigars, bidis, hookahs or pipes, as well as the smoke exhaled by a smoker, is as harmful in smaller amounts because it contains more than 4,000 substances, including several compounds that cause cancer. Young children with small airways and developing lungs breathe more rapidly than adults, which makes the more susceptible to the damage./Air-conditioning systems often harbour mould and fungi, as do other warm, dark and moist spaces, such kitchen sinks and bathrooms. Getting air conditioners cleaned periodically, especially before seasonal use, lowers the amount of toxic aerosols released/Mites, pests and dander/Droppings from microscopic dust mites that feed on human skin flakes in mattresses, pillows, upholstered furniture, stuffed toys and pillows also cause allergies. Washing linen in hot water and airing mattress and pillows in the sun regularly lowers exposure, as does dusting using a damp cloth./Cockroach saliva and droppings contain proteins that may trigger allergy, but since insecticides and pesticides are more toxic, the problem is best managed by keeping the counters, sinks and floors clean, and sealing cracks or opening inside cabinets./Another cause is animal dander from dogs, cats, rodents (including hamsters and guinea pigs) and other warm-blooded mammals, which can only be managed by staying away from homes with pets./Ten of the world's top 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India, but clean-air policies have to factor in strategies to lower indoor air pollution to help India to improve the health of the hundreds of millions who live outside its cities that grabbed the world's attention for exceeding the World Health Organisation (WHO) limits on air safety./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

AIR POLLUTION: WHY THIS PLACE MAKES ME SICK!,"Kolkata, June 16 -- Air pollution raises the risk of stroke, reported a study in The Lancet, highlighting once again how poor air quality damages more than your lungs. Air toxins use lungs as gateways to enter the body to affect the brain, circulation, central nervous system, endocrine system, blood and immunity. Carbon monoxide, for example, hurts the heart and circulation the most./The good news is that controlling modifiable lifestyle risks (such as smoking, unhealthy diet and low physical activity) and metabolic factors such as blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol and weight, can avert stroke and associated disability in three in four people affected worldwide./UNSAFE HOMES/Indoor air pollution, the neglected aspect of air pollution, is far more deadly. Of the annual 7 million deaths - one in eight of total global deaths - caused by air pollution around the word in 2012, 4.3 million were from indoor air pollution and 3.7 million from outdoor air, said the WHO. Poor quality outdoor air causes heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and lung diseases and infections, but so does bad indoor air. Cleaning up outdoor air pollution needs strong clean-air policies and public health commitment, but you can do your bit to improve air quality at home./In India, indoor air pollution is the second-biggest cause of death after dietary risks such as overand undernutrition, reported the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2010. While bad outdoor air can affect indoor air quality, there are toxins and allergens other than nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and lead that can make enclosed spaces dangerous./Poor air quality often causes no symptoms, and when it does, the signs are too generalised to be directly liked to it./At most, people develop headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, sinus congestion, cough, sneezing, eye, nose, throat and skin irritation, dizziness or nausea, collectively referred to as the Sick Building Syndrome.

Asola slum kids begin a dialogue on social issues with street plays,"New Delhi, June 28 -- Each evening at five, a group of children, aged between four and 15, gather at a Sainik Farms house to practice voice projection. These kids are from Asola slum cluster, sandwiched between Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary and Sainik Farms. The kids have found a constructive way to spend their time after school. Covering public spaces like malls, markets and schools, they perform nukkad naataks (street plays) on various social issues. They have covered disconcerting topics like child labour, air pollution, sanitation, gender equality and cleanliness. Having performed in Sangam Vihar, Saket and Sainik Farms, the kids are now looking to expand their reach./""My first play was on child labour in cracker factories. It felt like we were the instruments of social change at that point in time and I felt great. I also want to do plays on waste management and highlight the evils of smoking and drinking,"" said 12-year-old Gobind Mahavar./Running this free after-school learning programme for underprivileged kids, Radhika Mittal, founder of the NGO Super School, is proud of the results. ""All the kids study at the neighbouring government schools and I realised that they were not being given ample attention and quality education in the classes. It needs much more than textbooks for the wholesome education of a child. In our classes, children feel empowered and are now looking forward to addressing more issues through the medium of street plays,"" said Radhika who runs these classes at her Sainik Farms residence./She feels that street plays are not only ways of engaging with the masses but also a medium of child development./About 100 kids attend the school where Radhika attempts to create an environment that encourages overall ethical behaviour. From an experiment that began last Diwali when the kids performed plays on child labour in fireworks industry, the kids have now learnt scriptwriting and are confident to perform on more issues affecting the society./Currently writing a script highlighting lack of waste management in the city, the kids are reaching out to other slums where their performances can make a difference./Unlike at their schools, the students like the environment where they study and learn other tricks of the trade./""Gender-based discrimination is common in my locality, I want to do something to make things better for the girls and women there. I want to become a teacher when I grow up and help students tell the right from the wrong. Some of us are lucky that we can attend school. Many kids of our age work in factories and suffer from severe health issues,"" said Khushboo Jaiswal, 14, another student./The kids have performed for more than 1,000 students in four government schools in Sangam Vihar and also for shoppers at PVR Saket market and Select City Walk mall./The school that started with just one kid from the neighbouring slum, now sees a new addition almost ever day. Volunteers at the school say this has become a learning space for slum children where they can understand about all bad things that could be changed and all good things that could be inculcated in their lives. In a month's time, the kids would be ready with their dance and drama play on the rights of young girls in urban areas./""It's a great way to give back to the society. Besides, interacting with these kids teaches me a lot. It's a constant reminder of how happiness is not material and it's the simple things in life that really matter,"" said Nimerta Chawla, a volunteer at the school./Apart from being involved in the production and performance of nukkad nataks, the kids at the school are also given tuitions for two hours each day. Volunteers at Super School have designed a special curriculum for students who are divided into classes based on academic and mental capabilities. Senior students are given the responsibility of teaching the kids in junior classes to improve community engagement. Many students say that they don't follow the curriculum taught in school and this after-school time helps them perform better./The volunteers at the school and Radhika are in talks with the urban development board to find more slums to perform. ""This is a great way to create community spirit among the kids,"" said Radhika who was inspired by a street play on child labour in her school days. ""That play changed my life and I thought that I wanted to do something to give back to the society. The solution to most problems in any country is education and that is how Super School came into being. These kids are not the beneficiaries anymore, they are the change makers,"" Radhika added./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Eco-friendly stoves to curb air pollution,"Patna, July 2 -- Bihar stands first among states and Patna sixth among cities burning solid fuels for cooking which contributes 20% to air pollution./Burning solid fuels is the third source of air pollution, as per a recent study./According to a report released by Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), 1.38 lakh household in Patna rely on solid fuels, mainly because they cannot afford an LPG with a daily earning of R 70-80./Keeping this in mind, CEED has taken an initiative to curb air pollution by distributing environment friendly cooking stoves under 'Clean cooking Patna' campaign to 12 women who live in slums and cannot afford an LPG connection./The stoves are made of steel and emit least smoke while cooking./""Once you put wood into the stove, it stays hot for two hours which can be used for re-heating or even cooking another meal,"" said Faiyaz Iqbal, programme officer, CEED./Garima Chaudhary of CEED while launching the campaign said, ""We are starting the campaign with 12 women but we aim to reach 25,000 households in next three months."" One of the beneficiaries Ishrat Bano of Phulwari said, ""Due to the smoke emitted during cooking, I lost my husband as he was infected with tuberculosis./Since then, my daughter was telling me to opt for LPG./We could not afford it. This stove will give us some relief."" Naveen Mishra, head operations, CEED said, ""These stoves will save time and money. It doesn't emit toxic smoke.

Decaying animal carcasses cleared from DLF Ph-1,"Gurgaon, Aug. 16 -- The Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) removed animal carcasses from the Sikanderpur Ghosi area on Monday. Residents of DLF Phase-1 had been suffering due to the stench and accumulating filth for the last couple of years./The move followed an HT report on August 13, about the open dumping of carcasses and a subsequent report on health concerns due to the activity./""This is a welcome move, since, after so many years of suffering, we are finally able to breathe fresh air. The foul smell coming from the decaying carcasses was making our lives miserable. However, MCG will take a few days to clear the entire area,"" Anil Mehra of DLF Phase-1 said./Ravinder Yadav, another resident, said, ""The civic body removed around 40%- 50% of the carcasses. It was difficult for us to even step outside our house. We are really thankful to Hindustan Times for reporting the issue.""/The area is close to the marble market and carcasses are dumped within a 4-5 km radius of the market. The situation worsened after the rains, which made the stench unbearable, residents said./""As the city does not have any incinerator for disposing of animal carcasses, we are transporting these to Hapur to dispose of them scientifically,"" an MCG official./However, there are still many carcasses in the area./Environmentalists pointed out that the city should get its own incinerator to dispose of carcasses, as dumping dead animals in the open will pollute the environment and also create health hazards for human beings./NB Nair, scientist (retd) from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, said, ""Disposal of carcasses requires scientific methodology. Any incinerator should have a filter device to control air pollution. It should also be set up in a remote area and carcasses should not be transported from one place to another as it might further create more environmental issues.""/Ruchika Sethi, a green activist, said, ""Carcasses should not be left unattended in the open as pathogens from these dead animals can cause diseases and can lead to problems in the society. These carcasses can also attract wild animals in the human habitat, and the ecological balance might be affected.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Gurgaon.

"Poor air kills 'extra' 12,000 a year","Mumbai, Aug. 23 -- Air pollution kills 12,000 more Mumbaiites than expected every year, says an Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB) study. Excess death is the difference between actual deaths and expected deaths to a population at risk by inhaling poor quality air./The study, which looked at mortality data from 2004 and 2013 across 10 cities in Maharashtra, analysed excess deaths caused by air pollution including heart and respiratory diseases./Researchers said 91% to 97% excess deaths in Mumbai was a result of inhaling harmful solid and liquid particles in the air - particulate matter of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10). PM10 is also responsible for mortality due to respiratory diseases (86.3%-95.9%) and cardiovascular diseases (76.3%-86%)./To calculate additional deaths, the IIT-B team used Risk of Mortality/Morbidity due to Air Pollution - a mathematical model - to estimate direct health impacts of the three critical air pollutants in 10 cities of Maharashtra. The team adopted the WHO guidelines for PM, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide concentrations, along with exposure-response relationship (exposure to the pollutant - morbidity and mortality) and the percentage of the incidence of a disease in both exposed and unexposed populations. The study said Mumbai has the highest annual average excess number of total mortality at 1,192 per one million population followed by mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (724) and respiratory diseases (121). Since the city's population is around 12 million, the excess deaths are around 12,000. ""Particulate matter released due to open solid waste burning and small scale bakeries are largely responsible for pollution in Mumbai.

Over 1.38L households in Patna still use solid fuels,"Patna, Aug. 24 -- Respiratory ailments are on rise in urban areas of the state capital and hinterlands due to dependency on traditional fuels for cooking purposes. The state also tops the chart in consumption of solid fuels, resulting in several respiratory diseases often caused by 'indoor air pollution'/More than 1.38 lakh households in Patna and about 90% of the population in the state still depend on traditional fuels for cooking./The issue came up for discussion at a national conference of Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) and the topic was 'Indoor air pollution and use of smokeless kitchen for healthy and breathable air', here on Monday./Households relying on traditional solid fuels were the highest in Patna district followed by Gopalganj, Begusarai and Madhubani. Toxic fumes emanating from solid fuels caused over 4.3 million deaths every year and sickness./Education minister Ashok Choudhary said, ""Reliable and affordable energy and its efficient use will lead to holistic growth of the society. Our government will formulate policies for schools to use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking mid-day meals.""/Rural development minister Shrawan Kumar said, ""Though 80% population in the state lived in villages, but it was seen that urban educated people had been contributing to air pollution by burning garbage in open.""/Naveen Kumar, a senior scientist in Bihar State Pollution Control Board, said, ""No new brick kiln units will be allowed in Bihar and existing ones will be asked to switch over to cleaner technology to check air pollution.""/CEED programme manager Ankita Jyoti said that 64% Indian population are still dependent on solid fuels for cooking, Two billion kilograms of solid fuels are burnt every day thereby affecting 72% female and 38% male./Ramapati Kumar, CEO of CEED, urged government to show urgency to combat the air pollution menace and work towards regenerating clean environment./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Toxic air pollution particles in brain could lead to Alzheimer's, says study","London, Sept. 8 -- A team involving Oxford University scientists has, for the first time, discovered tiny magnetic particles from air pollution lodged in human brains in cities such as Manchester and Mexico City - and researchers think they could be a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease./Researchers led by Lancaster University found abundant magnetite nanoparticles in the brain tissue of 37 individuals aged three to 92 who lived in the two cities./This strongly magnetic mineral is toxic and has been implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) in the human brain, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, according to a statement from Oxford./The results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences./Barbara Maher, from the Lancaster Environment Centre, and colleagues from Oxford, Glasgow, Manchester and Mexico City used spectroscopic analysis to identify the particles as magnetite./Unlike angular magnetite particles that are believed to form naturally within the brain, most of the observed particles were spherical, with diameters up to 150 nm, some with fused surfaces - all characteristic of high-temperature formation, such as from vehicle (particularly diesel) engines or open fires./The spherical particles are often accompanied by nanoparticles containing other metals, such as platinum, nickel, and cobalt, the statement added./Maher said: ""The particles we found are strikingly similar to the magnetite nanospheres that are abundant in the airborne pollution found in urban settings, especially next to busy roads, and which are formed by combustion or frictional heating from vehicle engines or brakes.""/Co-author Imad Ahmed from Oxford said: ""Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction, we were able to show the presence of extremely tiny crystals having the 'unmistakable signature' of magnetite, with sizes ranging from ~10 nm up to 150 nm in diameter./""The amazing thing is that the discovered particles have almost the same shape and surface texture of magnetic particles formed during high-temperature combustion of fossil fuels used in car engines, power stations, or even in the smelting industry.""/While it is still debated whether the response of brain magnetites to external magnetic fields - such as the earth's own magnetic field - can cause health damage, Ahmed believes the outstanding chemical and electrochemical reactivity of magnetites' surfaces might be the key link to a range of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia, Alzheimer's and epilepsy./Maher added: ""Our results indicate that magnetite nanoparticles in the atmosphere can enter the human brain, where they might pose a risk to human health, including conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.""/#alzheimersawarenessmonth #alzheimers #pitrodamedical/A photo posted by Pitroda Medical and Spa Dyu (@pitrodamedical) on Sep 8, 2016 at 6:10am PDT/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Which Indian city is most polluted, Delhi or Kolkata?","Kolkata, Sept. 16 -- Which is the most polluted city in India? Is it Delhi or Kolkata? Experts said the two cities are neck and neck when it comes to who would get the tag of the most polluted city in the country./While Delhi remains the most polluted city in India for almost seven months, pollution in Kolkata starts increasing from September and reaches the peak between November and January surpassing Delhi./""Statistics show that while pollution in Delhi remains the highest between February and August, Kolkata starts taking over from September. Kolkata's pollution reaches its peak between November and January - the winter months,"" said Rajeev Sharma, conservation specialist of US Embassy, New Delhi./Sharma was speaking at a seminar, ""Kolkata's Air Quality - Navigation Solutions"", organised by the US Consulate in Kolkata, Banglanatak.com and the Global Change Programme of Jadavpur University on Thursday./The US Consulate maintains a daily air quality index through its own system of measuring air pollution, including particulate matter (PM) levels. Five air quality monitors were set up in Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata to measure the quality of air in these places. Data from these monitors were complied to come up with the Ambient Air Quality Index (2014-16)./Earlier, studies by the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute had revealed that nearly 70% of Kolkatans suffer from respiratory trouble caused by pollution. Recent reports by the Union government claim that several persons in West Bengal have succumbed to diseases caused by the rising air pollution since 2009./""Despite the results in research reports and available hard data highlighting the adverse impact of air pollution on human health, we have figured out after discussions with local experts that there is a lack of awareness among Kolkata's citizens on this issue,"" said Craig Hall, US Consul General in Kolkata./Experts emphasised the need to have air purifiers and spread awareness about the proper disposal of waste materials, vehicular emissions, air filtration and providing mats at offices to remove dirt so that the air will remain clean and pure./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Choked in Delhi: How to survive in a polluted city,"India, Sept. 21 -- Sarita Surana, 52, skips her morning walks on days when the roads are dusty and the pollution levels are high. She has been living with asthma and bronchitis for 15 years and uses an inhaler daily to dilate her airways and help her breathe. On the days the inhaler fails to help her, she uses a nebuliser, a device that helps in inhaling the drugs better./""I have to be very careful because of my asthma. Before going anywhere, I go to the balcony and if their air is too polluted, I either don't go out or use a mask. Sometimes, I feel tired after being out for an hour,"" said Surana./Like her, adopting measures to protect themselves from pollution as become a part of routine for many thousands, especially during the smoggy winter months./""Air pollution causes short-term problems like cough, sore throat and eye irritation for most people, but people with chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may need medical management when pollution levels go up,"" said Dr Rajesh Chawla, consulting pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo hospital./""Every winter,there is a spike in the number of patients with respiratory problems. This could be due to the concentration of pollution in the lower levels of the atmosphere, but also because of dipping temperatures and viral infections doing rounds,"" said Dr Nevin Kishore, head of the department of broncology at Max Hospital, Saket./An increase in the number of people living with chronic respiratory problem is also linked to pollution. ""A report by the Central Pollution Control Board said every third child in Delhi has some kind of lung impairment,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhary, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment ./CHANGE THE AIR/""Delhi is proof that the pollution trends can change, depending on the actions that we take. There was a visible reduction in the levels of pollution when the buses in the city switched to CNG in 2011, but it started going up again in 2008-09. This means we have been unable to maintain the momentum,"" she said./To improve the air quality, a source-wise pollution control strategy has to be made./""Vehicular emissions, construction and demolition of buildings and trash burning are among the main reasons for pollution . To control trash burning, the corporations need to ensure that a proper collection mechanism and enough composting facilities are in place. The Centre has already come up with rules for dust control during construction and demolition, but this has to be strictly enforced,"" said Roy Chowdhary./Several actions need to be taken to control vehicular emissions. ""The number of cars that get registered in the city has to be controlled. For that the government needs to improve the connectivity of metro and buses, make cycle tracks, make cleaner fuels available and improve the emission standards. To control the number of cars entering from across the border, high parking prices may be charged to discourage people,"" she said./Around 1,400 new vehicles are registered in Delhi every day and around 5.7 lakh vehicles enter the city from across the border, which is equal to the number of vehicles that are registered in Delhi annually. ""This is contributing to the pollution enormously. We need to focus on moving people but not vehicles,"" she said./Till policy measures ensure the air gets cleaner, people have to focus on protecting their lungs. People with chronic conditions must take prescribed medicines to control symptoms and avoid areas with high pollution and vehicular density,"" said Dr Kishore./Decreasing the exposure is the best solution. ""People with such conditions must not travel during the rush hours and when in a car must roll up the windows. While stepping out, it is a good idea to cover the nose and the mouth either with a mask or a wet handkerchief.,' says Dr Chawla./Children's developing airways are at most risk of damage from polluted air. ""Everyone must ensure that their children go to schools that are 5 -6 km away to cut down on their commute time,"" said Dr Chawla./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Are we breathing clean, fresh and pure air inside our homes?","New Delhi, Sept. 25 -- Life in a metro exposes you to airborne contaminants on a daily basis. With rapid urbanisation, construction, vehicular pollution and dust, Indian cities are now bearing the brunt of air pollution both outside and inside homes. Here is a way to help you breath fresh at least inside your home./Indoor air pollution can be up to ten times worse than outdoor air pollution as per recent research reports. A high level of particulate matter in the air called PM2.5 is the root cause of air pollution. PM2.5 is invisible to the naked eye. Studies by US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have concluded that exposure to PM2.5 in children will mean reduced lung functioning, and an increase in asthma and respiratory illnesses. A common problem due to increased exposure to air pollution is eye irritation, watering in the eyes; and exposure to such high levels of pollution can result in serious health damages in the long run. A safe breathing environment requires PM2.5 to be below 25 micrograms per cubic meter as per World Health Organisation's (WHO) standards, and below 60 micrograms per cubic meter as per Indian standards. Air purifier can clear the air of dust, pollen, pet dander, smoke and almost all pollutants present in the air. It can actually clean the air around us, purifying it by removing microns. The most vulnerable to air pollution are children and elderly, as they have lower immunity. Babies and young children have developing immune systems, neurological and respiratory systems, which makes them much more susceptible to lifelong health damage as a result of inhalation of polluted air, early on. Honeywell, a US based MNC offers a range of do-ityourself (DIY) air purifiers for homes. One of the leading and popular air purifiers in this portfolio is Honeywell Air Touch(TM) that has a powerful and clean air delivery rate of 300 Cubic m/h. It fights indoor air pollution in homes by removing PM2.5, dust, pollen, allergens, formaldehydes, Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), harmful gases and odour. The air purifier cleans indoor air with Honeywell's patented HiSiv(TM) technology filter, HEPA filter and a pre-filter. HiSiv(TM) filter is a differentiator and it targets formaldehydes, harmful gases, TVOC and odour. The HEPA filter removes PM2.5 and bacteria. The prefilter removes large dust particles. Together, the three filters purify air inside homes comprehensively. This air purifier is power efficient and utilises only 52W at highest fan speed and 7.5W at lowest fan speed. The product has a filter life of approximately 3,000 hours depending on indoor air quality. An impressive feature is its low noise of operation with builtin sleep mode, ensuring sound sleep.

FIVE HELD IN RNE FOR BURNING CHEMICALS,"GHAZIABAD, Sept. 26 -- Five people were arrested in Raj Nagar Extension for allegedly burning chemical containers and tyres, which resulted in toxic smoke reaching several high-rises. The incident took place between 2am to 5am on Sunday when thick smoke came out of some makeshift dwellings around 1.5km from the high-rise area. ""Residents became anxious as the smoke entered their houses and children started vomiting. We too felt nauseated. Some residents took their cars and went to trace the origin of the smoke. We found several workers burning chemical and coal tar containers and rubber tyres,"" said Vikrant Sharma of Gaur Cascade, Raj Nagar Extension. ""We immediately called up the police and PCR van 27 arrived. They took the workers to the police station where they were arrested following a written complaint by residents. There have been directions by different courts against burning of garbage and other material in order to prevent air pollution,"" Sharma said. The police said they lodged a non-cognizable FIR under IPC's Section 278. ""The PCR went to the spot upon complaint by residents. Five workers were arrested and FIR was also lodged.

"In the time of climate change, a few smart lessons for the Capital","New Delhi, Sept. 26 -- Last week, the C40, a global network of 86 cities, including six from India, released the list of 35 urban programmes to compete in its annual award on fighting climate change to be held in December./One would have expected the more radical ideas fromMumbai, Delhi, Chennai or Bengaluru to impress the world. But the only Indian city to make it to the shortlist of global finalists was Kolkata, the forgotten metro often mocked as an urban nightmare. Its solid waste management improvement project that aims to reduce the city trash sent to the landfills now competes with Milan' s food wastage reduction and Auckland's waste to resources programmes for the top slot./Lastyear, theC40foundthat at least 70% of its member cities were already affected by climate change. The rising pollution, growing congestion and mounting waste are throttling local environments and contributing to global warming. If not suffering already, these cities are likely to face climate hazards such as storms, surge, floods, rain drought, heat, smog, groundwater depletion and outbreak of vector- or water-borne diseases./In the middle of a dengue-chikungunya outbreak, this threat can't get more real for Indian cities. There centglobal ranking of 2,100 urban centres on a list of Fragile Cities put together by The Igarape Institute in Brazil, United Nations University and the World Economic Forum placed Delhi in the high-risk category, prone to both floods and drought./Delhi, where the air is fouled by nine million vehicles, energy is sourced from coal-fired plants, dumpsites are overfilled, and every third resident lives illegally on a river that resembles an open sewer, may not have much to showcase yet in this global competition. But we could take a cue or two from some urban experiments the C40 is talking about:/MEXICO CITY'S MOBILITY PROGRAMME/Like Delhi, the Mexican capital has to deal with population pressure, car-jammed streets, high air pollution levels and earthquake vulnerability. In 2014, the city passed a law recognising mobility as a fundamental right of its residents, prioritising non-motorised transport and creating a legal framework to streamline and scale up mass transit./Till recently, services for bus, metro and Bus Rapid T ransit were fragmented, preventing users from efficiently transferring from one system to another, the Sustainable Cities Collective reported in 2014. So Mexico City integrated all modes of public transport and also placed pedestrians and cyclists on top of the mobility hierarchy, allocating more funds and road space to them./NON-POTABLE WATER REGULATION/California's four-year drought taught San Francisco to reuse every drop of water. In2012, San Francisco made it mandatory for larger residential units to install systems to treat water from sinks, bathtubs, sewage and use it for non-potable purpose. Potable water has to be used for drinking and cooking only. In 2013, it allowed two or more buildings to share or sell water between them./Parts of San Francisco already have dual-pipe system since 1991 that receives recycled water. By2018, the city will have are cycling facility to meet irrigation needs on the west side of the city by treating a million gallons of water a day that would otherwise have been piped into the ocean, Huffington Post reported in October, 2015./TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT/When most Indian cities are aping the US-style suburbanisation, Cape Town is aiming to become compact. For the next 16 years, transit-oriented development will be this South African city's key urban planning strategy. It wants to build residential areas and renew the existing ones by giving them efficient and affordable public transport connectivity and reducing dependency on cars./Cape Town is using the project to overcome the apartheid spatial inequality by building homes for all income groups, bringing work space closer to home and thus reducing travel time and commuting costs for lower-income households who were earlier dispersed to the city's periphery./While climate change mitigation is the larger aim of these projects, they are also about improving the way the cities run. An efficient public transport, unclogged streets, cleaner air, greener parks, a reliable water system and housing for all are the fundamentals of urban living. Delhi could do with some inspiration./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

In 2014, the city passed a law recognising mobility as a fundamental right of its residents, prioritising non-motorised transport and creating a legal framework to streamline and scale up mass transit./Till recently, services for bus, metro and Bus Rapid Transit were fragmented, preventing users from efficiently transferring from one system to another, the Sustainable Cities Collective reported in 2014. So Mexico City integrated all modes of public transport and also placed pedestrians and cyclists on top of the mobility hierarchy, allocating more funds and road space to them./Non-potable water regulation/California's four-year drought taught San Francisco to reuse every drop of water. In 2012, San Francisco made it mandatory for larger residential units to install systems to treat water from sinks, bathtubs, sewage and use it for non-potable purpose. Potable water has to be used for drinking and cooking only. In 2013, it allowed two or more buildings to share or sell water between them./Parts of San Francisco already have dual-pipe system since 1991 that receives recycled water. By 2018, the city will have a recycling facility to meet irrigation needs on the west side of the city by treating a million gallons of water a day that would otherwise have been piped into the ocean, Huffington Post reported in October, 2015./Transit-oriented development/When most Indian cities are aping the US-style suburbanisation, Cape Town is aiming to become compact. For the next 16 years, transit-oriented development will be this South African city's key urban planning strategy. It wants to build residential areas and renew the existing ones by giving them efficient and affordable public transport connectivity and reducing dependency on cars./Cape Town is using the project to overcome the apartheid spatial inequality by building homes for all income groups, bringing work space closer to home and thus reducing travel time and commuting costs for lower-income households who were earlier dispersed to the city's periphery./While climate change mitigation is the larger aim of these projects, they are also about improving the way the cities run. An efficient public transport, unclogged streets, cleaner air, greener parks, a reliable water system and housing for all are the fundamentals of urban living. Delhi could do with some inspiration./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

8.9 million reasons why Delhi should worry about its air,"New Delhi, Sept. 28 -- For most Delhiites, choking on heavy fumes from diesel vehicles on city roads is a part of everyday life. With each breath of the polluted city air, they are at greater risk of respiratory ailments, heart diseases, cancer, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders./The Capital has over 8.9 million registered vehicles and another 50,000 commercial vehicles enter the city's borders each night. A two-year analysis, submitted by IIT Kanpur to the Delhi government, identified the major contributors to the city's pollution levels. Vehicular emissions were found to be among the top two contributors. According to the report, pollution from vehicles grew from 64% to 72% between 1990 and 2000. During the winter season, on an average vehicles contribute up to 25% of PM2.5 and at certain locations this could be above 35%./In winters, 46% particulate emissions (PM10) were attributed to trucks and 33% to two wheelers. Four wheelers trailed behind at 10%, followed by buses (5%) and light commercial vehicles (4%), the study found. More than a third (38%) of the small particulate matter (PM2.5) not visible to the naked eye was contributed by road dust, while 20% was from vehicular emissions./""Small particles are the most dangerous as they enter the walls of lungs and clog it. This causes severe respiratory problems and other degenerative diseases,"" said Dr AnantMohan, lungs specialist, AIIMS. WHAT NEXT To reduce vehicular pollution the government has taken measures such as introduction of BS-VI standards for fuel by 2020. This will cut down diesel vehicle emissions to petrol levels for all pollutants and slash 55% of the particulate matter and 47% of nitrous oxide emissions. Besides this, initiatives are also being taken to encourage the market of e-vehicles in the city./However, this not enough to control vehicular emission./""Just giving subsidies on e-vehicles will not help. The government first needs to provide proper infrastructure. I have two electricity driven cars but I think twice before taking them out for long rides. There are no charging points anywherein the city and I have to rely on personal is ed charging kits which I got along with the car,"" said Sunil Kumar Dahiya, a pilot with a private airline who has been using e-cars for the past two years now./Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said vehicular emission has remained a significant source of pollution in the city and the government's odd-even road rationing scheme and orders to limit the registration of diesel vehicles have proved this./""The government needs to proactively work on a comprehensive policy package that includes phasing in a policy of obsolescence for vehicles, congestion fees, expansion and integration of public transport. Measures have been taken, but we need to keep up the momentum and encourage public participation,"" Roychowdhury said./In 2013, Dr Sara th Guttikunda published a study on environment according to which vehicular emissions contributed90%, 54% and33% to NitrogenOxide (NOx), suspended particulate matter and sulphur dioxide (SO2) emission, respectively./In the same year, a study led by Dr Pramil a Goy al of II T-Delhi' s Centre for Atmospheric Studies flagged emissions from two wheelers as a' matter of concern '. Two wheelers contribute between 40% and 60% of the total pollution from vehicles, the study said. It identified Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCVs) to be the major contributors to particulates (92%)./Market trends also show the city's heavy reliance on private vehicles. Last year, Delhi recorded a 9.5% increase in the sale of cars, excluding the luxury segment./""Only a good public transport system can reduce people's dependence on private vehicles. If we do not provide them a comfortable, cheap-and-well-connected alternative, it will be unfair to expect people to not use their cars,"" said PK Sarkar, head of department (transport planning) at the School of Planning and Architecture. ""As the dependence on private vehicles increases, the air pollution levels will become more uncontrollable.""/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

It reduces during the monsoons, but goes up again during the winters,"" the minister said./He also took a dig at the BJPled municipal corporations for not cleaning the garbage, which, he said has also contributed to the outbreak of mosquito-borne disease. ""They (municipal corporations) do not do their job of keeping Delhi clean, they are just good for taking money,"" he said./Jain credited the fogging drive by the AAP government for the reduction in the number of people coming to Delhi government hospitals with fever. ""The government has been conducting fogging for the last seven -eight days and we have seen that the number of fever cases coming to the hospitals has gone down in the past 2 -3 days,"" the minister said./He also assured that adequate measures have been taken for treating fever patients./""All the dispensaries and mohalla clinics are running on all seven days of the week to take care of fever patients, fever corners in the hospitals are running round-the-clock,"" Jain said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Rain fails to clear Delhi's haze,"New Delhi, Oct. 5 -- The Capital was enveloped in the season's first haze on Tuesday morning, followed by light to moderate rains in the evening. However, the rain failed to clear the air as pollution peaked to a three-month high./Delhi environment minister Imran Hussain wrote to union minister of state for environment (independent charge) Anil Madhav Dave and the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Hussain urged the state governments to curb burning of crop stubble, which is a major source of pollutants in Delhi's air./""With the onset of winter, Delhi enters a critical phase of air pollution due to meteorological conditions like wind pattern, low temperature, etc, which aggravate levels of pollutants, especially particulate matter such PM 2.5 and PM 10 in Delhi's air,"" Hussain wrote./""I therefore request you to kindly issue necessary instructions for preventing burning of agricultural residue,"" the Delhi minister wrote./According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), areas around Pusa, Delhi University and Ridge witnessed substantial rainfall recorded at 22 mm, 17.0 mm and 16.5 mm. Surprisingly, it was in these areas that the air quality worsened insteadofimproving,contraryto the general perception./The real-time air quality index of System of Air quality and weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) indicated that both Pusa and Delhi University had as much as 320 microgrampercubicmetre( mu/m3)of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 against the prescribed 60 mu/m3 norm. Even PM10, which are relative thicker pollutants, were found to be fairly above the stan- dard norm of 100 mu/m3./Officials of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) clarified that the phenomena is haze and not smog. ""There is a lot of dust in the air, but no smoke so far. Moderate duststorm was recorded before the rain that increased humidity up to 85 per cent,"" an official explained./""Hence, the concentration of dust and pollutants increased./But, we cannot call it smog as yet and gaseous pollutants are well within permissible standards,"" the official said./Smog engulfs the city mostly due to stubble burning in NCR and other states which normally begins from mid-October.

Noida residents complain of open burning of waste in several sectors,"NOIDA, Oct. 8 -- Residents of sectors 62, 63, 63B and 70 have expressed concern about garbage being burnt in the open on roadsides and in vacant plots in their areas. Burning of solid waste in the open pollutes the air, endangering the health of those living nearby./On April 28, 2015, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had imposed a complete ban on burning of waste - including garbage, leaves, plastic and crop residues - in the open. The NGT also directed a fine of Rs 5,000 to be levied on those violating its order. However, that has not stopped those engaging in burning waste in Noida./""The staff of the Noida authority collects solid waste and dumps it in a vacant plot behind group housing complexes. Every day some unidentified persons burn this waste, causing air pollution. The authority should stop this immediately. The Noida authority, forest department and other agencies are not stopping the waste being burnt and are also allowing the cutting, nailing and damaging of trees,"" said Sharad Tiwari, an environmentalist staying in Sector 62./Unidentified persons are also dumping and burning solid waste on a road connecting Sector 63 (an industrial area) with Sector 70, a newly developed residential area. Residents are forced to put up with the smell of burning plastic and the smoke entering their houses./""Solid waste, including plastic and papers etc, are kept burning on this road, polluting the air. The Noida authority does not act on our complaints. The practice of burning waste in the open is prevalent in other areas of Noida too,"" said Brij Mohan Tyagi of Sector 70./In a 2015 study, the Housing and urban development corporation (Hudco) had said that Noida's population of 14 lakh that year generated nearly 660 tonnes of waste daily. Hudco is a government agency and consultant with the Noida authority for waste disposal. Its study further estimated that by 2016, the city's 15.77 lakh population would generate 757 tonnes of waste daily, which would go up to 1,074 tonnes a day by 25 lakh Noida residents in 2021./Despite this, the 40-year-old city lacks a landfill site for waste disposal. ""We are likely to begin the tender process to select a private agency that will develop a Rs 60-crore plant for waste disposal in Greater Noida's Astoli village. The plant is expected to be operational by 2018. However, solid waste should not be burnt at all,"" said Samakant Shrivastava, senior project engineer, Noida authority./In the absence of a landfill site, solid waste in Noida is being dumped anywhere at vacant plots in sectors 136, 62, 85 and others./""I will instruct inspectors to identify those who burnt waste and levy a penalty as per the NGT order,"" said SK Gupta, project engineer, health department, Noida authority./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Noida & Ghaziabad.

Delhi gasps for breath as construction dust envelopes NCR,"Gurgaon/Noida/Ghaziabad, Oct. 12 -- 'Peaceful life', 'green surroundings' and 'quality living' are some of the promises with which real estate hoardings lure buyers to Delhi's satellite towns. The reality, though, is completely different./For over a decade, the cycle of construction and growth has given the cities of Ghaziabad, Noida and Gurgaon an ever-rising skyline and a persistent blanket of dust./According to the Haryana Pollution Control Board, the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in Gurgaon increased from 350 micro g/m3 in 2015 to 415 micro g/m3 in 2016. Though the equivalent figures are much lower in Noida and Ghaziabad, a report by the Greater Noida authority revealed that construction projects are the main cause of air pollution there./As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), on October 8 evening, Noida's PM10 (particulate matter) was 213 microgrammes per cubic metre as against the permissible limit of 100. ""The level is more than double the permissible limit in areas around sector 62. In other parts of Noida, the air is even more polluted. Air pollution is worst in Greater Noida West, where construction is underway on around 80 realty projects,"" said Sharad Tiwari, an environmentalist./The problem largely stems from the absence of measures to prevent pollution at construction sites. These sites do not have cover scaffoldings and water is not sprinkled to prevent dispersal of dust as directed by the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF)./Similarly, adequate arrangements are not made for transportation of construction material despite an NGT order . The April 2015 order say a person/builder will be liable to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 per violation in relation to construction activity and Rs 5,000 for transportation of construction material or debris without covering it./""The internal roads in Gurgaon's sector 77, 76, 78 are filled with dust as the roads are broken and dumpers carrying construction material flout NGT norms. It is hard to breathe on the main road that connects sector 77 and sector 62 due to the construction of Metro and underpass. I have stopped using my motorbike on this route and travel by car,"" said Amit Gupta, a software engineer and resident of sector 77./The situation is equally grim in the new sectors of Gurgaon, where a majority of buildings are under construction. These areas are wrapped in a permanent haze and residents claim they never see a clear sky. ""Dust clouds cover the sky completely. Living in these areas is difficult as we rarely get fresh air. Each year, the region receives less rainfall and the dust never settles,"" said Kavita Saini, a resident of GPL Eden Heights, Sector-70./Acting on the NGT order, the Greater Noida authority slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 each on 40 builders for causing dust pollution. The authority fined six contractors for burning waste instead of disposing it in an authorised manner. Since April 2015, the Noida authority has levied Rs 1,18,50,000 as penalty on 37 builders who flouted the NGT's order and caused air pollution./The Noida authority attempted to use dust sucking machines on the lines of Gurgaon to reduce air pollution but the plan did not work. ""Our officials studied the system but the plan was not economically viable. The authority has hired a private agency for mechanical sweeping on Master Plan-I, II, III, Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and Dadri-Surjapur-Chhalera road,"" said Saumya Srivastava deputy chief executive officer of the Noida authority./""Our teams go on random inspections and we take action if they find a realtor violating NGT directions,"" said SC Gaur, chief architect and town planner of the Noida authority. In Gurgaon such inspections are a distant dream./Similarly, the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has so far imposed penalty in 44 cases where notices were issued to developers or those undertaking construction under the authority's jurisdiction. The authority collected a penalty amount of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000 in 34 of these cases./""We are conducting regular drives to check compliance with the NGT orders and developers and sites have been penalized. Action is also taken up on public complaints,"" said DP Singh, officer on special duty, GDA./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

No respite in sight from dust in Gurgaon,"Gurgaon, Oct. 12 -- Chandan Singh, from Hermu in Jharkhand, works at a construction site on Golf Course road. He handles cement with his bare hands and says he finds it hard to breath due to the dust. ""All my life I have worked at construction sites. As these sites are spreading, it is sometimes difficult to sleep and people here cough for months,"" he says./In the absence of measures to control pollution from construction sites, thousands of labourers like Chandan have to survive in hazardous conditions every day./According to the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) guidelines, civic authorities should take measures to ensure toxins from construction machinery and vehicles, and construction dust are not released in the air. Similarly, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) ordered that for construction activity beyond 2 lakh sqft, clearance has to be taken from the government on 70 environmental safety parameters notified by MoEF./As per construction norms, sites should be covered with a tarpaulin sheet to prevent spread of dust. But on ground, these norms are nowhere to be seen./""Only by implementing norms can the pollution levels be reduced. Though several factors are responsible for air pollution, dust from construction sites in the region is a major contributor,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE./Environmentalists say as workers are unaware of the norms, the developers get away with violations. ""The pollution at construction sites affects the labourers much more. But the measures to curb air pollution are not followed by the developers. People in the city suffer from many respiratory diseases but none of the civic agencies keep watch on rampant construction work,"" said Vivek Kamboj, an activist./Officials at pollution department admit that workers handle cement with bare hands and do not have face masks or protective head gear. But they said implementation of guidelines is a problem. ""We deal strictly with them but implementation is a huge issue because of large-scale construction projects and little awareness,"" said Bhupender Singh, district pollution officer./Site managers say they never had any inspection for environment norms. ""Norms like washing the site and the vehicles are not practical. On one hand we are asked not to waste water and on other they want us to clean everything,"" a site manager at Golf Course Road said./To reduce the amount of dust produced at a construction site, some developers are now looking at new-age technology. One such model, called Mivan technology which originated from Malaysia, is being used for a housing project in Sector 70./This shuttering technology uses an aluminium framework with RCC (Reinforced Cement concrete) instead of brick walls. ""As the traditional red brick is not used, it generates less dust and lowers pollution levels,"" said Parveen Jain, managing director of Tulip, which is using this technology./This process combines cement, concrete with aluminium bars to utilize the compressive strength of concrete and tensile strength of aluminium simultaneously./Reinforced concrete is a fluid material which can be economically molded into shapes and does not emit dust, the developer said./This is Part 4 of our ongoing series 'Save our Lungs', which looks at how to combat pollution in Delhi./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Chembur, Deonar bear the brunt of city's air-pollution problems: Survey","Mumbai, Oct. 16 -- Almost half the population of Chembur and Deonar suffers from air pollution-induced health ailments, a survey found./The study stated that of the 406 residents surveyed at Mahulgaon in Chembur, 46.7% were unhealthy. At Bainganwadi in Deonar, more than four of 10 respondents had respiratory problems./As a part of the Environment Status Report from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Environmental Pollution Research Centre (EPRC) of KEM Hospital carried out a respiratory morbidity survey of 2,483 patients across the city between 2015 -16, mostly focusing on workplaces and residential areas./Pollution levels in the city soared during the Deonar dumping ground fires in February and March. ""The study published is the beginning of a comprehensive research. We will monitor vulnerable areas from now on,"" said Athavle./The EPRC team conducted the survey in February, a month after the fire. The study found that more than one-fourth respondents at Neelkanth Gardens complained of choking, 26.2% were coughing and 17.8% had breathlessness, 57.9% people had eye-irritation and 73.8% were perturbed by the strong smell in the area./At Kamla Raman Nagar and Rafiq Nagar in Bainganwadi, residents had repeated complaints of choking. While 33.7% suffered from cough, 23.3% complained of breathlessness and 48.8% had eye -irritation./The report highlighted a number of preventive measures for residents living close to dumping grounds. ""There is an immediate requirement for environmental engineering control measures to prevent landfill site-related pollution exposure. This, combined with health education and awareness regarding prevention and early diagnosis of asthma is needed,"" the report recommended./HT had reported on March 23 that doctors from areas near the Deonar landfill had witnessed a 25% rise in respiratory ailments after the fire./Swami Kandaswami, 55, a labourer and odd job technician from Ghatkopar, on his visit to Deonar to repair a water tanker earlier this year, fell unconscious, allegedly due to inhaling toxic fumes emanating from the dump. ""The fumes made me extremely nauseous. People in the area told me they face this issue all the time. It was a bad experience,"" he said./Doctors from Sion Hospital treating Kandaswami said that while they could not conclusively establish whether his condition was entirely caused by a gas, his prevailing heart condition was certainly aggravated after inhaling toxic fumes. ""He was suffering from a heart condition, in which the blood supply to the brain is not normal and it differs depending upon the exertion of the body,"" said a doctor from the hospital./Doctors said pollutants from the dumping ground, especially particulate matter - small pollutants that can easily enter our lungs, leading to ailments - is one of the major issues that reduces the ability of the lungs to protect itself from microorganisms./""Cilia (hair-like projections) move microorganisms and harmful particles up and out of the airways to protect the lungs. However, they are killed due to particulate matter. Once this defence mechanism collapses, the particles enter the lungs and result in multiple pulmonary issues such as chronic bronchitis - the most common disorder - respiratory tract disorders, tuberculosis, cardiac issues and other chronic diseases,"" said Dr Rajendra Nanaware, senior pulmonologist and medical superintendent, Sewri TB Hospital./Case Studies/Impact of Deonar fire: Did not leave his house for four days./Chembur resident Atul Deshpande, 76, said he had not left his house for four days during the Deonar dumping ground fire, as he suffers from allergic rhinitis. ""Whenever there is still excess smoke in the air, I start coughing and sneezing. I am forced to take medicines and use a nebuliser twice a day. While it has been better during the monsoon, the air around Deonar still makes it difficult for me to take long walks during the evenings,"" he said./RCF colony chokes on toxic fumes/Residents of RCF colony in Chembur said that over the past year, they have been waking up to the nauseating smell of toxic gases daily. ""Chemical waste dumped in the nearby nullahs is also burnt twice a day opposite our colony, near the Eastern Freeway. However, no action has been taken by the authorities,"" a resident said./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Care4air campaign gains momentum,"VARANASI, Oct. 21 -- A group of volunteers will create a people's green manifesto and would strongly appeal to political parties to include it in their political manifesto in order to keep an effective check on growing air pollution under care 4 air campaign. The volunteers took the decision on Thrusday in a workshop organised by Whistle Blower Trust in association with chemical engineering department, IITBHU at the department itself. /The Trust runs the campaign care 4 air. It motivates people for using solar energy. Chief campaigner Ekta Shekhar said, ""Volunteers together took a resolution to draft a people's green manifesto, including the demands for CNG, maximum utilisation of solar energy, better waste management, better public transport systems in order to control the increasing air pollution in the state. Then, we will appeal political parties to implement the same in their respective poll manifestoes."" Shekhar said the volunteers, who work for controlling air pollution, from Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Chandauli, Mirzapur, Bhadohi and Sonbhadra attended the workshop. They have agreed to create a coalition that will continue to work as a pressure group on all stakeholders including political parties and the state government for achieving the goal. Chemical engineering department head Prof PK Mihsra said, ""Harmful particles are continuously increasing in air due to incessant industrialization. Care 4 Air is a good effort. Such efforts are required to be taken at each town across eastern UP to solve the problem of air pollution."" Prof Mishra said that people need to be made aware about the preventive measures for controlling the pollution level. Referring to various researches and reports, senior campaigner of Greenpeace India Sunil Dahiya said that air pollution borne diseases cause a death every 18 minutes. This is alarming. The state and centre should together form a policy to control the air pollution and people can breathe fresh air. Campaigner Neha Yadav apprised volunteers of effective use of social media for making people aware about ways which could help in controlling air pollution. Dr SK Pathak threw a light on how air pollution gave rise to number of asthma, heart attack, allergy and cancer in Banaras and surrounding areas. Several social activists participated in the workshop./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Varanasi.

Air quality in Kashi way below WHO standard: CEED report,"VARANASI, Oct. 21 -- The particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentration in the city air has exceeded the prescribed World Health Organisation (WHO) standards by two to three times, revealed a study by Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED). At a press conference on Thursday, chief executive officer (CEO) of the organisation Ramapati Kumar shared details of a study report 'Ambient Air Quality in Varanasi' that gives a detailed analysis of the deteriorating air quality in the city. The samples for study were collected between August 1 and September 30 in temple town. /""The findings of the report state that the particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentration in the city has exceeded the prescribed World Health Organisation (WHO) standards by two to three times. Given the fact that the air quality usually fares better during monsoon than the rest of the season, the poor air quality in Varanasi is a matter of serious concern."" ""We need an immediate clean air action plan from the state government to curb the growing menace of air pollution in the city and improve the ambient air quality. It is imperative to chalk out a well defined policy and programme to give Varanasi a healthy environment to breathe in,"" said Kumar. Programme manager (CEED) Ankita Jyoti presented the details. Jyoti highlighted that as per the study, the maximum 24-hour mean concentration for PM2.5 was recorded on September 19, 2016 with a value of 145ug/m3 . This recorded value was 5.8 times higher than the prescribed WHO limit. As per the CPCB standards, the above mentioned value is likely to cause respiratory ailments to people with prolonged exposure to the air, and may cause severe health problems to patients with lung and cardiac diseases. During the sample period (August - September), the average PM2.5 concentration was noted to be 56.2 ug/m3. As per the WHO guidelines, this value suggests a 2.5% increase in the short-term mortality rate. Jyoti further added that the period around midnight displayed better air quality as compared to the other three time-periods of the day. Such a result is attributed to the dilution due to higher boundary layer and lesser traffic. The corrective steps need to be taken on an urgent basis in order to improve the air quality in Varanasi. The government must not only chalk out effective clean air action plan, but should also maintain transparency at sharing the pollution data of the city./Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Varanasi.

"Vehicle smoke, road dust add to winter air pollution in Delhi","New Delhi, Oct. 24 -- Apart from stubble burning by neighbouring states, the Capital has to battle pollution from millions of vehicles, construction and road dust./The problem becomes graver during winters. ""With winter approaching, Delhi and other parts of north India show a noticeable spike in air pollution,"" said Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) executive director Anumita Roychowdhury./She said Delhi also suffers from the lacklustre attitude of its own authorities and people. ""Others (contributors of pollution) are industrial waste and diesel trucks and interstate buses entering the city.""/A study conducted by IIT Kanpur on Delhi's pollution levels says that emissions from vehicles are the second largest source of particulate matter, especially PM2.5. Construction dust and stubble burning are the other sources./Vehicular pollution grew from 64% to 72% between 1990 and 2000, the report says. In winter, vehicles contribute 25% to PM2.5. At places, it could be above 35%. It also says that diesel vehicles contribute significantly to PM10 and PM2.5./Delhi has over 8.9 million registered vehicles. In addition, 570,000 personal and passenger vehicles enter Delhi every day, shows a CSE study in June./In comparison, a total of 569,000 vehicles were registered in the city in 2014-15, according to the Economic Survey of Delhi. This shows that the number of vehicles coming into Delhi daily is almost equal to the number registered in the city in a year./""The number of vehicles on the roads is increasing every day, but the space is the same. So, vehicles crawl on the road. With lower speed, engine efficiency reduces and emission levels increase,"" said senior principal scientist at CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), Dr S Velmurugan./The city's average speed has gone down from 20 kilometres an hour to 5 kilometres an hour over five years, he said quoting studies by CSIR-CRRI./ROAD AND CONSTRUCTION DUST/The daily PM10 and PM2.5 emissions from road dust are 79,626 kilos and 22,165 kilos, respectively. Broken and poorly maintained roads, a regular sight in Delhi, also cause significant non-exhaust road dust emissions./Also, construction dust contributes to 40% of the city's total waste generated./""The most harmful element in construction matter is silica which often escapes the human body's filter mechanism. Over a period of time, it shrinks lung capacity and makes the person vulnerable to all kinds of infections,"" said Dr Neeraj Jain, chest specialist at Ganga Ram Hospital./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution: China on track but Delhi still on a death wish every Diwali,"India, Oct. 24 -- American astronaut Scott Kelly spent a year watching the earth from the space. The clouds of pollution over India and China shocked him./For a single day last summer, Kelly could see the eastern part of China, its 200 cities, clearly. ""The next day I heard that the Chinese government had turned off a lot of the coal-producing power plants, stopped the cars from running in that part of the country for this national holiday, and the sky had completely cleared,"" Kelly told PTI in Washington last week./""It's interesting to see just how quickly we can have a positive impact on (environment) if we decide,"" said Kelly, who returned to earth in March 2016. He did not mention if he ever had a clear view of India from up there. He probably did not get any./If China could clear its skies, albeit for just one day, India manages the opposite in a matter of hours every Diwali evening when cracker-bursting and fireworks turn towns and cities into mass gas chambers. Every year, our courts, administrations and citizens promise to be kinder to the environment the next time. But each Diwali turns out to be worse than the last./Delhi is rated as one of the most polluted capitals of the world. Air pollution is making us vulnerable to lung infections, heart attacks and cancer. A 2008 study by Central Pollution Control Board found that more than two-fifths of Delhi's schoolchildren had reduced lung function and the damage was likely to be irreversible. The Centre for Science and Environment found that air pollution-related diseases cause more than 3,000 premature deaths every year./Track pollution in your city with this real-time air quality map/Fireworks that light up Diwali skies contain the worst possible toxins. It is the gunpowder that fuels them up. It is the metallic compounds that colour their explosions. The dazzles of whites are created by burning up aluminium that affects brain and lungs. The blazing red is released from lithium and strontium compounds that can hamper bone growth in children. Fireworks often contain carcinogenic or hormone-disrupting substances that can seep into soil and water, not to mention the lung-clogging smoke they release and plastic debris they scatter./Inexplicably, no amount of persuasion seems to be enough to stop Delhi from poisoning the already foul air. Every Diwali, the national capital appears to be on a death wish./Globally, religious rituals collide with environmentalism. For his book, When God isn't Green, Boston University professor Jay Wexler travelled around the world to find ""Hindus in Mumbai carrying 25-foot plaster idols of Ganesh into the sea, Taoists in Hong Kong creating poisonous fumes by burning bushels of 'ghost money', and American Palm Sunday celebrants contributing to the deforestation of Central American palm forests""./As argued in this column earlier, no religious excuse can justify environmentally disastrous rituals. There is anyway nothing religious about converting a festival of light into a cracker-bursting competition. Last year, the Delhi high court noted that ""Diwali has religious context only in illuminating the buildings traditionally with diyas. There was nothing to suggest that bursting of firecrackers is related to any religious tenet.""/Even when it comes to fireworks, China restricted the age-old tradition in 700 cities last year. This Chinese New Year, Shanghai banned all fireworks in the inner-city areas surrounding its outer ring road. The police recruited more than 300,000 volunteers to enforce the rules and imposed fines up to $75./Post-festival, the air quality didn't improve because the outskirts and rural neighbourhoods had no such restriction. But those living along the ring road reported a quieter New Year and sanitation workers' cleaned up 80% less firework waste in Shanghai this year./Shanghaiist, a popular website on city affairs, quoted a poll by China News saying 52% of the 7,000 respondents were not ""hot on the use of crackers"", and only 41% insisted on ""the necessity of fireworks for celebration""./While China makes the right noises, we remain resigned to suicidal traditions. Even the Supreme Court last year refused to ban bursting of crackers during Diwali or direct authorities to earmark designated places for, saying it was not possible to issue orders that cannot be implemented./And just like that, we gave up without even trying./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Capital chokes on neighbours' smoke,"KARNAL/KURUKSHETRA/PATIALA, Oct. 24 -- Plumes of blinding smoke rise from the fields in Haryana's Indri village, over 150 kilometres from the national capital./Every second farm in the area has been set ablaze as it is the season for stubble burning./On October 17 and 20, the number of red dots in the 'fire map' by NASA grew considerably in Haryana and Punjab./The ill-effects of these fires are not limited to the two states. They travel to Delhi because of the westerly winds, causing major health concerns among people, say environment experts./Apart from the lungs, the smoke also affects the brain, eyes and the nervous system, say doctors./A study by IIT Kanpur listed stubble burning as the third highest contributor to Delhi's winter air-pollution, after construction dust and vehicular fumes./Stubble is eight to 10 inches of straw that stands behind after paddy, wheat and other crops have been harvested using a machine. Farmers usually burn the stubble to prepare the fields for the next sowing season./India produces 550 million tonnes of crop residue every year, with Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana being the highest producers./A 2012 study estimated that Punjab and Haryana burnt 80% of rice residue, while Uttar Pradesh burnt 25%./The Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) held a meeting with the Punjab and Haryana governments on Wednesday to discuss the burning issue./""We have asked the governments to take both coercive and incentive measures to discourage farmers from burning their crop residue. We have suggested that the governments should/Rs 100 an acre to farmers to purchase no-till machines,"" said EPCA chairperson, Bhure Lal, who headed the meeting./STUBBLE POLITICS/Despite multiple court orders banning stubble burning and instituting fines, Punjab farmers continue the age-old practice undeterred. The administration of the state, going to polls in 2017, has fined only one offender in October. There have been just eight prosecutions in 2016 so far. In 2015, the figure was 16./There was no major stubble burning during wheat harvesting this year, said PPCB chairman, Manpreet Singh Chhatwal. Paddy harvesting has just begun and figures will come to us after November 15, he said./""Due to mounting tension at the Indian-Pakistan border, farmers of seven districts were given free hand to harvest and clear fields. So, the administration didn't act in some cases,"" said Chhatwal./In comparison, Haryana fined 575 farmers till October 19 and collected Rs 4.12 lakh in fines, Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary, S Narayanan, said./In Kurukshetra district, 146 offenders were fined in the last two weeks./Haryana officials say the cases of stubble burning have reduced this year because of heavy prosecutions. Government agencies have also roped in patvaris, gram sachivs and village sarpanchs to reign in the malpractice./In Haryana, offenders have to pay a fine of Rs 2,500 an acre. In Punjab, violators are liable to a highest fine of Rs 1000 an acre and a maximum jail term of six months./NO ALTERNATIVES: FARMERS/When HT visited the fields around Haryana's Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Karnal and Panipat districts, many farmers blamed the lack of an alternative for crop residue burning./They have limited time between crop cycles to ready the land for the next season, they said. By October second week, the farmers of Haryana and Punjab start burning the residue./In Kurukshetra, Karnal and Panipat, many fields are already covered in black ash, after the burning./Farmer Sukhwant Singh of Kurukshetra's Bhore village said most farmers in his village follow a wheat-paddy cycle every year. Burning is the easiest and cheapest way to ready the field, he said./After the fields cool off, most farmers cultivate potato and mustard between cycles to reclaim the soil's nutrients./""We don't know any other option but to burn the stubble. We have a lot of land and harvesting manually is not possible. When combines (machines) are used for harvesting, the stubble left behind is of no use to us. What do we do with it?"" said Singh, who owns a six-acre farm./Machine-generated remains do not mix with the soil. The ash from burning, on the other hand, is good manure for the fields, farmer Mahabir Chand said./'IT'S CHEAP TO BURN WASTE'/Manually harvesting crops doesn't leave much stubble, said Punjab and Haryana farmers. However, labour is expensive and not easily available./The labour cost for manual harvesting is Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 an acre. Renting a combine costs/Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. It takes just half an hour to harvest an acre of land using a combine./""We are already running into losses with the low rates for our produce. How can we bear the expenses of the clearance of our fields?"" said Satnam Singh Behru, head of a farmer's group./BLAME GAME/Kurukshetra district's deputy commissioner, Sumedha Kataria, refutes farmers' claims that the ash left behind after stubble burning nourishes the soil./Apart from health effects and the evening haze bringing the city's traffic to a standstill, burning kills microbial activity in the soil, she said./""These farmers think there is no other option but the truth is that there are several better alternatives... The stubble generated can be sold off to paper and cardboard factories and can also be used to generate power,"" she said./Kataria said the administration is educating farmers about alternatives./The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) rubbished charges that state's stubble burning cause pollution in Delhi./""We have scientific data of Panipat and Karnal, where air quality remains normal, when smog engulfs Delhi. It is not possible that Punjab's paddy pollution reaches Delhi bypassing Karnal and Panipat. There must be other reasons, but paddy straw burning is not wholly liable for smog in Delhi,"" said PPCB scientific officer, Charanjit Singh./Delhi's environment experts did not agree. ""Crop burning is a major component of Delhi pollution during winters. This is not only harming Delhi's residents but the residents of Punjab as well. It is high time the government works hand-in-hand instead of living in denial and indulging in blame game,"" said Centre for Science and Environment director, Anumita Roychowdhury./DELHI BEARS THE BRUNT/Every year, farm fires in the surrounding states raise pollutants in the Delhi's air by over six times the permissible limit, show data./The smoke often rises and swarms over Delhi, especially during winters, when the city is most vulnerable to toxic smog./Over 25% of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 17% of PM10 in Delhi's winter air is from burning of agriculture waste in the fields around the city, according to the IIT- Kanpur study./PM2.5 and PM10 are fine particles with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 micrometres, respectively. Permissible limits of PM2.5 and PM10 are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre./""The Delhi government has been writing to the governments of Haryana and Punjab to control stubble burning in their states. We want to work with them to control air pollution,"" said Delhi health minister, Satyendar Jain./The smoke produced by stubble burning contains toxic substances, including PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx)./A joint study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and University of California, San Diego, in early October found that over 40% of the PM2.5 in Delhi originates from outside the city. The findings also showed that 60% to 80% of Delhi's bad ozone, an air pollutant, was from sources outside the city./By mid-October, the winds carry the fumes from the blaze to Delhi, where the low winter wind speeds makes pollutants settle in the atmosphere./'GOVT SHOULD PROMOTE STUBBLE SELLING'/Even if the stubble can be useful as raw material for the cardboard and paper industries, the government has not helped to sell it, said farmers./""If the government makes some provision to collect the waste, we are even ready to pay them for their services. You cannot just fine farmers without showing them an alternative,"" said Indri farmer Balwant Singh./The residue can also be used to generate power. The Haryana government is planning to set up a power plant in Panipat that will consume the stubble from villages to produce energy for the entire state./The government also gives a subsidy of Rs 1 lakh to buy New Holand machines, which cut crops with minimum stubble.

Delhi chokes on smoke from neighbouring states,"India, Oct. 24 -- Plumes of blinding smoke rise from the fields in Haryana's Indri village, over 150 kilometres from the National Capital./Every second farm in the area has been set ablaze as it is the season for stubble burning./On October 17 and 20, the number of red dots in the 'fire map' by NASA grew considerably in Haryana and Punjab./The ill-effects of these fires are not limited to the two states. They travel to Delhi because of the westerly winds, causing major health concerns among people, say environment experts./Apart from the lungs, the smoke also affects the brain, eyes and the nervous system, say doctors./A study by IIT Kanpur listed stubble burning as the third highest contributor to Delhi's winter air-pollution, after construction dust and vehicular fumes./Stubble is eight to 10 inches of straw that stands behind after paddy, wheat and other crops have been harvested using a machine. Farmers usually burn the stubble to prepare the fields for the next sowing season./India produces 550 million tonnes of crop residue every year, with Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana being the highest producers./A 2012 study estimated that Punjab and Haryana burnt 80% of rice residue, while Uttar Pradesh burnt 25%./The Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) held a meeting with the Punjab and Haryana governments on Wednesday to discuss the burning issue./""We have asked the governments to take both coercive and incentive measures to discourage farmers from burning their crop residue. We have suggested that the governments should R100 an acre to farmers to purchase no-till machines,"" said EPCA chairperson, Bhure Lal, who headed the meeting./STUBBLE POLITICS/Despite multiple court orders banning stubble burning and instituting fines, Punjab farmers continue the age-old practice undeterred. The administration of the state, going to polls in 2017, has fined only one offender in October. There have been just eight prosecutions in 2016 so far. In 2015, the figure stood at 16./There was no major stubble burning during wheat harvesting this year, said PPCB chairman, Manpreet Singh Chhatwal. Paddy harvesting has just begun and figures will come to us after November 15, he said./""Because of the mounting tension at the Indian-Pakistan border, farmers of seven districts were given free hand to harvest and clear fields. So, the administration didn't act in some cases,"" said Chhatwal./In comparison, Haryana fined 575 farmers till October 19 and collected Rs 4.12 lakh in fines, Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary, S Narayanan, said./In Kurukshetra district alone, at least 146 offenders were fined in the last two weeks./Haryana officials say the cases of stubble burning have reduced this year because of heavy prosecutions. Government agencies have also roped in patvaris, gram sachivs and village sarpanchs to reign in the malpractice./In Haryana, offenders have to pay a fine of Rs 2,500 an acre. In Punjab, violators are liable to a highest fine of Rs 1,000 an acre and a maximum jail term of six months./NO ALTERNATIVES, SAY FARMERS/When HT visited the fields around Haryana's Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Karnal and Panipat districts, many farmers blamed the lack of an alternative for crop residue burning./They have limited time between crop cycles to ready the land for the next season, they said. By October second week, the farmers of Haryana and Punjab start burning the residue./In Kurukshetra, Karnal and Panipat, many fields are already covered in black ash, after the burning./Farmer Sukhwant Singh of Kurukshetra's Bhore village said most farmers in his village follow a wheat-paddy cycle every year. Burning is the easiest and the cheapest way to prepare the field, he said./After the fields cool off, most farmers cultivate potato and mustard between cycles to reclaim the soil's nutrients./""We don't know of any other option but to burn the stubble. We have a lot of land and harvesting manually is not possible. When combines (machines) are used for harvesting, the stubble left behind is of no use to us. What do we do with it?"" said Singh, who owns six-acre farm./Machine-generated remains do not mix with the soil. The ash from burning, on the other hand, is good manure for the fields, farmer Mahabir Chand said./'IT'S CHEAP, EASY TO BURN WASTE'/Manually harvesting crops doesn't leave much stubble, said Punjab and Haryana farmers. However, labour is expensive and not easily available./The labour cost for manual harvesting is Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 an acre. On the other hand, renting a combine costs Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. It takes just half an hour to harvest an acre of land using a combine./""We are already running into losses with the low rates for our produce. How can we bear the expenses of the clearance of our fields?"" said Satnam Singh Behru, head of a farmer's group./BLAME GAME/Kurukshetra district's deputy commissioner, Sumedha Kataria, refutes farmers' claims that the ash left behind after stubble burning nourishes the soil./Apart from health effects and the evening haze bringing the city's traffic to a standstill, burning kills microbial activity in the soil, she said./""These farmers think there is no other option but the truth is that there are several better alternatives. The stubble generated can be sold off to paper and cardboard factories and can also be used to generate power,"" she said./Kataria said the administration is educating farmers about the alternatives./The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) rubbished charges that state's stubble burning cause pollution in Delhi./""We have scientific data of Panipat and Karnal, where air quality remains normal, when smog engulfs Delhi. It is not possible that Punjab's paddy pollution reaches Delhi bypassing Karnal and Panipat. There must be other reasons, but paddy straw burning is not wholly liable for smog in Delhi,"" said PPCB scientific officer, Charanjit Singh./Delhi's environment experts did not agree. ""Crop burning is a major component of Delhi pollution during winters. This is not only harming Delhi's residents but the residents of Punjab as well. It is high time the government works hand-in-hand instead of living in denial and indulging in blame game,"" said Centre for Science and Environment director, Anumita Roychowdhury./JAKARTA: The country has had trouble tackling the problem on vast stretches of rural land, much of which is hard to access. The government has been taking preventive measures with aerial monitoring of fields. In case a fire is spotted, it is doused immediately with water bombing and artificial rains./Nitrous Oxide (N2O): Long term inhalation can cause damage to brain,/Nitrogen Oxide (NOx): Cough, airway infection, chest pain, difficulty in breathing/Sulphur Dioxide (SO2): Eye irritation, wheezing, chest tightness, asthma/DELHI BEARS THE BRUNT/Every year, farm fires in the surrounding states raise pollutants in the Delhi's air by over six times the permissible limit, show data. The smoke often rises and swarms over Delhi, especially during winters, when the city is most vulnerable to toxic smog./Over 25% of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 17% of PM10 in Delhi's winter air is from burning of agriculture waste in the fields around the city, according to the IIT- Kanpur study./PM2.5 and PM10 are fine particles with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 micrometres, respectively. Permissible limits of PM2.5 and PM10 are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre./""The Delhi government has been regularly writing to the governments of Haryana and Punjab to control the problem of stubble burning in their states. We want to work with the neighbouring states to control the problem of air pollution,"" said Delhi health minister, Satyendar Jain./The smoke produced by stubble burning contains toxic substances, including PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx)./A joint study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and University of California, San Diego, in early October found that over 40% of the PM2.5 in Delhi originates from outside the city. The findings also showed that 60% to 80% of Delhi's bad ozone, an air pollutant, was from sources outside the city./By mid-October, the fumes from the blaze travel through the winds to reach Delhi, where the low winter wind speeds makes pollutants settle in the atmosphere./'GOVT SHOULD PROMOTE STUBBLE SELLING'/Even if the stubble can be useful as raw material for the cardboard and paper industries, the government has not helped to sell it, said farmers./""If the government makes some provision to collect the waste, we are even ready to pay them for their services. You cannot just fine farmers without showing them an alternative,"" said Indri farmer Balwant Singh./The residue can also be used to generate power. The Haryana government is planning to set up a power plant in Panipat that will consume the stubble from villages to produce energy for the entire state./The government also gives a subsidy of Rs 1 lakh to buy New Holand machines, which cut crops with minimum stubble. The Punjab government gives farmers a 50% subsidy on the machine's cost./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Vehicle smoke, road dust also cloud Delhi skies","NEW DELHI, Oct. 24 -- Apart from stubble burning by neighbouring states, the Capital has to battle pollution from millions of vehicles, construction and road dust./The problem becomes graver during winters. ""With winter approaching, Delhi and other parts of north India show a noticeable spike in air pollution,"" said Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) executive director Anumita Roychowdhury./She said Delhi also suffers from the lacklustre attitude of its own authorities and people. ""Others (contributors of pollution) are industrial waste and diesel trucks, interstate buses entering the city."" A study conducted by IIT Kanpur on Delhi's pollution levels says that emissions from vehicles are the second largest source of particulate matter, especially PM2.5. Construction dust and stubble burning are the other sources. Vehicular pollution grew from 64% to 72% between 1990 and 2000, the report says. In winter, vehicles contribute 25% to PM2.5. At places, it could be above 35%./It also says that diesel vehicles contribute significantly to PM10 and PM2.5./Delhi has over 8.9 million registered vehicles. Studies show that the number of vehicles coming into Delhi daily is almost equal to the number registered in the city in a year./""Vehicles crawl on the road because of lack of space.With lower speed,engine efficiency reduces and emission levels increase,"" said senior principal scientist at CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), Dr S Velmurugan./The city's average speed has gone down from 20 kilometres an hour to 5 kilometres an hour over five years, he said quoting studies by CSIR-CRRI./The daily PM10 and PM2.5 emissions from road dust are 79,626 kilos and 22,165 kilos, respectively. Broken and poorly maintained roads, a regular sight in Delhi, also cause significant non-exhaust road dust emissions./""The most harmful element in construction matter is silica which often escapes the human body's filter mechanism./Over a period of time, it shrinks lung capacity and makes the person vulnerable to all kinds of infections,"" said Dr Neeraj Jain, chest specialist at Ganga Ram Hospital./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion,"" read a health impact statement issued by SAFAR on the basis of their forecast./SAFAR monitors and predicts air quality at 10 locations in Mumbai on a real-time basis. Pollution levels are predicted by calculating weather factors such as windspeed, moisture, temperatures and amount of local emissions using high-resolution atmospheric chemistry transport prediction model on a supercomputer./The report identified that the most striking factor was that the share of PM 2.5 (small pollutant particles that can enter the lungs) in PM10 (slightly larger, coarser particles) are expected to increase by 10-20% during Diwali as compared to normal days./Air quality levels are expected to be 'poor' on Saturday at 235, Sunday, which is Diwali day (259), and Tuesday (245). AQI levels between 201-300 fall under the 'poor' category and 301-400 is 'very poor', indicating a health risk for people sensitive to air pollution./Researchers from SAFAR said the peak pollution hours are expected between Sunday night (October 30) and Monday morning (October 31) between 11pm to 3am. ""A higher level of pollution may be observed at night after Diwali, based on our hourly model forecast. A combination of several weather parameters plays a role in controlling air pollution.

Seriously?), we must adopt these simple strategies to cope./Commute/As pollution peaks across India in winter, start your day by going online to check pollution levels in your neighbourhood and city before stepping out./Several government and independent sites, including the Hindustan Times' Air Quality Index, give round-the-clock colour-coded information on fluctuating air pollution levels that can help you choose when and where to step out to lower exposure to air toxins./Avoid non-essential travel during peak hours and use public transport a far as possible. Even in neighbourhoods with low to moderate pollution, vehicular exhaust pushes up air pollution levels up to one km on either side of the road during peak hours./Drive with your windows rolled up or cover your mouth and nostrils with a N95 respirator, which filters out at least 95% of fine airborne particles. Fine pollutants pass through a normal surgical mask and cloth, but in the absence of a N95, use any form of protection to cover your nose and mouth./Outdoor activity/Don't exercise (walk, cycle or run) or play outdoors when pollution levels are high, which is usually in the morning. The health benefits of exercising outweigh the harzards of pollution only if you choose to exercise when the air quality index reading is lower than 160 microgram/m3, which is the tipping point after which any time spent exercising does more damage than good to your health. A study published in the journal Preventive Medicine last year In an average polluted city (44 microgram/m3 to 153 microgram/m3), physical exercise will remain beneficial for up to seven hours a day on a bicycle or walking for 16 hours. But in the most polluted cities such as Delhi, the tipping point when exercising began to hurt more than benefit started after 30 minutes of cycling a day and 90 minutes of walking./If you live in a polluted neighbourhood, walk indoors in a shopping mall or head for a gym. Limit the time your child spends playing outdoors during hours when the air quality is poor and for at least three days after Diwali, which is roughly the time the bad air takes to dissipate./Don't go near burning crackers or burn the trash generated the day after Diwali. Copper, cadmium, sulphur, aluminium and barium, among others, are added to crackers to produce the vibrant colours and sparkle, and the particulate matter and gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide that hang low in the atmosphere for hours, stinging our eyes and choking lungs./Breathing problems in people with asthma can aggravate suddenly, so keep an inhaler or nebuliser at hand. During this period, use prescription medicine, including steroids, to control your asthma. Sudden breathlessness and tightening of the chest should not be ignored. You must rush to a hospital emergency./Foods that beat pollution/Foods that fight inflammation and boost immunity do their bit in keeping your airways from reacting to the air toxins. Garlic contains medicinal compounds such as allicin and sulfhydryl, which give it its pungent smell and also make it a powerful immune booster and antimicrobial that fights infections. Having fresh garlic or garlic supplements protects against infection./Spring onion (scallion), which belongs to the garlic family, is also rich in organic sulfur compounds, as well as vitamin C, B vitamins, and trace minerals that fight infection and lower inflammation./Air pollution lowers the body's reserves of vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant found in vegetable oils, nuts, and green leafy vegetables that protect cells against the effects of free radicals, which are potentially damaging by-products of the body's metabolism. Free radicals cause cell damage that raises risk of heart disease, cancers and ageing./Vitamin C boosts resistance to infections, raises iron absorption and helps heal wounds. Amalaki (amla), guava, oranges, lemons, limes, green vegetables and melons are all rich sources of Vitamin C. One small alma contains more than 300 mg of vitamin C, compared to around 200 mg found in one guava, 70 mg in one orange, and 100 mg in one bell pepper. All bell peppers are high in vitamin C, but yellow pepper have the highest amount, followed by red./Follow @htlifeandstyle for more/Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Diwali triggers toxicity that stays throughout winter,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 29 -- Diwali is not a one night affair with high air pollution.The festival triggers haze and toxic smog that intensify as winter sets in and engulfs the city air till New Year./This year in all likelihood would be like the last five years when Delhi's air quality remained poor throughout the post-Diwali period. The particulate matter levels have crossed 500 micrograms in a cubic meter of air(micro g/m3)and could touch the 1,000 mark this Diwali season, if the past trends prevail./The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) data of the last five years showed that air quality has seen a gradual dip before the festival and continues deteriorating till mid-December./On November 3, 2015, the PM 2.5 levels touched 348.3 micrograms per cubic meter.It reached 605.7micrograms per cubic meter on Diwali - November 11, and remained high thereafter./The prime reason for the phenomenon is poor dispersal of pollutants because of the low wind speed and chilly condition.What compounds the problem is stubble and waste burning in and around Delhi during the season./""Inhaling high levels of gases such as sulphur dioxide which are released from cracker burning not only cause respiratory problems..,"" said Dr Anant Mohan,lung specialist at AIIMS./Environment experts said that the period between October 15 and November 20 records the worst pollution levels./""If the wind speed continues to be low, the toxic chemicals from crackers will deteriorate the capital's air quality further, making it a health emergency,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment./""Between mid-October and December there is no moisture in the air and the temperature is not very low.

"Delhi's kids show the way, say no to crackers for a clean Diwali","New Delhi, Oct. 29 -- Adults usually cite children as a reason for bursting crackers during Diwali, despite the effect on air quality, noise pollution levels, and one's health./But many children across the National Capital Region have set the record straight by refusing to use crackers this festive season./""I want to celebrate a green Diwali with diyas, lights and rangoli. The city looks beautiful with lights, but pollution spoils the fun,"" said third grader Aryaman Bharadwaj from Vaishali, Ghaziabad./While adults continue to indulge their children's requests for crackers, some lead the way for a cracker-free Diwali./'Let there be light'/Advaita Vijan (7)/Young Advaita has decided not to burst crackers after her two-year old sibling was hospitalised for respiratory problems earlier his year./""Bursting crackers is bad. The pollution has very bad effects,"" she said./Since Advaita's sister's developed respiratory problems, the family has been extra cautious, said their father, Sachin Vijan. ""We even considered moving out of the city,"" he said./Advaita will pay heed to her teacher's word of caution against crackers. ""My teacher told my class not to burst crackers this year. They pollute the air. The air is Delhi is already bad,"" said the Class-2 student at Shri Ram Millennium in Noida./Instead, she will celebrate the festival of lights in its truest sense. ""I love lights! So we will decorate our homes with loads of diyas, (LED) lights and (smoke-free) candles,"" she said./'There were no crackers during the time of Lord Ram'/Mihir Dhawan (13)/Mihir, an aspiring filmmaker, never liked firecrackers. ""As a child, I used to find them scary and disturbingly noisy. As I grew up, I realised how harmful it is to burst crackers, especially to animals,"" said the dog lover from Vasant Vihar./He once fostered a dog named Sherry. It irks him that people burst crackers, despite the effect toxic fumes and loud noises they have on animals. ""It is just cruel,"" he said./The Class-8 student at the American Embassy School realises Delhi's air quality deteriorates during Diwali. ""I remember reading somewhere that breathing for a day in Delhi hurts our lungs more than smoking.""/He feels people are too focused on having fun and forget about others. ""Some people have trouble breathing. Others are disturbed by the noise. We need to start respecting their needs,"" he said./Mihir's mother, Aparna Dhawan, feels crackers have gotten louder and more toxic. ""When we used burst crackers as kids, it smelt of smoke. Now, it smells of chemicals,"" she said./Mihir feels the festival should be celebrated with lights rather than crackers. ""When Lord Ram came back home after his vanvaas, he was welcomed home with diyas, not crackers,"" he says./'Itna shor kyun hain bhai?'/Tanya Borah (15)/Born to an environmentalist, Tanya has always found it disturbing to burst crackers for celebrations. She gave up crackers when she was 12./""Every year, there is so much noise around. I used to despise it. Earlier, Diwali was peaceful and about commemorating Lord Ram's return after the vanvaas. Today, it is all about the ""Dhamaka"" as can be seen in any ad run during Diwali,"" says the Class-10 student at Ambience Public School./She worries for people's health and Delhi's environment./""Even the morning after, there is a lot of residue, like the burnt remains, dust, etc., that litter the streets and pollute the air,"" said the Safdarjung Enclave resident./She blames the media as well. ""Whenever there is a Diwali storyline on a TV show or in a movie, we see the actors bursting crackers. People, especially kids, are influenced by this.""/She is trying to convince others to give up crackers. ""My brother (in Class 6) is too young to understand. He insists on buying crackers because many of his classmates use them. My family and I have said a strict ""no"". Just because others do it, does not mean we should too.""/However, Tanya eagerly looks forward to the festival every year. To her, it is about decorating her house with rangolis, flowers and diyas, spending time with family and friends, and exchanging sweets and gifts with them./'Why burn money?'/Vamika Vedi (15)/Vamika admits she used to burst crackers till last year. This Diwali, she has vowed to give it up after a personal tragedy. ""Last year, an acquaintance lost hearing in one ear because of crackers. I decided I would not burst anymore crackers,"" she said./Vamika was also moved by a presentation shown in her school - Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj. It highlighted the plight of children making crackers in hazardous conditions. ""If you support bursting crackers, you are supporting child labour too,"" she says./She feels bursting crackers is the equivalent of burning money. ""Why not buy gifts for others with that money? That would spread more joy, which is the essence of the festival,"" she adds./Vamika's Diwali is about good food, new clothes, and lights and diyas. ""Sitting with loved ones and talking is so much more fulfilling and fun than bursting crackers,"" she says./'Let's talk about the future'/Charvi Nayyar (15)/A self-proclaimed 'environmental freak,' Charvi has never really been a fan of firecrackers. ""I was scared of them., but as I grew older, I got to know more about how it affects the environment. I have since consciously tried to ensure an eco-friendly Diwali in my house.""/She says she makes extra effort to ensure a better future for herself and her the next generations. ""Our actions will have long-term consequences. If we are not careful (about pollution) I will suffer, the future generations will suffer. After all, isn't the current situation in Delhi a consequence of what our fathers and forefathers did?""/Like other kids who have pledged to say no to crackers this Diwali, Charvi also is concerned about the city's air pollution levels. ""Delhi's air is almost unbreathable, and it is getting worse by the day,"" she said./Charvi celebrates Diwali by spending quality time with her family, making rangolis and eating great food and going shopping. She believes crackers are extraneous to Diwali. ""Diwali is Deepavali - the festival of lights. Toh deepak se raunak honi chahiye, pataakho se nahin (There should lustre from lights, not from crackers).""/These kids have set an example for other children as well as adults in the country by saying no to crackers this Diwali. The next time you use your children as an excuse to pollute Delhi, remember that all they need is a little guidance./""Kids will be kids. They will ask for crackers. But if we try and make them understand, they will relent,"" said Class-12 student Sagar Jha from Sahid Hemu Khilani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Faridabad./He has not only given up crackers himself but has also convinced his younger sister to embrace a greener and safer Diwali./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

Air pollution level is classified as severe if it is between 401 and 500./While the deed is done for this year, here's why there should be a blanket ban on crackers in India:/First, the chemical footprint of crackers is deadly./Second, the impact of crackers on children is far greater than it is on adults because their defence mechanism is much poorer and their ability to metabolise and detoxify environmental agents is different. Moreover, due to their high level of physical activities, children inhale more volume of air as compared to adults and so breathe in more toxic air./Third, fire crackers have carbon and sulphur and they produce a range of gases. Plus, there are a number of chemicals that act as colouring agent, reducing agent, oxidiser, stabiliser and binder./These colours have antimony sulphide for the glitter effect, aluminum for white, barium nitrate for green, lithium for red, copper for blue and strontium for purple./These chemical substances are harmful to our body./Aluminum and antimony sulphide (colouring agents) causes Alzheimer' disease, perchlorate (ammonium and potassium), an oxidizing agent, can cause lung cancer. It causes thyroid complications, the cadmium compounds damage the lungs and leads to gastrointestinal problems./The barium nitrate is poisonous and causes respiratory irritation, radioactive effects, gastrointestinal problems and muscular weakness./The lithium and copper compounds causes hormonal imbalance and is poisonous to plants and animals, detrimental to physical and mental growth in infants and unborn children, accumulation within the body and by-products like nitrogen dioxide which is highly poisonous, fatal for infants, the source of acid rain./Most of these toxins can trigger cancer./Fourth, these gases cause respiratory problems. Hospitals in Delhi report at least 30%-40% increase in wheezing, respiratory disease, bronchial asthma, bronchitis, and worsening of asthma./India Chest Society has issued warning about hearing loss, blood pressure, sleeping disturbances, heart ailments and nausea effects on pets./In 1992, the Centre issued a notification to ban explosives containing a series of dangerous substances like sulphur or sulphurate mixed with potassium chlorate or chlorate of other elements./It said storage and handling of these compounds is hazardous and can cause serious accidents. They are sensitive to the slightest amount of friction and are toxic to the skin. When coupled with potassium, they form explosives that lead to fires and deaths. The fire that took place at a temple in Kollam, Kerala, killed over 100 people in April 2016 was caused due to fireworks made from these banned substances./The unstable and explosive nature of chlorates and perchlorates makes crackers noisier and gives a ""bigger bang for your buck"". Before the 1992 notification, firecracker manufacturers preferred potassium chlorates and perchlorates because they were cheaper. They cost one-third as compared to their substitutes, potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate mixtures./Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

"Pollution level alarming in Delhi after Diwali, people complain of 'zero visibility'","New Delhi, Oct. 31 -- A blanket of haze and smog enveloped Delhi on Monday morning after night of Diwali revelry and firecracker burning pushed the city's air quality to alarming toxic highs./People commuting to their offices early morning posted photographs of smog-covered lights with accompanying texts complaining of ""zero visibility"". Many said the air smelt of charred firecrackers and that it was difficult to breathe./Pollution peaks in the city during Diwali as a hazardous mix of noxious gases and respirable pollutants hang very close to the surface due to low temperature and near-stagnant wind movement./At 7:23am, HT's air quality index showed a reading of a severe 447. Air pollution level is classified as severe if it is between 401 and 500. At Mandir Marg in south Delhi, the index read 492 and it was again 500 at Shadipur in west Delhi./China declares a 'red alert' if air quality plunges to this level. If the alarming pollution levels continue for three consecutive days, China facilitates measures such as shutting down schools and offices, closing down industries and power plants, and road rationing of vehicles./This came after alarm bells were set off on Sunday evening as air quality in the Capital deteriorated alarmingly on Diwali night with pollution levels spiking as much as 42 times higher than normal at one of the most polluted spots./Data from the Hindustan Times air quality map showed that the air quality index had peaked -- touching the maximum limit of 500 -- in almost all monitoring spots in the city./The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's real-time ambient air quality data said the PM10 readings went up by over 42 times on Sunday from the national ambiance air quality standard at RK Puram. At 10.55pm, PM10 was recorded at 4,273 ug/m(3). PM2.5 also touched an alarming high at 748ug/m(3) at 2.30am./Particulate matters (PM) are tiny particles in the air that cause visibility problems and health hazards./The permissible level of PM 2.5 is 60ug/m(3) while PM10 is 100 ug/m(3). Levels beyond that can cause harm to the respiratory system as the ultra fine particulates can embed themselves deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream./Zero visibility at Sarai Kale Khan #Delhi #smog pic.twitter.com/jP9gWOSur0/#Delhi wakes up to heavy smog post #Diwali.
