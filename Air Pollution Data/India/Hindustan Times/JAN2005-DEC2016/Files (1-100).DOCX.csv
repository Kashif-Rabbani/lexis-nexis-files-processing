Turn on the heat," NEW DELHI, India, Jan. 8 -- Button up your home, get the fire blazing, pull on your blankets and settle down to a cosy winter evening. For all its biting cold and the tiresome duty of trussing yourself up, winter can be a great season. Just remember one thing, however - it is good to keep the cold out in winter but don't bring the health problems in, in the process./  The body and its various organs are built to function at their optimum efficiency at a given normal body and environmental temperature. When these are not ideal - including when your indoor-heating is not adequate - the entire system is affected, though the manifestations are more obvious in one organ or area than another, explains Dr VBN Prasad Rao, Head, Dept of Orthopaedics, NIMS, Hyderabad. At first the body's compensatory mechanisms make up, but after some time, they too get exhausted, leading to health problems./  Experts say the ideal temperature that you should maintain inside the home should be around 30 degrees Centigrade or 75 to to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The best option for keeping your indoor environment warm is central heating with humidifiers, though this is expensive./  Avoid too much exposure/  The more commonly used indoor-heating appliances are blowers, radiators, rod heaters, electric blankets and hotwater bottles. The vital thing is to regulate the heat from them so it doesn't rise or fall above the healthy level. Hotwater bottles are therefore useful, but carry a risk since their heat can't be controlled, points out physician Dr M B R Sarma. So, a bottle with very hot water used for a long time is dangerous, since it directly exposes the skin to an excess of heat, damaging it and the underlying tissue as well. Such prolonged use leads to chronic skin irritation at first, and then skin cancer./  Unfortunately, in very cold areas, where the temperature falls to zero or sub-zero levels, as in Jammu and Kashmir or in the Himalayan foothills, and also if there's access to modern heating appliances, people have been known to keep unduly hot bottles on their body, especially their abdomens./  Be extra cautious/  Radiators and rodheaters are useful but the possibility of accidental burns in children from such appliances placed in accessible places, is very high, says Dr H. Paramesh, Bangalore-based paediatric pulmonologist and national Chairman of Environment and Child Health Group of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics. The damage to tender fingers can be great and if such victims don't receive immediate and expert medical care, it can impair their hands and the use of their fingers for life. He adds that parents should be more careful about the placement of such appliances. Even with adults, accidents from rodheaters placed carelessly are common in winter, explains Delhi-based cosmetologist Dr Aneesh Gupta. ""It is a pity to see such major injuries and problems which take relatively long to heal, resulting only from a lack of a simple common-sense,"" he adds./  Beware of harmful gases/  Fireplaces are other options. Fireplaces may make homes cosy - and add to the decor if well-designed - but they are also a potential hazard if not ventilated properly. Otherwise firewood smoke is harmful since it contains carbon monoxide (CO), polyorganic matter, polyorganic hydrocarbons, and formaldehyde, all of which lead to chronic coughs, asthma, headaches and allergic nose problems, says Dr Paramesh./  Exposure to low levels of CO can cause flu-like symptoms like headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness and nausea, while higher levels can result in unconsciousness and even death. Typically, CO accumulates when the home is insulated and sealed against the cold, and woodstoves, charcoal grills, clothes dryers, boilers, gas stoves, water heaters and furnaces, etc are often in use./  Ideal bathing temperature/  People tend to bathe and wash with very hot water in winter. This can harm the skin and nerves. The ideal bathing water temperature is always between seven degrees above and below your normal body temperature, says Dr Sarma. That makes it about 30 to 44 degrees C (normal body temperature is 37 degree C) which means in winter, don't go above 44. We don't generally have the means or time to measure the temperature of our bathing water, so here's a simple and practical equivalent - the water should feel lukewarm or just-above-lukewarm./  Keep it warm, not dry/  Having a warm environment is not enough - there should be adequate humidity too (25 to 50 per cent). Dry heat dries the mouth, nose and its mucus membrane, and throat and results in bleeding from the nose and sore throats. It can even lead to bronchial asthma. Another symptom is sore throat which can be cured by drinking water, though most people think it needs medical attention or antibiotics./  Hence one needs humidifiers which generate humidity to balance the dry heat. Humidifiers are an expensive proposition, however, for the average home, so a good idea would be to keep a pail of water in the room in which you have placed your heating appliances, suggest Dr Paramesh./  Too much heat in your room can lead to excess sweating (with those with tendency to sweat profusely, this is triggered off by even a little more than normal-level heat). This leads to loss of both salt and water from the body. The remedy is not only to take water but also electroyl solution (for the salt). Tender coconut water is another good option. Again, overheating can be harmful for the heart and lungs and patients with a history of health problems in these areas have to be very careful./  In fact, if indoor-heating systems are inadequate or malfunctioning, leading to excess or little heat, the most vulnerable are those confined to the home - the sick, the elderly or babies. Dr Gupta advises that homes with such residents should be extra-careful during winter. For such people, easy-to-use and maintain traditional warmers like razais or blankets and woollens are safer than electric blankets. In fact, the electric blanket is a very useful thing but it requires very careful use - the wiring, connectors and plugs should be in perfect condition and they get easily overheated. This happens if you put other clothes or bedding on them when in use, or if you fold the blanket (this bends the coils, leading to overheating)./  Keep your carpets away/  Carpets are often used in homes during this period for the warmth or insulation they provide from the cold in the floor. However, in a home with carpets, a combination of high temperature and high humidity can lead to an increase in dust mites, a major source of indoor air pollution, and which triggers asthma attacks and similar allergies, according to Dr Paramesh. A total lack of any indoor-heating arrangements in winter for whatever reason can led to hypothermia (cold stress and low body temperatures). These are extreme cases but known to happen./  So, turn the heat on. Just remember to regulate it sensibly too. And enjoy the winter./  - Aruna Chandaraju/  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Overcoming the hurdles," NEW DELHI, India, Jan. 18 -- The pre-Boards are over. And the countdown to the Class X Board examination has begun. It doesn't matter how you fared in the warm-up series, there's still more than a month's time before the final test. To help you prepare for this much-hyped exam, HT Horizons interviewed schoolteachers about the most crucial topics in the syllabi. Here is what they had to say?/  The easy cash-cheque called practical aside, Science theory papers have their own must-do areas that teachers will ask you to focus on. Here is an outline of what you must pore over to be ready for the finals. Remember of the 75 marks in theory, units 2, 3 and 4 of the curriculum account for 59 marks./  Physics/  Light, electricity and magnetism were introduced two years ago. Says Pushpa Tyagi, HOD Physics, Sanskriti School, ""It is difficult to comment on the question paper trends. Electricity and magnetism are two topics that you should focus on. Students often make errors in these."" Here's a sampler:/  The network of resistance, and a cell is given. Find the potential difference across the given resistance. ""You'll have to draw the network following the instructions given in the question and then calculate. Remember a few ground rules. In a series combination, current that flows through each resistance is the same whereas in a parallel combination, the current is divided. However, the potential difference across each one of them will remain the same,"" explains Tyagi./  Most students tend to answer questions on the generator or cell accurately but remember to define the principle, construction and working along with a well-labelled diagram. Don't overlook labelling or forget to mark arrows. ""You must be able to derive the formulae for a mirror and lens (concave and convex). The types of vision defects (human eye) and ways to rectify them may be asked,"" explains Ritu Khanna, Science Faculty, St. Columba's School./  Khanna says, ""Don't mix up the following formula: the mirror formulae is 1/v + 1/u = 1/f whereas the lens formula is 1/v - 1/u = 1/f (v is the image distance, u is the object distance and f is the focal length)."" Corroborates Tyagi, ""All the principles of the Cartesian Sign Conventions should be learnt by heart like the object distance for a real object is always negative, distances in the direction of the incident ray are positive units and so on."" Make sure that you follow a uniform system of measurement, either cgs or SI. Special attention should be paid to the conversion of units./  Chemistry/  There are several new topics in Chemistry like chemical equilibrium, which was earlier part of the Class XI curriculum. Reiterates Abha Goyal, Faculty, Spingdales School (Dhaula Kuan), ""In chemical equilibrium, you'll have to determine the pH value of solutions. This is deduced with the help of logarithms, which are not included in Maths. But you can avoid making errors by remembering a few properties of logarithms like log mn = log m + log n; log mn = n log m; Log 10 = 1; Log 1 = 0. Also learn how to read log tables and find out antilog values as well.""/  Another crucial section is the chapter on carbon and its compounds. Write the chemical formula in bond structure form. For example, CH3-CH=O + HCN ? CH3-CH (OH) (CN). Chemistry is all about equations; hence practice equations regularly. Says Khanna, ""Not only the properties but the respective equations should be memorised as well. Study fermentation, esterification, saponification and so on. Moreover while balancing a formula, give the names of the compounds in the equation, like CH4 is methane.""/  Also pay attention to metals and non-metals - especially the extraction and manufacturing of iron. ""Give the method of the formation of metals and non-metals in steps along with temperature details and the chemicals used.""/  Some important topics/  Carbon and its compounds; metals and non-metals - iron, aluminium, sulphur, hydrogen formation; polymerisation, esterification./  Biology/  Life process, earlier a part of the Class IX curriculum, is now part of the Class X syllabus. Crop production and human diseases, on the other hand, have now become part of the Class IX syllabus. Says Khanna, ""Practising diagrams are an absolute must when you revise. There is no other way to remember the human body."" Practise diagrams of the structure of the kidney, heart, brain and nephron (to show urine formation). Practise drawing the respiratory, circulatory and excretory systems. Know the parts of the brain and their functions. Study how various nerves control different functions. Remember the names of glands, the hormones they secrete and their functions./  Adds Sunita Sharma, Faculty, Laxman Public School, ""Topics which students normally find difficult to tackle are respiration in insects, transpiration in plants and the lymphatic system of man. So pay more attention to these areas."" Give illustrations wherever required. Learn the theories of evolution (three- or five-mark question) and evidences of evolution. You should cite examples to support a theory. Prepare the structure of a DNA molecule, the types of chromosomes and understand how the sex of a child is determined./  You must know the impact of air pollution (acid rain, the green house effect, thinning of the ozone layer). A question on this topic may give a situation (for instance, about the increasing concentration of CO2) and ask you to give its implication and solutions./  Some important areas/  Structure and functions of each human organ; the structure of DNA; photosynthesis./  So, whether it is numericals for Physics, equations for Chemistry or diagrams for Biology, practise, practise and practise till you have mastered the subject!/  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Bihar is five times more polluted than Los Angeles!," Washington, Jan. 28 -- A study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters has revealed that NASA scientists studying satellite data have discovered an immense wintertime pool of pollution over the northern Indian state of Bihar. /  The study also showed that Bihar's pollution levels are about five times larger than those typically found over Los Angeles. /The discovery was made by researchers analyzing four years of data collected by the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) onboard the Terra satellite in NASA. ""MISR is the first instrument to make high-resolution, multi- angle radiometric measurements of Earth from space. /  This study is the most comprehensive and detailed examination of industrial, smoke and other air pollution particles over the Indian subcontinent to date, and reveals how topography, meteorology and human activity help determine where these particles are concentrated,"" said Larry Di Girolamo, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois, and co-investigator of the MISR mission. /  While high pollution levels were found over much of India, a concentrated pool of particles was discovered over Bihar. A large source contributing to the Bihar pollution pool is the inefficient burning of a variety of biofuels during cooking and other domestic use. Particles in the smoke remain close to the ground, trapped by valley walls, and unable to mix upward because of a high-pressure system that dominates the region during winter. /  ""The Bihar pollution pool must be having a tremendous impact on the local climate and the health of the approximately 100 million people that reside within this pool. Our long-term goal is to better predict the occurrence of these pollution episodes and their impact on public health and local climate,"" said Di Girolamo./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from ANI./  ANI is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air pollution can lead to cardiovascular diseases," Washington, Feb. 1 -- A new study published in the latest issue of 'Environmental Health Perspectives' has revealed that long-term exposure to air pollution may lead to the development of atherosclerosis./  Atherosclerosis is a form of cardiovascular disease in which fatty deposits cause artery walls to thicken and harden. The study adds to the growing body of literature linking air pollution with cardiovascular disease and provides the first epidemiologic evidence linking atherosclerosis with exposure to fine particulate matter. /  The researchers evaluated 798 healthy Los Angeles-area men and women over the age of 40 who showed some signs of increased risk of cardiovascular disease. /  The results showed that the more polluted the air to which subjects were exposed, the thicker the inner layers of their carotid artery, which transports blood to the head and neck. /  The most-exposed study participants experienced about 8 per cent more artery thickening than the least-exposed participants, after accounting for such factors as diet, use of vitamin supplements and hormone-replacement drugs, physical activity, blood pressure, education, and income. Women over the age of 60 experienced artery thickening at a rate almost four times higher than the overall population. /  In general, women were much more vulnerable than men, and non-smokers and people taking drugs to reduce cholesterol also proved to be more vulnerable than average. /  ""Our results support the hypothesis that long-term exposure to ambient particulate matter contributes to systemic inflammatory pathways, which are a relevant aspect of atherogenesis,"" wrote the study authors. /  ""The findings indicate a biologically plausible link between the observed acute effects of ambient air pollution on systemic inflammation and the long-term consequences of sustained vascular inflammation leading to increased atherosclerosis and, ultimately, cardiovascular death,"" they concluded./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from ANI./  This Asian News International (ANI) article is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"'PROVIDE AIR, WATER QUALITY DATA TO PUBLIC WITHOUT DELAY': MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS"," NEW DELHI, India, Feb. 14 -- The Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests issued the following press release:/  Minister of Environment and Forests Thiru A. Raja said that the data collected by the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board), SPCBs (State Pollution Control Boards) and other agencies by way of air and water quality monitoring should be made available to the public without any delay. /  Inaugurating the meeting of Chairmen and Member Secretaries of Pollution Control Boards/Committees here today, Thiru Raja also stressed the need for protecting drinking water sources particularly by way of keeping a close watch on all polluting sources. /  ""Considering the incidence of water borne diseases in our country, it is of paramount importance to protect drinking water sources particularly by way of keeping a close watch on all polluting sources"", he said. /  Observing that awareness about environmental issues has grown and also manifested in the spate of public interest litigations seeking affirmative executive action, the Minister pointed out that ""courts, have often observed that the enforcement machinery has been wanting in resolve and action"", while adding that ""it is clear that the Centre, States and Union Territories have to work together very closely for strengthening the institutional capabilities for pollution control"". Thiru Raja further stated that common industrial infrastructure in the form of common effluent treatment plants, treatment, storage and disposal facilities for hazardous wastes are being set up with support from Central/State Governments. ""Considering that the common facilities cater to the requirements of small scale industries that cannot afford treatment facilities of their own and that substantial Government funds have been invested in such facilities, it is necessary to ensure that these facilities are operated in such a manner as to meet the prescribed norms"", he emphasised. ""CPCB/SPCBs should regularly inspect these common facilities, assess their performance and provide technical advice for improving their performance wherever required. In addition, monitoring of sewage treatment plants and common bio-medical treatment facilities should also figure in the regular inspection programme of the Central Board / State Boards"", the Minister added. /  Observing that public awareness programmes, especially by way of vigorous campaigning in schools have helped in mitigating noise pollution problems during Deepawali, Thiru Raja said that CPCB/SPCBs should regularly collect and test samples from fire cracker manufactures in order to ensure that only crackers meeting prescribed noise standards reach the markets. Stating that CPCB has come out with comprehensive emission and noise standards for various generator sets and engines, the Minister stressed that these standards should be enforced strictly in order to reduce noise and air pollution in urban areas./  India Press Releases are provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air pollutants linked to chromosome damage in the foetus," Washington, Feb 16 -- A new study has revealed that exposure of expectant mothers to combustion-related urban air pollution may alter the structure of babies' chromosomes while in the womb. /  While previous experiments have linked such genetic alterations to an increased risk of leukemia and other cancers, much larger studies would be required to determine the precise increase in risk as these children reach adulthood. /  The air pollutants considered in this study include emissions from cars, trucks, bus engines, residential heating, power generation and tobacco smoking. These pollutants can cross the placenta and reach the foetus. /  ""This is the first study to show that environmental exposures to specific combustion pollutants during pregnancy can result in chromosomal abnormalities in foetal tissues,"" said Kenneth Olden, Ph.D., the director of NIEHS. /  Exposure to combustion pollutants was assessed through personal questionnaires and portable air monitors worn by the mothers during the third trimester of their pregnancies. Researchers then calculated the concentration of air pollution to which each pregnant woman and her baby were exposed. /  Study participants exposed to air pollution levels below the average were designated as having ""low exposure,"" while those exposed to pollution levels above the average were designated as having ""high exposure."" /  ""This evidence that air pollutants can alter chromosomes in utero is troubling since other studies have validated this type of genetic alteration as a biomarker of cancer risk,"" said Perera. /  ""While we can't estimate the precise increase in cancer risk, these findings underscore the need for policymakers at the federal, state, and local levels to take appropriate steps to protect children from these avoidable exposures."" /  Previous studies conducted by Perera and colleagues showed that combustion-related air pollutants significantly reduce foetal growth, which may affect cognitive development during childhood./  This Asian News International (ANI) article is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Global warming can affect your health: Expert," Washington, Feb 21 -- Global warming may not just affect your immediate environment, but could also increase the number and scope of climate-related health crises, ranging from killer heat waves and famine, to floods and waves of infectious diseases, an expert has warned. /  In a message delivered at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) over the weekend, Jonathan A. Patz, an authority on the human health effects of global environmental change, warned that as global warming spreads, human populations will become far more vulnerable to heat-related mortality, air pollution-related illnesses, infectious diseases and malnutrition. /  According to Patz, a professor of environmental studies and population health studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, global warming by itself will not be a major threat. /  The dramatic increase in severe weather events like major storms, heat waves, flooding triggered by a shifting global climate could have the most adverse impact on your health. /  ""Averages don't kill people - it is the extremes. If we don't do major stormssomething to mitigate the potential human health effects of climate change, the world, beginning at the local and regional level, will begin to experience climate-related catastrophe,"" warns Patz. /  ""In the face of climate change, what are the adaptive measures at many and variable scales that we can take to reduce the health impact of climate change? That's what we need to be thinking about,"" he adds. /  However, all hope is not lost, as Patz feels that one strategy that can mitigate future climate-related health problems would be to develop and use climate forecasts and warning systems to avert disease and adverse health outcomes. /  He believes that such events can be predicted with confidence, and if higher risk is forecast, people can prepare by mouse- proofing their homes and taking other measures to minimize contact with the source of a serious disease. ""The key will be early detection, warning and responding to threats,"" Patz says./  This Asian News International (ANI) article is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Commuting through callousness & confusion," NEW DELHI, India, March 28 -- THE TEEN Imli Junction on the cross section of the Ring Road and the Nemawar Road remains choked most of the days with long traffic jams and high air pollution levels./  The Junction is a major transit point from where roads lead to Ujjain, Dewas, Bhopal, Mumbai, Mhow, Harda, Betul, Nagpur, Khandwa and Burhanpur./  Over 1,000 trucks and 250 private buses pass through the junction each day, making it one of the busiest entry and transit points of the State./  The daily traffic population excludes the two and four-wheel vehicles operated by residents of about 32 localities within a three km radius of the Junction./  Incidentally, this is the only entry point for trucks that transport goods to the Loha Mandi, Siyaganj Mandi and the Grain Mandis./  The number of trucks passing through the entry point increases after each harvest season when they enter, loaded with vegetables, fruits, food grains and fodder in addition to steel, iron and scrap./  ""The traffic jams are a common occurrence at Teen Imli and at times the road is blocked for two hours at a stretch with no one to care,"" say labourers Roshan Silawat and Sunil Verma./  Since Teen Imli is also the halting point, about 150-200 trucks remain parked on an average at any given time./  In the absence of parking space, the haphazardly parked heavy vehicles on the roadside or on land reserved for service road add to the chaos./  Further, encroachments on the service road along the Ring Road make commuting difficult./  Trucks and mini trucks that line up at the three 'taul kantas' located in the area also add to the road block as there is no one to regulate the entry and exit of these vehicles./  But what has worsened matters is the narrow Teen Imli culvert, the oversized rotary developed by the Indore Development Authority and the ongoing construction of concrete road from Navlakha to Teen Imli Junction./  Worse, there is no traffic police or traffic signal to regulate vehicle flow at the Junction. As a result, road mishaps and tiffs between vehicle drivers are the order of the day./  The layers of dust raised by the heavy vehicles create a haze in the evening./  The nights are still worse as the streetlights between the Musakhedi to the Asaram Bapu Junction on the Ring Road do not function. Needless to add, there are no lighting arrangements from Teen Imli Junction and Udyog Nagar./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Ludhiana police launches special drive to check rising auto-pollution," Ludhiana, April 13 -- The rampant use of auto-rickshaws without proper authorisation in Ludhiana has made it the most polluted city after Delhi in the northern region as the level of air pollution has crossed all danger marks. The kerosene oil, which is used instead of diesel, is the reason behind this. /  When started, the auto emits a dense cloud of smoke, harmful for health, especially for those suffering from asthma./  In a startling revelation of the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the city is between 500 to 600 micro gram while the permissible limit is only 200 micro gram./  Last month, Ludhiana police had busted a gang who were involved in the purchase of old auto rickshaws at the rate of scrap and replacing its petrol engines with old diesel engines and selling them off./  ""Near the railway station, a person called Tarlok Singh Bedi and some of his associates were caught. They were involved in buying old auto rickshaws along with registration certificates (RC) that the owners sold them to be disposed. But instead of disposing, they replace the petrol engines with old diesel engines and use them as taxis or sold them off after preparing fake RC and affidavit,"" said R.K. Jaiswal, Superintendent of Police, Ludhiana./  Some of these autos, said the SP, were more than 15 years old and were not fit to ply on the roads. Such autos also lead to heavy pollution, said officials. Police is now investigating how many such autos were sold by the gang./  The District Transport Office and the Traffic Police have started a joint campaign against those plying auto rickshaws without the essential documents. By setting up special nakas at various places in the city, the team today checked many auto rickshaw drivers./  Officials of the DTO confessed that the city lacks a strict survey of unauthorised vehicles./  ""We do not have a survey conducted on unauthorised vehicles. But we catch up to almost 20 per cent vehicles which are unauthorised,"" said Kulwinder Singh, DTO official./  The common man in the city is complaining of the pollution caused by the auto-rickshaws. They demand the autos to be converted to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)./  ""We are facing problems of pollution caused by auto-rickshaws. The fumes and the smoke emits from these autos are major caused of pollution. We want them to be converted to CNG,"" said Gurwinder Singh, a local./  ""The pollution caused by autos affects our eyes, nose and skin,"" said Sikandar Singh, a local./  The locals complain that the auto drivers use adulterated fuel and due to it the emission of smoke and unburnt fuel is very high./  ""We have lots of problem due to smoke emitted from autos. They mix soil in the petrol, which causes more pollution. We are suffering from cough and other respiratory problems,"" said Jagdeep Singh, a local./  Interestingly, the officials of DTO have revealed that after Delhi's transport has switched over to the CNG, the auto-rickshaws plying on Delhi roads have made their way into Ludhiana./  Officials said that auto drivers would now adhere to the essential norms while plying their vehicles in the city, which would check pollution./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Bangladesh to launch radio channel on traffic movements," Dhaka, May 20 -- State-owned Bangladesh Betar has announced plans to launch a Frequency Modulation (FM) band channel soon to disseminate information on traffic congestions in Dhaka, keeping in mind that the country's capital is getting overburdened with multi-modal vehicles. /  After its formal launching on May 26, the new channel on 103.2 KHz, would initially promote public awareness on the duties and rights of pedestrians and drivers through its programme. Later, it would air programmes on vehicular movements on prime city thoroughfares, Bangladesh Betar officials said on Thursday. /  The Information Minister, Shamsul Islam, and the Communication Minister, Barrister Nazmul Huda, are due to open the radio channel formally on May 26, said Nazmul Ahsan, the Director-General of Bangladesh Betar. /  Senior Betar officials had a meeting Thursday with officials of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC), Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), Road Safety Council and representatives from the ministries concerned to sort out how they can make the proposed programme useful for the general masses. /  The Betar DG said the channel has already started airing test programmes on the designated frequency. The channel would run seven and half hours programme a day in two shifts --morning and afternoon. /  Its programmes would be loaded with information on road congestion, road accidents, traffic rules, safety measures, duties of drivers, passengers and pedestrians, he added. /  The project will cost at least Taka two crore which includes infrastructure development and procurement of instruments for new studios, but they still run short of adequate fund. /  But, the Betar officials decided to start the channel with the limited resources. /  'This is an ambitious drive. But we have decided to start it to raise awareness among citizens', Nazmul told reportershere, adding that initially, it may not be possible to come up with hourly-basis updates on traffic movement as the city has limited alternative roads at this moment. But in the long run,Betar would provide on the spot description of the vehicular movements. /  ""Our objective is to inform and educate the listeners about their rights and duties as drivers, passengers and pedestrians, and to make easier their journey in the city,"" Nazmul said. /  With increased rate of urbanisation in the country, the number of vehicles is also increasing rapidly, and contributing to more and more air pollution. The Department of Environment (DOE), and other related organisations, have identified the two-stroke engines used in autorickshaws (baby-taxies), tempos, mini-trucks, and motorcycles as major polluters. /  At the last count, there were about 65,000 baby taxies and more than 296,000 motor vehicles in Dhaka alone. Moreover, overloaded, poorly maintained and very old trucks and mini-buses are also plying the city's streets emitting smoke and gas. In fact about 90 percent of the vehicles that ply Dhaka's streets daily are faulty, and emit smoke far exceeding the prescribed limit. Diesel vehicles emit black smoke, which contain unburned fine carbon particles./  Two-stroke engines are now discouraged in Bangladesh because of their pollution hazard. In view of the serious automobile pollution faced in the metropolis, the World Bank took the initiative to support the introduction of big buses in the city with the aim of discouraging use of smaller automobiles, including baby-taxis. The introduction of air-conditioned city bus service is an outcome of that initiative./  Sophisticated equipment is now being used to detect air polluters in Bangladesh. As such, four monitoring stations have been set up at Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, and Bogra. In Dhaka, the vehicular emission test locations are at Tejgaon, Farmgate, Manik Mia Avenue, Gulshan, Lalmatia, and Agargaon./  Last year, it was reported that an estimated ten people died in road accidents daily while countless others suffered from resulting disfigurations and disabilities. Annually more than 4000 people are killed in road mishaps./  The number of vehicles plying the streets of Dhaka is literally mushrooming. That in itself is not so alarming, but what makes the overall situation worse is the knowledge that most vehicle drivers are said to be inexperienced and it does not take much effort to get a driving license. The universal language of money does all the talking. /  Apart from the horrendous daytime traffic situation in Dhaka City, the deadweight of this urban affliction also has two nocturnal aspects -- one in the early part of the night and the other from midnight./  The sheer volume of rickshaws plying the city roads presents an extra hazard due to lack of lights on these vehicles unlike during pre-independence days when rickshaws, with the onset of dusk, used to hang hurricane lanterns from the rear. /  The traffic police also does'nt enforce such requirements. This increases the danger of road accidents particularly in areas where streetlights are inadequate or absent, or when the city plunges into darkness due to loadshedding. Also, such rickshaws become the choice targets of muggers lying in wait for their victims in dark alleys./  As night progresses, office-goers go home and businesses close. The road then belongs to speedsters -- drivers of commercial vehicles like trucks and night coaches. /  Dhaka's midnight traffic represents an almost an unending flow of such vehicles passing through some of the city's main thoroughfares. A view from the roof of any high-rise building by the road will present a staggering sight of a large number of trucks and other commercial transports racing with each other and sometimes jamming the road. Many of these vehicles are inter-district trucks and night coaches bringing in or taking out goods and passengers to and from the capital./ Dhaka's traffic control mechanism is practically non-functional at night as traffic police pack up and leave their stations at around 11:00 p.m. Thus, the road becomes a virtual free for all from around midnight till the morning, as is the case in most metros. /  Experts and observers say road-related hazards are compounded by vehicles of varying speeds plying the same roads at the same time. Some observers also point to the lack of coordination between authorities responsible for road traffic control. Particularly, there have been allegations that the Road and Highways Department and the Dhaka City Corporation hardly agree over any issue of importance./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
?Neem Kranti' to check air pollution," NEW DELHI, India, May 23 -- FOREST DEPARTMENT has taken up a massive project of planting Neem trees in the entire Allahabad Division. The project is named 'Neem Kranti' which is being initiated with the objective of abatement of the pollution present in the air./  According to Chief Forest Conservator, Ashwini Kumar, the target is to plant nearly 1,00,000 Neem trees in the area, although the minimum limit has been set at 60,000./  Known to have served as an Ayurvedic medicine for several skin diseases, the Neem trees will now help in minimising pollution. ""The Neem trees grow easily in the saline and alkaline soil that makes it the best choice,"" informed Ashwini Kumar./  ""The planting of Neem will start in July and the entire upkeep of the plants will be the responsibility of the forest department,"" he added./  Yet, the forest department soon is achieving another major breakthrough in the abatement of pollution. ""We will plant such trees in the district that will not only lessen air pollution but they will also absorb the pollutants present in ground water,"" said the chief forest conservator./  ""Ground water is often laced with pollutants present in the form of heavy metals such as nickle, cadmium, etc and the rivers too carry pollutants that are mostly industrial wastes like waste water from tanneries. Several species of trees have the capability to absorb them,"" he said./  In this context, the Forest Department is planning to plant two major trees. ""A foreign origin plant Cassia Siamia has the ability to absorb ground water pollutants and also lessen the pollutants present in the environment./  Another species is Pongamia Pinnata commonly known as Karanj. It is the most common pollutant absorbant and is found in urban areas. One more species is Ficus which we are planning to plant,"" informed Ashwini Kumar. According to him, the entire process of planting the trees will start from last week of July./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
?Air pollution may cause more diseases'," NEW DELHI, India, May 25 -- FAST GROWING air pollution in the city has become a cause of concern for the medical experts here. According to them, if this pollution continues for an indefinite period, the people here will fall prey to serious respiratory and other lung diseases./  The medical experts are of the view that the rise in suspended particulate material (SPM) in air could cause burning of eyes and nose, an itchy and irritated throat and trouble in breathing. Presence of certain deadly chemicals in air could even cause cancer, birth deformities, nerve damage and long-term injury to breathing passage./  According to principal of the GSVM Medical College and a noted chest physician DR SK Katiyar, the air pollution is the main reason behind the rising cases of tuberculosis and related chest diseases./  A report, based on the medical and environmental studies, has revealed that presence of about 2000 ug/m3 with o.4 parts per million (PPM) of SO2 (Sulphur dioxide of several days duration can increase death rate due to bronchitis. Similarly, 1000 ug/m3 with o.25 ppm of SO2 in 24 hours could increase mortality from all causes including respiratory and cardiac diseases./  There could be a significant increase in bronchitis symptoms if air contained 300ug/m3 with0.21 PPM of SO2 for an average of 24-hour period while the increase in incidences of bronchitis has been reported above the level of 100 ug/m3 with 0.05 to 0.08 PPM of SO2./  The Central Pollution Control Board has observed during its air monitoring programme that the concentration of air pollutants in a particular area have on occasions reached excessively high levels for several hours in a day causing threat to the human health./  However, despite all reports about the polluted air, the district administration has failed to take measures for containing the air pollutants and has allowed the citizens to face the deadly health hazards./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
NGOs approach DM over Jajmau pollution," NEW DELHI, India, May 26 -- Thousands of residents of Jajmau are forced to endure high levels of pollution. Earlier, while this was limited to water pollution due to toxic effluents from leather industries, this has now extended to air pollution, too, due to violation of norms by glue factories which have mushroomed in the area lately./  Taking a step to protest the residents, Ecofriends, a non- governmental organisation (NGO), working for environmental protection, has given a memorandum to the district magistrate and the SSP. The NGO has demanded closure of glue factories in Vazidpur and Pyondi villages./  The memorandum states that there are nearly 40 glue factories which are running illegally in these areas. They use the waste dumped by leather factories as fuel for their boilers./  Such factories even produce fertilizers, which are sold outside Kanpur. In the process, huge amounts of toxic gases are released into the air, which is causing several diseases among local residents./  General secretary of the NGO, Rakesh Jaiswal, said: ""More than 16 crore litres of water of Kanpur city and 1.5 crore litre water from leather tanneries reaches Jajmau and, as a result, the groundwater here is highly polluted.""/  He said: ""Most villagers in the area are suffering from one or more diseases, their land has been affected and this, in turn, is affecting their livelihood.""/  The NGO has, therefore, demanded that these glue factories be removed from these areas. Besides Jaiswal, Rakesh Pal, Kushma, Kallu, Krishna Kumar Yadav, Sumit, Shobha and other members of the NGO were present when the DM assured them of appropriate action within a week./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Pollution is at its peak," NEW DELHI, India, June 5 -- THE WORLD Environment Day by and large passed off un-noticed here on Sunday. However, a few Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) as well as some government organisations held closed-door seminars to chalk out ambitious future programmes for making the city pollution-free by the next year./  However, zoo director Hemant Kumar organised a rally in the morning with some two hundred schoolchildren to create an awareness among citizens about the hazards of pollution. Children were carrying placards with message of keeping the city green and clean./  The rally, which passed through the congested market area of Nawabganj, attracted the attention of residents./  One would be surprised to know the status of various pollutants which have gripped the city and its people for the past many years. Despite the best efforts, the polluted scenario could not be improved till date./  According to findings of Dr Mukesh Sharma, an environmentalist at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur, (IIT-K), there are only a few pockets in the city where one can go and breathe normally./  The Air Quality Index (AQI) developed at Agriculture University, Head Post Office, Lajpat Nagar, Kidwai Nagar, Fazalganj and Deputy-ka-Parao, showed very poor AQI values. The Suspended Particulate Material (SPM) exceeded the permissible limits in the air in these localities, as per the findings./  A survey conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) revealed that at least 30-40 per cent of the city's air pollution comes from vehicular emissions./  The coal smoke, combined with the automobile and industrial emissions, creates a pall of dust that almost perpetually hangs over the city./  The estimated pollution load from vehicular sources was about 90 tons daily (T/D) while the total emission load from industrial sources was around 250 T/D./  The water pollution problem is on its peak these days./  Water supplied to many residential areas has become undrinkable, but no initiative has been taken to check it so far./  The noise pollution level in the city has also gone very high. Reports of the pollution control board have revealed that in the industrial areas, the noise level has exceeded the limits by 20 per cent during the daytime and five per cent in the night hours against the international standards of 65 db and 45 db respectively./  In commercial areas, the noise pollution has exceeded by 30 per cent in the day and 10 per cent in the night against the permissible limits of 65 db and 55 db respectively./  Similarly, in the residential areas, it has gone up by 20 per cent in the day and by five per cent in the night against the permissible limits of 55 db and 45 db respectively./  In silence zones, the noise level more or less remained constant due to preventive and punitive measures, the report said./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air-pollution can cause heart-attack to Diabetic people," Washington , June 8 -- High exposure to air-pollution (specifically emissions from coal-burning power plants and diesel vehicles) can cause heart-attack to patients of diabeties, says a study published in the journal of the American Heart Association./  The study revealed on days when air pollution levels were high, adults with diabetes were at higher risk for cardiovascular problems due to impairments in blood vessel function. /  ""This research highlights an important mechanism by which particles can increase the risk of heart attacks and deaths. If particles can impair the function of our arteries, it is understandable that this could increase the risk of death from heart  disease. This puts greater emphasis on controlling air pollution sooner rather than later, said Joel Schwartz, a senior author of the study and professor of environmental epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health ./  Interestingly, People without diabeties were not affected. /  ""The number of diabetics in the US is increasing rapidly, suggesting the impact of air pollution is likely to rise. This study shows that both--coal-burning powerplants and diesel engines-- produce dangerous pollutants and should be controlled,"" Schwartz added. /   The study compared the effect of pollution on 270 greater Americans divided into two groups; one positively diagnosed with either type I or type II diabetes and the other comprised of non-diabetic individuals but with a family history of diabetes. To assess blood vessel functioning, an ultrasound device was used to measure how well the participants' arteries were able to expand in response to increased blood flow through the arm. /  Impaired blood vessel function is associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis, heart attacks, stroke, other serious cardiovascular problems and death. On days with either high levels of sulfate particles from power plants or black carbon particles from automobile traffic, the arteries of the diabetics in the study were less able to expand in response to blood flow. /  Specifically, on days when sulfate pollution was elevated the researchers found an 11 percent decrease in vascular reactivity among diabetic participants. On days when black carbon concentrations were elevated, diabetic study participants had a 13 percent decrease in vascular reactivity. In comparison, non-diabetics were not affected. /  Earlier, in the early 1990s researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health showed that particles in the air, predominantly from coal-burning power plants and traffic emissions, were associated with nearly 1,00,000 cardiovascular-related deaths each year./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./  -82608 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Civic problems bother kids too," NEW DELHI, India, June 17 -- ONE MIGHT think that children's world revolves around playing and studies. But a group of City kids, who participated in an activity organised by social organisation Eklavya as part of its `Pitara Utsav', showed that children are no less concerned about environment and civic problems, as also their own specific problems like heavy schoolbags./  Forty-odd children in the age group of eight to 12 years wrote letters to the editor of Hindustan Times as part of an activity organised by the Eklavya recently./  The children were not given any kind of guidelines regarding content of the letters, but they managed to draw attention of the editor to various civic and other common problems faced by citizens. They urged the editor to take steps to improve the situation./  The most important concern shown by the children was about bad roads and garbage strewn in public places. They also spoke about noise pollution, air pollution and heavy schoolbags./  Other problems such as presence of potholes, paucity of drinking water, menace of honeybees also figured in the letters they wrote./  Most of the children have suggested that garbage bins should be placed in public places so that the localities could remain clean and there are no diseases./  They have also requested that the roads be repaired and maintained properly so that they can cycle on the roads to their heart's content and elderly people do not have problem crossing road./  Nehal Makhija and Ekta Sharma both of Arera Colony have expressed concern over condition of roads and the fact that vehicles are driven recklessly. This, they say, leads to a number of accidents and loss of life./  Nehal says that all this should be improved so that elderly people can easily move on roads. She has also expressed concern over the fact that two- wheeler drivers use helmets only near the police checking points./  Vidhushekhar of class VII has suggested that children should not be burdened with overdose of knowledge in lower classes, and that the newspapers should everyday carry material for children. Ashta Singh of Gulmohar Colony has expressed concern over misuse of water, adding water should be saved globally. Swati S of Shahpura has spoken about the problem of sewage disposal in her locality./  Most of the children have very vocally spoken about the problem of heavy schoolbags and urged that this load should be reduced./  The children have promised that they would keep writing letters to the editor to attract attention of the civic and specific problems./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Human Activities and Ecosystem," GUWAHATI, India, July 02 -- According to the report of the World Bank, in Philippines serious environmental degradations have been caused due to agriculture, urban and coastal development, water and air pollution. This has resulted in tremendous economic loss which is estimated to be more than USD two billion a year. To save from further loss Philippines government had adopted legislation to improve air and water quality and preserve environmental resources. Due to climate change, there is a decline of butter flies in the entire Himalayan region of India. It is mosquitoes that swarm the areas today. Skin diseases and infections are now more common in the children of this area. The most important cause for ecological imbalance is the increase in human population and their activities./  The ecosystem is a basic functional unit or system made up of living organisms and their environment which is capable of independent existence. The living organisations are in a State of balance or equilibrium with one another and with the physical environment. This situation does not remain in the same condition for all time. They maintain intricate balance with changing environmental conditions. When the organisms become incapable of maintaining this balance, they die. The dynamic balance achieved by the organisms is mainly through self adjustment or homo-statis mechanism./  In the early periods, man was living just like other animals in the ecosystem. He gathered foods and other basic needs from nature. Therefore, his impact on the ecosystem was not felt. He lived in perfect harmony with the environment. When man learnt the use of fire and made tools out of stones and iron his impact on the ecosystem became gradually visible. It will be bewildering to find that population is increasing by leaps and bounds. The most important cause of imbalance in the ecosystem is the increase in human population. Population is an important resource for development, yet it is a major source of environment degradation when it exceeds the threshold limits of the support system. At the beginning of the Christian era, population of the world was estimated at about 300 million. This increased to 1000 million by 1850, 2000 million by 1930, 4000 in 1975. According to UNPPA report world population has touched the height of 6 billion on October 12, 1999. The UNO has declared October 12 as ?Day of 6 billion?. When settled agriculture came into practice, man started replacing the natural ecosystem with cultivated crop. Man is at the top of the ecological pyramid and due to increase in population, the top of the ecological pyramid and due to increase in population, the top of the pyramid has become broad without corresponding widening of the base and top heavy. For this reason, the ecological pyramid is tending to become unstable. In order to feed the large human population, the natural ecological efficiency of 10% is not adequate. Large areas of forest and grass land had to be cleared for cultivation. Because of all these human activities, the entire ecological system has become greatly disturbed or imbalanced. To bring this situation back to the original State i.e. climax succession the complex interacting forces in the ecosystem are balanced and natural checks work to maintain that balance. It is estimated that about 1000 years are needed to establish a climax succession in a temperate region and about 250 years in tropical region. In tropical region conditions of growth are better and growth takes place throughout the year./  Agriculture has resulted in large scale global ecological imbalance. In agricultural practice, the diversity of natural ecosystem is replaced by cultivated crop over thousands of hectares year after year. This has rendered the ecosystem unstable. There is no recycling of nutrients as taken place in the natural ecosystem. The soil becomes toxic. Without addition of chemical fertilizers desired yield of crop cannot be expected. The removal of original plant cover and it's replacement by single cultivated crop reduces the biological diversity and simplify the ecosystem. As a result, it becomes vulnerable to pests and disease, which attack that particular crop./  In order to feed large human population, large areas of forest and grass land had to be cleared for cultivation. Deforestation is a threat to the economy, quality of life and future of the environment. The main causes of deforestation are explosion of human and livestock population, increased requirements of timber and fuel wood, paper-board and newsprint etc., expansion of cropland and enhanced grazing. Deforestation results in removal of habitats of animals and birds disturbing the balance of nature. If we look at the Indian scenario, it is found that we have already lost millions of hectares of forest. Soil erosion takes place resulting in changes in the abiotic components of the ecosystem. In India, we lose nearly 6000 million tonnes of sub soil through erosion resulting in the increase of floods and other disasters. Ideally 33% of land of our country must be covered by forests. Forest cover is only 19.43%, out of which only 13% are thick forests. Deforestation has led to soil erosion, increased run off and floods. Wind erosion has become dominant in arid regions and migration of sand dunes has left to advance of the deserts. /  One of the effects of air pollution in the industrial regions is the phenomenon of acid rain. Surface water of lakes and rivers become acidic and this affects aquatic organisms. Smoke from thermal power stations, factories and forest fires affect people and other organisms in the biosphere. Lead, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide are added to the atmosphere from automobile exhaust. Lead is known to hamper haemoglobin formation chlorofluro carbons which are widely used as propellants and as refrigerants cause ozone depletion in the atmosphere./  Soil is considered as no-renewable resource. There are many natural and synthetic materials that can adversely affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil and seriously affect its productivity. The soil pollutions are pesticides, insecticides, fertilisers, industrial wastes, mining wastes, salts, radio active materials, tin, iron, lead, mercury, aluminium and plastics. For increasing productivity on cultivated lands fertilisers, pesticides etc., are used. They are nothing but chemicals. They affect the soils and organisms on the land. Such chemicals get washed down to lakes and ponds. This results in depletion of dissolved oxygen in water. Aquatic organisms like fish cannot survive under such conditions and they die. This condition is called eutrophication of lakes./  Water pollution affects both terestrial and aquatic ecosystem. Effluents from paper mills, sugar factories, chemical factories and tanneries are let into rivers and lakes or allow them to stagnant on the land. Water draining from cultivated lands may have harmful pesticides and other chemicals in dissolved State and pollute rivers. Pollution takes place in the ocean by discharge of sewage from cities and factories along the coast. Nuclear power stations and disposal nuclear waste may cause pollution of coast. Nuclear power stations and disposal nuclear waste may cause pollution of ocean waters. Drilling for oil on the ocean floors disturbs marine ecosystem. Various harmful chemicals like DDT can enter into food chain through polluted water./  Now man has become aware of the harmful effects of his activities. Man has understood that his economic activities are threatening his very survival on earth. The global ecological imbalance can be set right only by proper understanding of ecological processes which take place in the biosphere. This understanding will surely help man to live in perfect harmony with organisms in the ecosystem. Such steps will make the earth a habitable place for man and other organisms./ (Published on the occasion of Vana Mohotsava)./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -153566 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Waterlogging, Garbage Creating Major Health Hazard"," GUWAHATI, July 19 -- Of late, waterlogging, accumulated garbage on the streets, and dust have emerged as a major health hazard for the citizens. While, during the rainy days, the people have to endure prolonged coexistence with filthy waters that inundate roads and enter houses, a few days of the scorching sun is enough to put a thick layer of mud on the city roads and streets, which gradually turns into dust creating severe air pollution. /  ?Constant waterlogging can lead to a number of diseases like malaria, gastroenteritis, etc. Malaria is a major threat because stagnant water is an ideal breeding ground for the malaria mosquito. Besides, as the rainwater gets mixed with the polluted drain water, the chances of being afflicted with skin disease are also very much there,? Dr MM Deka, Principal, Guwahati Medical College, says. /  Even after the watrerlogging subsides, there is hardly any respite for the citizens. First, the areas under waterlogging, including roads, become a cesspool of mud, silt and all sorts of dirt and garbage carried by the water. Then, after a few days of sunshine, the mud gives way to soil and dust. And the ever-increasing vehicular traffic in the city ensures that a misty shroud of dust now drapes most of the city roads and streets that had been reeling under artificial flood. /  The increasing level of dust in the city's atmosphere has been a major cause of air pollution. According to the Pollution Control Board Assam (PCBA) Chairman, Prof Jawaharlal Dutta, presence of dust in large quantities is among the main reasons behind the higher accumulation of respiratorial suspended particulate matters (RSPMs) in many areas of the city. ?Our monitoring has shown that several areas like Paltanbazar and Ganeshguri have RSPMs well above the permissible limits,? he says. /  The situation has also adversely affected the health of the citizens. ?The dangers of being exposed to dust are many, as it can cause various ailments and disorders. All sorts of respiratory tract infections including sinusitis, laryngitis, pharyngites, bronchitis, etc., besides cold and sore throat are a common problem with people exposed to dust pollution,? Dr Deka says. Dust pollution also results in eye and skin infections. And as the dust contains elements of polluted materials and filth from drain waters, it carries germs of a lot of other diseases as well. /  With the hills in and around the city losing their green cover with unabated encroachment and rampant earth-cutting, waterlogging and the consequent dust pollution is assuming alarming proportions. The hills have lost much of their water-retaining capacity, and a single burst of shower is enough to bring down huge quantities of loose earth and silt from the hills, which ultimately clog the drains and find their way to the roads and streets./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -154112 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Polluted city air an evolving health hazard," NEW DELHI, India, Aug 1 -- AUTO-EMISSIONS seem to have got one traffic cop. A head constable, reportedly, has gone down with bronchial asthma. Suffering for the last two years, a shift for him from old to new Bhopal did not help, pollution level having increased there too./  His physician ultimately connected his condition to exposure to auto-emissions. Reacting predictably, the police administration promptly requisitioned masks for its traffic cops to fend off the deteriorating air quality./  There has been a phenomenal rise in the number of automobiles in the town during recent years. Of the currently registered about four-lakh vehicles, an overwhelming majority are two-wheelers./  A large number of them are old, ill-maintained and re-conditioned, and, hence, heavy polluters. The same could be said of about 15,000-odd heavy and light commercial vehicles, buses, minibuses, tempos and jeeps./  When all these move in the thickly populated commercial-cum-residential areas they foul up the air spreading misery all round. Dread is what one feels visiting such areas during the peak traffic hours./  The suffering of shopkeepers/salesmen of the Chowk is such that it makes them crave for closure of all two-wheeler manufacturing plants. I know it because they have told me so. Subjected to a slow, agonising death, their distress, unlike that of the lone cop, has never made news./  According to WHO, long-term exposure to air-pollution can raise the risk of pulmonary and heart diseases, adversely affect respiratory system and may take years off the life-span./  Now, evidently, even the new town is no longer free of air-pollution, slowly and surely as it creeps up through the busy arterial roads. My eyes burnt the other day while driving through the increasingly polluted air in the Civil Lines./  Although assuming problematic proportions, the growing air-pollution is yet to receive the recognition it merits from the authorities./  Faltering efforts made for pollution-check of vehicles a couple of years back were unceremoniously dumped. Pollution levels are, reportedly, periodically measured and the findings are forwarded, curiously, to the RTO, apparently, only to be given an appropriate burial there./  One can, therefore, see buses, jeeps, tempos, autos, scooters, etc merrily plying, belching unchecked thick, black smoke heavily loaded with particulates. Cars, mostly Euro-II/Euro-III compliant, are much cleaner. Their clean act is, however, neutralised by a few heavily smoking tempos./  With addition of large number of vehicles everyday, we may soon find ourselves in the big league. Delhi, despite the Supreme Court intervention, wholesale conversion of public transport to CNG and strict pollution control, is still polluted. Two out of five of its residents suffer from health disorders related to poor air quality./  And breathing Bombay's heavily polluted air amounts to smoking two packs of cigarettes. A WHO report says two-thirds of 800,000 premature deaths caused by air-pollution occur in Asia. The automobile boom has become environmentalists' nightmare./  No wonder the 'Asian Brown Haze', a grey cocktail of carbon, sulphur and ash, the size of the continental USA, floats 3 km above much of South Asia. Our town may soon be making substantial contributions to it./  Cleaning up the town's air is not difficult, devoid as it is of major industrial or power plants. Clamping down on auto-emission alone would solve much of the problem./  Discarding of the fuzzy bureaucratic control and creation of a single authority earmarked for controlling vehicular emissions is urgently needed. Proper management of traffic enabling its unhindered flow and stiff action against fuel adulterators are some of the necessary short-term steps./  Above all, the need is of huge doses of firm administrative action sourced from a (committed) political will with, perhaps, a little economic sacrifice all round. We owe it to us and to our progeny./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
'Stern steps urged to check air pollution'," NEW DELHI, India, Oct. 22 -- End of the monsoon and onset of winter in most cities in the State including Satna, Rewa, Ratlam, Nagda, Jabalpur, Gwalior, Ujjain and Bhopal has brought with it deterioration in air quality./  Worsening status of pollution is a major concern and the noises made by media, public, environmentalists, officials and NGOs need to be translated into concrete action, regional director of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) Dr K S Tiwari said today./  He was speaking on the occasion of launch of an environmental programme simultaneously at Bhopal, Sagar, Jabalpur and other parts of the State. Commissioner, Higher Education, SD Agrawal was present on the occasion./  Dr Tiwari while lauding the fact that problem of lead in petrol has been taken care of that was cause of serious breathing disorder, kidney dysfunction, blood-related problem and cancer./  However, its replacement benzene is also not too safe and causes leukemia (blood cancer). He said that increasing number of vehicles is leading to increasing level of polluting benzene. Research has to be carried out to find a safer substitute./  He said that stern and immediate steps should be taken to avoid further deterioration of air quality. Study/research focused on links between disease like respiratory problems and cancers and air quality must be performed./  Bhopal, he said, fortunately has sufficient vegetation to absorb and assimilate some pollutants in the air but still pollutants like benzene may acquire a dimension of threat./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
France targets plastic bags," NEW DELHI, India, Oct 30 -- FOR THE last decade or so, legislation on plastics in India has been based upon recommendations from committees that are covertly or overtly monopolised by the plastic industry./  As a result, we have had to contend with ridiculous legislation like thicker bags, which actually do nothing for the planet, except load it with trash and people who feel good even if they do use plastics./  Now, France has come up with a legislation that will ban non-biodegradable plastic bags by 2010. It's sensible, although France does not have open drains or cows that choke to death. In short, despite facing fewer problems than we do, the French have decided to call for a ban./  They will encourage non-biodegradable bags as replacement, as actual non-plastic alternatives are hard to come by anymore in France. Besides, as agricultural subsidies from the EU are reduced, farmers, the backbone of France's economy, will require assistance from within the country./  This they have, because biodegradable plastic requires large quantities of corn, which at once creates markets. In just five years, it could be possible to see a complete change in the French landscape./  Floods, health, environment: Linked The World Bank has just released a study, Environment Matters, that should make us all think about the floods in Bangalore and Mumbai in a new way. According to the report, almost 20 per cent of the burden of disease is due to environmental risks like unsafe water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene. These cause millions of premature deaths per year. Urban air pollution is estimated to cause about 800,000 premature deaths annually./  Consider this in the context of the post-floods. Ideally, there should be studies commissioned to study the environmental health impacts of the floods. If we did have the data, it would surely help us to handle the consequent crises of health. It would also help us to meet our Millenium Development Goals (MDGs), which require India to reduce its infant mortality rate./  Apart from this, one of the biggest losses to both these cities, engines of finance and software, is economic, mostly on account of manpower impact./  Of course, the linkages here are not new and the World Bank is not a pioneer in the field.

Pavement-edges are cesspools of pollution!," London, Nov. 4 -- Walking to work may be good for your heart, but think twice before walking on the edges of the pavement facing the road, because a new study has concluded that it is almost a tenth more polluted than the other side facing the buildings./  The study was carried out by a team from Imperial College London as part of the four-year Dispersion of Air Pollution and Penetration into the Local Environment (DAPPLE) project, which is aimed at helping tackle urban pollution hotspots, and published in the journal Atmospheric Environment./  It found that people walking on the edge nearest to the road encountered higher concentrations of ultrafine particles which are associated with respiratory illnesses and cancer, than those on the side facing the buildings./  The study involved eleven volunteers taking 20-minute walks over 12 days along Marylebone Road, near Madame Tussauds in London, and monitored the pollution levels with the help of pumps that sucked in air as they walked./ ""It is something that susceptible people like asthmatics and those suffering from cardiovascular disease should be made aware of."" Dr Surbjit Kaur, the deputy scientific co-ordinator for DAPPLE, who is based at the centre for environmental policy at Imperial College, was quoted by New Scientist, as saying./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
A healthy lifestyle can keep cancer at bay," London, Nov. 18 -- A new research has revealed that a simple lifestyle and environmental changes could significantly help to cut the number of cancer deaths around the world each year./ Experts linked more than a third of the seven million cancer deaths worldwide in 2001 to nine potentially modifiable risk factors, these include poor diet, smoking, alcohol, obesity, lack of exercise and air pollution. /  The Harvard University study is published in The Lancet revealed that the findings were based on a comprehensive review of scientific studies and other sources such as government reports. The Harvard team and their collaborators also re-analysed some of the original data from the studies. /  They concluded that in low and middle-income countries the most important risk factors were smoking, alcohol use, and low consumption of fruit and vegetables. /  In high-income countries, smoking, alcohol use, and obesity played the leading role. /  Lead researcher Dr Majid Ezzati said that smoking was by far the most important risk factor for cancer, responsible for 21 percent of cancer deaths worldwide. /  He said public health campaigns targeting smoking in the UK had led to a drop in deaths from lung cancer in the past few decades, and showed just how effective such campaigns could be. /   ""Primary prevention through lifestyle and environmental interventions remains the main route for reducing the global cancer burden,"" he was quoted by The BBC, as saying. /  ""If implemented, reduction of exposure to well-known behavioural and environmental risk factors would prevent a substantial proportion of deaths from cancer,"" he added./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
One-third cancer deaths caused by 9 avoidable risk factors," London, Nov. 19 -- More than one third of seven million cancer deaths worldwide every year are caused by nine avoidable behavioral and environmental risk factors, a new study published in the recent of the journal The Lancet has found./  The researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) estimated mortality for 12 types of cancer linked to nine risk factors in seven World Bank regions for the year 2001. They found that of the seven million deaths worldwide that year from cancer, 35 percent were attributable to the nine well-known behavioral and environmental risk factors. They also looked at how the risks, and the cancers they cause, were distributed over the regions of the world. /  The analysis covered all high-income countries together, and separated low-income and middle-income countries into geographical regions: East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The nine risk factors were overweight and obesity, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol use, unsafe sex, urban air pollution, indoor smoke from household use of coal and contaminated injections in healthcare settings./  They found that more than one in every three of the seven million deaths from cancer worldwide was caused by these nine potentially modifiable risk factors, with alcohol and smoking playing large roles in all income levels and regions. Worldwide, the nine risk factors caused 1.6 million cancer deaths among men and 830,000 among women. Smoking alone is estimated to have caused 21 percent of deaths from cancer worldwide./  In high-income countries, these nine risks caused 760,000 cancer deaths; smoking, alcohol, and overweight and obesity were the most important causes of cancer in these nations./  In low- and middle-income regions the nine risks caused 1.67 million cancer deaths; and smoking, alcohol consumption and low fruit and vegetable intake were the leading risk factors for these deaths. Sexual transmission of human papillomavirus is the leading risk factor for cervical cancer in women in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where access to cervical screening is also limited./  Among low- and middle-income regions, Europe and Central Asia had the highest proportion of death from cancer from the nine risk factors studied; 39 percent of 825,000 cancer deaths in the low- and middle-income countries of Europe and Central Asia were caused by these risks. The effects were even larger among men; one half of cancer deaths among men in the low and middle income countries of Europe and Central Asia were caused by these nine risks./  ""These results clearly show that many globally important types of cancer are preventable by changes in lifestyle behaviors and environmental interventions. To win the war against cancer, we must focus not just on advances in bio-medical technologies, but also on technologies and policies that change the behaviors and environments that cause those cancers,"" said lead researcher Majid Ezzati./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"PROPER SEGREGATION, HANDLING OF BIO-MEDICAL WASTES URGED"," GUWAHATI, Nov 21 -- As a part of its drive to create awareness about pollution control norms and to curb the spread of fatal diseases like HIV/AIDS hepatitis B and cancer, the Pollution Control Board, Assam (PCBA) organised a short term training programme on bio-medical waste (BMW) segregation, handling and disposal at NF Railway Hospital recently. Medical Director, Dr Rabha of NF Railway Central Hospital presided over the training programme. There were about 100 doctors and nurses from nearby railway hospital and Maligaon Central Hospital who participated in the training programme, a press release said./  Speaking on the occasion, chairman, PCBA, Prof JL Dutta dwelt on the issues of proper segregation, handling and disposal of BMW at source. He said that every hospital rising home must have at least one electric needle destroyer in each nursing station (ward) for destroying the needle immediately after its use. The disposable syringes are to be disinfected by bleaching solution and then crushed (mutilated). This is to be done to ensure that are not affected with HIV, AIDS and hepatitis B infection. The needle and syringes obtained from blood bank after blood transfusion are also to be disposed in a similar way. The blood bag and other items contaminated with blood should be treated as infectious items and are to be disposed as per Bio-Medical Waste (Management & Handling) Rule. Care has to be taken so that blood which is transfused is free from infection like HIV, AIDS, hepatitis B etc. The whole exercise will make significant contribution towards elimination of spread of HIV, AIDS, hepatitis B and cancer./  The chairman mentioned that practically hospitals/nursing homes generate only 10-15% infectious wastes but due to lack of proper segregation/separation at source these infectious waste contaminate the uninfectious wastes thereby increasing the amount of infectious waste. Especially, he highlighted the need to destroy the needles and syringes at source after single use to stop recycling. The chairman also highlighted that anatomical waste obtained in the, operation theatre, blood, body fluid, cotton swab, bandages etc. are to be incinerated in a two-chamber incinerator with good air pollution control device and chimney height should be 30 meters, with regular monitoring. The temperatures are to be maintained are 800?50 ?C at the primary chamber and at 1000?50 ?C at secondary chamber. The ash produced so should be disposed through secured landfill. This will curb significantly the growth of cancers as carcinogenic gases like Dioxin & Furan will be trapped in the air pollution control device and will not come to the atmosphere./  Moreover, he said that all the BMW should be handled by using globes and after one use it should be destroyed properly. Also, to treat the liquid waste (effluent) generated from the hospitals/ nursing homes, install an effluent treatment plant (ETP) and after the treatment it could be released to the drains. The chairman also emphasised installation of a common incinerator and common effluent treatment plant combining together several hospitals/nursing homes and this should be installed outside the residential area, but during this, proper dare should be taken when the wastes are taken from one place to other. /  Here also, the incinerator should be equipped with proper air pollution control device so that the toxic gases are not released to the atmosphere. The chairman also warned not to burn any kind of materials containing chlorinated substances and PVC bags, in the incinerator./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -176851 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

DRAFT INTEGRATED ENERGY POLICY PUT FOR PUBLIC DEBATE," NEW DELHI, India, Dec. 15 -- The Government of India's Planning Commission issued the following press release:/  India faces formidable challenges in meeting its energy needs and providing adequate energy of desired quality in various forms to users in a sustainable manner and at reasonable costs. India needs to sustain a 8% to 10% economic growth to eradicate poverty and meet its economic & human development goals. Such economic growth would call for increased demand for energy and ensuring access to clean, convenient and reliable energy for all to address human development. To deliver a sustained growth of 8% through 2031, India would, in the very least, need to grow its primary energy supply by 3 to 4 times and electricity supply by 5 to 7 times of today's consumption. Along with quantity the quality of energy supply has to also improve. The energy challenge is of fundamental importance to India's economic growth imperatives./  There are no projections worldwide that show a lowering of dependence on fossil fuels by 2031-32. Oil and gas are forecast to remain in a tight demand-supply balance and the likelihood is that most new oil and gas will come from a politically uncertain Middle East. Such a global backdrop as resulted in high price volatility for oil & gas. Further, energy security concerns are driving key consumers such as the US, China and Japan (that together account for some 40% of the world's primary energy consumption) to seek coal - the world's most abundant fossil fuel. This has also led to a push worldwide for clean coal technologies, carbon sequestration coal to liquids and the zero emission initiative. Coal shall remain India's most important energy source till 2031-32 and possibly beyond. India will need to take a lead in seeking clean coal technologies and, given its growing demand, new coal extraction technologies such as in-situ gasification to tap its vast coal reserves that are difficult to extract economically using conventional technologies./  The broad vision behind the energy policy is to reliably meet the demand for energy services of II sectors including the lifeline energy needs of vulnerable households, in all parts of the country, with safe and convenient energy at the least cost in a technically efficient, economically viable and sustainable manner. Meeting this vision would require that India pursues all available fuel options and forms of energy, both conventional and non-conventional, as well as new and emerging technologies and energy sources. Assured supply of such energy and technologies at all times, with a prescribed confidence level, considering the shocks and disruption that can be reasonably expected is essential to providing energy security to all./  The approach of the Committee is directed to realize cost-effective energy system. For this the following are needed:/  (i) Restructure markets so as to promote competition./  (ii) Allow market forces to determine pricing and resource allocation under an effective and credible regulatory oversight, as far as possible./  (iii) Provide transparent and targeted subsidies./  (iv) Improve efficiencies across the energy chain./  (v) Reflect externalities of energy consumption./  (vi) Use policies that rely on incentives and which are implementable./  A competitive market without any entry barriers is theoretically the most efficient way to realize optimal fuel and technology choices for extraction, conversion, transportation, distribution and end use of energy. The tax structure and regulation across energy sub-sectors should be consistent and institutional arrangements should provide a level playing field to all players. Social objectives should be ideally met through direct transfers. Environmental externalities should be treated uniformly and internalised, as far as possible, under the polluter pays principle. An energy market with the foregoing features would minimise market distortions and maximise efficiency gains. An integrated energy policy is needed to weave together the foregoing conflicting parameters into an energy market that ensures that energy availability does not become a constraint on India's economic growth and competitiveness./  While the medium to long-term challenges of ensuring competitive energy supplies are formidable, the immediate problem of power and coal shortages also require policy actions. The policy recommendations have addressed the immediate as well as the medium to long-term issues. /  Some key recommendations are summarized below: /  (i) Coal Shall Remain India's Primary Energy Source till 2031-32, Current shortages are a concern:/  (a) Coal accounts for over 50% of India's commercial energy consumption and some 78% of domestic coal production is dedicated to power generation. Since prices were de-controlled, the sector has become profitable primarily as a result of price increases and the rising share of open cast production. The present shortage can be addressed by encouraging imports which are also needed from a longer-term perspective. Thus we need to facilitate coal imports and create the needed infrastructure. Imports also put a competitive pressure on domestic coal industry to be efficient./  (b) The Committee has concluded that imported coal is far more cost competitive to imported gas for power generation especially along the western & southern coasts of India. Such a cost advantage is likely to continue. /  (c) At the same time domestic coal production should be stepped up by allotting coal blocks to central and state public sector units and for captive mines to notified end users. Coal blocks held by Coal India Limited (CIL) which CIL cannot bring into production by 2016-17, either directly or through joint ventures, should be made available to other eligible candidates for development and bringing into production by 2011-12./  (d) Ideally, the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 should be amended to facilitate (a) private participation in coal mining for purposes other than those specified and (b) offering of future coal blocks to potential entrepreneurs. /  (ii) Power Sector Reforms must focus on control over aggregate technical and commercial losses of state power utilities. Only financially healthy state power utilities can sustain the growing Central and State Public Sector Units (PSUs) and provide the needed comfort on payment security to attract private investment in the power sector at internationally competitive tariffs. To control AT&C losses the Committee recommends that the existing Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme (APDRP) be restructured to ensure energy flow auditing at the distribution transformer level through automated meter reading, geographical information system (GIS) mapping of the network and consumers and separation of feeders for agricultural pumps. Investment in developing the MIS that can support full energy audit for each distribution transformer is essential to reform and reduction in AT&C losses. This will fix accountability and provide a baseline which is an essential prerequisite to privatisation. The revised APDRP would provide incentives to SEBs linked to performance outcomes and would also include incentives to staff for reduction in AT&C losses. The Committee also recommends that a liberal captive and group captive regime foreseen under the Electricity Act 2003 be realised on the ground./  India's liberal captive regime would not only derive economic benefits from availability of distributed generation but also set competitive wheeling charges to supply power to group captive consumers. This will pave the way for open access to distribution networks. This will facilitate private generation that limits its interface with the host utility to merely use of the distribution network for a fee and thus can be realised even before AT&C losses are reduced. However, to achieve these objectives, the Committee feels that it is essential to separate the cost of the pure wires business (carriage) from the energy business (content) in both transmission & distribution. Electricity Act 2003 recognises such separation for the transmission sub-segment. Separation of content from carriage in the distribution sub-segment, however, is foreseen only through the provision of open access. The wires business within the distribution sub-segment is also a natural monopoly and must be regulated as proposed under (iii) (e) below. Further, introduction of ABT and the upgrading of State Load Despatch Centres to the technological level of Regional Load Despatch Centres will have to be realised./  (iii) Reduce Cost of Power: In terms of purchasing power parity, power tariffs in India for industry, commerce & large households are among the highest in the world. A number of measures are suggested to reduce cost of power./  (a) The Government Policy should seek to ensure that all generation & transmission projects started in the 11th Plan & beyond should be competitively built on the basis of tariff based bidding under a prescribed price cap./  (b) Where a cost plus regime cannot be avoided and the payments are guaranteed by the Government of India (GOI) the internal rate of return on total capital employed should bear a reasonable relationship to the long-term government bond coupon at the time of the approval./  (c) Government should seed the capital markets to develop market-based instruments that effectively extend the tenure of debt available to power projects to say 20 years. This will reduce the capacity charge in the earlier years and spread it more evenly over the life of the project./  (d) Standardise the unit size and invite global tenders for 20 to 30 units to get substantial bulk discount./  (e) Distribution should be bid out on the basis of a distribution margin or paid for by a regulated distribution charge determined on a cost plus basis including a profit mark up similar to that paid under (b) above./  (iv) Rationalise Fuel Prices: Relative prices play the most important role in choice of fuel and energy form. They are thus the most vital aspect of Integrated Energy Policy that promotes efficient fuel choices and facilitates appropriate substitution. In a competitive set up, the marginal use value of different fuels, which are substitutes, is equal at a given place and time and the prices of different fuels at different places do not differ by more than the cost of transporting the fuels. Then the resulting inter-fuel choices would be economically efficient. /  Prices of different fuels should not be set independently of each other. As a general rule, all commercial primary energy sources must be priced at trade parity prices at the point of sale. This means FOB price for products for which the country is a net exporter and CIF price for which it is a net importer./  This principle is extremely relevant for the petroleum sector wherein bulk of the crude is imported and India is fast becoming a net exporter of petroleum products. The only legitimate alternative to trade parity prices in the petroleum sector is to permit full price competition at the refinery gate and the retail level. To provide a cushion against the volatility of prices on the international market, FOB or CIF prices, can be set on the basis of median prices over a month or three months. /  Coal prices should ideally be left to the market and trading of coal, nationally and internationally, should be free. Only a competitive free market can do an efficient job of price determination. A competitive market requires that there are multiple producers and that there are no entry barriers to new producers or to imports. Steps to achieve these objectives for the coal market are summarized in paragraph (i) above. Pending the creation of such a competitive market independent regulation of coal prices becomes essential./  Natural Gas is a non-tradable commodity in the absences of significant investments in pipelines or, alternatively, in liquification, cryogenic shipping & regasification. Thus the natural gas price can be determined through competition among different producers (this presumes multiple sources and a competitive supply-demand balance) or independently regulated on a cost plus basis including reasonable returns (where competing supply sources are absent and/or demand exceeds available supply). Another option could be to price gas on a net-back-basis./  Should a scenario wherein gas becomes 15%-20% of India's energy mix materialise by 2031-32; some 60% to 80% of the gas supply would be used for power generation. This would mean that beyond the level of gas consumption in the fertiliser, petrochemical, automotive and domestic sectors gas must compete with coal, the key alternative for power generation. A competitive coal market is thus important for setting a proper price of natural gas on a net-back-basis. An alternative to pricing domestic gas could be the net realisation of the domestic natural gas producer after investing and getting a return on the infrastructure needed to make the natural gas tradable across borders./  Central and State taxes on commercial energy supplies need to be rationalized to yield optimal fuel choices and investment decisions. Relative prices of fuels can be distorted if taxes and subsidies are not equivalent across fuels. The equivalence should be in term of effective calorie. In other words they should be such that producer and consumer choices as to which fuel and which technology to use are not affected by the taxes and subsidies. Environmental taxes and subsidies, however, are levied to affect choices. Differential taxes can be justified here if they appropriately reflect environmental externalities. A consistent application of polluter pays principle or consumer pays principle should be made to attain environmental objectives at least cost./  (v) Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management: Lowering energy intensity of GDP growth through higher energy efficiency is key to meeting India's energy challenge & ensuring its energy security. India's energy intensity of growth has been falling and is about half what it used to be in the early seventies. Currently India consumes 0.19 kilogram of oil equivalent per dollar of GDP expressed in purchasing parity terms. This is equal to the energy intensity of the OECD and better than the 0.21 kilograms of China, 0.22 kilograms of the US and a World average of 0.21. However, there are several countries in Europe at or below 0.12 with Brazil at 0.14 and Japan at 0.15./  Thus, clearly there is room to improve and energy intensity can be brought down significantly in India with current commercially available technologies. India would need to and must succeed in achieving much lower energy intensity compared to its current level. Lowering energy intensity through higher efficiency is like creating a virtual source of untapped domestic energy. It may be noted that a unit of energy saved by a user is greater than a unit produced, as it saves on production losses, as well as transport, transmission and distribution losses. Thus a ""Negawatt"", produced by reducing energy need saves more than a Megawatt generated. The Committee feels that upto 25 percent reduction in India's energy intensity is possible overn current levels. /  Efficiency can be increased in energy extraction, energy conversion, energy transportation, as well as in energy consumption. Further, the same level of service can be provided by alternate means requiring less energy. The major areas where efficiency in energy use can make a substantial impact are mining, electricity generation, electricity transmission, electricity distribution, pumping water, industrial production processes, haulage, mass transport, building design, construction, heating ventilation & air conditioning, lighting and household appliances./  As the Indian economy opens up to international competition, it would become more energy efficient. This is well demonstrated by India's steel & cement industry. However, the Committee recommends the following policies, some of which can be implemented through voluntary targets undertaken by industry associations as opposed to external inspection and enforcement./  (a) The Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) should be merged with Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) that is seen as an autonomous statutory body under the Energy Conservation Act. The merged entity should endeavour to achieve financial independence through energy savings it helps generate & may also tap financial support from key industry players with an interest in India's energy sector. /  (b) Increase coal use efficiency in power generation from the current average of 30.5 percent to 9 percent for all new plants. /  (c) Require a least cost planning approach providing level playing field, in the very least, to Negawatts and Megawatts. /  (d) Promote urban mass transport, freight movement by railways, and energy efficient vehicles. Enforce minimum fuel efficiency, standards for all vehicles. /  (e) Force the pace of energy efficiency improvement in energy using appliances and equipment and incentivise through golden carrots which give an appropriate incentive to the firm which first commercialises equipment that exceeds energy efficiency target./  (f) Enforce labelling with major financial repercussions if equipment fails to deliver stated efficiencies. In extreme cases resort to black listing of errant suppliers at consumer information web sites and for government procurement. /  (g) Promote minimum life cycle cost purchases instead of minimum initial cost procurement by government and public sector. /  (h) Require industry with a turnover in excess of say 50 crore to employ at least one certified internal energy auditor reporting directly to the board/owner like the current internal auditor. For smaller industries achieve the same by clubbing a group of them together or requiring each industrial estate to provide such services collectively for a fee. /  (i) Annual audits must include energy audits for all specified energy intensive industries and industries with a turnover exceeding say Rs. 100 crore. /  (j) Establish benchmarks of energy consumption for all energy intensive sectors. /  (k) Disseminate information, support training and reward best practices with national level honours in energy efficiency & energy conservation. /  (l) Institute specialisations in energy efficiency/energy conservation in all technical colleges and commence certification of such experts. /  (vi) Augmenting Resources: India's energy resources can be augmented till 2031-32 by exploration to find more of coal, oil and gas, or by recovering a higher percentage of the in-place reserves. Developing the thorium cycle for nuclear power and exploiting non-conventional energy, especially solar, offer possibilities for India's energy independence beyond 2050. /  At a growth rate of 5% in domestic production, currently extractable coal resources will be exhausted in about 40 years. However, only about 45% of the potential coal bearing area has currently been covered by regional surveys. Further, it is felt that both regional as well as detailed drilling can be made more comprehensive. Covering all coal bearing areas with comprehensive regional & detailed drilling could make a significant difference to the estimated life of India's coal reserves. Finally, India's extractable coal resources can be augmented through in-situ coal gasification which permits using coal deposits which are at greater depth or not easily extracted by conventional methods. Similarly extracting coal bed methane before and during mining can augment the country's energy resources. Again, enhanced oil recovery and incremental oil recovery technologies can improve the proportion of in-place reserves that can be economically recovered from abandoned/depleted fields. Finally, isolated deposits of all hydrocarbons including coal may be tapped economically through sub leases to the private sector./  (vii) Role of Hydro and Nuclear: It is seen that even if India succeeds in exploiting its full hydro potential of 150,000 MW, the contribution of hydro to the energy mix would be around 5-6%. Similarly, even if a 20-fold increase takes place in India's nuclear power capacity by 2031-32, the contribution of nuclear energy to India's energy mix is also, at best, expected to be 5-6%./  Though its contribution to energy requirement is small, hydro electricity's flexibility and suitability as a peaking power make it valuable. Moreover, hydro development especially storage schemes are critical for India as India's per capita water storage is the lowest among all its comparators. Creating such storages is critical to India's water security, flood control and drought control. /  Nuclear, on the other hand, theoretically offers India the most potent means to long-term energy security. India has to succeed in realising the three-stage development process described in the main report and thereby tap its vast thorium resource to become truly energy independent beyond 2050. Continuing support to the three-stage development of India's nuclear potential is considered essential. /  (viii) Role of Renewables: Renewables are unlikely to make a major impact on India's energy mix till 2031-32. Even with a 20-fold increase in capacity, renewables cannot account for more than 5-7% of India's energy mix. However, from a longer-term perspective and the need to maximally develop domestic supply options as well as the need to diversify energy sources, renewables remain important to India's energy sector. It would not be out of place to mention that solar power could be an important player in India attaining energy independence beyond 2050. /  Subsidy for renewables may be justified on several grounds. A renewable energy source may be environmentally benign. It may be locally available making it possible to supply energy earlier than a centralized system. Grid connected renewables could provide system benefits by generating energy at the lagging ends of the grid. Further, renewables may provide employment and livelihood to the poor. However, the subsidies should be given for a well-defined period or upto a well-defined limit and should be linked to outcomes (energy generated), and not just outlays (capacity installed)./  Power Regulators must create alternative incentive structures such as mandated feed-in-laws or differential tariffs to encourage utilities to integrate wind, small hydro, cogeneration etc. into their systems. A subsidy could also be given in the form of a Tradable Tax Rebate Certificates (TTRC) based on energy generated. The rebate claim becomes payable depending upon the amount of electricity/energy actually certified as having been supplied./  An annual renewable energy report should be published providing details of actual performance of different renewable technologies at the state and national level. This would include actual energy supplied from different renewable options, availability, actual costs, operating and maintenance problems etc. It should also report on social benefits, employment created, women participation and empowerment./  Policies for promoting many specific alternatives are suggested in the main text. These include fuel wood plantations, biogas plants, wood gasifier based power plants, solar thermal, solar water heaters, solar photovoltaics, bio-diesel and ethanol./  It is also recommended that Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (IREDA) be converted into a national refinancing institution on the lines of NABARD/National Housing Bank (NHB) for the Renewable Energy Sector. IREDA's own equity base can be expanded by the financial institutions of the country instead of continuing the current system of GOI support. A sharing of the carbon credits generated could also provide additional capital for IREDA./  (ix) Ensuring Energy Security: India's energy security, at its broadest level, has to do with the continuous availability of primary commercial energy at an affordable price. Reducing energy requirement and increasing energy use efficiency are the most important measures to increase energy security. However, it is still necessary to recognise that India's growing dependence on energy imports increases uncertainty regarding availability of energy at affordable prices./  How do we deal with this supply risk? The threat to energy security arises not just from the uncertainty of availability and price of imported energy, but also from the possible disruption or shortfalls in domestic production. Supply risk from domestic sources, such as from a strike in Coal India or Railways, also needs to be addressed. Even if there is no disruption of supply there can be the market risk of a sudden increase in oil price. Again, even when the country has adequate energy resources, technical failures may disrupt the supply of energy to some people. Generators fail, transmission lines trip or oil pipeline may spring a leak. One needs to provide security against such technical risks. Risks can be reduced by reducing the requirement of energy by increasing efficiency in production and use of energy; by substituting imported fuels by domestic fuels; by diversifying fuel choices (gas, ethanol, ore-emulsion tar sands etc.) and supply sources; and by expanding domestic energy resource base. Risks can also be dealt with by increasing ability to withstand supply shocks; ability to import energy and face market risk; and providing redundancy to address technical risks./  The policy recommendation include maintaining a strategic reserve for 90 days of oil imports and/or buying options for emergency supplies from neighbouring large storages such as those available in Singapore. The Committee, however, felt that obtaining equity oil, coal and gas abroad, do not represent adequate strategies for enhancing energy security beyond the fact that they help diversify supply sources. In contrast, pipelines for importing gas do enhance security of supply if the supplying country makes a major investment in the pipeline. The most critical elements of our energy security, however, remain the measures suggested herein to increase efficiency, reduce requirements and augment the domestic energy resource base./  (x) Boosting Energy Related R&D: India would find it increasingly harder to import the required commercial energy as India's share of the incremental world supply of oil & gas could be as high as 20% since its demand is growing faster than that of industrialized nations. Research and Development (R&D) in the energy sector is critical to augment our energy resources, to meet India's long-term energy needs, to attain energy independence, to promote energy efficiency and to enhance our energy security. R&D requires sustained and continued support over a long period of time. /  Energy related R&D has not got the resources that it needs. India needs to substantially augment the resources for energy related R&D and to allocate these strategically. To take an innovative idea to a commercial application involves many steps. Basic research leading to a fundamental breakthrough may open up possibilities of applications. R&D is needed to develop the concept and to prove its feasibility./  This needs to be followed up by a working model at laboratory scale. Scaling up to a pilot project follows if the economic potential looks attractive keeping in mind cost reductions that could be achieved through better engineering and mass production. Demonstration project, economic assessment and further R&D to make the new technology acceptable and attractive to customers is required before commercialisation and diffusion can take place. Some key policy initiatives relevant to energy related R&D are detailed below:/  (a) A National Energy Fund (NEF) should be set up by levying a cess of 0.1% of the turnover of all companies engaged in the field of primary/secondary energy production. In order to encourage the firms to do their own R&D a rebate of upto 80% of this cess may be given to firms for R&D carried out in-house. The R&D priorities have to be based on a strategic vision which is frequently updated. The NEF should periodically commission and fund such studies./  (b) A number of technology missions should be mounted for developing near commercial technologies and rolling out new technologies in a time bound manner. These include coal technologies (wherein India should take a lead) for efficiency improvement; in-situ gasification; IGCC and carbon sequestration; solar technologies for thermal and photovoltaics; bio-fuels such as bio-diesel and ethanol; bio-mass plantation and wood gasification and community based bio-gas plants./  (c) Coordinated research and development of all stages of the innovation chain to reach a targeted goal such as in the departments of atomic energy and space research are suggested for more efficient industrial plant, machinery & processes, efficient appliances, hybrids, super batteries, nuclear technologies related to thorium and fusion, gas hydrates, and hydrogen production, storage transport and distribution./  (d) The NEF could provide R&D funding in support of applications, innovation of new ideas, fundamental research etc., to researchers in different institution, universities, organisations and even individuals working independently./  (xi) Household Energy Security - Electricity and Clean Fuels for All: One of toughest challenge is to provide electricity and clean fuels to all, particularly rural populations; considering the poor paying capacity, the limited availability of local resources for clean cooking energy and the size of the country and its population. Yet, given the fact that women and the girl child carry most of the burden of the drudgery of gathering fuel wood, agricultural wastes and animal dung and also bear the brunt of the indoor air pollution; the urgency to meet the challenge should be high, if we are to achieve universal primary education for girls, promote gender equality and empower women./  The considerable effort spent on gathering the bio-mass and the cow-dung & preparing the same for use is not priced into the cost of such energy. These fuels create smoke and indoor air pollution and are inconvenient to use. They have adverse impact on the health of people, particularly women and children. Easy availability of a certain amount of clean energy, required to maintain life, should be considered as a basic necessity. Energy security at the individual level means to ensure supply of such lifeline energy need. India cannot be energy secure if her people remain without secure supply of energy at affordable cost./  Even if one assumes that some 30% of India's households are unable to pay for a lifeline electricity consumption of 30 units/month and a loss level of about 40% in delivering these 30 units, the total need for free electricity is about 7% of the current generation. At zero cost to the consumer, this translates into a subsidy burden of about Rs. 9,500 crore a year assuming the infrastructure is built under RGGVY. This burden would reduce over time as 8% GDP growth is expected to reduce poverty at a rate that exceeds population growth. Similarly, if one assumes that the same 30% of Indian households cannot pay for a lifeline consumption of 8 cylinders of gas per annum while another 20% can only pay for 25% of the cost of supply of such lifeline consumption of gas; the subsidy burden amounts to about Rs. 34,000 crore annually at Rs. 450/cylinder. Again, this subsidy burden would reduce over time with economic growth./  The foregoing demonstrates that a well-directed subsidy programme targeted at the intended beneficiary is not unaffordable for a resurgent India. The benefits in empowerment, health, environment and reduced pressure on deforestation and hence the water table and soil erosion are well worth the cost - even without considering the benefits from the likely increase in productivity of rural India. The top 5% of India's households could pay for this subsidy through a cess on their incomes or a more widely distributed cess on consumption could fund this subsidy burden. /  It is pointed out that even currently over 60% of the estimated subsidy burden is being funded, although the benefits do not reach the intended beneficiaries due to poor targeting. The real issue is to target the subsidy programme well and ensure that those falling outside the subsidy net pay the full cost of supply. A well-targeted subsidy regime may only marginally raise the current subsidy burden. A system of lifeline tradable entitlements delivered through smart debit cards could potentially be the answer./  In addition to the above subsidy other actions are also needed. /  (a) Finance a large scale socio-economic experiment to operate community sized bio-gas plants as a commercial enterprise either by a community cooperative or by a commercial entrepreneur, as such bio-gas plants can meet the need for clean cooking energy of a sizable segment of the rural population./  (b) Even with subsidies for clean fuel, it may not be easy to reach clean fuels to the poor and they may continue to use fuelwood. As part of the above programme, improve the efficiency of domestic chullahs & lanterns from the prevailing 10-12% to 20-25% which is easily attainable. Couple this to improving ventilation in the cooking area of the dwellings./  (c) To reduce drudgery of those who still need to gather fuel, village woodlots within one kilometer should be developed. To develop sustainable energy supply, women's groups can form co-operatives for developing and managing fuel wood or oil seed plantations with the same efforts that they put in searching and gathering fuel wood today. Provide finance through self-help groups to transform women, who are today energy gatherers into micro-entrepreneurs engaged in rural energy markets and energy management./  (d) Generate electricity through wood gasifiers or burning surplus bio-gas from the community bio-gas plants. Such distributed generators may be able to reach electricity to villages sooner than the grid and may be connected to the grid with a feed-in tariff as and when it reaches the villages. This will encourage such local generation, as people would not wait for the grid. Cover such distributed generation together with the local grid under the subsidy scheme of RGGVY. Formulate a tariff policy for such distributed generation for both household and productive use including agriculture./  (xii) Enabling an Environment for Competitive Efficiency: Apart from pricing policies, an environment that allows multiple players in each element of the energy value chain to compete under transparent & level terms is essential to realizing efficiency gains within the energy sector. Currently the Energy Sector is dominated by large Public Sector Companies and some sub-sectors have natural monopoly characteristics potentially offering economies of scale. Given this ground reality, independent & informed regulation becomes essential to realizing competitive efficiency at least till markets develop and mature. Such regulation must in the very last ensure that:/  (a) The regulatory responsibility/functions of the State are separated from the Ministries that control the Public Sector Units that dominate the energy sector; and/  (b) Till competitive markets emerge, independent regulators should fix prices or price caps to mimic competitive markets based on principles summarized in para (iv) above./  (c) A common energy regulator at the level of the Central Government could provide a positive impetus to some of the policy initiatives foreseen under the integrated energy policy set out herein./  (xiii) Climate Change Concerns: Concern for the threat of climate change has been an important issue in formulating the energy policy. Even though India is not required to contain its GHG emissions, as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and a country where the impact on its poor due to climate change could be serious, this policy has suggested a number of initiatives that will reduce the green house gas intensity of the economy. These are:/ Energy efficiency in all sectors./ Emphasis on mass transport./ Active policy on renewable energy including bio-fuels and fuel plantations./ Accelerated development of nuclear and hydro-electricity./ Technology Missions for clean coal technologies./ Focussed R&D on many climate friendly technologies./  Edited press releases are provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
How air pollution causes heart disease discovered," Washington, Dec. 21 -- Air pollution has long been known to cause cardiovascular diseases, but until now it was not clear how it damaged the body's blood vessels. Now, a new study by New York University School of Medicine researchers has not only found evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution, even at levels within the US government's standards, causes heart disease, but also the mechanism behind its harmful effects. /  According to the research published in the recent issue of JAMA, in a well-designed mouse study, where animals breathed air as polluted as the air in New York City, the researchers pinpointed specific mechanisms and showed that air pollution can be particularly damaging when coupled with a high-fat diet./  The study looked at the effects of airborne particles measuring less than 2.5 microns, referred to as PM2.5, the size linked most strongly with cardiovascular disease. The emissions arise primarily from power plants and vehicle exhaust. /  The researchers led by Lung Chi Chen divided 28 mice, which were genetically prone to developing cardiovascular disease, into two groups eating either normal or high-fat diets. For the next six months, half of the mice in each feeding group breathed doses of either particle-free filtered air or concentrated air containing PM2.5 at levels that averaged out to 15.2 micrograms per cubic meter. /  They then conducted an array of tests to measure whether the PM2.5 exposure had any impact on the mice's cardiovascular health. Overall, mice who breathed polluted air fared worse than those inhaling filtered air. But when coupled with a high-fat diet, the impact of PM2.5 exposure was even more dramatic. The results added up to a clear cause and effect relationship between PM2.5 exposure and atherosclerosis./  On the whole, mice breathing polluted air had far more plaque than those breathing filtered air. In cross sections taken from the largest artery in the body-the aorta-mice on normal diets and exposed to PM2.5 had arteries 19.2 percent filled with plaque, the fatty deposits that clog arteries. /  The arteries of those breathing particle-free air were 13.2 percent obstructed. Among high-fat diet mice, those exposed to PM2.5 had arteries that were 41.5 percent obstructed by plaque, whereas the arteries of the pollution-free mice were 26.2 percent clogged. In both normal and high-fat diet mice, PM2.5 exposure increased cholesterol levels, which are thought to exacerbate plaque buildup. /  Mice exposed to PM2.5 also appeared prone to developing high blood pressure, another element of cardiovascular disease, because their arteries had become less elastic. The researchers also examined various measures of vascular inflammation, which is involved in atherosclerosis on a number of levels. In the aortas of PM2.5-exposed mice, for example, they found increased levels of macrophages, immune cells that are an important ingredient in plaque deposits and also active participants in a biochemical pathway related to inflammation. /  The study revealed several signs that this pathway was more active, strengthening the connection between airborne particles and cardiovascular disease./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Air pollution leads to hardening of the arteries," Washington, Dec. 23 -- A new study by American researchers has found a direct cause-and-effect relationship between exposure to fine particle air pollution and the development of atherosclerosis, commonly known as hardening of the arteries. /  In laboratory tests conducted on mice, the researchers found that the mice that were fed a high-fat diet and exposed to air with fine particles had 1.5 times more plaque production than mice fed the same diet and exposed to clean filtered air. /  Plaque, a fatty deposit on the inner lining of the blood vessels, can predispose individuals to conditions such as heart attacks and strokes. The fine particle exposure also led to increased inflammation of the artery walls and reduced function of the artery wall's inner lining. /  The study, published in the recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that the combination of fine particle pollution and high-fat diet can promote the development of atherosclerosis, and may explain why people who live in highly polluted areas have a higher risk of heart disease. /  The findings are also important because the fine particle concentrations used in the study were well within the range of concentrations found in the air around major metropolitan areas. /  The researchers did not observe significant differences in plaque production and artery wall inflammation in fine particle-exposed mice given the normal diet. However, among mice given clean air, those on the high-fat diet had greater plaque production and artery wall inflammation than those given the normal diet. These results suggest that both diet and fine particle pollution contributed to the development of atherosclerosis in the mice. /  ""This is one of the first studies to demonstrate measurable changes in plaque production and artery inflammation following exposure to fine particle matter. These findings have important implications for the long-term impact of fine particle air pollution on urban populations,"" said researcher David A. Schwartz./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

AIR POLLUTION POSING THREAT TO NAMRUP," NAMRUP, Dec 26 -- Namrup is ecologically fragile owing to industrialisation, covering the 59.48 per cent of entire land surface. The process of industrialisation paved its way to Namrup with the establishment of Namrup Thermal Power Station way back in 1962. After that the two major gas-based industries viz HFCL (now BVFCL) and APL came into existence./  The first unit of HFCL (BVFCL) Namrup started its commercial production from January 1, 1969 with daily production capacity of 167 MT of urea and 304 MT of ammonium sulphate. The commercial production of HFCL (BVFCL) Namrup II & III began from October 1, 1976 and October 1, 1987 with production capacity of 600 MT and 1000 MT of urea per day. APL one of the State government's Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) incorporated in 1971, started its commercial production of 21 TPD Methanol plant and 36 TPD Formalin or Formaldehyde plant in 1975./  One after the other gaseous emissions of these industries like oxide, sulphur, nitrogen, methane and several other particulates, are bound to effect the environment of Namrup and its adjoining areas./  HFCL (now BVFCL) which manufactures sulpher based fertiliser, releases sulpher dioxide at least to some extent in the air. Similarly the emitted oxide of nitrogen may proliferate photo synthetic reaction. The methane is not far from being an agent of pollution./  Sometimes, the reek of ammonia floats into the air, causing irritation to eyes and skin. Further more the solid wastages of these industries, act as pollutants, for which the people of Namrup belt, have been suffering from a number of diseases like anemia, bronchitis, stomach trouble, skin diseases and even cancer./  The people of the vicinity claim that the living organisms of the river like fishes and others have been reduced. Moreover, the drain clogging and rotten dirt heaps hither and thiter within the township is posing threat to environment./  The inhabitants of Namrup township and its adjoining rural areas have felt that local industries should form separate departments each of their own with efficient and academically qualified personnel in the field of ecology and environment, providing all required facilities for the pollution control and protection of environment and ecology of this industrial area./  It is learnt that Namrup Anchalik Students Union (NASU) had already submitted memorandum to the BVFCL Namrup authorities to take proper measure to control air, water and soil pollution in and around Namrup along with other demands./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -194171 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"A city that chokes, suffocates"," NEW DELHI, India, Dec 28 -- THE YEAR 2005 did not bring any relief to the pollution-stricken people of the city. Despite all efforts pollution continues to rise. Moreover, the shifting of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to Lucknow adversely affected all ongoing anti-pollution programmes in the city./  Air Quality status:/  According to findings of an environmentalist at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Dr Mukesh Sharma, there are only a few pockets in the city where one can go and breath normally. A CPCB survey also revealed that every cubic meter of city air contained 4.63 micrograms of lead, suspended particulate matter (SPM), sulphur dioxide, Nitrogen dioxide and poly-nuclear hydrocarbons./  No check on these pollutants has been made so far. At least 30-40 per cent of the city's air pollution comes from vehicular emissions. Coal smoke, together with automobile and industrial emissions, creates a cover of dust that almost perpetually hangs over the city. During winters the dust clouds comes down creating smog, which leads to respiratory troubles and other ailments./  Vehicular Pollution:/  The city is reeling under heavy vehicular pollution .The estimated pollution load from vehicular sources was about 90 tons daily (T/D) while the total emission load from industrial sources was around 250 T/D. According to environmentalists, this was too high in respect of the small area of the township./  Water Pollution:/  Unchecked sewer water, discharge of chromium, a toxic metal from chrome tanning industry, and sludge generated at the Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) have collectively polluted the river and underground water resources in the city. Chrome pollution has gone so deep at certain places that the underground water has become yellow and is not fit for drinking./  Reports say the city generated about 360 MLD waste daily. Most of the waste is discharged in the river directly./  Noise Pollution:/  Noise pollution level in the city has gone very high. In industrial areas the noise level has exceeded limits by 20 per cent during daytime and five per cent in the night hours against international standards of 65 db and 45 db, respectively. In commercial areas noise pollution has exceeded by 30 per cent in the day and 10 per cent in the night against permissible limits of 65 db and 55 db, respectively./  Similarly, in residential areas it gone up by 20 per cent in the day and by five percent in the night against the permissible limits of 55 db and 45 db, respectively./  Biomedical Waste:/  Nursing homes and hospitals generates more than 200 tons of biomedical waste daily. Incinerators are not used to burn the waste./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Hukumchand Mill chimney will be history soon," NEW DELHI, India, Jan 14 -- WHAT DOES it take to hammer away a piece of history? Too much for those who once derived sustenance from it, and too little for those who are paid to demolish the same./  Ask 47-year-old Vallabh Thakur, the professional chimney breaker from Morvi in Gujarat, who has been called here to chip off the 51.83-meter high century-old Hukumchand Textile Mill chimney block by block from the top. His two sons, two nephews and a cook will be paid Rs 1 lakh to accomplish the job in 15 days./  ""Pulling down chimneys manually with the help of hammer and chisel is nothing new for me. I have broken over 32 textile mill chimneys in Gujarat, each measuring 60 to 100 feet in height,"" says Thakur, unaware that his skill and number of chimneys he pulled down could find him a place in record books./  He says he has knocked down 20 chimneys in Ahmedabad alone. Besides, he flattened one each at Vadodara, Surat, Navsari Railway Station and Billimora, four at Petlad, and two at Dwarka RCC cement factory earlier. Offers to tear down more are still coming. ""I have been asked to raze two chimneys of Malwa Mill here. In addition, there are six such orders for Ahmedabad and six from Delhi,"" Vallabh, who works for eight hours a day, remarked./  Thakur recalls that chimneys of about 40 factories that made roof tiles (kavelu) were damaged at Morvi during the earthquake that shattered large parts of Gujarat three years back. ""I razed all those damaged structures,"" he states in a matter-of-fact manner./  The art of demolition was handed down to Vallabh by his father Siddhimala, an uneducated man like him. Following the family tradition, Thakur thought it appropriate to pass on the expertise to his sons and nephews. Only his youngest son Dhanji has deviated to set up a paan shop at his native town./  Back home, the chimney will turn into ground zero in next fortnight, another reminder that cloth mills have been wiped off. The chimneys of seven textile mills that billowed smoke were considered a symbol of City's prosperity 25 years back. The air pollution caused due to smoke was unheard of those days. The denizens, especially textile workers and owners, took pride in the fact that Indore's industrial expansion owed a lot to their cloth mills. But, as they say, all is history now./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"NORTH AMERICAN REPORT ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT INDICATORS RELEASED"," MONTREAL, Jan. 26 -- The World Health Organisation (WHO) issued the following press release:/  The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC), in partnership with public health organizations and the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States, today released the first-ever report on children's health and environment indicators in North America./  The report presents 13 indicators under three thematic areas: asthma and respiratory disease, effects of exposure to lead and other toxic substances, and waterborne diseases. It finds that North American children remain at risk from environmental exposures and that children's health reporting must be improved to address the data gaps identified in the report. Only one of the indicators, addressing asthma in children, was fully reported by all three countries./  That data shows a rising number of childhood asthma cases across North America. One possible contributor is outdoor air pollution such as ground-level ozone and particulate matter, which remains a problem for all three countries. In Mexico, exposure to smoke from indoor burning of wood or charcoal is also a problem, as 18 percent of the country's population continued to burn biomass for cooking and heating in 2000. And while Canadian and American children are increasingly less likely to be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, data from the United States shows that certain minority groups remain disproportionately affected./  For lead exposure, case studies from all three countries demonstrate improvements in children's blood lead levels due to interventions such as the removal of lead from gasoline. However, there is little biomonitoring data available in Canada since there has been no national blood level survey in the country since 1978. Other exposure pathways for lead remain a concern, such as older homes with lead-based paint. Recently collected data in the United States showed that 25 percent of homes had a ""significant lead based paint hazard, which could be from deteriorating paint, contaminated dust or contaminated soil outside the house.""/  Mexico faces the region's largest challenges in the area of water and sanitation. Data from 2003 indicate that 17 percent of the Mexican population did not have water of appropriate bacteriological quality. However, advances in water and sanitation in Mexico have contributed to a decline in diarrheic diseases from a rate of 125.6 deaths per 100,000 children in 1990 to 20 deaths per 100,000 children in 2002. In the United States, the percentage of children living in an area served by a public water system having at least one major monitoring and reporting violation decreased from 22 percent in 1993 to 10 percent in 1999./  ""This first set of children's environmental health indicators will help improve public policy and promote the cause of improved air and water quality, pollution prevention and better management of toxic chemicals,"" says William V. Kennedy, the executive director of the CEC. ""While this report finds improvement in some indicators and challenges in others, it's clear that measurable progress will require a uniform data set for policy-makers to adequately address the risks to children's health.""/  Indicators are important to tracking and communicating the health and well-being of North America's 123 million children because environmental contaminants can affect the young quite differently than adults. Children generally eat more food, drink more water and breathe more air relative to their size than adults do, and children's normal activities--such as putting their hands in their mouths or playing outdoors--can result in higher exposures to certain contaminants. In addition, environmental contaminants may affect children disproportionately because their immune defenses, for example, are not fully developed and their organs are more easily harmed./  The CEC, the International Joint Commission, the Pan American Health Organization, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States collaborated in the development and selection of the children's environmental health indicators and the release of this report./  As the first regional report under the Global Initiative on Children's Environmental Health Indicators (CEHI)--led by WHO, spearheaded by the US EPA and launched at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg -- it is anticipated that this report will contribute to worldwide efforts to improve children's health. Children's Environmental Health regional indicator pilot projects are currently underway in Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Eastern Mediterranean.

Smoke from wooden cooking stones as harmful as cigarettes," Washington, Feb. 19 -- Women in developing countries who cook over a wood stove for years and inhale the smoke can develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and experience the same clinical characteristics, diminished quality of life and increased mortality rates as tobacco smokers. /  These findings from a Mexican study appear in the second issue for February 2006 of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, published by the American Thoracic Society. /  Over a seven-year period, Alejandra Ram?rez-Venegas, M.D., and six associates from the COPD Clinic at the National Institutes of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, followed up on clinical, functional, health-related quality of life and survival characteristics of 481 COPD patients. Of this group, 345 persons (76 percent of whom were male) had COPD associated with tobacco smoke and 186 individuals (86 percent female) developed the disease as a result of inhaling wood smoke. /  Although cigarette smoking is a greater risk factor for COPD in developed countries, indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is responsible for more than 1.6 million annual deaths and 2.7 percent of the global burden of COPD in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization. /  ""Biomass (wood) smoke is composed of a relatively equal mixture of coarse and ultrafine particles and can penetrate deeply into the lung, producing a variety of morphologic and biochemical changes,"" said Dr. Ram?rez-Venegas. /  According to the authors, the patients in the wood smoke group were older, shorter and had a greater body mass than those in the tobacco smoke group. /  The cumulative exposure for the wood smoke COPD patients was expressed in hour-years, the number of hours of cooking with wood stoves multiplied by the average number of hours spent daily in the kitchen. The average cumulative exposure was 214 hour-years for the wood smoke group and 56 pack years for the tobacco smokers. /  ""In our study, the degree of airflow limitation was worse in tobacco smokers than in subjects exposed to wood smoke,"" said Dr. Ram?rez-Venegas./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"PHILIPS DEVELOPS WOODSTOVE THAT SAVES LIVES, PRESERVES ENERGY RESOURCES"," EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, Feb. 27 -- Philips India issued the following press release:/  Philips Research today announced the end of successful trials of a woodstove for cooking in communities currently relying on less efficient means. The stove cuts the smoke and toxic emissions which are claimed to cause 1.6 million deaths a year. It also burns more efficiently to reduce the load on the existing energy supply chain, without involving dependence on non-renewable energy sources. The stove could benefit up to 300 million families in the world's poorest regions. /  When properly used the woodstove typically reduces fuel consumption up to 80% compared with traditional, three stone fires. Apart from faster and more convenient cooking, this energy efficiency means the stove can save the cost of the time needed to gather fuel, and should also slow deforestation. /  Efficient burning and high combustion temperatures also reduce the amount of indoor air pollution. The Philips woodstove reduces pollution due to smoke up to 90%, and organic volatile emissions up to 99% of the level of traditional cooking fires. ""The World Health Organisation has identified indoor air pollution as a major risk to the health of women and children in the world's poorest countries,"" explains Rick Harwig, Chief Executive Officer of Philips Research. ""It was this that first prompted us to investigate sophisticated, sustainable technology that was affordable and practicable for a great many of the world's less developed countries."" /  The secret to many benefits of this stove is an electronically controlled fan forcing air through the stove, leading to higher temperatures and a better fuel to air ratio.

"BUDGET 2006 IS SHORT-SIGHTED, SAYS CSE"," NEW DELHI, India, March 1 -- The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) issued the following press release:/  Some so-called excise reform initiatives ushered in by the Budget 2006 should be recognised for what they are: shortsighted, retrograde measures, says the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). By reducing the excise duty on small cars and soft drinks, the Union finance minister, P. Chidambaram, has actually chosen to encourage the manufacture and consumption of two key public health threats, feel experts in CSE. /  Small cars: carrying on with slow murder/  The government's thumbs-up for small cars in the 2006 Union budget is a rude joke on the environment. Even though traffic congestion and poisonous air today mark almost every Indian city and town, Chidambaram has slashed excise on small cars from 24 percent to 16 percent: this can lead to an explosion in car numbers, especially in diesel cars that will worsen pollution and congestion in cities already caught in the traffic gridlock. This, when the share of small cars in the total car sales has already increased phenomenally from 54 percent in 2001-02 to 61 percent in 2004-05. /  The government, on the other hand, has made no efforts to stimulate investments in different mix of public transport systems in cities. ""The tax cut on small cars is reprehensible and unjustifiable,"" says Anumita Roychoudhury, associate director, CSE. /  This move threatens to destroy public transport in cities and works against pollution and congestion reduction measures. With the excise cuts on small cars, the total and unfavourable burden of taxes on buses will get more skewed in cities. Already, the annual road tax imposed by state governments is higher for buses than the lifetime tax that cars pay. The World Bank estimates that in India, the total taxes per vehicle kilometre for a bus are three times higher then that for a car. A bus is made to pay more, even though it carries 40 times more passengers than a car but occupies only twice the road space. The finance minister neither has the will nor the vision to correct this distortion./  Policy makers cannot afford to ignore the enormous costs cars impose on society in terms of air pollution, congestion, noise pollution, risk of accidents and locking up of enormous urban space to move a small minority. By not recovering these costs through taxes, the government is actually subsiding the cars of the rich and decimating public transport used by the urban majority and the poor. The only way the cities can be saved from the pollution and congestion mayhem is by using taxes to build public transport. Says Sunita Narain, director, CSE, ""The pretext of uniform excise duty cannot be used to lower taxes simply because taxes are also a tool for regulating production and consumption. One expects the finance minister to not act so mechanically and ignore vital health and environmental issues in the budget.""/  The budget has not considered any fiscal model of funding public transport worldwide, that taxes ownership and usage of personal vehicles to build public transport. The new budget conflicts with the ongoing efforts of the Supreme Court and the Delhi government to decongest roads where private vehicles take up more than 90 percent of the road space during peak traffic hour. /  The weak-kneed argument of the finance minister that the tax cut on small cars will improve fuel efficiency flies in the face of reason: if that was the true intent, the minister would have proposed taxes to promote fuel economy./  The minister's eagerness to ""seize the opportunity to make India a hub for the manufacture of small and fuel-efficient cars"" is grossly misguided. If indeed private vehicles have to be promoted by the government, the same tax cut should have been given as an incentive to vehicle manufacturers to meet more stringent emission standards. Indian carmakers are gearing up to produce Euro IV cars for the European market, even though India has far more serious air pollution problems than the Europe. The finance minister has once again failed to use fiscal measures to protect public health. The budget is designed to serve the narrow industrial interests even as it further destroys urban quality of life leading to enormous traffic mayhem and a threat to the lives of hundreds of thousands of urban Indians, especially the poor. /  Soft drinks: promoting 'eat least' foods/  The excise duty on soft drinks has also been reduced from 24 percent to 16 percent. In one sweep, the government has undone all the work that the civil society, the judiciary and the political class had accomplished with respect to restraining the consumption of these beverages. /  There is a growing concern across the world about the severe health impacts of soft drink consumption, especially on children and adolescents. According to a 2002 World Health Organization (WHO) report, higher consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks is directly linked with weight gain and obesity. ""It has been estimated that each additional can or glass of sugar-sweetened drink that children consume every day increases their risk of becoming obese by 60 percent,"" says the report. The report also provides strong scientific evidence of the fact that the risks of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension rise continuously with increasing weight. The report strongly recommends restricting the intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks for children and adolescents to prevent obesity./  Soft drinks, usually classified under the 'eat least' category in dietary guidelines, are among the most heavily marketed products in the world. Young children are often the target group for the advertising of these products because they exercise a significant influence on the foods bought by parents. The huge expenditure on marketing soft drinks and other 'eat least' choices is considered to be a key factor in the increased consumption. While the reduction in excise duty might not result in cheaper soft drinks (as most manufacturers have claimed), it will certainly encourage the soft drinks industry to invest in better marketing and distribution systems and make their products easily accessible to more consumers. Children, the most vulnerable segment of those guzzling on these drinks, will bear the brunt./  In India, following CSE's expose of the presence of pesticide residues in soft drinks, the Supreme Court and other courts have been listening to and closely examining cases on the health effects of soft drinks. As recently as on February 27, 2006, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to constitute a committee within three weeks to look into the harmful effects of chemical additives in soft drinks. But the government has turned a blind eye to this order and has gone ahead instead to promote unregulated consumption of soft drinks./  The soft drinks industry has, for a long time, lobbied for doing away with the special excise duty which the government had put in place partly to discourage consumption of these beverages. The Union finance minister's decision has given it what it wanted, but at the cost of public health./  Edited press releases are provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Pollution linked to increased heart and lung disease risk," Washington, March 8 -- Exposure to fine particle matter and air pollution increases a person's risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, according to a study in the March 8 issue of JAMA./ Numerous studies have shown associations of chronic exposure to airborne particles and increased health risks. Recent evidence on adverse effects of particulate air pollution on public health has motivated the development of more stringent standards for levels of particulate matter in outdoor air in the United States and in other countries, according to background information in the article. /  In 1997, the standard for airborne particulate matter was revised, maintaining the previous indicator of particulate matter of less than or equal to 10 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and creating a new indicator for fine particulate matter of less than or equal to 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Particles in this size range have a much greater probability of reaching the small airways and the alveoli (air sacs) of the lung than do larger particles. Evidence is limited on the health risks of this size range of particulate matter. /  Francesca Dominici, Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and colleagues conducted a study to estimate the risk for cardiac and respiratory diseases from exposure to fine particulate air pollution. The researchers analyzed data from a national database for 1999 through 2002 on hospital admission rates (constructed from the Medicare National Claims History Files) for cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and injuries for 11.5 million Medicare enrollees (aged 65 years or older) who lived in 204 U.S. urban counties (population greater than 200,000). The individuals lived an average of 5.9 miles from a PM2.5 monitor. /  The researchers found there was a short-term increase in hospital admission rates associated with exposure to PM2.5 for all of the health outcomes except injuries. The largest association was for heart failure, which had a 1.28 percent increase in risk per 10-?g/m3 increase in same-day PM2.5. Cardiovascular risks tended to be higher in counties located in the Eastern region of the United States, which included the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest, and the South. /  ""In the lung, particulate matter may promote inflammation and thereby exacerbate underlying lung disease and reduce the efficacy of lung-defense mechanisms. Cardiovascular effects may reflect neurogenic [arising in or stimulated by nerve tissues] and inflammatory processes,"" the authors write./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
PRIME MINISTER LAUNCHES MAHA SURAKSHA YOJANA," NEW DELHI, India, March 18 -- The Office of the Prime Minister of India issued the following press release:/ The Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh launched Maha Suraksha Yojana, a personal accident insurance cover to all taxi and autorikshaw drivers using CNG vehicles, at a function in Mumbai today. Following is the text of the Prime Minister's address on the occasion:/  ""I am delighted to associate myself today with the launch of the Maha Suraksha Yojana, a unique social initiative of the Mahanagar Gas Limited. This social initiative, which provides personal accident insurance cover to all taxi and autorikshaw drivers using CNG vehicles, is a unique experiment in corporate social responsibility, pioneered in this great city of Mumbai. /  Mumbai is not only the commercial capital of India but also one of the great cities of this world. I have a particular attachment with this city as I have lived here as the Governor of the Reserve bank of India. Whenever I have visited this great city, I have been amazed by the energy and life that drives the people of the city. The work culture of the city, the orderly systematic approach to day-to-day issues, the time consciousness of the people and calm and industriousness of its citizens are the envy of the rest of the country. /  And the success of this city has been based on the hard work and effort of its millions of residents among whom the drivers of taxis and autorikshaws form an essential component. Cities of this size can function only if there are efficient transport systems. While the suburban railway system in Mumbai takes care of a large portion of the transport needs of this city, private taxis and autorikshaws are equally important contributors to its smooth functioning. I have seen that even in times of crises - such as after the heavy rainfall last year - taxi and autorikshaw drivers calmly go about taking passengers from place to place, keeping the wheels of commerce and business functioning smoothly. And of course, we keep hearing stories of the honest drivers who return the purses and baggage forgotten by forgetful passengers!/  I think that the Mahanagar Gas Company is doing a noble deed by starting this innovative insurance scheme for drivers of taxis and autorikshaws. By providing a one lakh rupee accident or permanent disability cover to CNG drivers, it is providing a social safety net to the vulnerable families of the drivers. Benefiting over 2 lakh drivers, I am sure that drivers would now be in a position to go about their tasks with the assurance that their families are secured against risk. This is being done at no cost to the beneficiary. I sincerely hope that this initiative will increase the level of confidence among CNG users. I also hope it will encourage greater safety at all stages in the manufacture, distribution and utilization of CNG. I commend the firm for this initiative./  One of the negative consequences of economic growth and rising purchasing power of our people has been the sharp increase in environmental pollution. While we celebrate the prosperity of our people, and their ability to use faster modes of transport, this has also contributed to increased energy consumption and pollution. /  A point had been reached in some of our big cities a few years back when it was virtually impossible to breath without difficulty. Even today, in many cities and towns vehicular pollution, both air pollution and noise pollution are harming the quality of life - both of users of vehicles and the non-users. In New Delhi, I remember that only a few years back, it was virtually impossible to go for a walk in the morning and or evening without suffering the effects of pollution. I am told that almost a third of children in Delhi suffer from asthma and other lung diseases./  I do think, however, that one of our great achievements in Delhi in the past couple of years has been our success in reducing pollution levels. All indicators show a marked improvement in air quality. This has been mainly on account of the introduction of unleaded petrol and CNG. I am delighted that Mumbai has also progressed very much in the direction of 100% use of CNG for taxis and autorikshaws. /  The environmental benefits from the use of CNG as a vehicle fuel have been marked. It is estimated that the current level of CNG usage removes 310 tonnes of harmful pollutants each year from Mumbai's atmosphere. In addition, approximately 3 lakh litres of petrol and 65,000 litres of diesel are conserved every day. I am also told that by using CNG, drivers save almost 70% of the cost as compared to petrol or diesel. I compliment Mahanagar Gas Limited for playing an important role in promoting the use of CNG as a vehicle fuel. /  I am also happy to learn that the Mahanagar Gas Ltd., is moving towards covering the entire city of Mumbai through piped gas supply by 2008. I am told that the cost of piped gas is 30% cheaper than LPG and more convenient to deliver. I request MGL and also GAIL to cover all major cities in India with piped gas supply systems so that more families can use a cheaper and cleaner fuel. This should be a priority for the department as well. /  CNG distribution infrastructure is developing rapidly. I do believe that additional infrastructure is required to ensure speedy and efficient sale of CNG. We also need to promote the use of CNG by private vehicle owners also. MGL should make efforts in this direction so that Mumbai becomes a clean, green city. /  The success of Delhi Metro has made public transport once again popular. I am aware that Mumbaikars are more used to traveling by public transport. However, Mumbai needs a quantum jump in the quality of public transport. Mumbai cannot continue to depend on a public transport that it has inherited from a distant past. We need more efficient and higher quality public transport. Our Government is committed to creating world-class infrastructure, especially public transport, here in Mumbai. I request the state government to speed up work on the Mumbai Metro. /  The UPA Government is a government of the aam aadmi. The concerns of the common man are at the heart of all our programmes. We will work towards creating credible, viable social safety nets for all sections of our society, particularly those who are vulnerable. The Maha Suraksha Yojana is one such effort. We will do more in future. We will see that every citizen of India is well educated, healthy and has the full opportunity of participating in the wonderful growth opportunities that we are unleashing in our economy while taking care of the concerns of the weak and needy. This is our vision of India, an inclusive India. /  Finally, let me compliment all those associated with this initiative and hope that Mumbai will continue to take the lead in energy conservation and showing social concern. /  I wish Mahanagar Gas Limited all the very best in its good work.""/  Edited press releases are provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Delhi air turns killer again," NEW DELHI, India, April 19 -- IF YOU are still celebrating the success of CNG, this might force a rethink: Delhi's air is not as clean as you believe. In fact, air pollution is fast moving towards the dangerous level of the pre-CNG days of the late Nineties. And it is being attributed to the rapidly increasing count of vehicles on the roads./  According to the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), areas like Town Hall and ITO have become the most polluted in terms of particulate matter, and Nitrogen Oxide is the emerging threat. On Wednesday, the CSE released ""The Leapfrog Factor"", a study on levels of pollution in Asian cities, which makes a strong argument for a better public transport system. It claims that the increase in the number of private diesel vehicles contributes most to the pollution./  Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who released the book, said it was time for second-generation reforms. ""Delhi has to be the city to experiment the second-generation of change,"" she said. ""Let's find a way forward, decide upon the best technology and I promise funds will not be a problem."" The CSE's data indicates there better be a solution soon as the city is inhaling killer air. One person dies every hour because of it. Also, there has been a 21.3 per cent increase in lung diseases, 20 per cent increase in asthma patients and 25 per cent increase in heart patients./  Anumita Roychowdhury, who researched for the book, said the biggest problem is the number of vehicles. Delhi owns 17 per cent of India's cars. ""A car caught in congestion pollutes four times more. They occupy 90 per cent of city's road space but transport only 17 per cent people,"" she said. She said diesel vehicles have made it worse. ""The refineries produce what we call 'dirty diesel' with high sulphur content. This needs to be controlled."" Bhure Lal, who headed the committee that had recommended CNG, said refineries plan to reduce the sulphur content further to European norms. He said better public transport was the solution./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Investment in cleaner household energy yields major health and economic benefits: WHO," New York/Geneva, May 3 -- Every day for the next 10 years, 485 000 people would need to gain access to cleaner fuels in order to halve by 2015 the population relying on solid fuels. /  A new report from the World Health Organization, Fuel for Life: Household Energy and Health, demonstrates that investing in cleaner household fuels can yield a seven-fold economic benefit in health and productivity gains. /  Cooking with wood, dung, coal and other solid fuels on open fires or simple stoves is a daily reality for more than half of the world's population. This leads to high levels of indoor air pollution, a major risk factor for pneumonia among children and chronic respiratory disease among adults. Globally, pneumonia remains the single most important child killer and is responsible for two million deaths a year./  Every year, the killer in the kitchen is responsible for 1.5 million deaths. Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia are particularly affected, with 396 000 and 483 000 annual deaths, respectively. Indoor air pollution also disproportionately affects women and children. In 2002, cooking with solid fuels was responsible for nearly 800 000 deaths among children and more than 500 000 deaths among women./  The good news is that effective solutions are available. Liquefied petroleum gas, biogas and other cleaner fuels represent the healthiest alternative. Switching from a traditional stove to an improved stove substantially reduces indoor smoke. /  ""Making cleaner fuels and improved stoves available to millions of poor people in developing countries will reduce child mortality and improve women's health,"" said Dr LEE Jong-wook, WHO Director-General. ""In addition to the health gains, household energy programmes can help lift families out of poverty and accelerate development progress.""/  On average, 100 million more homes using liquefied petroleum gas, biogas or modern fuels for cooking would lead to 473 million fewer women, children and men exposed to harmful indoor air pollution, and 282 thousand fewer deaths from respiratory diseases per year. /  The economic case for adopting practical solutions on a large scale is just as strong as the humanitarian case. /  For as little as six dollars, families can install better ventilated and fuel efficient stoves. A total cost of 13 billion dollars per year to halve the number of people worldwide cooking with solid fuels by 2015 shows a payback of 91 billion dollars per year, highlights the report. Making improved stoves available to half of those still burning biomass fuels and coal on traditional stoves would save USD 34 billion in fuel expenditure every year, and generate an economic return of USD 105 billion every year over a 10 year period. /  The majority of these costs are borne at the household level, which is also where the majority of the benefits occur. Nevertheless, donor investments are required upfront for designing appropriate technologies, setting up local businesses, and putting micro-credit systems in place. Developing energy infrastructure in this way would not only mean less illness and death but also less time spent ill, collecting fuel and cooking. With more time available, children would do better at school, while their mothers could engage in childcare, agriculture or other income-generating activities as a way to break the vicious cycle of poverty./  ""It is a travesty that 1.5 million lives a year - many of those of children whose lives have not even started - are snuffed out every year because of needless exposure to indoor smoke. We have simple, affordable solutions; let us ensure that they reach the people who can benefit from - and live by - using them,"" said Dr Maria Neira, WHO's Director for Public Health and Environment. /  Some low-income countries with enormous financial constraints are already responding to the challenge, and programmes are operating effectively and producing results. The same commitment needs to be replicated worldwide. /  The problem of indoor air pollution has been around since the Stone Age, yet international development agendas fail to recognize that missing out on clean energy equals missing out on life. Today's report provides an overview of the global situation on indoor air pollution, and calls for vigorous action to close the household energy gap by developing energy infrastructure to meet basic household needs in a healthy, safe and sustainable way. /  Fuel for Life: Household Energy and Health will be launched at a press briefing at the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, United Nations Press Centre in New York, and simultaneously in Geneva, at the United Nations Headquarters./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Asthma fully controllable, says expert"," NEW DELHI, India, May 6 -- ACCORDING TO noted chest specialist Dr JK Samaria, asthma is a disease of the civilized society and 5 to 7 per cent people are suffering from bronchial asthma in India./  Delivering a lecture on 'Asthma: Cause, Prevention and Advanced Treatment' in a scientific seminar organised at Indian Medical Association as part of the ongoing week long World Asthma Day celebrations here on Saturday afternoon, Dr Samaria , who is faculty member in TB and Respiratory Diseases Department at Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, said that air pollution and changing lifestyle were the main factors responsible for increasing cases of asthma in the country./  Dr Samaria, who conducted a survey on school kids in Varanasi, said that 24 per cent schoolgoing children were suffering from asthmatic allergy and 10 to 12 per cent allergy cases got converted into asthma cases./  He said consumption of junk and fast food was one of the main factors behind increasing cases of bronchial asthma as there were zero per cent anti-oxidants in these foods./  Dr Samaria, who is also Secretary of Indian Chest Society, informed that asthma was a disease of rich persons and that was why around 20 to 25 percent people were suffering from asthma in developed nations such as Australia and New Zealand. ""People who are more attentive towards hygiene are more prone to asthma,"" he said./  He said that due to lack of awareness, the mortality rate of asthma was increasing in India./  ""Both the physicians and common people should have proper awareness about asthma to control the disorder"", he said, adding, ""Out of 1000 asthma patients, around 50 patients succumb to this infection""./  He said that asthma was 100 per cent controllable and one could lead a normal life through proper treatment. He expressed concern over lack of proper knowledge of inhalation and said that around 60 per cent doctors did not know the proper way of inhalation. He said that various advancements had been made in inhalers and now a single dose of inhaler was enough for a day./  Dr Samaria said that since asthma was a life-style disease, therefore one should have better control over daily habits to avoid asthmatic complications. He suggested the parents should not to get their wards exposed to air pollution as kids were more prone to asthma. Around 50 general practitioners and office-bearers of IMA were present on the occasion./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Tobacco smoke increases infants hay-fever risk," Washington, May 18 -- Parents of kids who are not even a year old should think twice before lighting a cigarette in their house, as a recent study conducted by the University of Cincinnati (UC) epidemiologists reveals that it is environmental tobacco smoke and not the visible mold, which severely increases an infant's risk of developing allergic rhinitis. /  Allergic rhinitis most commonly known as hay fever, occurs when a person's immune system wrongly reacts to allergens (aggravating particles) in the air. And when the body releases substances to defend itself, it causes the allergy sufferer to experience constant sneezing and, a blocked / nose. /  The study suggests that for the good health of their children, it's essential for parents to eradicate tobacco from their homes. /  ""An infant's lungs and immune system are still developing in the first year of life, environmental tobacco smoke puts harmful particulates in the air / Which, when inhaled regularly at such an early age--could lead to serious allergic conditions like asthma."" Sais Grace LeMasters, PhD, co-author and principal investigator of the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS)./  The study assessed the effects of numerous indoor exposures to things such as environmental tobacco smoke, visible mold, pets, siblings and the day-care environment on 633 infants under age one./  ""We found that infants who were exposed to 20 or more cigarettes a day were three times more likely to develop allergic rhinitis by their first birthday than those who were not exposed,"" sais Biagini. /  This is the first study to show a relationship between environmental tobacco smoke exposure and allergic rhinitis in year-old infants./  ""Previous studies have addressed risk factors for allergic rhinitis, but they failed to examine multiple environmental exposures, and some yielded / contradictory results,"" said Jocelyn Biagini, lead author and an epidemiologist in UC's environmental health department. /  The study further revealed that household mold, which was always considered to be a major cause for rhinitis, did not contribute to allergic rhinitis development. /  ""It did increase the infant's risk for ear infections though,"" Biagini said. /  ""Infants exposed to a mold patch about the size of a shoebox were five times more likely to contract ear infections requiring antibiotics than those living in mold-free homes,"" she added. /  The UC study also suggests that infants with elder siblings are less susceptible to have allergic rhinitis./  ""Research has shown that exposure to certain infections early in life may decrease your risk for allergic diseases. We found a 'sibling protective effect' for allergic rhinitis--this may mean the more siblings infants have, the more infections they are exposed to. As a result, the infant's body may be better equipped to fight off allergic diseases later in life,"" explained James Lockey, MD, professor of environmental health and pulmonary medicine./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Pakistan in grip of a pollution crisis," Islamabad, June 7 -- Pakistan is in the grip of a major pollution crisis, with the country's economic planners warning that the levels are said to be among the highest in the world./  Dust and smoke particles are ""generally twice the world average"" and ""five times"" higher than the developed world, the Pakistan Economic Survey found, adding that the crisis has been compounded by severe water scarcity. /  The survey, which was released by the government's principal economic adviser earlier this week, lists an increase in the demand for energy and an unprecedented growth in the number of vehicles in Pakistan as the key reasons behind growing levels of air pollution. /  According to the survey, the number of vehicles on road has increased five times in the last two decades and two-stroke vehicles and diesel-powered goods lorries are said to be the major pollution culprits for their refusal to maintain acceptable emission norms./  Authorities here say that the government has been encouraging the use of vehicles powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). /  At present, CNG vehicles in Pakistan are estimated at just under one million, making Pakistan's CNG fleet the third largest in the world after Argentina and Brazil. But red tapehas reportedly slowed the increase of CNG-friendly vehicles, the report adds./  Pollution levels are also prevalent water bodies, and it is unsafe to drink in many areas. According to the survey, the annual per capita water availability dropped to 1,105 cubic metres - just above the 1,000 cubic metre threshold level. Thousands of people across Pakistan have reported falling ill after drinking polluted water. The water crisis is likely to become more acute in the coming years unless more reservoirs are built, the survey warns. /  The government plans to build over 6,500 water purification plants over the next few years to counter impurities in water./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Pak denies having razed Krishna Mandir in Lahore," Geneva, June 16 -- As much as 24 percent of global disease is caused by environmental exposures which can be averted. Well-targeted interventions can prevent much of this environmental risk, the World Health Organization (WHO) demonstrates in a report issued today. /  The report further estimates that over 33 percent of disease in children under the age of five is caused by environmental exposures. Preventing environmental risk could save as many as four million lives a year, mostly in developing countries. /  The report, Preventing disease through healthy environments - towards an estimate of the environmental burden of disease, is the most comprehensive and systematic study yet undertaken on how preventable environmental hazards contribute to a wide range of diseases and injuries. By focusing on the environmental causes of disease, and how various diseases are influenced by environmental factors, the analysis breaks new ground in understanding the interactions between environment and health. The estimate reflects how much death, illness and disability could be realistically avoided every year as a result of better environmental management./  ""The report issued today is a major contribution to ongoing efforts to better define the links between environment and health,"" said Dr Anders Nordstr?m, Acting WHO Director-General. ""We have always known that the environment influences health very profoundly, but these estimates are the best to date. This will help us to demonstrate that wise investment to create a supportive environment can be a successful strategy in improving health and achieving development that is sustainable."" /  The report estimates that more than 13 million deaths annually are due to preventable environmental causes. Nearly one third of death and disease in the least developed regions is due to environmental causes. Over 40 percent of deaths from malaria and an estimated 94 percent of deaths from diarrhoeal diseases, two of the world's biggest childhood killers, could be prevented through better environmental management. /  The four main diseases influenced by poor environments are diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, various forms of unintentional injuries, and malaria. Measures which could be taken now to reduce this environmental disease burden include the promotion of safe household water storage and better hygienic measures; the use of cleaner and safer fuels; increased safety of the built environment, more judicious use and management of toxic substances in the home and workplace; better water resource management./  ""For the first time, this new report shows how specific diseases and injuries are influenced by environmental risks and by how much,"" said Dr Maria Neira, Director of WHO's Department for Public Health and Environment. ""It also shows very clearly the gains that would accrue both to public health and to the general environment by a series of straightforward, coordinated investments. We call on ministries of health, environment and other partners to work together to ensure that these environmental and public health gains become a reality."" /  This research, which involved systematic review of literature as well as surveys of over 100 experts worldwide, identifies specific diseases impacted by certain well-known environmental hazards - and by how much. ""It brings together the best evidence available today on environmental links to health in 85 categories of disease and injury. Since the research focuses strictly on environmental hazards that are amenable to change, we can also see where preventive health measures combined with better environmental management and cleanup can have the biggest impact. In effect, we now have a 'hit list' for problems we need to tackle most urgently in terms of health and the environment,"" noted Dr Neira. /  Diseases with the largest total annual health burden from environmental factors, in terms of death, illness and disability or Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)1 are: /  Diarrhoea (58 million DALYS per year; 94% of the diarrhoeal burden of disease) largely from unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene Lower respiratory infections (37 million DALYs per year; 41 percent of all cases globally) largely from air pollution, indoor and outdoor. /  Unintentional injuries other than road traffic injuries (21 million DALYs per year; 44 percent of all cases globally), classification which includes a wide range of industrial and workplace accidents./ Malaria (19 million DALYs per year; 42 percent of all cases globally), largely as a result of poor water resource, housing and land use management which fails to curb vector populations effectively. /  Road traffic injuries (15 million DALYS per year; 40 percent of all cases globally), largely as a result of poor urban design or poor environmental design of transport systems. /  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) - a slowly progressing disease characterized by a gradual loss of lung function. (COPD, 12 million DALYs per year; 42 percent of all cases globally) largely as a result of exposures to workplace dusts and fumes and other forms of indoor and outdoor air pollution. /  Perinatal conditions (11 million DALYS per year; 11 percent of all cases globally)./  Most of the same environmentally-triggered diseases also rank as the biggest killers outright - although they rank somewhat differently in order of lethality. Diseases with the largest absolute number of deaths annually from modifiable environmental factors (these are all parts of the environment amenable to change using available technologies, policies, preventive and public health measure). These diseases include:/  2.6 million deaths annually from cardiovascular diseases /  1.7 million deaths annually from diarrhoeal diseases/  1.5 million deaths annually from lower respiratory infections /  1.4 million deaths annually from cancers /  1.3 million deaths annually from chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease/  470,000 deaths annually from road traffic crashes /  400,000 deaths annually from unintentional injuries /  The report shows that one way or another, the environment significantly affects more than 80% of these major diseases. Moreover, it looks to quantify only those environmental hazards that are modifiable - that is, those that are readily amenable to change through policies or technologies that already exist. The report also spells out us how much environment-related disease is preventable. /  By acting assertively and setting priorities for measures aimed at curbing the most serious killers, millions of unnecessary deaths can be prevented every year. Working with sectors such as energy, transport, agriculture and industry to ameliorate the root environmental causes of ill health is crucial./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

Medical wastes pose threat," NEW DELHI, India, Aug 6 -- Bio-medical wastes have become a major burden for Aligarh. In the absence of a scientific waste management system, medical wastes get accumulated in the backyards of hospitals and on streets near nursing homes and clinics. These get mixed with the domestic wastes and turn into hazard./  Ragpickers pick up such wastes. Stray animals, including dogs, feast on human parts clumped along with bio-medical waste at garbage dumps of Nagar Nigam Aligarh.The dumps have resulted in air pollution and are causing spread diseases like deptospira, hepatitis B and other skin infections and asthma. The Uttar Pradesh Government has geared up for the management of bio-medical waste in the state. And the government had constituted three state-level committees under the Environment (Protection) Act for devising ways for proper disposal of bio-medical waste, and government had fixed time limits for implementation of rules by various hospitals and nursing homes in the state including Aligarh./  But dispite the government's commitment for proper bio-medical wastes management the city hospitals including the government civil hospitals, J.N. Medical College of AMU and about 200 nursing homes are piling up such wastes indiscriminately. The rules on bio-medical wastes management and handling are binding on all hospitals and nursing homes including government hospitals and medical colleges. Surprisingly non hospitals Nagar Nigam have surprisingly no hospital including both civil hospital or homes have own incinerator although J.N. Medical College of AMU have small incinerator installed on the premises of the hospitals was a mere showpiece. All waste was being disposed of merely on paper. Both the civil hospitals of Aligarh usually burned the medical waste in the open./  The situation of the city is indeed very pathetic, contaminated syringes, body fluids, blood and pus stained cotton bandages and fracture plasters and some time human organs lie discarded in open spaces on the street and back lanes of the callous hospitals and nursing homes and these eyesores are a common sight in the city these get mixed with the domestic wastes. The Nagar Nigam Tractors loaded the waste on trolley twice of week and dumped this medical wastes in the roadside touching areas of the city./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
KALIBARI AREA LACKS PROPER WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY," DIBRUGARH, Aug 13 -- To be in the Kalibari area of the city means one has to help himself with a hanky on the nose. The unhygienic surroundings of the area provide a horrific picture to an onlooker. With garbage strewn all over the Kalibari road, mounting filth in the sweeper colony, air polluted with dust particles, pigs scavenging in the area and the dark looking clogged drains are enough to establish that the people in the area are living in sub-human conditions. /  The stink emanating from the area particularly from the main drain near the Loharpatty makes the stay here worse./  It may be mentioned that the area, which fall under the No 9 Kalibari ward of the Dibrugarh Municipal Board (DMB) is devoid of any waste disposal facility. Junaid Ahmed, a businessman admitted that due to lack of dustbin, people are compelled to dispose the domestic wastes either on the roads or push them into the drains. Moreover, huge piles of garbage from the new market area and the surroundings get thrown near the sweepers colony. /  The pigs reared by the sweepers in the area is another concern of the public here. These let lose pigs hunt on the mounting garbage and also move out to other areas. In the process, the pigs rummage lanes and damage drains. These pigs have no enclosures. The sanitation problem here has posed serious health hazards to the children particularly of the sweepers here. Children were found to be playing hide and seek amidst the pigs over the heap of garbage, when this Correspondent made a visit to the area. Aoti Devi, wage earner and mother of three children said that their children had no other option. ""I cannot tie my children at home"", Devi said./  The area undergoes the worst experience during the rains. Almost eight percent of the houses in the ward get submerged. All filths flow out of the drains and float all over. Riaz Ahmed, a businessman said that the stinking rubbishes would get into the houses and make the stay. ""Due to foul smell we can hardly have our meals"", he said. When the surface is wet or inundated, cooking becomes a crisis for the people using firewood as fuel. /  Dildar Hussain, an old man of the locality said in a frail voice that some families survive on biscuits and bread while some others frequent to hotels. Hussain further said that the situation was not so harsh during his young days./  ""Although there was the water logging problem earlier, we never experienced in this magnitude "", he said. The area gets inundated right from the fancy street to the Kalibari road. The people residing in the Loharpatty and Sweepers colony face the problem even in slightest rain. Children are unable to go to their schools during the floods. The people settled on the sides of the AT road and the Kalibari road are comparatively in a better situation./  The clogged drains that appear dark are filled with garbage. No drains were found to be praiseworthy. Firoz Ahmed, another resident of the area said that the drains were cleared after two-to-three-month interval./  The insanitary surrounding might give rise to malaria, encephalitis and other water borne diseases. It is high time authorities initiate measures to develop the area, lest it has to take the onus of any possible epidemic in future./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -312043 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Acid drops," NEW DELHI, India, Sep 10 -- Freak rains may have turned drought-prone areas like Barmer into lakes overnight and flooded parts of Kashmir. But a more freakish downpour drenches/  one-third of China: acid rain./  China's metal foundries and coal-fired power and coking plants belch millions of tonnes of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) into the skies, which come down as acidic rain. This threatens soil quality, increases levels of heavy metals in drinking water, damages crops, corrodes bridges and buildings and causes premature human deaths./  British chemist Robert Angus Smith coined the term 'acid rain' in 1870 when he noticed that smoke and steam of early industrialisation contained substances that changed the chemical composition of rain. He also discovered some of its harmful effects, like discolouring of fabrics, corrosion of metal surfaces, deterioration of building materials and withering of plants. Smith's warning, alas, went unheeded and the 'developed' world only began to take acid showers seriously in the Fifties./  Rain turns acidic when SO2 and NO2 mix with atmospheric moisture and are transformed into sulphuric and nitric acid deposits. Acidity is measured using the percentage hydrogen, or pH, scale. Distilled water has a pH of 7, which is considered neutral. A substance with a pH less than 7 is acidic, while those with a pH over 7 are alkaline. Emissions from volcanoes, sea spray, rotting vegetation and plankton make even normal rain mildly acidic, with a pH of 5.7. When Earth was young, chemicals in the atmosphere produced downpours similar to the sulphuric acid showers on Venus today./  But the real threat is human activity. Power plants that burn coal with high sulphur content, and vehicles and heating systems that emit nitrogen oxides are the largest sources of acid deposition. The deadly drizzle they produce has forced ancient buildings and monuments in many cities to weather more during the last 20 years than in the preceding 2,000, as limestone and marble turn to gypsum (a crumbling substance) upon contact with acid./  Paradoxically, reducing acid rain could cause more environmental damage. For, low-sulphur coal has more mercury and trace metals that worsen toxic air pollution. And its lower energy value means power plants must burn more of it to generate the same amount of electricity. This produces more carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming.

Season's greetings," NEW DELHI, India, Sep 23 -- Come September, and not only does the weather begin to change, but also the mood. Because this month marks the beginning of the festival season - it is officially time to celebrate. Lights, late nights, firecrackers, dancing, extra-special food?/  Most of us love this season. But for some people, the smoke and the noise that are an inevitable part of the celebratory atmosphere become too much to cope with. Some of this has to do with personal predilections: all that noise makes us tense and edgy. But if even the thought of that is agonising, consider the trauma of 27-year-old Gauri Mewati every Dussehra and Diwali. From the time the first firecrackers go off, she begins to wheeze and gasp for breath./  On the first day of the festival season? she retreats into a room, shuts all doors and windows so that she is insulated from the smoke-filled atmosphere outside, and ""suffocates inside the room"".Says Mewati, ""The situation can get so bad that I have to use three or four inhalers at a time, which means around 30 to 40 a night, to get some relief. My lungs swell up and I am not able to breathe.""/  Out of control/  True, Mewati has an extreme reaction to firecrackers. But there is no reason to assume that all of us are immune to the toxic fumes of firecrackers. Even if we are otherwise healthy, there is no doubt that the smoke from crackers and diyas, and the constant smell of gunpowder can have a terrible effect on our lungs./  ""Every year, I see an increase in asthma, allergies, sneezing and chronic colds just after the festive season,"" says Dr Deepak Kripalani, a general practitioner from Peddar Road, Mumbai. ""Some patients also come in with perforations of the eardrum, caused by bombs."" Dr Ashish Kumar Tiwari, staff physician at Bombay Hospital, agrees that there is a definite increase in the number of patients with respiratory and ear problems during the festive season./  ""Basically, there are two types of pollution - noise and air pollution,"" he says. ""Noise pollution causes a variety of problems, ranging from hearing loss to ringing in the ears, eardrum perforation, giddiness, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and even irritation, dizziness and lack of concentration."" Smoke pollution, on the other hand, says Dr Tiwari, could lead to respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Even those of us who are not usually prone to respiratory problems could face some slight trouble breathing. And children, says Dr Tiwari, are the most at risk from firecrackers, since their immunity levels are lower than those of adults./  Personal problems/  So what can be done to ensure that the festive season does not contribute to permanently damaging your hearing or breathing? Well, very little actually, says Dr Tiwari. Because while there are laws that are meant to ensure that both smoke and noise pollution do not get out of hand, the fact remains that these matters are often beyond our own control./  What we can do individually, however, is reduce the number of crackers that we set off ourselves, and make sure that these crackers are set off in an open, well-ventilated space. Definitely not indoors, especially in a corridor. And if you suffer from respiratory allergies, make sure that you wear a mask at least in the evenings and at night, and stay as far from crackers as possible. Noise pollution is much more difficult to deal with because, according to Sumera Abdul Ali of the Awaz Foundation, Mumbai, an organisation that seeks to bring down levels of noise pollution, there is no such thing as a low-decibel fire cracker./  ""During a recent survey we conducted with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, we determined that except for phooljadis and chakris, there is no such thing as a low-decibel firework,"" she says. ""Most of them explode at more than 100 decibels. And the crackers that only emit light are not as noise-free as people think. Besides, they have a very high level of air pollution. They certainly do not keep the environment clean."" The only solution then, for people who cannot take the noise, is to buy a pair of earplugs./  Little things/  But though these partial solutions may work for most of us, there are some people who are more at risk during the festival season than others. In particular, pregnant women. ""The effect of so much noise and smoke on pregnant women has not been explored in too much detail,"" says Dr Rishma Dhillon-Pai, a gynaecologist in Mumbai, ""But I know one thing for sure: foetuses do respond to sound when we conduct a non-stress test to monitor the baby's heartbeat. When a sudden sound is produced either at that time or at the time of a sonography, the baby moves, its heartbeat immediately increases and stays up for a period of time.""/  This could mean, she says, that loud noises for a prolonged period of time could cause a significant disturbance to the baby. ""Also, remaining in a polluted environment where there is very little pure oxygen is sure to have some kind of negative effect on the baby,"" she adds.Her advice to expecting mothers, therefore, is to stay as far away from crackers as possible. And also, to watch their diet. ""Do not forget to eat a healthy, balanced diet even in the middle of all the indulgences of the festive season,"" says Dr Dhillon-Pai./  In fact, 'watch the diet' is a rule that applies to everyone at this time of official indulgence, says dietician Dr Naini Setalvad. Her instructions for those of us with not-so-robust self-control includes the following: ""If you must eat fattening food, eat it in its natural form."" In other words, stay away from anything that is fried or sugar-heavy, and instead, reach for the nuts and dry fruit like walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, pistas, raisins and dates./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Living in neighbourhoods close to heavy industry doubles lung cancer risk," Washington, Sept 28 -- A new case control study on women has shown that living in neighbourhoods close to heavy industry may increase the risk of developing lung cancer. /  The researchers did online interviews of over 200 women with primary lung cancer, and compared the details got with those obtained from 339 healthy women. All subjects were under the age of 80 years. /  The study called 'Thorax 2006' was set in north east England, where heavy industry expanded rapidly throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and poverty and deprivation are common. Also rates of lung cancer among women are high in this area. /  The researchers interviewed their subjects at length about their lives, including full histories of where they had lived, their employment, as well as their smoking habits, and exposure to second hand smoke. /  They grouped the subjects' distances from heavy industry sites into three zones, wherein less than 5 km away was called 'zone A', 5 to 10 km away 'Zone B', and more than 10 km away 'Zone C'./  The researchers found that the average length of time that all participants had lived in the area was over 55 years./  Since smoking habits ant other factors might influence the results of the study, the data showed that women who had lived in zone A for more than 25 years, were almost twice as likely to develop lung cancer as others. /  However, the authors of the study suggest that the impact of air pollution on the development of lung cancer warrants further study./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Drug free approach for bronchial asthma," New Delhi, Oct 15 -- Diet therapy, nature cure and yoga therapy have been found to be effective in curing bronchial asthma./  Observing that morbidity and mortality from asthma is on the rise and more so due to the medications used in its treatment, Dr. T N Sathyaprabha, Dr Hemalatha Murthy and Dr B T C Murthy, conducted a study: ""Efficacy of naturopathy and yoga in bronchial asthma - A self controlled matched scientific study""./  The study aimed at finding the efficacy of non-pharmacological approach of naturopathy and yoga in bronchial asthma./  Over 30 centuries old disease, bronchial asthma, affect about five per cent of general population, with female being affected more than males./  Bronchial asthma is not a specific disease, but a syndrome that derives multiple precipitating mechanism and results in airway hyper-responsiveness and airway obstruction characterised by episodic occurrence of dyspnea and wheezing./  While, bronchodilators are known to give temporary relief and have side affects as well, the study conducted found that the drugless therapy of naturopathy and yoga helps in alleviating the symptoms of the disease by acting at physical and mental levels./  Thirty-seven patients, 19 men and 18 women in the age group of 35 to 40 years, with bronchial asthma were included in the two phases of the study - control period and treatment period./  During the control period the patients were studied on the first day and after 21 days of stay at home with drugs they normally take. On the 22nd day they were admitted to Institute of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences (INYS), Bangalore for 21 days of treatment./  All the medications were gradually stopped within two to three days of admission to INYS. The treatment included diet therapy, nature cure treatment and yoga therapy./  Diet therapy consisted of eliminative, soothing and constructive phase. Patients were given lime juice with honey, tender coconut water and plenty of water during three to five days long eliminative phase./  Depending upon the patient's requirements and structure, the fast was broken during the soothing phase (lasting around ten days) with seasonal fruit juice, fruits, salads and sprouts./  Patients were brought back to normal diet, during the constructive phase of diet therapy with few modifications like avoiding milk and milk products./  Nature cure treatments like chest pack, hot foot and arm bath, back massage, steam and sauna bath were given at regular intervals to the patients./  Yoga therapy comprised of jalanethi (traditional voluntary nose and stomach wash techniques), pranayama (breath slowing technique) and asanas (modified physical postures) once daily./  The lung function tests were conducted on asthma patients at weekly intervals at 8 am, during the treatment period./  Various parameters of lung function tests such as vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) showed significant improvement./  The hematological profile showed significant reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) at the time of discharge./  Reduction in AEC indicates a decrease in pathogenesis of asthma, since eosinophil plays an important role in development of morbid conditions of asthma./  The diet therapy eliminates toxins and clears digestive tract, the study explains. It is believed most of the diseases are caused due to accumulation of toxins and morbid matter in the body./  The holistic approach of nature cure treatment relieves lungs congestion, decreases pulmonary mucus membrane irritation and increases the depth of respiration, the study adds./  The yoga therapy relaxes mind and body. Yoga practice reduces emotional disturbance, thereby modifying airway resistance resulting in easy breathing./  Pranayama, defined in yog-sutras as the science of cleansing, balancing and gaining control over the prana (breath) in human systems, with its calming effects on mind reduce and release emotional stress./  Yoga kriyas bring about cleansing of inner tracts and desensitisation of nerve ending, the study says. The sensory nerve endings in the airways are activated due to inflammatory mediators such as air pollution causing cough, chest tightness and broncho-constriction./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
It's official: This Diwali was quieter," NEW DELHI, India, Nov 7 -- THIS DIWALI was safer, if MP Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) is to be believed. Although the sound and air pollution caused due to crackers this was a little above tolerable limit, it was lower than what was recorded during the last festive season./  The Board has attributed low pollution level to the rains that occurred in the City on Diwali night more than a pollution-conscious citizenry. According to MPPCB, the pollution level recorded at the City's four checkpoints was between 450 to 580 m3, which is quite low compared to the 896 m3 registered last year. Similarly, the level of noise pollution recorded was 88 decibels, which was much lower than maximum limit of 125 decibels./  The Board had set up checkpoints at Rajwada, Cloth Market, Polo Ground and Vijay Nagar to monitor air and noise pollution in the City from October 20-22. MPPCB Regional Officer Achyut Kumar Mishra told Hindustan Times that four teams with four members each were formed and trained for monitoring the noise pollution and ambient level in air with the help of decibel metre (DB) - sound monitoring system - and ambient air metre system. In all, three readings were taken at each area coming under the periphery of every checkpoint./  However, doctors disagree that the festivity made huge difference to asthmatic patients this year. Physician Dr Hansmukh Gandhi said several cases of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (in which a patient suffers from breathing problem) were reported on Diwali night. He said that there were complaints of hearing problem and allergic urticaria (in which rashes appear due to dust and smoke) too./  Notwithstanding the medical opinion, the common advise of MPPCB and doctors is to avoid smoke-spewing and noisy crackers during the oncoming wedding season, as they could lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic bronchitis, hearing problem and skin ailments./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Passive smoking does cause respiratory troubles in healthy adults," Washington, Nov 16 -- Passive smoking does lead to respiratory troubles in healthy adults, reveals a new long-term study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine./  Dr. Margaret W. Gerbase of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland, and her 11 associates came to the conclusion after assessing the respiratory symptoms in 1,661 never-smokers over an 11-year period. /  All individuals in the study cohort had participated in a Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Lung Diseases in Adults in 1991, and again in 2002. The two-part study was the first large-scale investigation of the long-term health effects of moderate ambient air pollution in Switzerland. /  ""The results of our longitudinal assessment of ETS effects in asymptomatic never-smokers showed that exposure to ETS was associated with the development of respiratory symptoms. A particularly strong effect of continued exposure to ETS was observed among previously asymptomatic individuals with bronchial hyper-reactivity,"" said Dr. Gerbase./  The researchers found that persistent exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) to be strongly associated with the development of cough. /  In subjects with bronchial hyper-reactivity, they observed a link between ETS and symptoms like wheeze, cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath) and chronic bronchitis. /  However, the condition that had the strongest association with ETS was dyspnea. /  The authors of the study say that if persistently exposed to ETS, individuals with bronchial hyper-reactivity are most likely to develop early-onset chronic respiratory disease. /  ""Symptom development in our subjects was accompanied by decrements in spirometric indices reflecting peripheral airway narrowing, notably in subjects with bronchial hyper-responsiveness,"" said Dr. Gerbase./  Of the 1,661 participants, 1,202 individuals reported never being exposed to ETS, 309 persons reported exposure only during the 1991 survey, and 150 subjects reported exposure both in 1991 and 2002./  ""Indirect evidence derived from smokers shows that airway responsiveness increases the risk to develop cough, phlegm, dyspnea and chronic bronchitis. Cessation of smoking leads to remission of symptoms and improvement in airway hyper-reactivity,"" said Dr. Gerbase./  Excluded from participation in the 1991 study were all potential participants who reported such symptoms as wheeze, cough, phlegm, dyspnea and chronic bronchitis, or who were taking a medication for asthma at the time./  The researchers concluded that their findings support the need for policies protecting all non-smokers from the ""detrimental effects"" of ETS./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
PCBA TRAINING ON BIOMEDICAL WASTE HANDLING ORGANISED," GUWAHATI, Nov 29 -- In order to curb the spread of fatal diseases like HIV/ AIDS / hepatitis-B and cancer, the Pollution Control Board, Assam (PCBA) organized a training programme on 'Biomedical waste (BMW) segregation, handling and disposal' at the Board's head office, Bamunimaidam, Guwahati recently. /  A large number of doctors and nurses from all the government hospitals along with the BB Cancer Hospital, Gauhati Medical College Hospital, Mahendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital, etc., participated in the training programme. /  Speaking on the occasion, Chairman, PCBA, Prof. JL Dutta dwelt on the issues of proper segregation of BMW at source in colour-coded bins as per Medical Waste Management and Handling Rule 1998. He said that every hospital and nursing home must have at least one electric needle destroyer in each nursing station (ward) for destroying the needle immediately after its use. /  ""The disposable syringes are to be disinfected by bleaching solution and then crushed (mutilated). This is to be done to ensure that people are not affected with HIV, AIDS and hepatitis-B infections,"" he said. /  The needle and syringes obtained from blood bank after blood transfusion are also to be disposed in a similar way. Care has to be taken so that blood, which is transfused, is free from infection like HIV, AIDS, hepatitis-B, etc. The whole exercise will make significant contribution towards elimination of spread of HIV, AIDS, hepatitis-B and cancer, he said./  The chairman said that practically hospitals/ nursing homes generate only 10-15 per cent of infectious wastes but due to lack of proper segregation/separation at source, those infectious wastes contaminate the non-infectious wastes, thereby making the whole waste infectious. /  Prof Dutta also highlighted the need to destroy the needles and syringes at source after single use to stop recycling. He said that anatomical waste obtained in the operation theatre, blood, body fluid, cotton swab, bandages, etc., were to be incinerated in a two-chamber incinerator with good air pollution control device, and chimney height should be 30 metres, with regular monitoring. The temperatures are to be maintained are 800?500C at the primary chamber and at 1050?500C at secondary chamber. The ash produced so should be disposed through secured landfill. The liquid biomedical waste is to be treated properly in an effluent treatment plant (ETP) and after proper treatment only it can be discharged. The PCBA has been conducting such programmes since June 2005. Till today 65 such training programmes have been conducted throughout the State./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -367863 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Kathmandu Asia's most polluted," NEW DELHI, India, Dec 15 -- Maoist chief Prachanda's dreams to make a ""new Nepal"" may be difficult to realise as a recent report has revealed that Kathmandu is the most polluted city in Asia./  The capital city of Nepal has topped the list of 22 ""sensitive cities"" for air pollution. The study was conducted by a team assigned by the Asian Development Bank./  The level of Particulate Matter (PM10) in the air of Kathmandu is 120 microgram per square metre, the study said, adding that as per World Health Organization standards, the level of PM10 should be 20 microgram per square meter./  The level of PM10 is higher than the official standard in most of the places of Kathmandu valley, the report prepared by renowned environmentalist Cornie Huizenga, said./  Particulate matter pollution consists of very small liquid and solid particles floating in the air. Scientists said PM10 is a mixture of materials including smoke, soot, dust, salts, acids, and metals./  However, Suman Sharma of Ministry of Environment of Nepal criticized the study as it failed to mention the official source of information and was prepared without direct involvement of any organization./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Fog will stay till New Year, thanks to rain"," NEW DELHI, India, Dec 27 -- The fog that engulfed the Capital on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning will be around for another three to four days. According to the Indian Meteorological Office (IMD) at the IGI Airport, this was the third spell of fog to hit the city and it is the most intense in this season. The fog had reduced the visibility to 200 meters in the city and below 50 meters in the airport./  ""All weather indicators on Tuesday evening suggested the fog by night-the moisture content in the air was higher than 85 per cent, thanks to some rain in the afternoon and the wind-speed was also not much - a classic precondition for fog,"" said a duty official at the Met office. But according to experts, the worst is far from over. ""December 15 to January 20 is considered to be the heavy fog season. The fog that we witnessed till now is nothing compared to how bad it is likely to get in the coming days,"" said J.B. Singh, director of National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF)./  According to Singh, the next ""three to four"" days will be foggy both in the morning and in the evening. ""Due to heavy moisture content in the air coupled with other weather indicators, we expect the existing spell to continue even till the arrival of the New Year,"" he said. But experts say that Delhi's infamous fog has been changing in character over the years and it is not just the weather that is to be blamed./  ""In terms of the density of the fog and the resultant dip in visibility, a lot is the result of the heavy vehicular pollution and a rise in population,"" said S. Khindri, chief meteorologist at SkyMet, a Delhi-based weather information firm. According to Khindri, emission from the 50 lakh-odd vehicles plying on Delhi roads make the city an ""island of heat and dust"". ""This affects the micro-weather of the city wherein the result is that the mercury is perpetually a bit higher than what it is in less-polluted and less populated cities. This has been adding to the density of fog in winters every year,"" he said./  Khindri also pointed out that earlier, when Delhi had much lesser vehicles and population, the intensity of the fog used to be lesser. ""Years ago, with the same meteorological conditions that caused fog on Wednesday, the visibility would have been a lot better,"" he said. According to air-pollution experts, over the years, Delhi has been increasingly experiencing, not fog, but smog./  ""When the level of suspended particulate matters in the air (tiny dust particles) increases, the fog takes the character of condensed air-pollution. Calm and cool weather is blocking the dispersal of smoke and pollutants. The low-hanging shroud impairs visibility and chokes lungs,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director, Centre for Science and Environment. ""Toxic emission, especially from the rising number of diesel vehicles is a major cause for concern,"" she said./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Medical experts suggest use of safety masks," NEW DELHI, India, Jan 13 -- EXPERTS SUGGEST each citizen should use safety masks while walking on city roads./  According to president of Kanpur Society of Chest Physicians (KSCP), Dr AK Mittal, the number of patients suffering from respiratory diseases and asthma were on the rise. The main reason behind rise in number of these patients was the highly polluted environment of the city./  The environment contained hazardous pollutants, which directly hit the respiratory system and caused complications even among the healthy persons./  Concentrated air pollution caused serious damage to the health of the patients already suffering from respiratory diseases like asthma, he added./  During winters the respiratory problems increased as the dust could not go up in the atmosphere due to the moisture-laden air generated by the dew. The dust-borne air passed to the lungs during the breathing process and aggravated the problem of breathlessness among the asthma patients. In order to protect oneself against the dust hazards it was advisable that the commuters, especially asthma patients, should use masks to protect themselves./  Dr Mittal said that the pollution level had attained hazardous proportions. He said that road side generators, dilapidated -dusty roads and garbage dumps on the streets were responsible for the rise in air pollution rate in the city./  Despite several efforts and representations to the Pollution Control Board no effective measures could be introduced to check air pollution during the past two decades and the situation was left to deteriorate further, he added./  Now the only solution to the problem was that individuals should take care of their health./  They should use masks to minimise risk and in case asthma patients received attacks they should use inhalers till they could reach the doctor./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Smokers have about double the risk of tuberculosis compared to non-smokers," Washington, Jan 16 -- A group of researchers have found that smokers have about double the risk of tuberculosis, when compared to non-smokers./  Though the evidence was more limited due to a substantially smaller number of studies, they also found evidence of an association between smoking, passive smoking and indoor air pollution and TB infection, disease and mortality./  They advocate larger rigorously designed studies in the future to substantiate that association./  ""Since tobacco smoking has increased in developing countries where TB is prevalent, a considerable portion of the global burden of TB may be attributed to tobacco. Importantly, this also implies that smoking cessation might provide benefits for global TB control in addition to those for chronic diseases,"" said Majid Ezzati, an associate professor of international health at Harvard School of Public Health ./  ""Our findings suggest that information on people's exposure to respirable pollutants from sources such as smoking and biomass use will help TB detection efforts. Additionally, TB control programs may benefit from including interventions aimed at reducing tobacco and IAP exposure, especially among those at high risk for exposure to infection,"" added Ezzati./  The study appears online on January 16, 2007, in the open-access journal PLoS Medicine./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Highway pollution found to increase heart attack risk in mice," Washington, Feb 1 -- A study conducted on mice models by the University of Rochester researchers, has explained why hospitals report a sharp rise in visits to emergency rooms for treatment of heart attacks on smoggy days in urban areas./  The study conducted on the rats that rode on a truck on the New York State Thruway between Rochester and Buffalo exposed to the same highway pollution that motorists encounter, showed a drop in heart rate and effects on the autonomic nervous system./  ""In humans, disruption of the autonomic nervous system could lead to serious health risks, particularly for people who already have heart disease. Such disruptions are associated with arrhythmia, and sometimes forewarn an early death after a heart attack,"" said Alison Elder, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a research assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Medicine./  ""The fact that exposure to air pollution can change the heart rate, independent of other factors, is a cause for concern,"" Elder said. ""It's important to understand that these changes are taking place outside of the lung. Air pollution is either having a direct effect on the heart in rats or is altering something within the circulatory system,"" he added./  The investigation began with the hypothesis that rats exposed to fresh vehicle emissions would show the same adverse outcomes that had been documented in a recent European study of humans. That study showed that people exposed to air pollution while riding in a bus or car or cycling to work were more likely to suffer a heart attack within one hour of their morning commute./  Rochester researchers placed aged hypertensive rats in a mobile laboratory for six hours on Interstate 90 in western New York for a total of 320 miles. The rats inhaled aerosols that any motorist would likely inhale on the same route. /  Researchers monitored the rats' blood pressure, heart rate and took electrocardiogram readings during the trip. Post-exposure recordings began 30 minutes after the trip and continued for five days./  Results showed a maximum drop in heart rate of 40 beats per minute, or a 10 percent decline. The effect persisted for up to 14 hours. In addition, researchers found a 70 percent decrease in the vagosympathetic balance, which is an index of heart rate variability and how the autonomic nervous system responds to change./  Studies such as this one are helping scientists understand why vehicle emissions, even at low levels, cause cardiovascular problems in addition to respiratory problems./  The biggest culprit seems to be the tiniest of air particles, known as ultrafines. They are 60,000 times more numerous than coarse particles found in air pollution. /  Ultrafines in ambient air are especially harmful because they mix with reactive gases and are taken deep into the lungs as aerosols. At that point, they may interact with the cells that line the blood vessels and enter the circulatory system. /  Elder's group is the first to report a link between freshly generated engine emissions and changes in the rat autonomic nervous system, which controls the heart and other key organs./  ""The investigators are now looking at how on-road aerosols affect blood platelets, which could impact clotting and other essential circulatory functions,"" Elder said./  The study is published in the January issue of the journal Inhalation Toxicology./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Live in CP, South Ex, Karol Bagh or Dwarka?"," NEW DELHI, India, Feb 6 -- IF YOU are a resident of South Extension, Dwarka, Karol Bagh, Connaught Place or the ISBT at Kashmere Gate, hold your breath. There's poison in the air. A report filed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) in the Delhi High Court on Tuesday revealed that the level of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in these areas are much higher than the permissible levels. The pollutants can lead to heart disorders, lung infections, asthma and bronchitis./  Suspended particulate matter consists of minute airborne particles produced through industrial activity, generator sets, vehicle emission and combustion. RSPM are a broad class of air pollutants that exist as discrete particles small enough to reach the pulmonary or alveolar regions. The case involved a public interest litigation filed by a citizen forum-Delhi Villagers Development Association - highlighting the alarming rise in air pollution. Quoting various environmental experts, the forum had said the city was turning into a ""gas chamber"" with 30 per cent of patients in hospitals suffering from respiratory problems, lung diseases and cancer./  A division bench comprising Justices Swatanter Kumar and H.R. Malhotra had directed the DPCC to file a report on the air pollution levels at these five ""most congested"" areas. The samples were collected between January 19 and 21, four times a day, including once during the rush hours (4pm to 8pm). It was observed that the SPM and RSPM levels at the five areas never dipped below the permissible levels of 200 and 100 microgram per cubic meters respectively./  Karol Bagh was the most polluted spot, with SPM levels ranging between 422mgpc and 976mgpc and the RSPM levels between 217 and 556mgpc./  In South Extension, the SPM levels were between 288mgpc and 606mgpc; the average for two consecutive days was 457mgpc. The RSPM levels were between 134mgpc and 344mgpc. In Dwarka, the SPM level was between 153mgpc and 588mgpc while RSPM hovered between 94mgpc and 318mgoc./  Connaught Place was no better, with SPM levels between 286mgpc and 617mgpc and RSPM levels between 132 and 324mgpc. The situation in ISBT was equally grim. The SPM levels were between 144 and 283mgpc while the RSPM level touched 216mgpc. Expressing ""shock"" at the revelations, the court has asked the Centre and the Delhi government and the DPCC to take immediate measures to check air pollution./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

AIR POLLUTION AND ITS EFFECTS," Guwahati, March 30 -- Air is essential free food of man to live. A man can stay without an eye, without hands, but not without this free food i.e. air. It is the human tendency to live a comfortable life, for which man has started polluting the environment in which he is living. Man started polluting the atmosphere in a small scale when he started lighting fire and burning fuel. Gradually, with the change of time, the human mind has also change and it started working parallel to the time. It has led him to greater aspiration there by his exploitation of nature's stores at a fast rate. Due to uncontrolled industrialisation and urbanisation and population explosion air pollution has now become a worldwide problem of indefinite magnitude. This problem 'air pollution' has already reached an alarming level in many highly industrialised countries./  Continued expansion of existing industries, development of new technologies and products and increasing use of automobiles coupled with pollution growth in large industrial towns are responsible for a great number and quantity of pollutants in the air. As most of the health-effects due to air pollution start showing off after a considerable period, it is essential to anticipate the problem potential of the next 20 years and take necessary preventive measure now itself./  A good composition of air contains 78.09 per cent nitrogen by volume, 20.94 per cent oxygen and the rest 0.97 per cent of the gaseous constituents of dry air including small amounts of carbon-dioxide. Helium, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and very small amounts of other inorganic and organic gasses are also present. In the atmosphere the air surrounded in the form of layers, and the thickness of this layer is approximately 160 km. Out of 160 km, more than half of its total weights is in the 64 km i.e. just above the surface of the earth./  Actually, the presence of foreign substances in air is known as pollution, in other dirtiness of air due to suspended gaseous particle is known as air pollution. According to Joint Council, USA, 'air pollution' means the presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more contaminants such as dust fumes, gas mist smoke, or vapour in quantities of characteristics and of duration, such as to be injurious to human, plant or animal life to property or which unreasonably interfere with the comfortable, enjoyment of life and property./  In all over the world stack gases from industrial establishments are still the major sources of air pollution. The industries letting out stack gases include thermal power stations, steel mills, petroleum refineries and other plants. The second source of air pollution are automobiles like cars, trains, planes which use fossil fuel in one form or the other. The third type is use of fuel for domestic purpose, refuse incineration, evaporation of petroleum products etc./  Air pollution sources can be divided into two i.e. specific sources and multiple sources. Specific sources are largely industrial in nature, thus permitting their potential to pollute a community atmosphere to be readily assayed on an industry-by-industry basis. In this case, the area is fixed and is commonly a limited area relative to be community. Multiple sources are either fixed or movable and commonly scattered throughout the community. Combustion of fuel is for power production, for transportation and domestic purposes./  Air pollution affects nearly a billion people worldwide exposing them to possible health hazards. It harms the human respiratory system. It also affects vegetation, for instance, by the uptake of pollutants through leaf stomata. Property loss is another problem imposed by atmospheric pollution. It can erode the exterior of buildings, specially constructed of limestones that react with acids in precipitation./  Since 1950, considerable research has been done. It has been found that patients with asthma, hay fever and chronic respiratory diseases suffer especially during smog period. On studying the health effects on can easily differentiate between the hazard of industrial atmosphere inside manufacturing or processing plants and those of the outside industrial atmosphere. The health effects on workers inside industry are classified as occupational diseases. Human system can adopt itself to certain amount of air pollutants, which are being breathed into the system, and the limit, at which it becomes hazardous to the individuals, is known as maximum allowable concentration. To analyse the effects of exposure to air pollutants at lower concentrations for a longer period epidemiological and toxicological studies are carried out and found that epidemiological studies are concerned with the effects occurring in human and animal population exposed under natural conditions. There is growing amount of evidence linking air pollution to respiratory conditions like chronic bronchitis, acute non-specific respiratory diseases, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive ventilatory diseases and lung cancer./  Air pollution can be controlled by two fundamental approaches i.e. control of pollutant at the source so that excessive amounts are emitted to the atmosphere and control by natural dilution of the pollutant in atmosphere. In order to combat the problem of air pollution, proper environmental management comes to rescue. A proper environmental monitoring and management will help to reduce the loss by air pollution./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -427071 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
TRAINING ON DISPOSAL OF BIO-MEDICAL WASTE HELD," GUWAHATI, April 1 -- To curb the spread of fatal diseases like HIV/ AIDS / Hepatitis B and Cancer, the Pollution Control Board, Assam (PCBA) organized a training programme on Bio-Medical Waste (BMW) segregation, handling and disposal at its head office, Bamunimaidam, Guwahati recently. Nurses from several hospitals and nursing homes of greater Guwahati participated in the training programme./  Speaking on the occasion, Chairman, PCBA, J. L. Dutta dwelt on the issues of proper segregation of BMW at source in colour-coded bins as per medical waste management and handling Rule 1998. He said that every hospital and nursing homes must have at least one electric needle destroyer in each nursing station (ward) for destroying the needle immediately after its use. The disposable syringes are to be disinfected by bleaching solution and then crushed. This is to be done to ensure that people are not affected with HIV, AIDS and Hepatitis B infections. /  The needle and syringes obtained from blood bank after blood transfusion are also to be disposed of in a similar way. Care has to be taken so that blood, which is transfused, is free from infection like HIV, AIDS and Hepatitis B etc. The whole exercise will make significant contribution towards elimination of spread of HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis B and cancer./  He also mentioned that practically hospitals and nursing homes generate only 10-15% infectious wastes but due to lack of proper segregation or separation at source these infectious waste contaminate the non-infectious wastes and thereby makes the whole waste infectious./  Especially, the need to destroy the needles and syringes at source after single use to stop recycling was highlighted in the meet. The anatomical waste obtained in the Operation Theatre, blood, body fluid, cotton swab, bandages etc. are to be incinerated in a two chamber incinerator with good air pollution control device and chimney height should be 30 meters, with regular monitoring.?The liquid biomedical wastes is also to be treated properly in an effluent treatment plant (ETP) and after proper treatment only it can be discharged./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from the Assam Tribune./  -428263 /For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Outdoor secondhand tobacco smoke is just as harmful," Washington, May 3 -- A new study by researchers at Stanford University has found that outdoor secondhand smoke can also be just as harmful as indoor smoke./  The study, on how smoking affects air quality at sidewalk cafés, park benches and other outdoor locations, is the first in-depth one to be conducted, and has led the researchers to conclude that a non-smoker sitting a few feet downwind from a smoldering cigarette is likely to be exposed to substantial levels of contaminated air for brief periods of time./  Lead author Neil Klepeis, assistant professor (consulting) of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford, said that the study busts the notion that exposure to outdoor smoke is not as harmful as it quickly dissipates into the air./  ""Some folks have expressed the opinion that exposure to outdoor tobacco smoke is insignificant, because it dissipates quickly into the air,"" said Neil Klepeis./   ""But our findings show that a person sitting or standing next to a smoker outdoors can breathe in wisps of smoke that are many times more concentrated than normal background air pollution levels,"" he added./  The study enforced the results of the 2006 Surgeon General's report, which found that even brief exposures to secondhand smoke may have adverse effects on the heart and respiratory systems and increase the severity of asthma attacks, especially in children, said Wayne Ott, professor (consulting) of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and co-author of the study. /  ""We were surprised to discover that being within a few feet of a smoker outdoors may expose you to air pollution levels that are comparable, on average, to indoor levels that we measured in previous studies of homes and taverns,"" said Ott./  ""For example, if you're at a sidewalk café, and you sit within 18 inches of a person who smokes two cigarettes over the course of an hour, your exposure to secondhand smoke could be the same as if you sat one hour inside a tavern with smokers. Based on our findings, a child in close proximity to adult smokers at a backyard party also could receive substantial exposure to secondhand smoke,"" he added./  In the study, the researchers used portable electronic monitors to make precise measurements of toxic airborne particles emitted from cigarettes at 10 sites near the Stanford campus. /  Each instrument was calibrated to measure an airborne pollutant known as particulate matter-2.5 (PM2.5), which consists of thousands of microscopic particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in width-about 30 times narrower than a human hair./  PM2.5 is a toxic pollutant produced by cigarettes, wood-burning stoves, diesel engines and other forms of combustion. It contains benzo(a)pyrene, a carcinogen, and many other toxic chemicals that can penetrate deep inside the lungs./  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, exposure to PM2.5 can lead to serious health problems, including asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, irregular heartbeat, nonfatal heart attacks and even premature death in people with heart or lung disease. The current EPA ambient air standard for PM2.5 is 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over 24 hours. Levels that exceed 35 micrograms are considered unhealthy. /  To measure PM2.5 levels in secondhand smoke, the researchers placed the instruments near actual smokers in different open-air environments, and found that the closer a person is to an outdoor smoker, the higher is the risk of exposure./  However, the researchers found that air quality improved as they moved away from the smoker./  ""If there's just one smoker, and you can sit six feet away, you would have little problem. At the same time, if there are a lot of smokers nearby, you may be exposed to very high levels of secondhand smoke. So this thing that critics have been dismissing as trivial is not,"" said Ott./  ""Unlike indoor tobacco smoke, which can persist for hours, the researchers found that outdoor smoke disappears rapidly when a cigarette is extinguished. Our data also show that if you move about six feet away from an outdoor smoker, your exposure levels are much lower,"" Klepeis added./  The study appears in the May issue of the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Pollution induced cancer emerges as top killer in China," New Delhi, May 21 -- Air and water pollution combined with widespread use of food additives and pesticides made cancer the top killer in China last year, according to a recent government survey. /  According to Chen Zhizhou, a health expert with the cancer research institute affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, ""the main reason behind the rising number of cancer cases"" was that pollution of air and water was directly affecting crops and food./  ""Pollution of the environment, water and air is getting worse day by day. Many chemical and industrial enterprises are built along rivers so that they can dump the waste into water easily. Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides also pollute underground water. The contaminated water has directly affected soil, crops and food,"" said Chen./  Released by the Ministry of Health, the survey, conducted in 30 cities and 78 counties, showed that cancer topped the list of the 10 most lethal diseases for urban residents last year, followed by cerebrovascular diseases and heart ailments./  Death rate from cancer had also risen to 19 percent in cities and 23 percent in rural areas, while in rural areas, 92 percent of fatalities were caused by 10 illnesses, the first three being cancer, cerebrovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, China Daily quoted the survey as saying./  Air pollution was a major cause of lung cancers, as harmful granules entered the lungs and did not get discharged, the survey showed. /  ""Large amounts of formaldehyde and its compounds used in house renovations and furniture has been blamed for deterioration in air quality.

Pollution increasing health risk," NEW DELHI, India, May 27 -- THE NUMBER OF patients suffering from respiratory diseases in Haldwani has gone up by 20 times in the past four years. The reason: a sharp increase in air pollution in the foothill town, according to a study./  The study conducted by the Aryabhatt Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, attributes the increased instance of respiratory diseases in Haldwani region to a high concentration of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. ""These particles also carry dust, smog and water vapours,"" it says./  Dr P. Pant, head of ARIES' Atmospheric Sciences Division, supervised the study. Stating that the concentration of dust particles in Haldwani becomes far heavier in summers than in winters, he attributed the problem to the green belt of the foothill region getting lost to developmental activities./  ""The number of bronchial asthma patients has gone up by 20 times since 2003,"" admitted Dr R.G.

Hostility can hamper lung function in young adults," Washington, June 4 -- Young adults need to rein in that short temper or mean disposition for a new study has found that it can compromise lung function./  Psychologists from the American Psychological Association wanting to examine whether the tendency to be hostile went along with having decreased lung function in young adults who were otherwise healthy, studied 4,629 Black and White 18-30 year olds from four metropolitan areas (sampled from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in (Young) Adults Study cohort (CARDIA). /   The results indicated that the more hostile one's personality--characterized by aggression or anger, for example--the lower levels one's of lung function even after controlling for age, height, socioeconomic status, smoking status and presence of asthma. /  The researchers noted that people with higher levels of general frustration predicted statistically significant reductions in pulmonary function for Black women, White women, and Black men. /  The only marginally strong finding occurred among the White men sampled. /  The authors speculate that people in lower status roles, Black women, White women, and Black men, who display hostility (and may be pushing against social expectations), elicit stronger social consequences than White men, resulting in higher levels of internalized stress that can make them sick. Further research is required to rule out if environmental toxins such as air pollution may contribute to both higher hostility and lower lung function. /  Hostility was measured using the Cook-Medley Questionnaire which is derived from the items on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Pulmonary function was measured while participants were standing and wearing a nose clip, blowing into a machine to measure their lung capacity, which can indicate upper airway obstruction./  ""Recent research demonstrates that greater hostility predicts lung function decline in older men. This is the first study of young adults to offer a detailed examination of the inverse link between hostility and pulmonary function,"" states lead author and psychologist Benita Jackson, PhD, MPH, of Smith College. /  ""It's remarkable to see reductions in lung function during a time of life we think of as healthy for most people. Right now, we can't say if having a hostile personality causes lung function decline, though we now know that these things happen together. More research is needed to establish whether hostility is associated with change in pulmonary function during young adulthood."" /  This research has implications for future research exploring the possible influence of social status on personality functioning and pulmonary health. /  The study is published in the journal Health Psychology./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

"AU, IIT-K to undertake joint study of aerosols"," NEW DELHI, India, June 13 -- EARTH AND Planetary Sciences department of Allahabad University (AU) and the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-K) are soon going to undertake a joint study of aerosols and its impact on the regional and the local environment./  They have also decided to set up a permanent Aerosol Collection Centre at the AU Earth and Planetary Science department besides having a number of mobile aerosol collection units on hand for being used in the nearby areas for the study./  ""Aerosols and its composition as well as impact are interesting areas of study attracting world-wide attention from scientists of various fields today. Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the air. Some occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea sprays. Human activities, such as burning of fossil fuels and the alteration of natural surface cover, also generate aerosols. These affect the climate as well as the human health significantly,"" said head of AU Earth and Planetary Science department Dr Jayant K Pati./  He said that sudden increase of aerosol particulate, measuring from a few nanometres to 100 micrometres, in the environment can affect the human health by clogging the lungs and causing other complications. ""World-wide exposure to particulate air pollution has been associated with three per cent mortality from cardiopulmonary diseases, five per cent mortality from cancer of the trachea, bronchus and the lung and one per cent from respiratory infections in children./  Besides causing ailments, aerosols are also known to reduce solar radiation by 19 per cent which has a significant impact on the regional climate,"" Dr Pati explained./  He said that during the last 30 years, scientists have identified several major aerosol types and they have developed general ideas about the amount of aerosol to be found in different seasons and locations./  ""Still, key details about the amount and properties of aerosols are needed to be calculated for even their current effect on surface temperatures. So far, it has not been possible to make these measurements on a global scale. It is for this reason that efforts are on all over the world to study aerosols,"" he added./  Explaining the significance of Allahabad as a place of initiating a study on aerosols and having a collection centre here, Dr Pati said that the city is important as the Indo-Gangetic plains (North of Ganga) and the shield area of peninsular India (South of Yamuna) meet./  ""One consists of diverse soil and the other is rocky, one is hot while the other is a cold front. As a result this is a region where aerosol particulate matter mix and settle down due to the high humidity which is the result of the two major rivers of the country flowing in the area,"" he elaborated./  He said that the presence of Silica stone mining and washeries in Shankargarh, the high density of stone crushers between Mahoba and Karvi as well as the city being placed in the Indo-Gangetic belt where huge spread of smog exists during winters along with Hissar, Delhi, Agra, Kanpur, Jadugoda and Kharagpur makes this place ideal for the proposed study./  Dr Pati said that IIT-K's Associate professor Dr Sacchidanand Tripathi has shown a keen interest on undertaking a joint study with Earth and Planetary Science department of AU now./  ""We floated the research idea and it has been duly accepted by them. Discussions were held here in March 2007 and we agreed that IIT-K would help train our students and faculty members in the use of the sophisticated instrument that we would be using here at the collection centre and analysis centre. Already a MSc student Ashish Chandra Shukla has returned after a short training and others would be following him soon,"" he added./  This research is being viewed as an onset of a new area of research on the varsity campus, that many experts believe, could spur on more researches on aerosols in AU./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"

"High acid content in Pune, Nagpur rain"," NEW DELHI, India, Aug. 1 -- WHEN IT rains in Pune and Nagpur, the raindrops may not taste unusual. But weathermen who recently studied the composition of rainwater from 10 cities are worried that it's raining 'acid rain' caused by vehicular, industrial pollution and frenetic urbanisation./  ""In Pune and Nagpur, the amount of acid in rainwater has gone up five times since 1995,''said V K Soni, a senior meteorologist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) who conducted the study with colleague Jayant Sarkar, former director of the IMD's air pollution unit. The researchers also collaborated with the World Meteorological Organisation./  Samples of rainwater from this year's first showers and last year's monsoon from Pune, Nagpur, Vishakhapatnam, Srinagar, Allahabad, Jodhpur, Kodaikanal, Minicoy (Lakshadweep) Mohanbari and Port Blair were tested at the IMD, Pune. The results indicated high amounts of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide - major contents of acid rain - that are emitted into the atmosphere from vehicles, coal-fired power plants and industries./  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website says pollutants in acid rain interact in the atmosphere to form fine sulphate and nitrate particles that can be 'transported long distances by winds and inhaled deep into people's lungs. Fine particles can also penetrate indoors.'/  Some medical practitioners say acid rain is linked to the neuro-degenerative Alzheimer's Disease. ""Drinking acidic rainwater directly or consuming vegetables grown on water containing acidic or metallic elements can cause Alzheimer's disease,"" maintained Nagpur-based neurologist Rajeev Deshpande.Acidic elements in rain are measured on a scale called pH that ranges from 0 to 14./  ""When there is a decline of 1 pH, it means acidity has gone up by 10 times,'' said Soni. ""In Nagpur, acidic elements in rainwater were 4.7 pH during 2005-06 as against 5.6 in 1995.''/  At the National Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Director Sukumar Devotta also blamed acid rain on pollution. ""Its sulphur content can damage plants and aquatic life too,'' said Devotta. Samples of rain from this year are now being collected./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Climate change contributing to Siberian forest fires," Washington, Aug. 1 -- Researchers at the university of Leicester have found that changing climate is contributing to forest fires in Central Siberia. /  The massive fire of 2003 had destroyed 38000 km2 of the region's woodlands and the thick smoke plumes caused air pollution as far as in the United States. /  Now, an international team of scientists led by Professor Heiko Balzter of the Department of Geography at the University of Leicester have found that Siberian fires are influenced by climate change. /  ""Last century a typical forest in Siberia had about 100 years after a fire to recover before it burned again. But new observations by Russian scientist Dr Kharuk have shown that fire now returns more frequently, about every 65 years. At the same time annual temperatures in Siberia have risen by almost two degrees Celsius, about twice as fast as the global average. And since 1990 the warming of Siberia has become even faster than before,"" said Prof. Balzter./  Scientists have known for sometime that global warming leads to warmer springs and causes plants to green up earlier. While this has been observed in the UK, scientists recently found the same occurring in Russia, as well. /  The scientists observed 18 years of satellite images of the region, and estimated the timing of the onset and end of the growing season, when the snow has melted and the plants take up carbon from the air during plant growth. /  They found that from 1982 to 1999 almost all Siberian ecosystems showed an earlier onset of spring. The strongest advance of spring was observed in Urban areas (0.74 days advance per year), Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (0.46 d/a), Forest - Cropland complexes (0.62 d/a), Humid grasslands (0.35 d/a) and Cropland - Grassland complexes (0.45 d/a)./  ""Central Siberia has a more continental climate. The changes in the timing of spring and also in fire occurrence are linked to temperature changes and a climate pattern that scientists call the Arctic Oscillation. Towards the East Siberian coast the Pacific plays a more important role, and the El Ni?o phenomenon together with low rainfall determines what happens to the forest,"" said Prof. Balzter. /  ""Planet Earth is always more complicated than you think. The lengthening of the growing season that has been described in the scientific literature is a non-linear phenomenon. It is influenced by feedbacks between the atmosphere and the forest, which responds to rising greenhouse gas levels and higher temperatures,"" he said./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Water, air, soil pollution accounts for 40pc worldwide deaths"," Washington, Aug. 14 -- Water, air, and soil pollution causes 40 per cent of deaths across the world, according to a survey conducted by Cornell researchers. /  Such environmental degradation, coupled with the rise in the world population, are major causes behind the rapid increase in human diseases that the World Health Organization has recently reported, says David Pimentel, Cornell professor of ecology and agricultural sciences./  He says that the two factors contribute to the malnourishment and disease susceptibility of 3.7 billion people. /  Pimentel and a team of Cornell graduate students came to these conclusions after examining data from more than 120 published papers on the effects of population growth, malnutrition and various kinds of environmental degradation on human diseases. /  ""We have serious environmental resource problems of water, land and energy, and these are now coming to bear on food production, malnutrition and the incidence of diseases,"" said Pimentel, whose report on the study has been published online in the journal Human Ecology./  He says that 57 per cent of the world population of about 6.5 billion is malnourished, compared with 20 per cent of a world population of 2.5 billion in 1950./  The researchers says that malnutrition not only causes the death of 6 million children every year, but also makes millions of people much more susceptible to various killer diseases like respiratory infections, malaria, and a host of other life-threatening diseases. /  Pimentel says that 1.2 billion people lack clean water, and waterborne infections account for 80 per cent of all infectious diseases. He said that increased water pollution creates breading grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes, claiming 1.2 million to 2.7 million lives a year. /  The study says that air pollution from smoke and various chemicals kills about 3 million people a year, and unsanitary living conditions account for more than 5 million deaths each year, of which more than half are children. /  Pimentel says that soil is contaminated by many chemicals and pathogens, which are passed on to humans through direct contact or via food and water. Increased soil erosion worldwide not only results in more soil being blown, but also in the spreading of disease microbes and various toxins, he adds. /  Drug-resistance of microbes and the influence of global warming and biological diversity on parasite evolution have further raised the risk of tuberculosis and influenza, says the researcher. New threats, such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease, have also developed, he adds./  ""A growing number of people lack basic needs, like pure water and ample food. They become more susceptible to diseases driven by malnourishment, and air, water and soil pollutants,"" Pimentel says. /  ""Relying on increasing diseases and malnutrition to limit human numbers in the world diminishes the quality of life for all humans and is a high-risk policy,"" he concludes./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Environment lovers in Dharamshala against certain Buddhist rituals," Dharmashala (Himachal Pradesh), Aug. 20 --  Many residents and environmentalists at Dharamshala are worried over the Tantrik prayer flags of Buddhists ""Bon"", that are feared to be polluting environment here. /  The problem has arisen after the Buddhist priests have started using synthetic flags and strings for performing their rituals. /  They are also used for pleasing local deities and spirits of the mountains, valleys, lakes and streams to seek protection against natural disasters and disease. The subsequent rites, with the aim of reckoning the divine, include hanging of the Bon flags over the branches of trees. The flags are then burnt to complete the Tantrik Buddhist rituals. /  The environmentalists have observed that when the synthetic material used for flags burns, it causes a lot of air- pollution. The knot tied around the tree, using plastic rope, also hinders tree's growth. /  Perturbed with such a practice affecting the environment, residents at Dharamshala have launched a drive to check the plethora of bon flags upsetting the greenery in the region. /  Ramesh, a local resident, said: ""They (Buddhist) light fire before they start worshipping and then they hang synthetic flags on plastic strings that too very tightly around tender branches of trees. First, the tight knot harms the tree. Secondly, due to heat when the string melts the flags and the string set ablaze, thus polluting the environment. Villagers here keep wandering in forests and unfasten Bon flags."" /  Residents of Dharamshala say that the religious practices should not be performed at the cost of environment. /  Prem, an environmentalist, said: ""We understand their (Buddhists') sentiments. But they should also show concern about environment. Some areas should be earmarked where the flags are allowed."" /  The Tibetan government-in-exile admits the environmental threat posed by the Bon flags and has assured a timely action. /  ""We will see that in pursuit of our religious practices, we should not harm the nature. We will try to stop the use of plastic flag and will tell our people not to tie flags too tightly over the branches. Paper or cloth flags are biodegradable,"" said Tsering Phuntsok, Minister of Religion and Culture, Tibetan government-in-exile. /  Tibetans have two forms of Bon flags, Lung-Ta (horizontal) and Dar-Cho (vertical)./  These flags carry images that may be of Lord Buddha, Bodhisattvas, Tara (Goddess of Tantrik sect) animals, lotus, teachers, or some other important entity. /  It is believed when the Bon flags brush against air, a positive energy is produced. The energy travels with air and protects all living and non-living beings that are exposed to the air./  Bon doctrine is a vital aspect of Tantrik (sorcery) Buddhism. /  Bon, a Tibetan word meaning invocation, is used during fire rituals by Buddhist priests. They perform burial rites as per their age old customs and believe that such incantations tame the demons. /  Tibetan prayer flags are available in five colours representing the five basic elements known as Pancha Bhootas - earth, air, water, fire, and space. /  The most common flags have the Ghachenchemon Mantra (hymn of prayer) script contents on them. The literal meaning of this is the 'highest umbrella' that protects its followers./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Environmental pollution contributing to 40 pc deaths worldwide," Washington, Sept. 11 -- Water, air and soil pollution, along with other environmental factors, contribute to 40 percent of deaths worldwide each year, a new study by a Cornell University ecologist has revealed./  The study in the journal Human Ecology revealed that 62 million deaths per year (40 percent) of all that occurred), could be attributed to environmental factors, particularly organic and chemical pollutants that accumulated in air, water, and soil. /  ""Water is one of the major concerns, without any question, because everyone must use it for drinking, cooking, washing and bathing,"" said David Pimentel./  ""Water contaminated with untreated sewage and faecal matter can facilitate the transmission of diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera (bacteria that live in faeces), intestinal infections (which can compound health issues by causing malnutrition) and other diseases - all of which kill millions every year, especially children,"" Pimentel wrote in his study./  Pimentel said air pollution was another big killer. /  The WHO ranks air pollution as the eighth most important risk in the burden of disease and holds it responsible for three million deaths each year through diseases such as pneumonia, chronic bronchitis and lung cancer. /  In developing countries, indoor air pollution is a major problem because most people rely on open stoves fuelled by dung, wood, crop waste or coal to cook and heat poorly-ventilated homes. /  ""A little more than half of the world's households use these solid fuels for cooking, which is huge. The smoke from these stoves accumulates in abodes, exposing those inside-mainly women and children-to the hazardous pollutants released from the fuel,"" said WHO scientist Annette Pr?ss-?st?n. /  ""In some houses you enter into the kitchen, and even though you might even have a permanent opening in the house ... you can hardly see ... the wall on the other side, so thick is the smoke,"" Pr?ss-?st?n said. /  Pimentel said more than 200 different chemicals are found in the smoke, and 14 of them are known carcinogens, adding that each year, this indoor air pollution kills 1.6 million people (or one person every 20 seconds), according to WHO reports. /  On the other hand, outdoor air pollution, accounts for some 800,000 deaths per year - about half as many as indoors - because the pollutants are much less concentrated. /  ""Indoor air pollution can be 100 times more concentrated. There's really a big difference,"" LiveScience quoted Pr?ss-?st?n, as saying. /  Pimentel's said the study has also shown that chemical exposures can contribute to cancers, birth defects, immune system defects, behavioural problems, altered sex hormones and dysfunctions in specific organs. /  Americans of all ages carry at least 116 foreign chemicals in their bodies, including DDT, lead and mercury, Pimentel said in his study./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Diesel exhaust may be hazardous for heart patients," London, Sept. 13 -- Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and Umea warned that air pollution could be hazardous for patients with heart disease./  Polluted air could put heart disease sufferers at risk by affecting the blood vessels and clotting./  At the University, a study was conducted by measuring the effects of diesel exhaust on heart and blood vessel function in men who have previously experienced a heart attack, and it was found that inhalation of diesel exhaust resulted in changes in the heart's electrical activity./  This study suggested that the air pollution reduces the amount of oxygen available to the heart during exercise. /   ""This study provides an explanation for why patients with heart disease are more likely to be admitted to hospital on days in which air pollution levels are increased. Most people tend to think of air pollution as having effects on the lungs but, as this study shows, it can also have a major impact on how our heart functions,"" the New England Journal of Medicine quoted Dr Nicholas Mills, of the University's Centre for Cardiovascular Sciences, as saying./  The study was conducted on a group of twenty men who had suffered a previous heart attack. The volunteers were screened for angina or heart rhythm problems./  They were then exposed to either filtered air or dilute diesel exhaust for one hour while sporadically riding a stationary bicycle, which was carefully monitored in an exposure chamber in Umea University./  Simultaneously, heart function was also being monitored and blood tests were taken six hours after leaving the chamber./  When the heart was electrically monitored it showed that inhalation of diesel exhaust caused a three-fold increase in the stress of the heart during exercise./   In supplement to this, the body's ability to release t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator), a ""guardian"" protein, which can prevent blood clots from forming, was also reduced by more than one third. /  For the fine exhaust particles produced by road traffic, the link between air pollution and heart disease is the strongest./   Researchers are mainly interested in diesel engines as they generate 10-100 times more pollutant particles than petrol engines./  ""Diesel exhaust consists of a complex mixture of particles and gases. Before we can recommend the widespread use of particle traps in diesel engines, we need to show that particles are the responsible component,"" Dr Mills said. /  ""If we do that, then it is likely that devices to filter particles from exhaust, will reduce exposure and benefit public health,"" he added./  Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said: ""There is already evidence that air pollution can make existing heart conditions worse. This research is helping us work out why. It shows that in patients with coronary heart disease, diesel exhaust can reduce the amount of oxygen available to the heart during exercise, which may increase the risk of a heart attack. /  ""Because of the overwhelming benefits of exercise on heart health, we would still encourage heart patients to exercise regularly, but preferably not when there is a lot of local traffic around. Heart patients can look out for pollution levels on their local weather forecasts.""/  The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation and published in the New England Journal of Medicine./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Breath-analysis may help monitor blood sugar in diabetes non-invasively," Washington, Sept. 25 -- A new study at the University of California, Irvine has shown that breath-analysis may serve as an effective, non-invasive method for monitoring blood sugar levels in diabetes./  The researchers used a chemical analysis method developed for air-pollution testing during the study, and found that children with type-1 diabetes exhaled significantly higher concentrations of methyl when they had high blood sugar, a condition known as hyperglycaemic. /  ""Breath analysis has been showing promise as a diagnostic tool in a number of clinical areas, such as with ulcers and cystic fibrosis. While no clinical breath test yet exists for diabetes, this study shows the possibility of non-invasive methods that can help the millions who have this chronic disease,"" said Dr. Pietro Galassetti, a diabetes researcher with the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at UC Irvine./  The study published in the online version of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences involved 10 children with type-1 diabetes mellitus. Dr. Dan Cooper and Andria Pontello of the GCRC took air samples during a hyperglycaemic state, and progressively as they increased the children's blood insulin levels./  UC Irvine chemists F. Sherwood Rowland and Donald Blake examined the exhaled breath samples in the laboratory, and measure the levels of trace gases in excess of the parts-per-billion range that contribute to local and regional air pollution. /  The children's breath samples were analysed for more than 100 gasses at parts-per-trillion levels, and the results showed that methyl nitrate exhaled concentrations had increased as much as 10 times more in diabetic children during hyperglycaemia than when they had normal glucose levels./  According to the researchers, the methyl nitrate concentrations corresponded with the children's glucose levels. The higher the glucose, the higher the exhaled methyl nitrates, they said./  Galassetti said that during hyperglycemia, in type 1 diabetes there are more fatty acids in the blood that cause oxidative stress. Methyl nitrate is likely a by-product of this increased oxidative stress, he added. /  ""Currently, we are involved with new studies looking at the correlation of other gases with hyperglycemia and other variables, including insulin. Eventually, we hope to put together a full exhaled gas profile of diabetes, and our efforts look promising,"" he said./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Accountants live eight-years longer than builders," London, October 25 -- Middle-class professionals like doctors and accountants in the UK are living about eight years longer than builders and cleaners, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. /  While life-expectancy among all social classis has increased, it is alleged that variations in the age at which people are dying point to the failure of Government measures to reduce the gap between rich and poor. /  The study, which looked at people from five social classes in 1972-76 and 2002-05, showed that skilled workers had had a greater increase in life expectancy at birth, and at the age of 65 than those in manual occupations. /  It also showed that men engaged in professional occupations live up to the age of 80, almost eight years longer than those in unskilled jobs, whose life expectancy is 72.7. /  Professional women were found to have a life expectancy at birth of 85.1 years as compared to 78.1 years for manual workers./  While men in managerial and technical occupations like that of journalists and teachers have slightly shorter life expectancy at 79.4, unskilled workers such as labourers and cleaners have the shortest life expectancy./  The King's Fund, a health think tank, said the figures showed the differences between social groups were growing./  ""Those who have a lower life expectancy have it because of a range of factors. They may live in housing which is damp and has poor heating, or near busy roads which means more air pollution. But the nature of people's jobs also has an effect. If you have autonomy and control over what you do, you tend to be in better health,"" the Telegraph quoted Karen Jochelson, a research fellow, as saying./  ""There is also evidence that shows people on low incomes have higher smoking rates and their diets tend to be worse because high fat, high sugar diets are cheaper,"" Jochelson added. /  Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said that public health resources and the actions of government should be focused on tackling poor health outcomes in the most deprived areas and among the poorest sections of society, instead of simply providing treatment of disease. /  Many experts believe that the problem will worsen if the poor failed to catch up with the rich. According to them, the less affluent started to give up smoking in the 1970s, two decades later than their richer neighbours, and the health improvements seen by this change take about 30 years to materialise./  ""If we don't start seeing changes as a result of this, then there are other factors at play,"" said Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at Sheffield University./  Dorling says that one of such factors is that the rich can effectively buy longer lives through more regular holidays and leisure activities./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
People get exposed to air pollutants the most while driving," Washington, Oct. 31 -- A new study by researchers from the University of southern California (USC) has revealed that people get exposed to harmful air pollutants the most while travelling in their vehicles./  In a study in Los Angeles, the scientists found that the average driver spent about six percent (1.5 hours) of his or her day on the road, and this period accounted for almost 33 to 45 percent of the total exposure to diesel and ultrafine particles (UFP). /  ""If you have otherwise healthy habits and don't smoke, driving to work is probably the most unhealthy part of your day. Urban dwellers with long commutes are probably getting most of their UFP exposure while driving,"" said Scott Fruin, D.Env, assistant professor of environmental health at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. /  He said high air exchange rates as a result of vehicular movement made roadways a major source of exposure. /  Ultrafine particles were of particular concern, as unlike larger particles, they could penetrate cell walls and disperse throughout the body, Prof. Fruin said. /  He said while particulate matter has been previously linked to cardiovascular disease, the ultrafine fraction on roadways appeared to be more toxic than larger sizes./  As part of the study, Prof. Fruin and his team measured exposure by outfitting an electric vehicle with nine, fast-response air pollution instruments. A video recorded surrounding traffic and driving conditions on freeways and arterial roads throughout the Los Angeles region. /  Measurements were collected during a three-month period from February to April 2003, and four typical days were selected for a second-by-second video and statistical analysis./  Prof. Fruin said the results showed that the two main sources of pollution were diesel-fuelled trucks on freeways and hard accelerations on surface streets. /  Surprisingly, overall congestion was only a factor on arterial roads and, even then, the highest concentrations of pollutants occurred only when vehicles were accelerating from a stop, he said./  ""This study was the first to look at the effect of driving and traffic conditions at this level of detail and to demonstrate the specific factors leading to the highest pollutant exposures for drivers. The extent that a specific type of vehicle - diesel trucks - dominated the highest concentration conditions on freeways was unexpected,"" Prof. Fruin said. /  He said though driving with the windows closed and re-circulating air settings modestly reduced the particle pollution exposure, it did not significantly reduce most gaseous pollutants. /  He said driving at speeds lower than 20 miles-per-hour could reduce exposure, but none of these measures were as effective as simply cutting back on driving time. /  ""Shortening your commute and spending less time in the car will significantly reduce your total body burden of harmful pollutants,"" Prof. Fruin said./  The study appears in this month's issue of the journal Atmospheric Environment./  Published by HT Media Ltd. with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Get ready for a smoggy Diwali," NEW DELHI, India, Nov. 6 -- THE CAPITAL will suffer one of the worst attacks of smog, dust haze and air polluting gases in recent years this Diwali and in the subsequent winter months, a new study said on Tuesday./  More and more people could be affected by asthma and lung-related diseases, the study warned. After going through air-pollution monitoring data of the Central Pollution Control Board, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has predicted that Delhi's ""clean air advantage"" due to public transport running on green fuel Compressed Natural gas (CNG) was about to be lost because of a rising number of diesel vehicles in the city./  ""The main reason for this alarming rise in air pollution is that the number of personal cars in the city have risen significantly,"" said Sunita Narain, director of the NGO. In 2000-01, around 580 vehicles were added to Delhi's fleet every day. That figure has now touched almost a thousand. ""The point to note is a significant increase in the number of diesel car-registrations every year,"" she said./  CSE has suggested that all cars - especially the diesel vehicles - be taxed, even those that were parked in public places in an apparent effort to encourage the use of public transport. The study said that the diesel car market share had increased to an unprecedented 30 per cent in the last 18 months./  ""Manufacturers estimate that it will be 50 per cent by 2015,"" Narain said. Diesel vehicles emit more harmful gases and particles that were suspended in the air compared to petrol cars, it added. Assessing yearly data, CSE has established a correlation between the rise of personal vehicles and the rising level of the harmful air-polluting nitrogen oxide in the city in the last nine years./  Respirable suspended particles (RSPM) in the air have increased phenomenally. ""After the introduction of CNG, annual average levels of RSPM in residential areas dropped to 115 microgrammes per cubic meter. It started rising since again last year. And in the last few months it reached 136 microgrammes per cubic meter, which is almost as high as what it was prior to the introduction of CNG,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director, CSE./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Diesel exhaust linked to higher heart attack, stroke risk in men"," Washington, Nov. 7 -- Increased amount of roadway pollution is leading to a cascade of conditions that might result in heart attack or stroke in men, says a new study./  The study, led by Andrew Lucking, M.D., a cardiology fellow at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, found that diesel exhaust increased clot formation and blood platelet activity in healthy volunteers, which could lead to heart attack and stroke. /  ""The study results are closely tied with previous observational and epidemiological studies showing that shortly after exposure to traffic air pollution, individuals are more likely to suffer a heart attack,"" Lucking said. /  ""This study shows that when a person is exposed to relatively high levels of diesel exhaust for a short time, the blood is more likely to clot. This could lead to a blocked vessel resulting in heart attack or stroke,"" he said./  In the double blind, randomised, crossover study 20 healthy men, in the age group of 21 to 44 years old were examined./  The participants were separately exposed to filtered air (serving as a control) and to diluted diesel exhaust at 300 micrograms per meter cubed (mcg/m3), a level comparable to curb side exposure on a busy street. /  For the study, the researchers performed the exposures in a specially built diesel exposure chamber./   At two hours and at six hours after exposure, researchers allowed a small amount of participants' blood to flow through a perfusion chamber. They measured clot formation, coagulation, platelet activation and inflammatory markers after each exposure. /  In order to measure clot formation, researchers used low and high shear rates, recreating flow conditions inside the body's blood vessels. /  Compared to filtered air, breathing air with diluted diesel exhaust increased clot formation in the low shear chamber by 24.2 percent and the high shear chamber by 19.1 percent. This was seen at both two and six hours after diesel exposure. /  The analysis also found an increase in platelet activation, assessed by measuring the number of platelets associated with white blood cells. /  Lucking said that platelets play a central role in blood clotting, and when they are activated, they associate with white blood cells such as neutrophils and monocytes./  Diluted diesel exhaust inhalation increased platelet-neutrophil aggregates from 6.5 percent to 9.2 percent and platelet-monocyte aggregates from 21 percent to 25 percent at two hours after exposure. /  At six hours, a trend toward platelet activation was found, but it was not statistically significant. /  ""After exposure to diesel exhaust, the participants had increased levels of activated platelets that became attached to white blood cells. When activated, the platelets can stick together and form a clot./  ""High levels of traffic pollution are known to increase the risk of heart attack in the immediate hours or days after exposure. These findings provide a potential mechanism that could link exposure to traffic-derived air pollution with acute heart attack,"" Lucking said./  ""Diesel engines are becoming very popular because of increased fuel economy. /  ""While diesel engines burn more efficiently, they also put more fine particulate matter into the air,"" Lucking said. /  Lucking encouraged physical activity but suggested that people with existing cardiovascular disease should try to exercise away from traffic congestion./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Let's pull off a clean Diwali again," NEW DELHI, India, Nov. 8 -- Can Delhiites make Diwali a less harmful affair for the environment this year as well? Last year, data from the Central Pollution Control Board and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had shown that air pollution on Diwali was at a three-year low./  Noise levels, too, had witnessed a drop by several decibels. This year, smog, which is a haze of air pollutants, has started appearing much before the usual time. The Centre for Science and Environment has issued warning that this year could see one of the smoggiest Diwalis and winters thanks to rising vehicular pollution./  On Friday, expect a light veil of fog in the morning. ""It will be misty and going by this year's trend, it will be smoggy in the morning,"" said the duty officer at the Safdarjung Met office. However, according to an IMD official, Diwali sees a drop in visibility at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. An airport official said, ""Usually, smog starts setting in after 7.30 pm when cracker bursting intensifies. By late night, the visibility at the airport drops substantially. This remains till the next morning, unless strong winds blow the smog away,"" he said./  ""This year, however, the condition might deteriorate because visibility is already low due to a dust haze in the airport area. The haze is caused by the construction work going on for the new terminal,"" said an air traffic controller./  According to CPCB findings, noisy crackers and fireworks both emit harmful gases. However, there was slight reprieve in the form of rain on Thursday. ""The spells of drizzles will help the dust to settle down thereby clearing the air a bit,"" said BP Yadav, director at the India Meteorological Department. Like every year, the government and the apex pollution board have urged people to celebrate with lights and not with crackers. Can we do better than last year?/  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Asthma Alert," NEW DELHI, India, Nov. 10 -- Paediatrician Dr Subhash Arya's prescription for his patients with severe asthma is simple: get out of Delhi around Diwali. ""Diwali is the worst time to be in the Capital for people with asthma, so I advise some of my patients to get out of the city. It doesn't have to be a trip to the mountains, any small town or even a weekend at Neemrana lowers their risk of an attack,"" says Dr Arya, who heads the Centre for Child Health at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital./  Not surprisingly, many of them do, but asthmatics are not the only ones at risk. One in seven people have asthma in Delhi, but the smog causes respiratory attacks and wheezing in some non-asthmatics who are old, who smoke, have respiratory infections or chronic bronchitis. ""The cold combined with chest infections worsens symptoms of breathlessness and can cause respiratory problems even in people who do not have chronic asthma,"" says Dr J. N. Pande, former head of the Department for medicine, AIIMS, and currently with the Sitaram Bhartia Institute./  About 20 per cent people in Delhi get acute respiratory attacks at least once in winter when air pollution combines with cold weather to become a deadly trigger, found a WHO-sponsored study on breathing disorders. Asthmatics are at most risk, with hospitalisation because of acute attacks doubling November to January./  Nearly 1,000 new cars a day are added to the existing 4 million registered in the city, which create a haze over the Capital. This smog peaks around Diwali, when the millions of lighted candles and crackers and add to air pollution. Rising diesel emissions in Delhi are a major cause of the problem, as diesel fumes - a mix of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury - contain up to 100 times more particles (suspended particulates) than petrol exhaust. Diesel can cause asthma attacks much after the initial allergen contact, at times prompting an attack hours after exposure to pollution, reports the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology./  ""Air pollutants such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulates compound the impact of inhaled allergens in asthmatics and increase airway inflammation, causing acute attacks,"" says Dr Anupam Sibal, consultant paediatrician and head of hospital services, Apollo Hospital./  There are 20 million severe asthmatics in India who need regular anti-inflammatory drugs to control airway inflammation. About 10-15 per cent in 5-11 year old children have the disorder, though almost half outgrow it by their teens. ""Even viral fever can lead to severe wheezing or an asthma attack in children who don't have diagnosed asthma. This happens because children have small airways and an infection may cause them to get inflamed, making breathing difficult,"" says Dr Arya. Chronic coughs may mean allergic bronchitis with or without asthma, so parents should get the condition diagnoses./  Attacks can be relieved with salbutamol inhalers (short-acting beta 2-agonists) that dilate airways. A combination of the inhaled steroid fluticasone propionate and the long-acting beta 2-agonist salmeterol is effective in controlling asthma./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"New guidelines to prevent, avoid asthma attacks listed"," Washington, Nov. 12 -- Asthma patients can avoid serious symptoms and disability if they follow the latest guidelines to keep their disease under control./  The guidelines, from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)./  The main highlights of the 2007 asthma guidelines were presented during the Annual Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in an attempt not only to increase awareness of the new recommendations, but also to help make sure they get put into practice. /  ""Asthma is not an event, it is a chronic disease that can be managed so that symptoms are controlled and severe attacks are prevented. The guidelines underscore the fact that people who are diagnosed with asthma do not have to suffer breathing difficulties or cut back on their activities. We want to make this a reality for all asthma patients,"" said Michael B. Foggs, M.D chief of asthma, allergy and immunology, Advocate Health Care, Chicago./  According to the NAEPP report, under-diagnosis and inadequate treatment are significant contributors to poor asthma control and the worsening of asthma severity. /  The new guidelines are the first major update in a decade; include the latest information on the best way to manage the chronic disease. /  Highlights of the guidelines include emphasis on ongoing monitoring and management of asthma, routine use of inhaled corticosteroids as the standard of care for most patients with chronic persistent asthma, distinguishing between managing acute and chronic asthma, and the identification of new risk factors for the disease. /  Dr. Foggs said that the guidelines put a new emphasis on the physician-patient partnership and ongoing monitoring and management. Specific recommendations include: /  All asthma patients should be monitored by a doctor every one to six months, regardless of how severe their condition is and whether they are experiencing symptoms. /  Each patient should have a written asthma action plan with instructions for daily treatment and what to do if symptoms become worse. The action plan should be developed by a doctor or nurse, with input from the patient, and shared with all those who interact with the patient such as family members, teachers and coaches./  Education that takes into account cultural background and literacy should be part of asthma care, and patients should play an active role in managing their condition./  Asthma treatment based on severity is classified in six steps, rather than four in previous guidelines. A stepwise approach to treatment is still recommended, with medication stepped up or increased when asthma symptoms increase and stepped down, if possible, when asthma is under control./  ""When patients and physicians work together to follow these guidelines, asthma symptoms can be prevented and patients can participate in all activities, and not miss days of work or school because of asthma. No one should expect anything less,"" Dr. Foggs said./  Anti-inflammatory medications should be routinely prescribed for long-term control of chronic persistent asthma. /  ""Low to medium dose inhaled corticosteroids are very safe, and remain the first line of treatment for preventing asthma symptoms. Unfortunately, they are not prescribed as often as they should be,"" said H. William Kelly, PharmD, professor emeritus, department of pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences, Albuquerque./  ""Some people confuse these safe medications with the risky anabolic steroids used by some athletes to improve performance. When used appropriately, corticosteroids are safe and effective in controlling asthma,"" Dr. Kelly said. /  Kids between the age group of 5 to 11 have been singled out as a separate category, based on research suggesting they may respond somewhat differently to medications than adults. /  For many kids in this age group, disease control usually can be maintained with a low daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than combination treatments, such as long acting beta agonists, needed by many adults. Other age groups in the new guidelines are children up to 4 years old and ages 12 to adult./  The guidelines insist that patients must take their controller medications even when they do not have symptoms, and should be taught how to use inhalers properly so the medication reaches their lungs./  According to Carlos Camargo, M.D., DrPH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, the guidelines also emphasize the distinction between acute and chronic asthma management. /  ""The new guidelines modify the spirometry cut points used to assign the severity of an asthma exacerbation, or flare-up,"" Dr. Camargo said. /  Spirometry is a test that measures lung function. /  ""The guidelines also encourage increased use of 'quick relief' medications such as albuterol and oral corticosteroids in the pre-hospital setting, and consideration of adjunctive treatments in severe exacerbations. The guidelines also recommend that emergency physicians and other acute care providers consider prescribing inhaled corticosteroids before patients are discharged from the hospital,"" he said./   ""According to one study, exposure to new surface materials such as linoleum flooring, synthetic carpeting, particle board, wall coverings and furniture, and recent painting significantly increased the risk of asthma in children,"" Dr. Nelson said. /  Other risk factors identified in the past include allergy to pollen, molds, animal danders and house dust mites, some occupational exposures, and exposure to tobacco smoke and to certain types of air pollution./  The guidelines insist the importance of specialty care when early treatment by primary care physicians is not sufficient to control asthma symptoms. For example, referral to a specialist is recommended for most patients who have tried the first three steps for asthma treatment, and have not improved. It also should be considered for those who have completed the first two treatment levels without improvement. /  Patients who have had a life-threatening asthma attack and those whose disease is not well-controlled after three to six months of therapy also should be referred to a specialist./  The guidelines also recommend that immunotherapy - or allergy vaccinations - be considered for patients with persistent allergic asthma. /  ACAAI is developing materials for patients and health care professionals about the new guidelines and asthma treatment./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
World Bank: Air pollution costs 3.8 percent of China's GDP," New Delhi, Nov. 20 -- Air pollution is costing China 3.8 percent of its gross domestic product, causing more diseases and claiming more lives, the World Bank has warned./  While it has put the combined health and non-health cost of outdoor air and water pollution for China's economy at around 100 billion dollars a year, or about 5.8 percent of the country's GDP, David Dollar, the World Bank country director for China and Mongolia, said air pollution poses higher costs than water pollution./  Air pollution, especially in large cities, is leading to higher incidence of lung diseases, including cancer, respiratory system problems, and therefore, higher levels of work and school absenteeism, Dollar said, quoting a World Bank report issued following a joint assessment with China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), Xinhua reported. /  He pointed to particulate matter, which measures less than 10 microns in diameter, as a major threat to health./  The density of particulate matter in north China averages 112 microgrammes and that in the south, 88 microgrammes, he said at a forum on China's investment environment in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province./  Particulate matter has also been a headache in Beijing, with density averaging 141 microgrammes./  As part of the joint study, the World Bank and SEPA also conducted a survey in the southwestern Chongqing Municipality, one of the worst polluted Chinese regions, and the commercial center Shanghai, and found many citizens are willing to pay for reduced health risks associated with environmental pollution./  Dollar said it would be a cost-effective move to reduce air pollution by moving manufacturing plants out of city centres, replacing coal-burning stoves with liquefied gas-fuelled heating systems, increasing state investment in public transport and limiting use of private cars./  Despite the pollution challenges, the World Bank affirmed China's commitment to address the problem. /  China has put environment protection as its highest priority in its 11th Five Year Plan and called for a ""resource saving society""./  China is set to improve its energy efficiency by cutting energy consumption by 20 percent per unit of GDP, along with a 10 percent cut in major pollutants, between 2006 and 2010./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
SC seeks Centre's reply on diesel pollution report," NEW DELHI, India, Nov. 20 -- The Supreme Court has sought the Centre's reply on a report by the Environment Protection Control Authority, terming Delhi's air pollution as critical because of the rise of diesel vehicles on the road. The authority recommended a ban on registration of diesel vehicles for personal use./  ""This restriction should also be applied to vehicles enter-ing the city from neighbouring states as otherwise, the influx of these vehicles into the city will continue to grow and will negate the gains of pollution control measures,"" the report said. The court, which issued the notice last Friday, has given the Centre four weeks to reply. The pollution report correlated increase in respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and Nitrogen Oxide (NOX) levels with higher registration of diesel vehicles in Delhi./  The number of diesel cars has increased by nearly 425 per cent over the last decade, but fell after the introduction of CNG, the report said. Every day 963 new vehicles ply Delhi's roads, of which 308 are diesel-run. While registration of petrol cars has increased at the annual rate of 8.5 per cent, diesel vehicle registrations have gone up by 16.6 per cent. Quoting information from the Society of Automobile Association of India, the report said, the market share of diesel cars has increased to over 30 per cent in the last 18 months and is expected to be 50 per cent by 2010, when Delhi hosts the Commonwealth Games./  These additional vehicles, the report said, would release particulate matter equal to 30,000 diesel buses. This month, the respirable suspended particulate matter level touched 240 microgram per cubic metre, which is higher than the level in 2002 when CNG was introduced. ""Diesel vehicles in 2004 contributed 23 per cent to RSPM levels,"" the report said. The report also said the emission from diesel vehicles is more toxic than petrol vehicles and cited various studies to substantiate this./  The report also said that diesel cars meeting the Bharat Stage III emission standards are allowed to emit three times more NOX and RSPM than the petrol cars. ""Petrol cars emit negligible particulate matter while every diesel car is allowed to emit 0.05 gram per kilometre under the Bharat Stage III norms,"" the report said. But in Europe the NOX and RSPM standards for petrol and diesel vehicles are similar, the report said./  Pointing out that Pollution Under Control System, measuring the polluting level of diesel vehicles, has not worked the report said that the standards for the smoke density test for a PUC certificate was quite low. Hence, of the 50 diesel vehicles checked, none failed the test. ""Worldwide the smoke density test has failed. Countries like Australia have adopted better technologies,"" the report said. EPCA also found out in June 2006 that some PUC centres were fudging their certificates, which it said, were issued without even starting the engine of the vehicles or sometimes by tinkering with the machines. Putting forth the point about the report, amicus curiae Harish Salve said the time has come to take corrective measures or the gains of introduction of CNG would be lost./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
"Ozone may be key linking heat, increased heart disease death risk"," Washington, Nov. 22 -- A new study suggests that ozone might prove to be the key to the link between high temperature and the increased risk of death from heart disease or stroke./  Ozone is chemical pollutant that is strongly tied to weather conditions, particularly the amount of ultraviolet light in the atmosphere./  It is generated by a reaction between nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and oxygen in sunlight./  The study was based on a population of almost 100 million people in 95 different geographical areas during the summer months of June to September./  The participants were already taking part in National Mortality and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS), which looked at health and weather pollution between 1987 and 2000./  At this time, 4 million heart attacks or strokes occurred. When the authors compared deaths on daily basis against fluctuations in temperature during one day, they found that ozone was a common link./  The results showed that the higher the ozone level, the higher was the risk of cardiovascular death attributable to high temperatures./  Ozone levels ranged from a daily average of 36.74 parts per billion to 142.85 ppb, while average daily temperatures ranged from 20 to around 42 degrees Centigrade./  A 10 degree temperature increase on the same day was associated with a rise in heart disease or stroke deaths of just over 1percent at the lowest ozone level and by more than 8 percent for the highest levels./  The researchers said that a link between temperature and ozone in driving up cardiovascular mortality was plausible./  They suggested that exposure to ozone might affect the airways and the autonomic nervous system, so making people more susceptible to the effects of fluctuations in temperature./  Scientists said that public health warnings during hot weather ought to include information on ozone levels, when these are high. Rising temperatures and the impact of ozone are likely to become increasingly important as the world heats up as a result of global warming./  The study is published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine./  Published by HT Syndication with permission from Asian News International./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Pollution stoops to new low," NEW DELHI, India, Nov. 22 -- PREPARE FOR an assault on your lungs and heart this winter, as toxic pollutants in the city's air are much closer to you than they were last year./  During winters, air pollutants usually accumulate in the atmosphere at a lower level due to lower temperatures and slower wind speeds. However, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) warns that their height was more than 30 per cent lower than it was last year. Major air pollutants such as respirable suspended particulate matters (RSPM) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) have been found at a higher level compared to the same period last year./  The CPCB blames the lowering of the ""mixing height"", or the inversion height in the atmosphere. ""As a result, those suffering from cardio-pulmonary diseases like asthma and bronchitis would need to be very careful,"" said S.D. Makhijani, director, CPCB. During all of October, for instance, the average mixing height during daytime decreased 31 per cent, while during the night it fell by 26 per cent. In certain cases, pollutants even descended by as much as 50 per cent lower than what was observed last year./  ""The meteorological conditions make this happen every year. This year has been lower owing to a several variables like lower wind speed, lower temperature, among others,"" he added. As an indicator, all air-pollution monitoring units of CPCB in the Capital have been registering a rise in the level of pollutants./  According to Dr Randeep Guleria of AIIMS, this rise will lead to increased cases of asthma attacks./  ""There has already been an increase. Studies of similar conditions in London in the past showed manifold increase in pulmonary and cardiac illness because harmful particles linger longer at ground levels,"" he said. There are other concerns too. ""Exposure to NOx is not good news. Since it is odourless, people are not aware of any assault by this toxic gas. They become silent victims,"" said Dr T.K. Joshi, head of Centre for Environment and Occupational Health./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
Errors of emission," NEW DELHI, India, Dec. 9 -- Like platform heels or skinny jeans, every age has a fashionable cause. For the past two decades, HIV/Aids wore that mantle, with every two-bit celebrity speaking for it, every word on it making headlines. Now, with Unaids announcing that HIV/Aids figures are stabilising, climate change and global warming is, well, hot: the flavour of the season./  The dangers of climate change and global warming are not new. Back in 1992, this was the basis of the Earth Summit in Rio, and the UN Framework on Climate Change, the first international treaty where countries agreed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The Kyoto Protocol, which first set mandatory targets for industrialised nations to reduce emissions of GHGs that are considered responsible for global warming, was adopted in 1997, though, tellingly, ratified only in 2005, and without two key countries, the United States and Australia./  Today, few can doubt that the world is getting warmer or that humans are responsible. We believe it not only because of the cogency of the reports of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but because we can feel the impact: heat waves and floods, the Katrinas and the Sidrs. With 'carbon footprint' a part of popular vocabulary, Bali, where the 13th UN Conference of Parties is being held this fortnight, promises to be a crowded place. Finally, we all agree the Earth is heading for environmental apocalypse if we continue with business as usual. So what's being done? Frankly, very little except talk./  According to IPCC, if the annual emission of GHGs remains at today's levels, by 2050 it will be 550 parts per million (ppm). This means a potentially catastrophic mean global temperature increase of 5? Celcius. That would imply seas rising and submerging half of Bangladesh. Glaciers would melt, leading first to floods and then droughts as rivers run dry. There would be more dengue, more malaria, more diarrhoea. And South-east Asia and Africa would be vulnerable. Limiting emission levels to 480 ppm by 2050 would mean a temperature increase of 2? Celcius - still dangerous, but feasible. That would, however, require a global emissions cut of 50-80 per cent over 1990 levels. That's neat mathematics, can it be done?/ The UNDP's Human Development Report 2007/2008 argues for a multilateral framework that combines a long-term goal of 50 per cent reduction on 1990 levels by 2050 with medium-term benchmarks. Consider though that the Kyoto Protocol asked developed countries to commit to only 7 per cent reduction in emissions at 1990 levels by 2012. In reality, between 1990 and 2005, rich country emissions went up by 11 per cent./  That's almost inevitable, as the world has nothing to replace the fossil fuels that power its economies. As one government insider put it, ""If, for example, we put solar panels across several hundred kilometres of the Rajasthan desert, we would probably have enough energy to meet our needs. but it is currently not cost-effective."" Making it cost-effective, then, is the technology challenge. A lot is being said about who should cut emissions and by how much, there is not enough focus on how to do it./  India has stressed the issue of equity. To the argument that growing economies like India should also have emissions targets, its answer is that it cannot afford to do so and still tackle poverty. Indeed, India's carbon report is not bad so far - per capita carbon emission is approximately one tonne per annum, compared to a world average of four tonnes. In June, at the G-7 meet, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised India's per capita GHG emissions would not exceed those of developed countries. A similar case was argued at the Asean meet in November./  Diplomatic energies are being used to ensure targets are not imposed on India. An admittedly clever coinage is that China is a 'developed developing' country and India only a 'developing developing' country and so India need not be expected to do even what China does. But beyond words, what is our stand? While energy efficiency policies have been put in place, such as the labelling programme for appliances, a long-range plan of clear-cut, achievable goals is missing. A draft Strategic Action Plan has reportedly led to so many disagreements among ministries that it has to be reworked. For a country likely to be one of the worst affected by climate change, this is quite amazing./  Developed countries have got to where they are by the cheap and dirty industrial path, followed by clean-up acts later. This is a model India simply cannot afford. It has to think differently and leapfrog to and invest much more in clean technology. It has been estimated that to maintain the current 8-9 per cent rate of GDP growth, our energy needs will increase by 4 per cent per annum. At present, India is the world's fourth largest energy consumer. More than half its needs are met by coal, and about 30 per cent by oil. Less than a third is met by renewable energy, mainly hydropower. 'New' renewable energy plays a minuscule role./  In all the hype, it is important not to delink climate change from the larger issue of environmental pollution. The GHGs are also part of toxic air pollutants that lead to diseases ranging from asthma to cancer. According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution is among the top 10 causes of death and disability worldwide. Quite apart from climate change, the health cost of pollution would be phenomenal./  Introduced in March 2007, mandatory energy audits for large industries are a good idea. But to be effective, India's 4.5 million small and medium industrial units also have to be brought into the fold. These units contribute 70 per cent of India's industrial pollution, largely due to obsolete technology, while being responsible for 40 per cent of industrial production. Yet, they are a major source of employment, and, therefore, political influence./  Even if we could implement our current environmental norms it would help. But India's agencies are grossly understaffed. According to a World Bank report, the Central Pollution Control Board has around 500 employees. The China Environment Protection Agency has 1,647 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has 18,000 nationwide. At India's state pollution control boards, a quarter of sanctioned posts are vacant. Either we act quickly, or prepare to join the dinosaurs. Alternatively, find another planet.

200 hospitals issued notice for medical waste pollution," NEW DELHI, India, Dec. 18 -- The pollution control board, Aligarh issued notice to 200 hospitals and nursing homes for disregarding bio-medical management rules./  This comes after a Supreme Court directive and a high level meeting to assess the situation arising out of non-implementation of bio-medical waste management and handling rules, 1995 by hospitals and nursing homes across the district./  City hospitals including government civil hospitals like J.N. Medical College of AMU and nursing homes are piling up wastes indiscriminately although the rules are binding on all hospitals and nursing homes including government hospitals and medical college./  According to heath department record, about 370 government hospitals and nursing homes, besides 300 jarrahs (unauthorised surgeon) and hundreds of quacks are engaged in such activities in the densely populated areas here./  These medical establishments generate about 1,500 kg waste daily and Aligarh city has no incinerator. Although J.N. Medical College has an incinerator, it is not enough. As a result, medical wastes including contaminated syringes, body fluids, blood and pus-stained cotton, bandages, fracture plasters and human organs strewn on the streets and block lanes of hospitals and nursing homes are a common sight in the city. These get mixed with domestic wastes and turn into a big dump./  Dr. Anil Kumar Kaushik, scientist and in-charge of district pollution control board, Aligarh, said, ""The dumps cause air pollution and spread diseases like leptospira, hepatitis B and other skin infections and asthma. So every hospital should follow the management and handling rules and every hospital is bound to follow this rule.""/  Dr. B.D. Singh, an environmental scientist, said Aligarh hospitals have failed to comply with the government's directives due to apathy of the officials of Nagar Nigam and District Administration and health department. Nagar Nigam should established central incinerator for the bio-medical wastes in Aligarh, he added./  Surprisingly, even the Nagar Nigam and District Administration are taking no cognisance of flouting of rules, which were promulgated to curb hazardous practice./  The Hindustan Times is provided through HT Syndication, New Delhi./For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at /<a href=""mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com"">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</a>"
