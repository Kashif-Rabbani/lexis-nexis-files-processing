Javadekar's remark on share of stubble burning in air pollution triggers twitter war with Kejriwal,"New Delhi: Stubble burning continues to deteriorate air quality in the Capital but it contributed only 4% of it this week while remaining 96% of the pollutants came from local sources like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, construction and demolition activities, said Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar while setting off 50 Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) ground monitoring teams to different cities in the Delhi-NCR on Thursday. Javadekar's remarks of only 4% contribution of stubble burning, however, trigged strong reaction from the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who later tweeted, ""Staying in denial will not help. If stubble burning causes only 4% pollution, then why has pollution suddenly increased last fortnight? Air was clean before that. /Same story every yr. There's no massive jump in any local source of pollution in last few days to cause this spike?""In his subsequent tweet, the chief minister appealed not to indulge in blame game and politics over the issue. ""Lets accept that stubble burning causes huge pollution every yr in North India during this time. And lets all together find a soln sincerely. Blame game and politics hasn't helped anyone. People r suffering. I am extremely worried that pollution will play havoc coupled with corona,"" tweeted Kejriwal on news report referring to Javadekar's remarks.Javadekar immediately sought to clarify his remark saying it was misinterpreted. ""Let me clarify, the figures of 4% share of stubble burning in AQI in Delhi, pertained to this week. It varies from 4% to 40% during peak stubble burning... At the same time let us not be in denial that there are several local factors - vehicular pollution, non-agricultural biomass burning, dust, geographical and metrological - that are primarily responsible for high air pollution during winters in Delhi,"" tweeted Javadekar while responding to Kejriwal on the micro-blogging site. The Union environment ministry in its tweet earlier said that the share of stubble burning in the overall air pollution changes every day. ""Last year between October 8 and December 9, the share of stubble burning in air pollution in Delhi (as per SAFAR data), was greater than 15% on six days, while on a single day it was greater than 40%,"" tweeted the ministry. The 50 CPCB ground teams, flagged off by Javadekar, will specifically focus on hotspots in the NCR cities - Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabgarh, Jhajjar, Panipat, Bhiwadi, Alwar and Bharatpur - and report gaps in implementation of various measures on the ground.Javadekar said strict action will be taken against the polluters on the basis of the feedback received from the CPCB teams and appealed Punjab government to take measures to stop stubble burning in the state as it did not affect people only in Delhi but also in states where stubbles were being burnt.Sharing his personal experience on effect of stubble burning, Javadekar said, ""I went to attend a programme in Ludhiana last year. On my way back, my throat choked due to the smoke from stubble burning even when I was in an air-conditioned car. It is harmful to everyone, including people living there. The Punjab government should ensure there is not much stubble burning this time.""Referring to roles of the CPCB teams which will continue to do the ground monitoring exercise till February 28next year, Javadekar said that during the current times of COVID the members of the team were no less than ""Corona Warriors"" as they will be visiting and giving feedback from the ground, which will help in mitigating air pollution.A central control room at CPCB headquarters has, meanwhile, been made functional for keeping track of pollution levels on an hour to hour basis and overall coordination with state agencies. In addition, district wise nodal officers have been appointed for better management and coordination with teams.""Feedback on polluting activities will be shared with concerned agencies through an automated system, for quick action. Details will also be shared with state governments. This will help in taking timely actions and monitoring at appropriate levels by the concerned agencies,"" said the ministry in a statement.

"Delhi air 'very poor', worst in 8 months","NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality hit the ""very poor"" category for the first time this season with the Air Quality Index on Thursday at 312. The last time Delhi had a worse air day was on February 12 when the AQI was at 320, the Central Pollution Control Board's daily bulletin stated.Although there was a haze in the morning, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's air pollution was just 6%. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a central government agency that monitors pollution, stated that the remaining 94% of PM2.5 concentration was likely from sources within the NCR./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Farm fires may play greater role with change in wind direction: Met deptBefore Thursday, the city's worst air quality was recorded on October 13, when the AQI touched 300 .SAFAR stated that 740 crop fires were recorded on Wednesday and, as the wind direction was favourable, the share of stubble burning in PM2.5 was expected to increase. ""Calm and variable surface wind condition is continuing and AQI is likely to stay in 'very poor' range on Friday. Marginal improvement is likely on October 17, but it will remain in the lower end of very poor to the higher end of poor categories,"" it said.Data showed that the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 was 1% on Wednesday and 3% on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. A change in wind direction is currently helping the capital as more farm fires have been recorded this year compared with the same time in 2019 and 2018.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's Regional Weather Forecasting Centre in Delhi, said haze was observed in the city, especially in the morning, due to stagnant winds at night. Similar conditions were expected to continue over the next few days. ""There is almost no air movement at night, which is not allowing pollutants to disperse freely. Winds pick up slightly only during the day. We estimate wind speed to range between 8-10 kmph over the next three days,"" he added.The met department said Delhi was currently experiencing easterly and southeasterly winds. ""This may switch to northwesterly winds, probably after four days. That will lead to a drop in temperature and possibly increase the impact of crop burning on PM2.5,"" said Srivastava.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB's air laboratory, said under the current conditions, there was locking and accumulation of pollutants at the gate of Indo-Gangetic plains.

Track the pollution level in your city,"Air quality in MP deteriorates, worse than pre-Covid levels","Bhopal: Air quality of Madhya Pradesh cities has deteriorated from what it was before the Covid lockdown began.The ambient air quality of Bhopal, Indore and Gwalior - as per the air quality monitoring of the central pollution control board - points to this trend. The air quality of Jabalpur is still better as compared to that before the first lockdown started in the country on March 25.In Bhopal, the air quality on Tuesday was worse than what it was on March 24. In Indore too air quality was bad when compared to March 24, and it was even worse in Gwalior.Ambient air quality between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while ambient air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, as per the pollution control board while ambient air quality between 101 and 200 is termed as moderate and may lead to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.Air quality of Bhopal on Tuesday was 129 while Indore was 153 and in Gwalior it was 164, which was the worst in four main cities of the state. Air quality remained satisfactory in Jabalpur with 77. Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. /While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM 2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data points that air quality of major Madhya Pradesh cities improved majorly in lockdown. Officials said the air pollution is going up after life getting back to normal and the pollution levels may further go up to the approaching festive season. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Another worry for Kol as air quality dips ahead of Puja,"Kolkata: Some leading doctors in the city have warned that the post-festival surge in infection and rapidly declining air quality will complicate the battle against Covid-19. Weak lungs - an outcome of constant breathing of toxic air - will lead to a difficult situation to fight the disease, said the doctors at a webinar to mark the beginning of Bengal Clean Air Network (Bengal CAN), a citizenship initiative against environmental degradation.Significantly, the alert came at a time when the city's air quality has started turning foul after nearly an eight-month long spell of good air. This is the time when the inversion of temperature prevents rise and dispersal of pollutants from the lower layers of the atmosphere as the warm air above and cooler air on the surface of the earth acts like a lid trapping the pollutants at the breathing height. Sanjukta Dutta, an emergency medicine expert, said, ""Lockdown has clearly shown the widespread benefit of clean air. /Patients of lung diseases like asthma and COPD are doing extremely well with lesser medication or no medication. Many are not requiring nebulisation or oxygen support that they had to use regularly. Many patients of hypertension are maintaining normal blood pressure with reduced medication. Hospitals in the city are receiving significantly fewer cases of heart attack and stroke."" Arup Haldar, a pulmonologist, said, ""The presence of oxidants in lungs aggravates the severity of infections. The oxidative stress actually accelerates the seriousness of a patient, making it a lost battle.""  Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) executive director, Anumita Roychowdhury, said the particulate pollution affects every cell and organ in the human body. Heart and lung diseases and several others like dementia, liver problems, brain, intelligence, abdominal organ failures, brittle bones and bladder cancer are caused due to particulate pollution. West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra said, ""The ambient air routinely gets toxic on Diwali night, which fails to recover fully, despite a series of measures. However, source apportionment study and pollutant specific remedial measures started yielding good results."" Suman Mallick, head of radiation oncology at a leading hospital said, ""The air pollution is one of the most important causes behind respiratory diseases and lung cancer. Thus, there is no room for debate whether worsening air quality will make the battle against Covid-19 far more difficult. The spike in cases post festival and worsening air quality will be a nightmarish combo.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution contributed to 6.7 million annual deaths globally in 2019, India faced 1.67 million deaths due to dirty air, says State of Global Air report","NEW DELHI: Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 6.7 million annual deaths globally, including 1.67 million in India, from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in 2019, says the annual 'State of Global Air 2020' report, released on Wednesday.""Overall, air pollution is now the fourth highest cause of death among all health risks, ranking just below smoking and poor diet,"" said the report, released by the Health Effects Institute (HEI), an independent, non-profit research institute funded jointly by the US Environmental Protection Agency, industry, foundations, and development banks.As far as India is concerned, air pollution, overall, is now the largest risk factor for death among all health risks in the country.The HEI, which for the first time did a comprehensive analysis of air pollution's global impact on new-borns, found that ""outdoor and household particulate matter (PM) pollution"" contributed to the deaths of nearly 5,00,000 infants globally, including 1,16,000 Infants in India, in their first month of life.The report noted that nearly two-thirds of those deaths were linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking, saying the most deaths for the youngest infants were related to complications from low birth weight and preterm birth.This report's findings, based on the most recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study published in the international medical journal The Lancet, comes as Covid-19 has claimed more than 1 million lives. /Although the full links between air pollution and Covid-19 are not yet known, the report claimed that there was clear evidence linking air pollution and increased heart and lung disease creating a growing concern that exposures to high levels of air pollution, especially those commonly experienced in countries of South and East Asia, could exacerbate the effects of Covid-19.""The interaction of Covid-19 with the continued global rise in chronic illness and related risk factors, including obesity, high blood sugar, and outdoor air pollution, over the past 30 years has created a perfect storm, fuelling Covid-19 deaths,"" said Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, who led the GBD research.In India, the study found progress in reducing ""household air pollution exposures"" but it said the levels were stagnant for outdoor PM2.5. It said more than half of these deaths in India were associated with outdoor PM2.5 and others were linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking.""This evidence is a stark reminder of unrelenting and continuous worsening of health risk from air pollution in India. Not only the absolute death burden from PM2.5 is high, but it has also increased the maximum - by as much as 61% between 2010 and 2019. This gets more complex with ozone related deaths also recording the highest jump of 84%,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, air pollution expert and executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Reacting to the findings, she said, ""Only 'chulha' pollution related health risk has declined due to improved access to clean energy. But the biggest shocker this time is the global evidence that air pollution accounts for 20% of new-born deaths worldwide, due to complications of low birth weight and preterm birth and mother's toxic exposure. Imagine its implication for India with one of the highest deaths and disease burdens from air pollution.

"'Pollution India's top risk factor for deaths', Air Pollution kills 1.2L infants in India in 2019","NEW DELHI: Long-term exposure to air pollution contributed to around 6.7 million deaths globally from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in 2019 with China (1.8 million) and India (1.6 million) together accounting for more than half of such deaths, says the annual 'State of Global Air 2020' report, released on Wednesday.While stating that air pollution is globally the fourth highest cause of death, the report says it is the largest risk factor for deaths for India, followed by high blood pressure. The report, however, notes the success of the 'Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG' programme, saying it helped dramatically expand access to clean energy, especially for rural households and helped reduce ""household air pollution exposure"". While the report identifies air pollution as the top risk factor for India, the Indian government has in the past rejected numerical estimates, saying that though studies have identified such pollution as a cause or contributory factor for ill-health, making projections or establishing direct linkages for deaths lacks sufficient evidence. The HEI, which for the first time did a comprehensive analysis of air pollution's global impact on the newborn, found that ""outdoor and household particulate matter pollution"" contributed to the deaths of nearly 5,00,000 infants globally, including 1,16,000 infants in India, in their first month of life.The report noted that nearly two-thirds of those deaths were linked to use of solid fuels like charcoal, wood and animal dung for cooking, saying the most deaths for the youngest infants were related to complications from low birth weight and pre-term birth. /Though it said India's National Clean Air Programme has spurred action on air pollution sources across India, it noted the levels were still stagnant for outdoor PM 2.5.

"For 2nd time this month, city air very poor","Gurgaon: Delhi-NCR on Friday woke up to yet another day of pollution, with the air quality index (AQI) in all three cities of Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad remaining in the unhealthy category of 'very poor'. While Delhi's AQI was recorded at 366, it was 369 in Noida, 381 in Greater Noida and 344 in Ghaziabad. Gurgaon fared only marginally better, with an AQI of 334. For Gurgaon, this is the second time after October 15 - it recorded an AQI of 312 that day - that the air has slipped into 'very poor' category. Before that, the city had seen moderate (between 100 and 200) or poor (201-300) air. AQI is monitored at four stations in Gurgaon - Vikas Sadan, Gwalpahari, Sector 51 and Teri Gram. /On Friday, the AQI at Sector 51 was 'severe' as PM2.5 crossed the 400 mark and PM10 shot up to 374. While the two stations at Vikas Sadan and Teri Gam recorded 'very poor' AQI, at 315 and 318, respectively, the Gwalpahari monitoring station recorded 'poor' AQI, at 295. An analysis of the four stations from the past six days reveals that Vikas Sadan and Sector 51 had the highest number of bad air days. In Sector 51, the PM2.5 and PM10 levels have shot up in the past 10 days. On October 18, the PM2.5 level was at 311 while PM10 was 309, which rose to 404 and 376, respectively, on Friday. In Gwalpahari, PM2.5, which was 210 on October 18, rose to 295 on Friday. The PM10 level also saw a similar trend, up from 175 on October 18 to 218 on Friday. The Teri Gram station on October 18 saw PM2.5 of 300 and PM10 of 153. On Friday, PM2.5 rose to 318 while PM10 was recorded at 180. At Vikash Sadan, PM2.5 was recorded at 274 on October 18, which rose to 315 on Friday. Officials of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) attributed the deterioration in air quality to construction activities, vehicular pollution, burning of garbage and farm fires in Gurgaon's neighbouring districts. ""We are conducting inspections daily at construction sites to check if they are following norms. We are also trying to ensure that people don't drive polluting vehicles. Dust from C&D waste is another major issue. We have asked the concerned department to take adequate steps to mitigate air pollution,"" said Shakti Singh, HSPCB regional officer, Gurgaon. Officials in Noida, meanwhile, blamed stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana for the rise in pollution levels. ""Active fire incidents have gone up by 18% in the two states. With Noida and Ghaziabad being in a downstream wind direction, we are obviously affected,"" Utsav Sharma, regional officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, said. In Delhi, the AQI at 366 was the worst recorded so far this winter season, and also since January 22, when it was 370. According to Central Pollution Control Board data, at least 10 air quality monitoring stations recorded readings in the 'severe' category, or over 400 on the AQI. With forecasting agencies saying wind speed would remain sluggish over the next 48 hours, the haze is likely to persist. Given the conditions, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority advised people to leave home only if absolutely necessary and to wear a mask at all times.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a forecasting agency, pegged the share of emissions from stubble burning in the pollutants in Delhi's air at 17% on Friday.

"Vizagites complain of breathing trouble; no unusual rise in air pollution, says PCB","Visakhapatnam: Be it 8am at Pandurangapuram or 11 am at Madillapalem or 7:30pm at Siripuram, residents of various parts of Vizag are complaining of breathing difficulties due to smog, haze and pollutants in the air for the last few days. But officials of the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) maintain that the board has not come across any unusual rise in pollution levels.According to a section of residents, air quality in the city seems to have worsened much before Diwali with people complaining of eye and throat irritation especially in early mornings and late evenings. The haze and smog are palpable even though there hasn't been any significant rise in traffic over the last week.""My eyes turned red and it was difficult to see in the morning due to the haze. /The air feels stuffy,"" said a resident of Pandurangapuram. ""While walking back from my office in Siripuram towards VUDA Complex late evening, I felt my eyes burn and experienced throat irritation,"" said another resident.Vijay Potnuru, a city-based businessman said, ""Going by the Brezzometer, the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 11am on Saturday states that the air is hazardous or extremely poor. It suggests that people stay indoors.""However, T Rajendra Reddy, zonal officer of APPCB in Vizag, said, ""We have not perceived anything unusual in the air quality or sudden increase of any particular pollutant as per our lab reports.""Dr Phanendra Ketha, a pulmonologist working with ESI Hospital, said, ""The phenomenon of land and sea breeze in some areas of Vizag plays a role in enhancement of pollutants. Possibly, industrial pollutants and emissions are carried in the air towards the sea.""""Most industries periodically release combustion products and waste gases. APPCB should take note of the concentration of pollutants. Meanwhile, the public should continue wearing masks and gargle with salt water if they step out as a safeguard,"" Dr Ketha added.

"As Annual Choke Ritual Begins, Rules Bite The Dust At Construction Sites","New Delhi: For three consecutive days, the capital's Air Quality Index (AQI) has been in the ""very poor"" category, but many construction sites still seem lax about undertaking dust control measures.A visit by TOI to major construction sites across the city showed that rules were being flouted with heaps of uncovered soil and debris remaining unattended. At a few sites, barriers and nets put unevenly had failed to prevent dust from blowing out.A source apportionment carried out by The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) and Automotive Research Association of India in 2018 revealed that dust (soil, road and construction) contributed 25% to PM10 and 17% to PM2.5 to Delhi's air pollution during winter.Though Delhi government has been running an anti-dust campaign to control pollution levels, measures are not being followed properly at many construction sites.A haze hung over Pragati Maidan and surrounding areas as the metal sheets at the construction site were unevenly installed with 10-inch gaps between them. A short distance away, the construction agency had put up barricades and nets at the periphery of another site, but mounds of dug-up soil were lying uncovered.Things were no different at Bhairon Marg. /Though the construction agency had put up metal sheets and green nets at the periphery of the site, dust was blowing from the excavated soil. The movement of vehicles was creating dust as the soil was not properly dampened. At Sunder Nagar, loose soil at the under-construction underpass was not properly covered.Dust control rules were also seen going for a toss at Barapullah Elevated Road Phase-III project from Sarai Kale Khan to Mayur Vihar Phase-I. Loose soil was piled up below the flyover, while the adjoining road was entirely covered with soil. When TOI visited the site near Mayur Vihar, it was found barricaded and water was being sprinkled, but the excavated soil was left uncovered.Measures to control dust include installing wind shields and barriers, covering debris and construction material with tarpaulin, using nets to prevent dust from blowing out, using sprinklers to settle dust, anti-smog guns at sites above 20,000 sqm, covering vehicles carrying construction material and washing their wheels regularly.Sumit Sharma, director, Teri earth science and climate change division, said, ""Dust control measures should be enforced at construction and demolition sites. Public vigilance plays an important role. If anyone spots rules being flouted, a complaint should be lodged with the agencies concerned.""A DPCC official said, ""We've been conducting random inspections and have imposed lakhs in fines on agencies flouting norms. We have a dedicated team to act on complaints received on our app and social media."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
The combined terror of pollution and COVID,"Amid fear and uncertainties, what the pandemic also brought along was clean blue sky and breathable air. However, with ease in lockdown rules, the air quality is back to being poor again. Air pollution is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, resulting in approximately 5 million deaths every year. Currently in Delhi, people are reporting breathing issues and children are facing throat problems due to contaminated air.Experts now warn that if necessary steps are not taken, poor air quality could make the spread and severity of COVID-19 far worse this winter. /Pune-based Dr. Sushrut Ganpule, Consultant- Chest Physician, Jupiter Hospital explains, ""It is highly likely that increased suspended particulate matters and rising wind speed could transport the virus faster and wider. Therefore, it is important to take these warnings seriously for states with huge concentrations of the virus and implement strict anti-pollution protocols, increase testing and overall strengthen the health care system for a potential surge in the number of cases during the winter months, especially in the northern plains."" People with heart problemsIt is known that tiny pollutants can lead to big heart health issues. In fact, almost 20% of deaths due to cardiovascular causes are attributed to air pollution. Dr Santosh Kumar Dora, Senior Cardiologist, Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai explains, ""For existing heart patients, air pollution can cause significant harm as their heart function is already compromised. In some heart patients, where the lungs are also congested, exposure to air pollution can rapidly deteriorate their health.""He advises people to take various measures to combat air pollution. They can ensure they do not live near factories or major roadways. They should be wearing face masks and installing air purifiers in homes. People with pre-existing respiratory issuesPeople with respiratory problems need to be extra careful amid COVID-19. Dr Davinder Kundra, consultant- Pulmonology, HCMCT Manipal Hospitals warns, ""Air pollution triggers respiratory problems and people suffering from such diseases have been put on a very high risk for COVID-19. Currently, the National Capital Region is witnessing bad quality of air due to various reasons including agricultural residue burning. If precautions are taken well in advance for winters, when air pollution would be on its peak, population health management would face a very tough task to cope up with pollution-triggered diseases and COVID-19. It would be a double whammy for the residents of Delhi.""The combined effects of air pollution cause a very large number of premature deaths every year due to weakened immune systems, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. Exposure to ambient air pollution can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma symptoms. Among respiratory diseases, asthma and COPD are the major concerns and that needs special attention. If infected by the virus, a patient's condition may deteriorate rapidly.The best mask for protectionTo safeguard ourselves from pollution and COVID-19, use of face masks is a must. Mask prevents the transmission of infection but also protects people from inhaling air pollutants to a larger extent. Older people need to stay inside during day time to protect themselves from air pollution. Presently due to COVID, the government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask while stepping out of their homes. The safest mask to filter out coronavirus is the N-95 mask. Coronavirus measure approximately 0.125 micron. So N-95 masks will be very useful to filter out the PM2.5 and PM 10 particles very effectively. Studies have shown triple layered surgical masks and multilayered cotton masks are also effective to prevent coronavirus spread. As the N-95 mask is costly, these masks are cheaper options. All these masks which protect us from COVID, also will be useful to protect us from PM 2.5 and PM 10 air pollutant particles. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Why farm fires continue to pollute our air,"The Supreme Court has suspended a one-man committee which was set up to oversee steps to tackle stubble burning after the Centre assured the apex court that it would create a permanent body to deal with annual air pollution problem in Delhi and its surrounding areas. Despite assurances, it remains to be seen how the situation will pan out. However, the situation on the ground appears grim.The rapid pace with which the leftover crop residue is being burnt in Punjab despite being provided a large number of machines under the crop residue management (CRM) is turning out to be a cause of concern for the state government. The claims of various district administrations of various village panchayats passing resolutions against stubble burning are falling flat. /Within a month when paddy stubble burning had started, the field fires have recorded almost threefold increase when compared with previous year. Even though the more harvesting of paddy in the fields is being cited as one of the reasons, according to agriculture department officials, the stubble burning events this year till now are much more even if the percentage of paddy harvesting is taken into account. A total of 12,985 stubble burning cases have been recorded till October 24 against 6,991 in 2019, 6,207 in 2018, and 12,074 in 2017.Under the central CRM scheme, Punjab government has till now provided 62,000 machines and has set up 17,000 custom hiring centres. The 50,815 machines (33,357 to CHCs and 17,458 to individual farmers) were provided at 80% subsidy and to individual farmers on 50% subsidy in last two years with subsidy of Rs. 480 crore. The government had the target to provide subsidy of Rs. 300 crore on 23,500 machines but so far nearly 11,000 machines have been purchased on subsidy by CHC, individually farmers from the manufacturers who are on the panel, said an official. The rentals (hiring charges) have been waived off for small and marginal farmers and these are being charged minimally from medium or big farmers for using machines from CHCs. Despite this the stubble burning is increasing and the small farmers say even though the rentals have been waived of but they have to hire tractor for which they have to pay Rs 1,000 per hour including the diesel and they are unable to bear this cost, said an official of the agriculture department. """"The machines provided without any rental of little use for us as we are unable to pay rent for tractor and the diesel which works out at over Rs 1,000 per hour. Under such circumstances we are failing to get benefit of CRM,"" said small farmer Jarnail Singh of a Bathinda village. Another farmer Mohinder Singh said we should be provided Rs 200 per quintal bonus or Rs 4,000 per acre, we will manage stubble. However, the EPCA has termed the cash incentive as perverse which should be avoided.According to the revised guidelines of crop residue management scheme 2020, issued by Union agriculture ministry, the burning of one tonne of paddy straw releases 3kg particulate matter, 60kg carbon monoxide, 1,460kg carbon dioxide, 199kg ash and 2kg sulphur dioxide. These gases affect human health due to general degradation in air quality resulting in aggravation of eye and skin diseases. The stubble burning shoots up the carbon dioxide levels in the air by 70%. The concentration of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide also rises by 7% and 2.1% respectively, triggering respiratory and heart problems. Small farmers cannot afford machine, despite subsidyHappy seeder costs Rs 1.50 lakh and requires a 65-horsepower tractor. Small farmers cannot afford to buy the machinery, even with a subsidy of 50% at current rates. Even though the central sector scheme (CSS) provides 80% subsidy to cooperative societies to rent out machines to farmers, most (cooperative societies) did not have funds to buy such machinery even on subsidy, says the study.There are also implementation issues. The unavailability of crop residue management machines has been a key issue in mitigating paddy stubble burning. In 2019, despite a sanction of 22,854 machines, only 14,625 were available for use. The in-situ management machines are still unaffordable to many farmers despite subsidy provisions.Picture credit:  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Beware, firecrackers can make your lungs weak amid Covid-19 pandemic","INDORE: Deterioration in air quality amidst the pandemic may pose severe health risks while emission from firecrackers in Diwali is likely to further worsen the air quality making people more susceptible to respiratory and lung infections.Experts and environmentalists expect Air Quality Index (AQI) to remain over 150 in November due to higher pollution levels. AQI between 0-50 indicates good air quality and levels above 100 means poor air. AQI remained mostly below 50 in July, August and September while in October, the index rose to over 100 for 14 days as on October 27 mainly due to vehicular emission.As air quality continues to deteriorate in October, firecrackers may cause severe damage to the air quality by releasing toxic gases due to presence of metal oxides, claimed experts.Environmentalist Gunwant Joshi said, ""Firecrackers have metallic components in the form of oxides to produce colours on burning. /All these metal salts and oxides release toxic gases that pollute the air quality. AQI may cross 150 by next month due to burning of fire crackers.""Firecrackers contain metal salts and metal oxides including sulphur, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, aluminum, zinc, lead and chromium which react to produce colours in the air upon burning.Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board is planning a random check on firecracker shops and factories to check emission and noise generated from them.Around 52 firecracker shops have been put up this year as on date with permission of district administration.Regional pollution control board chief chemist DR DK Wagela said, ""Air pollution levels were at record low levels between April to August as people were mostly confined to their houses but again we are heading towards poor air quality. Smoke from firecrackers will add a lot of particulate matters in atmosphere."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Not moving away from coal is killing 1 lakh a year in India,"India is increasingly powering itself on coal. About three-fourth of India's electricity is coal-based, its dependence on coal is growing faster than any other country in the world (6% a year) and coal extraction has doubled to 500 million tons since 1994. It's killing people.""The coal complex in India has significant health impacts - mainly through local air pollution - including premature mortality, ranging from 80,000 to 115,000 premature deaths per year,"" says the study, published in 'Ecological Economics' by Elsevier this month. Workers and people living around coal mines contract diseases by inhaling coal dust and drinking polluted water. Besides, mining accidents have also been taking thousands of lives: ""From 2001 to 2014, more than 7,000 accidents were reported across all coal mining companies in India. /In the three years between 2015 and 2017, more than 200 coal miners lost their lives in such accidents.""This is linked, the authors point out, to the fact that despite an increase in renewable sources of energy, India continues to depend on coal. ""Both hydroelectricity and nuclear are being promoted as sources of energy production in India, and both result in socio-ecological justice movements. What we argue in the article is that there is no transition but rather addition of the different energy sources, and coal continues to dominate the energy mix, despite the rhetoric of renewables and the climate crisis,"" lead author Brototi Roy, from the Universitat Autnoma de Barcelona, told TOI.So, while coal contributed to 23% of India's energy supply in 1970, its share is nearly 40% now. If all fossil fuels are taken into account, India is sourcing 70% of its energy from non-renewable sources. In fact, India accounts for 10% of the global energy supply from coal. But it's not that renewable resources are not being invested in. Data from the International Energy Agency show India's hydro, wind and solar power generation has gone up 60% since 1990. But the share of these energy sources has dropped from 14% then to 10% now. The logic, so far, has been that ""continued extraction of coal and expansion of the electricity system are necessary in order to meet the 'needs' of the population, especially those of India's poor, making coal 'a compulsion' rather than 'an option',"" the paper says. But, the paper adds, the primary consumer of Indian electricity is industry (40%) and not households (25%). The other justification has been development: ""The most visible justification ... is that coal supposedly allows for development, that is, for industrialization following the Western (and more recently Chinese) blueprint ... with mines and power plants and trickle-down effects into the economy generating the employment the country desperately needs; in sum, with coal improving the income and the lives of all Indians. This was, for example, the justification provided for the auction of 41 coal blocks for private companies to mine in June 2020.""But, again, the paper adds, ""Less than 1% of employment is in mining and electricity, gas, and water supply combined ... As coal output increases, average employment in coal mining either stagnates or even declines. This can be observed for the Indian average as well as for the three main coal-mining states (Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and Jharkhand)."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Kolkata air enters 'poor' zone again, docs sound Covid alarm","Kolkata: The city's air quality index breached the 200-mark - entering the 'poor' zone - on Wednesday for the first time since end-March, raising concerns about a spike in patients with respiratory distress amid the Covid situation.TOI, on Wednesday, had reported a study that suggested that long-term exposure to air pollution could be linked to as much as 15% Covid deaths globally. Doctors have cautioned that those with pre-existing lung diseases, asthma and heart ailments were particularly vulnerable to breathing distress as pollution levels rise during Kolkata's winter. Some have even warned that higher pollution could lead to a rise in Covid deaths. The pandemic-induced restrictions had caused pollution to drop sharply to the lowest since pollution levels began to be recorded. /Though the AQI had been going down gradually since Unlock began in June, it began to shoot up since Tuesday evening, with hourly AQI at some stations shooting past 300. At most places, however, it was around 200.With Kali Puja and Diwali round the corner - when the AQI plunges because of firecrackers - doctors are now extremely worried. ""There is no debate as to whether the degrading air quality would make the Covid-19 battle more difficult,"" felt Suman Mallick, head, radiation oncology, Narayana Superspeciality Hospital. ""The post-festival case spike and worsening air quality would be a nightmarish combination,"" he added. An AQI range of 101-200 signifies 'moderate' air quality, which can cause breathing distress to people with lung disease, asthma and heart disease. Once it breaches the 200-mark, the air quality becomes poor. Long exposure to such air can cause breathing distress to even healthy people. ""Rise in pollution is directly linked to a spurt in Covid transmission,"" said Raja Dhar, a pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital. ""So, it's a matter of concern that the AQI is climbing. The virus can easily stick on to particulate matter and infiltrate the lungs. So, the higher the pollution level, the greater would be the possibility of transmission. Over the last seven months, we have seen that people living in congested and polluted areas have tested positive more frequently.""Pulmonologist Arup Haldar, who is associated with several hospitals in the city, said: ""The presence of oxidants in the lungs aggravates the severity of infections. The oxidative stress actually accelerates the seriousness of the patient."" The higher pollution load leaves the lungs ailing, making them vulnerable to infections, said Arun Sharma, the director of community medicine at the University College Of Medical Sciences, Delhi, who has studied pollution patterns and effects in Kolkata.A study carried out in May by Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health suggested that even one microgram increase of PM2.5 (the main type of air pollutant in Kolkata) could increase mortality by 8%. A recent study, however, estimated that exposure to air pollution could increase Covid-19 deaths by as much as 15%. The study estimated that about 15% of deaths worldwide from Covid-19 could be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution. Significantly, it is the heart which suffers most and not the lung because of prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter like PM2.5. Ambient air pollution caused 4.2 million deaths due to stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory diseases, said Dr K Aggarwal, IMA-CMAAO, during a webinar on Covid and air pollution. Ajay Mittal of the organisation Calcutta Clean Air, which works on pollution-related issues, said: ""This is an unusual year, which warrants radical steps to contain air pollution. Since Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, we must have stricter protocols and awareness for Kali Puja and Diwali. It should not be confined to noise, but against air pollution caused by low-decibel fireworks, before the fireworks start invading the markets.""Pradeep Kakkar, founder-member of city-based People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC), said: ""The AQI plunged to 10 during the lockdown. How could we again let it shoot beyond 200?""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

This has been the worst day since lockdown started at the end of March. When the AQI gets to poor and very poor levels, it can cause respiratory illness and people should stay indoors or wear a pollution mask outdoors,"" Rahul Bedi, weather and air quality enthusiast, said.Bedi has been running a weather station in Whitefield, Bengaluru, and another in Kodagu district since 2013. Realtime particulate matter (2.5 microns) presence measured at Bedi's station in Bengaluru touched 229 microgram/cubic metre. Anything between 121 and 250 microgram/cubic metre is described as very poor level of pollution.AQI is a simplified number used to indicate what's the impact of a given pollutant on people's health.Air quality is found to come down rapidly during winter. Air quality within the radius of 10km from the surface of the earth, due to release of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), SOx and NOx, is different for summer and winter. The mixing height in winter is around 1,000 metre, lower compared to summer when it is over 1,700 m.Pratima Singh, research scientist, Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), Bengaluru, said: ""The smoke, haze and dust from other northern regions have travelled down to the southern peninsula, adding to the existing pollutant concentration. This will impact the ambient atmosphere in the region by increasing PM concentration levels.""Pratima said citizens must be careful and avoid catching cough or any other respiratory disease, considering the world is already battling a pandemic.

"Not counting Cov, Apr-Sept 2020 saw fewer deaths in city","Kolkata: The number of people dying in Kolkata between April and September this year is slightly higher than that recorded in the corresponding period last year, but Covid fatalities form a chunk of the toll. Kolkata Municipal Corporation data reveals that there were 1,250 less non-Covid deaths in the city in these six months as compared to the same period in 2019 and health experts believe staying indoors due to the Covid-induced lockdown helped save many lives. Overall, the city witnessed 31,710 deaths between April and September 2020, of which 1,710 deaths were due to Covid. /By comparison, the number of deaths over the same months last year was 31,250. According to KMC health department officials, several factors led to the decline in number of non-Covid deaths this year. Adviser to the KMC health department, T K Mukherjee, pointed out that staying home during the lockdown not only prevented accidental deaths but also saved lives by reducing ailments and hospital-acquired infections. ""After analysing data of previous years and this year we have reasons to believe that as a result of staying indoors, the mortality rate has reduced. People with minor ailments didn't dare visit hospitals and were thus saved from hospital-acquired infections,"" Mukherhee said.KMC health department adviser T K Mukherjee added that less air pollution due to non-plying of vehicles also ""gave relief to patients suffering from chronic diseases"". One remarkable achievement for the KMC health department is that it has recorded ""zero dengue death"" so far this year. Besides, the civic body's death registration unit has recorded a sharp drop in the number of fatalities due to road accidents during the lockdown months. ""The number of deaths due to road accidents has gone down by 60% over the same period last year,"" said a senior KMC health department official. Health experts also believe that better compliance with medical advice and safety precautions have contributed to a fall in the mortality figures. ""Covid-induced precautions made more people follow doctors' advice diligently and stick to medicines and a healthy lifestyle consistently. This has made a huge difference for those suffering from hypertension and diabetes, who often tend to skip drugs,"" said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) consultant Arindam Biswas. He added that a drop in pollution level also helped many stay healthier. ""Those suffering from lung ailments didn't require hospitalisation,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Covid-19 pneumonia can worsen with the air pollution caused by bursting of crackers, they point out.Avoid bursting crackers this Diwali: DocDr Srivatsa Lokeshwaran, consultant for Interventional Pulmonology at Aster CMI Hospital, said Covid, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients already have swollen and very sensitive lungs and hence firecracker smoke can affect their lungs further. /""In such a scenario, people should refrain from bursting crackers this year as it can also generate suspended particulate matter (SPM) which can increase transmission of Covid-19 virus,"" he added.When there are noxious gases around, patients suffering from or having recovered from Covid will be at risk, Dr Vasunethra Kasargod, consultant chest physician at Vikram Hospital, said. ""Equally vulnerable are those with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). They may develop reactive airway disease because of the inhalation of cracker fumes. Those recovering from Covid-19 and SARI and who are on home oxygen or those who have bronchitis with Covid have to be careful,"" he said.Cracker fumes can exacerbate asthma. Patients must be regular with their inhalers which imparts strength to the lungs, he said. The doctor also suggested that vulnerable people wear masks at home when firecrackers are being burst outside, so as to reduce exposure.""There are fumes which have too fine particles and can traverse through a cloth mask as well. But wearing a mask will help to some extent. It is certainly better than not wearing it,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Open garbage burning polluting air, locals complain of health issues","Dehradun: The menace of open burning of household waste, which contains anything from food waste to plastics to discarded electric items, is leading to a spike in the air pollution levels of the city. In several localities, the waste generated from households is being dumped on vacant plots and is later set afire, causing pollution in the state capital. Also, with the onset of winter, the practice of burning dry leaves has become rampant which is further worsening air quality levels in the city.Locals say that the air is so contaminated in some areas that they have developed respiratory issues. /The residents of Vasant Vihar area say that open dumping and subsequent burning of waste is ongoing in several vacant plots of the locality. They allege that that the garbage that is dumped in such areas is simply set afire without anyone bothering about the consequences this will have on the environment or on the health of people.Ranir Pal Saini, a resident of Vasant Vihar Enclave, said, ""A few days back, a garbage pile was set on fire near my house and it kept on burning for several hours before I doused it with water. This practice is shockingly rampant and no official seems bothered.""Ankit Agarwal, ward councillor of Vasant Vihar, said, ""The problem of open garbage burning is mainly associated with waste generated from gardens as the door-to-door facility only collects the household waste. Besides, the residents who leave for work early or those who try to skip the monthly garbage picking charges dump garbage at several points. The same waste is later burnt. We will take help from residents who have CCTV cameras installed in their homes to identify the ones who burn the garbage pile."" A similar issue has been reported by the residents of Sahastradhara where garbage is being burnt every day at the old trenching ground. Mridul Kumar, a resident of the area, said, ""The trenching ground was shifted months ago but the garbage is still being dumped here only to be burnt later. Consequently, the smoke reaches our house. This poses a threat of health issues to residents, especially children and elderly.""Anoop Nautiyal, founder of social organisation 'Social Development for Communities Foundation', said, ""The problem of burning garbage in the city is rampant as we do not have a stringent framework to curb the practice. The menace can be controlled if a penalty is imposed on offenders. There is also a need to spread awareness among the residents.""Meanwhile, mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama when apprised of the issue said that ""action will be taken if someone is found burning garbage.""

"Covid-19: From record 59,000 last Friday, Delhi cases soar to 6,725","NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 6,725 new cases of Covid-19 - its highest single-day tally - on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases to over 400,000 even as hospitals struggled to accommodate the critically ill patients due to paucity of ICU beds.The 6,725 fresh cases came out of 59,540 tests conducted in the past 24 hours, the government said.This is the first time when the number of daily cases has crossed the 6,000-mark in Delhi. Earlier, on October 30, the city had reported a high of 5,891 cases. Forty-eight new fatalities were recorded on Tuesday, pushing the toll in the capital to 6,652.The medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, Dr Suresh Kumar, said the spike in daily cases has led to a rise in demand for hospital beds. ""We are getting 90 to 100 new Covid-19 patients daily over the past 2-3 days. /In August, we were getting less than 30 patients daily,"" he added.City's positivity rate of 11.3% four times India avgLok Nayak Hospital, which is run by the Delhi government, has 2,000 beds for Covid-19 patients, of which 200 have ventilators attached. Only 11 ventilators were available on Tuesday.Overall, data shared by the hospitals showed that 68% of ventilator beds and 70% of ICU beds without ventilators were occupied. ""The situation is grave. New cases are increasing and many people are still not following any preventive measures. This can lead to a spiralling effect in the next four to six weeks as the infection spreads further in communities,"" said Dr S K Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.The positivity rate - number of positive cases among those tested - in Delhi is 11.3% at present, nearly four times the rate in the country. The case fatality rate is 1.7% which is also higher than the national average of 1.5%.Critical care specialist Dr Shrikanth Srinivasan of Manipal Hospital said Delhi is facing the double impact of a Covid-19 outbreak and increased air pollution, both leading to an increase in severe symptoms among those infected. ""Social-distancing norms, hand hygiene and wearing of masks should be strictly adhered to. Early testing and seeking appropriate healthcare are paramount and could make the difference between life and death,"" he said.According to Dr Priyadarshini Pal Singh, who heads emergency and critical care at Apollo Hospital, delay in admission is one of the reasons behind the rise in critical illness due to Covid. ""If someone has Covid-19 symptoms, for example fever, cough or difficulty in breathing, s/he should get tested immediately. Even those under home isolation should be under medical supervision,"" she said.Dr Singh said deterioration of symptoms could be very sudden in the novel coronavirus. ""Covid-19 is known to cause happy hypoxia, an unusual complication portrayed by low oxygen level in blood without obvious breathing difficulty.""On Monday, the Union home ministry held a review meeting to assess the deteriorating situation in the national capital and decided on a series of measures, including targeted RT-PCR testing in critical zones like marketplaces, restaurants, salons and barber shops to control the spread of the disease. It was also felt that Delhi Metro travel needs to be regulated strictly in line with the laid-down standard operating procedure. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Thick haze wraps Delhi, PM2.5 10x of safe level","NEW DELHI: A thick haze engulfed the city within a matter of hours on Wednesday afternoon, with visibility dropping considerably. It fell to as low as 600 metres at Safdarjung as air pollution levels shot up to around 10 times the standard for PM 2.5 concentration by 3 pm./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Delhi's overall Air Quality Index (AQI), measured over a 24-hour period, also shot up sharply during the day, deteriorating from the 'poor' category in the morning to the 'very poor' category at 343 by 4 pm. The city is likely to witness further deterioration in the AQI over the next 24 hours and it may even touch 'severe', according to officials.According to experts, a mix of factors, such as low wind speed, a low mixing height and low temperatures, which have been prevailing in the region over the past 48 hours, led to stagnant conditions with the wind speed remaining below 5 km/hr for several hours. However, stubble burning did not contribute to this episodic event with SAFAR, a central government agency, pegging the contribution of farm fires to Delhi's air at just 5%, owing to a change in wind direction.The IMD has also warned of moderate fog on Thursday morning due to these prevailing 'calm' conditions.Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department, said: ""Calm wind conditions prevailed on Tuesday night, and even during the day on Wednesday, the wind speed was below 5 km/hr, making it tough for pollutants to disperse. Besides this, the minimum temperature has been hovering around 10 degrees Celsius for the past two days. A low temperature slows down dispersion of pollutants."" He added that as the wind direction changed to westerly on Wednesday morning, there was minimum transfer of pollutants from Punjab and Haryana.According to IMD, the visibility dropped to its lowest at 600 metres at Safdarjung station while it was 800 metres at Palam from 3pm to 5pm on Wednesday.On Thursday, the minimum temperature stood at 10.6 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal, while the maximum temperature was 28 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The season's lowest minimum temperature was recorded at 10 degrees Celsius, five notches below normal, on Tuesday.SAFAR said air quality was expected to deteriorate further in the next 48 hours, owing to unfavourable meteorological conditions. ""There is a high probability that a shift in wind direction for a limited period may bring a plume of smoke as upper wind speed is highly favourable. This may cause a sudden jump in particulate pollutants for some time, leading to a higher 24-hr average by tomorrow. It is likely to increase the share of stubble-related intrusion by Thursday,"" said SAFAR.While 1,949 fire counts were recorded by SAFAR in the northern plains on Tuesday, it pegged the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's air at just 5%. The mixing height or a low boundary layer also played a key role with pollutants visibly close to the surface.""The rise in PM2.5 values on November 4 can be explained by low wind speeds and solar radiation,"" said Tanushree Ganguly, programme associate at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). ""As per data reported by the Major Dhyanchand National Stadium and East Arjun Nagar continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations, in addition to low wind speeds of less than 7km/hr, the solar radiation was less than 300 W/m2 which resulted in a low mixing height during the day. Low mixing heights trap particulates closer to the surface. Both wind speed and solar radiation were found to be lower compared to the last two days.""CPCB data showed Delhi's hourly PM 2.5 concentration rising through the day. At 6 am, it was recorded at 161 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm). By 10 am, it had touched 235 mpcm, and by 2 pm, it had reached 485 mpcm. The standard for PM 2.5 is just 60 mpcm. Readings were even higher at individual stations. Anand Vihar recorded an hourly PM 2.5 concentration of 584 mpcm at 2 pm while Patparganj recorded a high of 586 mpcm at 3 pm. Mandir Marg had a high of 560 mpcm at 3 pm while Mundka recorded a high of 560 mpcm. Even the Dr Karni Singh shooting range station, located in a green, forested area in south Delhi recorded a high of 504 mpcm at 3 pm.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said: ""The contribution of stubble to Delhi's air was reduced to only 5% but the adverse weather conditions led to trapping of local pollutants. It shows why we must have stringent control on local pollutants. Stubble is variable as it comes and goes. However, continuous pollution happening inside the city makes Delhi hugely vulnerable when the weather turns adverse like Wednesday when the wind dissipated and couldn't blow away the pollutants. This shows that we have to strengthen our local action."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

On Tuesday, data from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) showed air quality in Pune and Mumbai had already registered a significant plunge, a full 10 days before Diwali.Pune's air quality on Wednesday had slid to ""moderate"" while Mumbai's was ""poor"". Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on Covid control, said, ""We have recommended a reduction in firecracker use during Diwali this year as part of our 10-point programme on avoiding a possible second wave. Cold temperatures, pollution caused by firecrackers and Covid could be a deadly combination.""Salunke said pollution affects the respiratory tract. /""Generally too, pollution and steep drops in temperature make individuals prone to viral infections. Also, allergies and asthma-like conditions are exacerbated by both cooler weather and pollution. Any factor that adds to pollution levels, such as firecrackers and garbage burning, needs to be immediately tackled because a pandemic is on,"" he said.Recently, after a plea, the National Green Tribunal had issued notices to the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and four state governments asking if there should be a firecracker ban from November 7 to 30 in the interest of public health and environment. The plea had sought action against pollution caused by fire crackers in the National Capital Region, during a time when air quality worsens along with risks posed by Covid-19.Health experts too have sounded caution. Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases specialist and a member of the state's Covid-19 task force, said, ""Particulate pollutants of specific sizes (3-5 microns) are the kind that infiltrate airways and stay there, especially in those with compromised immune systems and diseases of the lung.""He added that a combination of factors, such as pollutant particle size in an environment that is cold and smoky, could be particularly problematic for a group of individuals. ""Viruses like H1N1 seem to thrive in this type of environment. This is the first winter with Covid-19, so we'll soon know how this virus behaves in the coming days. Nevertheless, it is strongly advised that people be more careful in the type of cold and polluted air we usually see during Diwali,"" he said.A study by Harvard University September had shown that even a tiny increase of only one microgram per cubic metre in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in Covid-19 death rate.

Many of them are experiencing breathing problems and fatigue while some are battling asthma despite testing negative several weeks ago.Jamshedpur-based septuagenarian Mahesh Kedia recovered last month after three rounds of plasma were administered to him and since then, he has been suffering from asthma. ""Even a slight rise in air pollution is making me almost breathless. /Why can't we celebrate Diwali only with lights this year,"" he said.Ranchi resident Kaveri Sinha, who recovered from the virus in August, wondered why the government is keeping mum on banning crackers especially when other states have already said no to bursting them this year. ""I am already experiencing shortness of breath because of the slight nip in the air. I shudder to think what will happen if the fireworks continue unabated,"" Sinha, who is in her 30s, said.Harmu-based LIC agent Abhay Kumar, who recovered in July, is still feeling weak and is yet to get back to his pre-Covid fitness level. ""Although I am not experiencing any major respiratory problems, I feel fatigued most of the time and my legs pain often,"" Kumar, who is in his 40s, said. ""Right now, I am exploring ways to safeguard myself from the pollution during Diwali,"" he said.""If it were up to me, I would put a ban on bursting crackers this year,"" he added.While the state government has not yet cleared its stand on bursting crackers, the medical fraternity has warned about the health risks involved. A week ago, the Jharkhand chapter of Indian Medical Association had issued an appeal to the public and the government for a smoke-free Diwali this year owing to the raging pandemic. They warned that the resultant rise in air pollution from bursting crackers coupled with the dip in temperature could prove to be lethal for Covid survivors, especially for those with respiratory ailments. They said that since this virus affects the lungs the most, the pollution could result in other complications for those cured. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Ones for future: These 'crackers' have green seeds,"NEW DELHI: To check the adverse impact of firecrackers, which add to air pollution every year during Diwali, here is a cracker of an idea. Though Delhi government has imposed a complete ban on the sale and bursting of all firecrackers from November 7 to 30 this year, this unique 'cracker' can help you celebrate the festival in a green manner./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Beej Patakha is an eco-friendly product in the shape of popular firecrackers like anaar, chakri, ladi, among others. However, instead of bursting into flames and releasing smoke, these ""patakhas"" are made with recycled paper with seeds embedded that lead to growth of plants.Diyanshu Asopa, founder of 21fools - a sustainable product company that manufactures plantable seed paper and paper products that grow into a plant, said: ""These products are designed to look like popular firecrackers, but are instead made from waste paper and recycled materials. We have a group of rural women, farmers and artisans who make these products. The papers are embedded with live seeds and when moist, it bio-degrades quickly and the seeds germinate in the soil, leading to growth of plants.""Asopa said crackers had become a means for exploitation of the marginalised communities and the environment suffered during the festive season. ""The idea is to promote conscious consumption and give an eco-friendly option to the people,"" he added. Beej Patakhas have microgreen ladis, which when soaked in water and sown, lead to growth of plants like red amaranthus, amaranth, fenugreek, mustard, spinach, etc.""A normal size ladi lasts for seven seconds and only creates noise and air pollution. On the contrary, if you nurture this hatcher ladi for seeds harvest, they will last for more than seven generations. Similarly, an onion chakri leads to growth of an onion plant,"" Asopa explained.

Shopping, travelling, and meeting friends after a long break due to pandemic is on the cards for many. Falling Covid-19 cases, and few deaths may give sense of freedom. /But, understand the risk factors and follow self-regulation to stay safe, healthy and happy during and post festive season.RISK FACTORSCrowding: With more relaxations, people likely to gather at shopping malls, multiplexes, and market places, leading to more infectionsTravelling: With travel restrictions removed, and almost all public transport back, crowded buses and trains are all potential carriers of virusFirecrackers: Air pollution caused by firecrackers may help aerosols of the virus from an infected person remain afloat in the air for longer than 10-20 minutesWinter: Nagpur city has recorded below normal temperature in first four days of November, and the trend is expected to continue over next week. Any flu virus survives for a longer period in a colder climate.Rising cases: Though not significant, there is a change in number of new cases and number of patients recovering daily in Vidarbha. In last three days, cases were more and recoveries were less. So, no one is safe. SECOND WAVE? Second wave means a revival of viral infection that appears to have decreased for a certain period of timeState health minister Rajesh Tope has said second wave of Covid-19 is unlikely in MaharashtraInfectious disease specialists find no reason to say there will not be a fresh wave of the disease ""There is no epidemiological reason to say there will not be a second wave. But how severe it will be depends on how seriously we follow Covid norms over next four weeks,"" said Dr Ashwini Tayade, infectious disease specialist.INDICATORS OF SECOND WAVE- If new cases remain more than recoveries- If sample positivity rate is more than 10%- If doubling rate, which is over 200 days now, reduces significantly- If under-treatment patients (active cases), which is less than 6% of total cases at present, increases - If recovery rate, which is more than 92% now, goes down significantlyHERD IMMUNITY? Declining number of new cases may create a notion that we have developed herd immunity. But, according to doctors, there's a long way to go""Herd immunity comes when at least 60% of the population gets infected, which, in turn, acts as a barrier for transmission. In India, we are not even at 10%,"" said pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat. TIPS FOR SAFE DIWALIHand sanitizers: Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are inflammable and can cause fire. Don't use them before lighting diyas, candles or firecrackers. Sanitizers: Sanitizer bottles have become most common household items during Covid-19. But, they can easily catch fire. So, keep them at a safe place before Diwali.Use water and soap: Better option is to keep water handy and wash hands with soap. Paper soap is better Distancing: To ensure Covid distancing, opt for 'namaste' instead of hugsWear mask: Diwali will be healthier for all if we follow Covid regulations.

States such as Delhi and West Bengal have banned crackers this year.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, ""We have not taken any decision on the issue yet and are awaiting a government directive. /We are constantly following up on the issue with the government."" A civic official involved in the process of drafting the notification has stated they studied similar orders issued by other state governments, including Rajasthan. The officials said under the Epidemic Diseases Act, they can impose a ban on bursting of firecrackers at public and private premises during a pandemic.The officials said state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray has asked the BMC to explore the possibility of banning firecrackers during the pandemic to avoid air pollution that would trouble Covid-19 patients and others.Meanwhile, the state home department has appealed to the public to not burst crackers as it can lead to noise and air pollution and have an adverse impact on Covid patients. ""Keeping all this in mind, citizens should avoid bursting crackers this year. It can aggravate health-related issues,"" stated the notification issued by the home department.

Blanket Of Smog Shrouds Capital,"Lucknow: The city witnessed the highest air pollution levels post-monsoon this year on Thursday due to a thick dense smog - a mix of mist/fog and pollutants - that enveloped the city since morning.As per the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Lucknow's Air Quality Index (AQI) was 349. This means the air quality of Lucknow was in the 'very poor' category which is harmful to lungs. The city skyline remained wrapped in a thick haze since morning, giving the appearance of an overcast sky and leading to drop in the visibility below 500 metres.According to weather experts, the smog created by clubbing of mist and pollutants remained suspended in the air for a longer period because wind velocity was also low. The drop in night temperatures by 3-4 degrees in the past few days condensed moisture in the air, leading to formation of the mist.On the other hand, the concentration of ultrafine pollutants (PM 10 and PM 2.5) spiked because of the rise in fuel emissions due to increase in vehicular load on roads owing to festival rush.The stubble burning in many parts of the state also made a significant contribution in the increase of PM 10 and 2.5 levels in the atmosphere. /Adding to it was the pollution caused by the bursting of firecrackers on Karva Chauth on Wednesday.Environmentalist Prof Venkatesh Dutta warned that the pollution levels will increase further in coming days. ""As winters are approaching, decline in temperatures will continue and there will be more vehicles on the road due to festivals,"" he added. He also said that since weather conditions cannot be changed, the effort should be to reduce emission of pollutants by strictly enforcing a ban on stubble burning, putting checks on construction activities as per guidelines.

'Reduced intake of toxins can make a difference',"Kolkata: On Diwali night, the PM2.5 concentration in city's air, a West Bengal Pollution Control Board study in 2018 revealed, rises to 1,200g/m on an average. This was equivalent to smoking 42 cigarettes in a short span of time. The thumb rule is: inhaling 29g/m3 PM2.5 for a day is equivalent to smoking one cigarette. /Particles of heavy metal in the air pushes up the pollution level by a few more notches during Kali Puja and Diwali.Experts warn that children who indulge in bursting fireworks get exposed to a much higher PM2.5 level. A benign - so it seems apparently - snake tablet emits 64,500g/m PM2.5 particles. ""It is no wonder why there is a sudden spike in asthma and COPD cases post-Diwali night,"" said Sushmita Roy Chowdhury, consultant pulmonologist with Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. Roy Chowdhury is relieved to see fewer asthma patients after lockdown improved the air quality. But her relief was short-lived, with the queue of patients with breathing distress getting longer with air quality declining as the nation unlocked gradually. ""The mixture of particulate matter, heavy metal particles and noxious fumes is a deadly combination. It is a far more serious issue than controlling pandal-hopping to restrict the infection,"" said Arup Haldar, consultant pulmonologist, Columbia Asia and Woodlands Hospitals. Particulate matter of PM2.5 size, which is 30 times finer than a human hair, is considered dangerous to humans since it can reach the deepest portions of lungs. It is declared as Class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and is also linked to heart disease and respiratory ailments. Due to its tiny size and ability to accumulate in human organs and blood, it plays havoc with vital organs like heart, lungs and stomach.""In the background of an ongoing pandemic, it is of utmost importance for us to realize the need to limit air pollution this Kali Puja-Diwali as it would only aggravate the suffering all around and increase the death toll,"" said Soirindhri Banerjee of radiation oncology, IPGMER & SSKM Hospital.""Crackers contain chemicals such as salts of potassium, sulphur, manganese, sodium, aluminium, iron, strontium, barium and charcoal.

PPCB meet dyers' assn over pollution-related issues,"Ludhiana: Officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board conducted a meeting with members of Punjab Dyers Association on Friday night to discuss the issues being faced by their industry on Tajpur road.The dyeing industry was informed that the chairman, Punjab Pollution Control Board, had issued a public notice advising all dyeing industries to voluntarily declare and dismantle/plug any bypass facility by November 6. With the last date over now, the board would be carrying out extensive surveillance from now onwards to ensure that there was no illegal discharge by any dyeing industry of Ludhiana.The problem of air pollution was also deliberated in detail and the dyeing industry on Tajpur road were suggested about various measures to control the black smoke generated from the chimneys of these industries. Sandeep Bahl, senior environmental engineer, said that the CETP project which was meant to tremendously reduce the water pollution level of the Buddha Nullah was not even sanctioned till November, 2019, and within just one year, the central government had released Rs 13.5 crore. Of the sanctioned central grant of Rs 15 crore the state government has released the entire state subsidy of Rs 7.5 crore for the execution of the project, which is now expected to be completed by December 31. He said that during the current Covid situation, the responsibility was of the industry to control air pollution as the virus primarily attacked the lungs and the problem of air pollution would certainly increase the severity of the disease. /He appealed to the dyeing industry to refurbish and diligently operate their pollution control devices. During the meeting, Ashok Makkar, chairman, Punjab Dyers Association, said that the CETP for Tajpur road dyeing cluster had now taken a practical shape and was becoming a reality soon.

BJP Asks Govt To Refrain From Cracker Ban,"Ranchi/Bokaro/Jamshedpur: The government must not ban use of firecrackers for Diwali alone and in case it does choose to restrict fireworks for the Hindu festival, the same should also apply for Christmas and New Year, BJP's Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth said on Saturday.Adding that he, being the people's representative, understands that the pollution and smoke emanating from the fireworks could pose a threat to public health amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Seth, who won the Ranchi Lok Sabha constituency for the first time last May, said, ""I am also concerned about public health and safety, but everyone's religious sentiments should be respected equally. The state government should take these into consideration and not just disrespect or offend one particular religion and its festival while issuing any guidelines,"" he added.Talking to TOI amid the debate over use of crackers in the wake of concerns raised by medical experts, Seth said, ""I am opposed to any such ban if it is only for Diwali. Let's ban it during festivals celebrated by other communities as well. Why only during Hindu festival?/ Ban it on December 25 (Christmas) and New Year when more crackers are used than Diwali.""Meanwhile, RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) also has urged the state to refrain from imposing a blanket ban on crackers on Diwali. Only firecrackers imported from China cause pollution, but governments in various states have been banning all crackers without a proper study on their effects, it said.SJM's regional convenor Sachinder Kumar Bariar said, ""Chinese crackers, imported illegally, have potassium nitrate, sulfur and other harmful chemicals that cause pollution. There are made-in-India eco-friendly crackers in the market that are free of any chemicals. These green crackers are certified by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - NEERI. It is unfair of the governments to impose a ban on all types of crackers on Diwali.""Recalling a Supreme Court order in 2018 which permitted crackers for two hours on Diwali to continue with the tradition and livelihood, he added that thousands of livelihood are dependent on the cracker industry and trade during Diwali,.Meanwhile, with just a week left for Diwali and a fortnight for Chhath, the state government is still to clear its stand on how the two festivals will be celebrated even though doctors have been warning the government about complications for Covid patients and also those who have recovered due to spurt in air pollution due to the use of crackers with the onset of winter.Former chief minister and BJP national vice-president Raghubar Das has written to chief minister Hemant Soren seeking early notification of Covid-19 guidelines for Chhath festival, which takes place six days after Diwali on November 14, to clear the confusion prevailing among organising samitis.Das aid, ""Lakhs of Chhath devotees are keenly awaiting the guidelines to prepare (for the festival) accordingly. The government should announce the festival norms at the earliest."" Several Chhath puja organising samitis recently told TOI that they are waiting for the government to issue guidelines so that they start work pertaining to sprucing up Chhath ghats and prepare puja material packets for distribution among devotees.Meanwhile, Chas Municipal Corporation (CMC) in Bokaro has floated a WhatsApp number (9939069533) seeking suggestions from residents on the ways to host the festival safely amid the pandemic.

And we thought pollution is an urban problem,"People living outside the big cities in India are just as badly hit by air pollution, but they may be far less equipped to reduce the risks. And because there has been little focus on pollution outside urban spaces, 84% of India's population is exposed to pollution levels much higher than India's safety standards allow.The study, 'Outdoor air pollution in India is not only an urban problem', was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA earlier this week. The scientists, from Colorado State University and IIT-Bombay, divided the area of study into six zones - Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), north India, east India, south India, west India and central India - and went over satellite-derived PM2.5 levels at various points over a decade.""The IGP stands out as the area of highest population-weighted PM2.5 (100 g/m3 throughout) and has the largest population density. In this region, the pollution is almost evenly spread across urban and nonurban regions ... Even in the other five regions, there is little difference between population-weighted PM2.5 levels between urban and non-urban regions,"" the study found.Southern India, in a 30-50g/m3 range, had the best air quality in non-urban areas, followed by central India. /While pollution over the Indo-Gangetic Plain is double that of the rest of the country, PM2.5 levels in all urban and non-urban areas were above the safe levels in all other five regions as well. ""IGP has a high population. It also has many high-polluting industries - coal-powered electricity plants, cement production,"" lead author Dr AR Ravishankara told TOI.The WHO's guidelines for healthy air set the danger mark at 10g/m3. By those standards, less than 0.001% (or less than 1 in a lakh) Indians breathe air that is safe, the study found. India's standards allow for four times more particulate matter in the air (0g/m3), and even by those, only 16% breathe relatively cleaner air. ""Clearly, the non-urban regions in India are being affected by air pollution as much as the more visible urban regions,"" the paper said.So far, understanding of how pollution in one area affects another has been restricted to stubble burning. But that doesn't take into account the impact at source. ""We have shown previously that eastern India is greatly affected by pollution transport from the IGP. It appears that nonurban regions create a significant amount of their own pollution,"" the paper said. In fact, emissions in non-urban areas, 53 Tg (teragram)/year (million tons a year), are more than double that in urban areas, 25 Tg/year.How it works is also different. ""In urban areas, the contribution of indoor air pollution to outdoor air pollution is not very large. Transportation, industry, among others, are significant factors,"" Ravishankara said. In non-urban areas, it's exactly the opposite: ""The residential energy use is a significant emissions source, primarily due to household cooking with solid fuels in the non-urban areas.""The impact is the same - people are dying sooner. ""The annual premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 for India (urban and nonurban) is 1.05 million,"" the study said, linking bad air to six causes of death - ischemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and diabetes mellitus type 2.But non-urban areas are worse placed than urban ones, with even less oversight, limited infrastructure and awareness. ""The nonurban population has a lesser ability to reduce their risks because of economic reasons and, thereby, raising equity issues,"" the paper said. ""Nonurban regions have the further confounding influence of indoor air quality due to the use of solid fuels for cooking in inefficient cookstoves. The inclusion of this impact would only ... enhance the air pollution impacts in nonurban areas relative to urban areas."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Trash burning ban goes up in smoke,"Lucknow: The air quality index (AQI) of Lucknow has touched 'severe' mark but burning of garbage in the open, one of the prominent contributors of air pollution, continues unabated in various parts of the city despite ban.The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) had banned burning of waste in the open in 2017 with the provision of Rs 500 fine but a TOI reality check found violations in several areas including Lalbagh, Latouche Road, New Hyderabad, Aliganj, Jankipuram, Gomtinagar and Daliganj.Residents complained that smoke is taking its toll on their health and no action is being taken by LMC despite complaints.Residents of Sector C in Aliganj said sanitary workers dump garbage on the roadside and burn it which creates smog in the morning and causes breathing problem to residents, especially senior citizens who go out for morning walk. ""Once my father told a sanitary worker not to burn garbage but he did not pay heed to him. Our complaints to LMC also went unattended,"" Vikas Lamba of Aliganj (Sector C) said. /Anuj Verma of Latouche Road said, ""This area has many electronics and cycle repair shops. Owners of these shops dump waste on the road which is burnt by sweepers in the morning.""Anya Tiwari of Sector H, Jankipuram, complained that waste was burnt by sanitary at least thrice a week. ""This has been the practice for last 10 years despite several complaints by residents,"" Tiwari said.In Vikrant Khand, Gomtinagar, TOI found a heap of garbage on fire in a park. ""LMC workers do not collect garbage from our locality. We hired a private company but its services are also irregular. Hence, residents dump garbage in park. The gardener sets it on fire,"" said Tarun Gupta, a resident. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Kumar said, ""LMC has launched a drive to penalise violators. At least 56 people have been booked in last few days."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The decision was taken at the corona review meeting held at CM's residence on Sunday. The official statement released by CM's office says that poisonous smoke emitted by crackers is a health hazard for people suffering from various diseases.OdishaThe Odisha government on November 3 banned the sale and use of firecrackers from November 10-30, worried over the impact it may have on Covid-19 patients.Protest against the banTrade unionists in several parts of the country protested the government's move to ban firecrackers on the ground that the ban would have a serious impact on the livelihood of workers in the industry.Senior BJP leader Vijay Goel on Sunday staged a dharna demanding that the Delhi government compensate traders who have suffered losses due to a ban on firecrackers.He claimed that 41 per cent of air pollution is contributed by vehicles, 21 per cent by industrial units and 18 per cent by dust, as well as by burning of garbage and construction activities, but firecrackers were singled out by the Delhi government to show that it is concerned.MostHighlighted For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Why are COVID cases increasing in Delhi unlike other parts of India? It is because of the killing air pollution: Docs,"With the onset of winters, chances of getting a common flu are higher. And as COVID-19 cases rise in the city and the poor air quality continues to choke citizens, doctors suggest the next few months be taken seriously. People with respiratory illnesses have a hard time as air quality worsens, so the last thing you'd want to expose yourself to is COVID. Apart from taking serious precautionary measures, doctors say one shouldn't forget that we are in the middle of a pandemic, and poor air quality will not make the situation better for NCR residents. /'Government needs to ban crackers across the country' Dr Arvind Kumar, Chairman, Centre for Chest Surgery, and Director, Institute of Robotic Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, says that he's already seeing the effects of cold air and pollution with respect to COVID. ""In the last two weeks, there has been a steep rise in the number of people testing COVID positive. In our hospital, about eight-ten doctors have tested positive in 10 days, which is a far bigger weekly number than we've witnessed in the last few months. I've been operating since May, and we've been conducting regular tests on our patients before surgery. Till now, about one in 50 would be COVID positive but in the last two weeks, 10% of the patients are testing positive. We need to take drastic measures to reduce pollution. In the OPD, there's a sudden rise in the people coming with cough, cold and breathlessness. Till about two weeks back, national figures were going down. The national figures are still low but Delhi is witnessing a steep rise. It is because of pollution,"" he says.Dr Arvind Kumar adds that we need to take serious measures to control pollution. ""There are so many vehicles out on the streets. People seem to have forgotten that COVID's still around. If this continues, Diwali will be disastrous for us. I was choking on the day of Karwa Chauth because people were bursting crackers. Add to this tonnes of more crackers, and we will choke to death. The government needs to issue an order that due to coronavirus, crackers will be banned across the country. If that is not done, we are in for serious times and the worst affected will be our new-borns,"" he points out.In areas with higher pollution, more people fall sick due to COVID: StudiesDr Vivek Nangia, Principal Director & HOD, Institute of Respiratory Pulmonary Intensive Care (Saket Complex) at Max Super Speciality Hospital, says there are enough studies showing that in areas with higher pollution, the number of COVID cases rise significantly, and so does the mortality rate. A Harvard study shows that someone who lives for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate pollution is 8% more likely to die from COVID-19 than someone who lives in a region that has just one unit (one microgram per cubic meter) less of such pollution.""This happens primarily because whenever PM2.5 particles increase, the COVID virus tends to stick to them remain suspended in the air for a longer period. As a result, the virus' survival chances in air is higher, and this is when the disease starts to spread more,"" he says. The doctor adds, ""Another mechanism also is that air pollution results in inflammation of the airways which makes an individual more susceptible to catching COVID.""Be extra careful this winter""You should be more careful during this time because it's the flu season and with the weather changing, if you get a common cold, you start thinking about COVID. This winter, you need to be extra careful,"" says Dr Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director and Senior Pediatrician, Apollo Hospitals Group. Talking about what one can do to stay protected, the doctor shares, ""Individuals can get flu shots that protect you from influenza. Follow SMS - sanitisation, mask wearing and social distancing - which has to be taken all the more seriously with rising COVID cases. There's a need for reinforcement of basic precautions that need to be taken, and it's extremely important that people realise it."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Disease burden might increase drastically if Covid-19 & air pollution get combined: AIIMS director Guleria,"MANGALURU: There is an urgent need to look for sustainable solutions and be more aggressive towards controlling air pollution, more so this year because with Covid-19 pandemic still being around and cases rising, it can lead to a huge burden if both of them get combined, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director, Dr Randeep Guleria said in an ASSOCHAM webinar on Tuesday.""There is definitely an on-going wave, especially in many parts of India, and air pollution is making it worse. So we need to act on multiple fronts to get hold as far as this pandemic is concerned,"" said Dr Guleria addressing an ASSOCHAM webinar on 'COVID-19 - Coming of the Second Wave: Myth or Reality.'Dr Guleria said that Delhi is facing a double whammy of air pollution and Covid-19 as the virus can survive for a long time in air pollution, which can cause more severe diseases.He added, ""There is no doubt that we are having a second wave but possibly multiple waves in different parts of the country as the number of cases increases. In our hospital we had created a facility with almost 1,500 beds for Covid patients, we had during June-July almost 900 patients admitted during a given point in time, it came down to about 200, but now again it is rising, and we have more than 500 Covid positive patients.""The AIIMS director also said that since the unlock has happened, the hospital's load has increased significantly as now it is facing a huge load as far as the number of cases of Covid and non-Covid are increasing which were not there during the lockdown, and that is causing a huge strain on healthcare facilities.He outlined three major reasons for the rise in Covid-19 cases - Covid fatigue and lack of Covid appropriate behaviour as people are crowding and not wearing masks; respiratory viruses peak during winter months and Delhi's poor air quality leading to rise in air pollution.Dr Guleria said that there is data suggesting that mortality during air pollution continues to be high. /""Every year in our hospital, we have done a study where we have followed all our admissions in an emergency for two years and what we found was that whenever the air quality index worsened there was an increase in admissions both in children and adults for respiratory diseases in the next 5-6 days. This is being shown for the last 2-3 years, now with air pollution and Covid-19 this is going to become a huge burden.""He also said that during this time of year there is an increase in allergic disorders - sneezing, running nose and a large number of cases of flu, therefore it becomes challenging in differentiating between upper respiratory manifestations. ""So, I think all individuals who have an influenza-like illness like fever, sore throat, headache, body ache, cough should at least get themselves tested for Covid-19.""

Got respiratory problems? Take extra care this Diwali,"Lucknow: People with respiratory problems, chronic autoimmune diseases and heart issues need to be extra careful this Diwali as increased pollution levels due to bursting of firecrackers are expected to make the environment conducive for severe coronavirus infections, doctors have warned. According to doctors, patients with respiratory issues like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, lung tuberculosis and bronchitis often have hypersensitive respiratory tract and already damaged lungs. Besides, their oxygen level remains low. /Therefore, their chances to catch infection with viruses and bacteria in winters is higher when air pollution acts as a catalyst. Since coronavirus attacks the respiratory tract, it may further damage the lungs. Prof Santosh Kumar, faculty in the respiratory medicine department of KGMU, while explaining how Covid can be hazardous in respiratory patients, said, ""Ailments like COPD, bronchitis and asthma damage air sacs and narrow airways. Besides, extra mucus is produced that causes breathlessness. This hinders oxygen intake. Covid-19 causes blood clotting and fibrosis in lungs. If a person is inflicted by both, it may turn fatal."" Dr D Himanshu, communicable disease expert at KGMU, said, ""These patients often suffer from hypoxemia as their lung capacity is low. Further damage is caused by ultrafine pollutants (PM 2.5 micron) if they enter lungs during inhalation. Hence, this year due to Covid-19, such patients need to take extra precautions because if they get infected, oxygen levels may drop faster in them than normal persons.""Patients with heart conditions, cancer and autoimmune disease should also take all precautions as their immunity remains low, he added.Dr Anil Kumar Gulati, director in microbiology department, Institute of Medical Sciences at Banaras Hindu University, said, ""Higher pollution during and post Diwali might result in Covid-19 surge among those who are more exposed to the environment.""Dr Amit Singh, epidemiologist and faculty at the Provincial Health and Family Welfare Training Centre, said, ""Though limited studies are available on the effect of air pollution on Covid-19, by studying other respiratory viruses we can say that it can thrive in damaged lungs and pollution is definitely a major contributing factor.""

This is the second highest single-day toll recorded in the last 24 hours in all states and union territories across the country. Maximum 85 fresh fatalities were recorded in Maharashtra.The number of new cases, which has been in the excess of 6,000 daily for the last one week, came down to 5,023 on Monday. /This could be because only 39,115 people underwent Covid-19 tests in the last 24 hours as against an average of nearly 60,000 tests conducted daily from Monday to Saturday. The positivity rate - number of positive cases from those tested - continues to be over 12% in the national capital.There are 39,795 active cases, according to the health bulletin issued by the state government. Of them, 25,231 (63%) are under home isolation while the rest (14,564) are undergoing treatment at various hospitals and Covid care centres.Doctors say due to air pollution, more people are developing severe symptoms and succumbing to the infection. ""Covid-19 damages the lungs mainly, in addition to the other organs. Pollution also affects the respiratory tract. Those with a history of illnesses, such as asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, aren't able to recover easily if they get Covid-19,"" said a senior doctor. He added that strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour was the only way to save lives.""So many people are moving around without a mask in markets. Many of them may be asymptomatic Covid-19 cases. If people wear masks, the risk of disease spread will reduce. Also, people who have weaker immunity due to pre-existing illnesses should avoid going to crowded places unless it is for an emergency,"" doctors say. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

These mothers are a part of a pan-India movement called ""Warrior Moms"". The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also endorsed a correlation between Covid-19-related mortalities and air pollution. Besides, the chemical contents present in firecrackers are harmful and toxic.Pashan-based Anuja Bali Karthikeyan, who is a part of the movement, said, ""Our campaign started two weeks ago. /It got a major boost after the Maharashtra government urged citizens to avoid bursting crackers to curb noise and air pollution that could affect patients with Covid-19 and other ailments."" Karthikeyan said, ""We are using social media extensively to spread awareness. I have also decided to visit the slum dwellers in my neighbourhood to create awareness among them by showing videos about the health hazards of firecrackers.""She said, ""Our members are sharing information about the chemical analysis of firecrackers released by Mumbai-based Awaaz Foundation and asking people to give priority to the health."" As a part of the campaign, the mothers have initiated conversations with relatives, friends as well as on social media groups to spread the word. ""With the support of local bloggers and city-based mothers' group, we are reaching out to people with their petition so that people can sign and give a missed call to pledge for a smoke-free Diwali,"" said Hema Chari Madabhushi, a member and resident of Bhosalenagar.Medical expert Arvind Kumar of Lung Care Foundation and Doctors for Clean Air said, ""In our zeal to celebrate a festival, we must not take our lungs for granted.

"Agra admin prohibits sale and use of firecrackers, traders decry 'sudden move'","Agra: With barely four days left for Diwali, the Agra district administration on Monday decided to prohibit the sale and use of firecrackers in Agratill November 30 in a bid to check the rising levels of air pollution.The district administration has stopped issuing licences to firecracker manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. It has also suspended the temporary licenses to sell firecrackers for three days.The air pollution level in Agra, which falls in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ), has been in the 'severe' category for the last two days. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air pollution level is so bad that it would seriously impact those with existing diseases. /""Sale and use of firecrackers will be strictly prohibited in Agra till November 30. The decision has been taken following the NGT orders to prevent a further increase in air pollution level due to the busting of firecrackers,"" district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said. ""Police and administration teams will be checking that no sale and use of firecracker takes place. We are expecting directives from the state government regarding action to be taken against people who violate the orders,"" he added.Meanwhile, a group of firecracker dealers staged a protest at the collectorate against the order, claiming that the sudden ban would result in major losses for them. ""We would have not raised any objection had the district administration announced the ban the sale of firecracker 15 days earlier. Now, we have invested money in the stocks and the ban has been imposed less than a week ahead of Diwali. This is completely unfair. The stubble burning and the dust has been the main source of air pollution in Agra which the district administration has failed to control,"" a firecracker retailer, Santosh Gupta said.Earlier, the district administration had invited applications for setting up sale outlets at 12 places where temporary market to sell crackers would be setup, like the previous years.A total of 286 shops were to be allotted at 12 places. On Sunday, 90 applicants were allotted space at Kothi Meena Bazaar from 12 to 14 November. Now, all these allotments have been cancelled by the district administration.

Netizens for ban on crackers as city's air quality worsens,"Hyderabad: With several states, including Rajasthan, Odisha and Delhi, banning firecrackers this Diwali, the demand for such a ban is growing among city residents as well. The twin problems of Covid-19 and rising air pollution have made people wary of bursting crackers. Taking to Twitter and tagging minister KT Ramarao, Arun Amaram (@arunamaram) said: ""Ban crackers for Diwali now for at least in Hyderabad."" /Kunal Mahendra (KunalMahendra6) said: ""Hyderabad AQI has not improved. Hopefully this year crackers are banned in Hyd...let's move towards a green city."" Data from the Telangana Pollution Control Board justifies claims of worsening air quality in the city. The Air Quality Index (AQI), used to gauge the comparative quality of air in the country, has touched a high of 167 this past week for a city which has seen levels well under 100 till a month ago. During Covid-19, when respiratory problems are a concern, people cannot be more worried. Several women, under the aegis of the pan-India group 'Warrior Moms' that raises awareness on pollution, brought to the fore their concerns on Friday. Sriparna Das, a part of the group, said: ""A festival is for everyone. It should not be a source of misery for the vulnerable, both humans and animals. Especially with Covid-19, we have to take care of the air that we breathe, it is our lifeline."" Said another mother from the group, Natasha Ramarathnam, ""As a mother, I dread the coming of Diwali, because I know that the smoke emitted by the crackers will cause respiratory ailments in the entire family. This could be worse this year, because we do not know the effect of the chemicals on Covid-19 patients. Festivals should be joyful, not feared. Please ban the sale of firecrackers."" ""Honestly while we think that children are actually having fun by bursting crackers, the actual fact is that we are gifting them poisonous gases like SO2, NOX, CO as well as metallic substance fumes like zinc, lead, magnesium etc which are highly reactive and can cause a number of respiratory, anemic and fever like complications. These might not surface immediately but will stay as underlying health issues and cause problems,"" said environmental activist Kaajal Maheshwari.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Crackers banned in Delhi, city may see muted Diwali too","Hyderabad: Only green crackers can be sold in the city and use may be restricted to two hours on Diwali day and other occasions following a directive from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday.

A bench, headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, said: ""The cities/towns where air quality is 'moderate' or below, only green crackers be sold, and the timings for use and bursting of crackers be restricted to two hours during festivals such as Diwali, Chhath, New Year/Christmas Eve as may be specified by the state concerned."" /""At other places ban/restrictions are optional for the authorities, but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail,"" the bench said.In Hyderabad, the air quality index (AQI) was at a high of 167 last week, which still falls under the moderate level. At this level, people with lung, asthma and other diseases could face breathing difficulties.Prasad Dasari, chief of Air Lab, Telangana State Pollution Control Board, said, ""The NGT order reiterated a Supreme Court decision of 2018 that encourages the use of green crackers across the country. We have been following this in Hyderabad."" Green crackers are supposed to be less polluting since they do not have harmful ingredients such as lithium and lead. Environmentalist Purushotham Reddy said, ""During the pandemic, people should refrain from bursting crackers at all considering people suffering from Covid and other respiratory illnesses.""The NGT also directed all states to initiate special drives to contain air pollution from all sources in view of the potential of aggravation of Covid-19.

Officials said 59,035 tests were conducted of which 17,810 were RT-PCR/CBNAAT/TrueNat and 41,225 Rapid Antigen Tests. ""A lot of people are moving around without wearing masks in markets. Many of them may be asymptomatic. If people wear masks, risk of spread of disease will reduce,"" said a doctor.""If someone has Covid-19 symptoms, for example fever, cough or difficulty breathing, he or she should get tested immediately. Also, those under home isolation should be under medical supervision. Deterioration of symptoms can be sudden and, therefore, patients need to be watchful of warning signs such as irregular heart beat or sudden loss of consciousness,"" said a health expert.

Uday Pratap Singh plans for a road trip on Diwali,"Actor Uday Pratap Singh is eagerly looking forward to his Diwali break. Uday, who plays the second lead in the serial Ki Kore Bolbo Tomay, will be heading to his mamabari or maternal grandfather's home in Bihar after 22 long years to usher in the festivities. ""I am really excited for this trip. /My father and I will go to my mamabari. It's going to be a road trip and I can't wait to go on this long distance car ride. I am going to Bihar after 22 years, which is a very long time. Since my mother's death in 2004, we haven't been there ever. My mama also passed away in 2006 and I somehow lost the urge to go there. But this time round I thought, let's ring in Diwali with mami and two cousins there. So, dad and I will go there for a few days. I am really looking forward to this break,"" said Uday.The actor is also happy about the ban on firecrackers this years and added, ""I know bursting crackers is synonymous with Diwali but in the current pandemic situation, it's of utmost necessity that we keep the environment free of harmful pollutants, smoke and fumes from the deadly firecrackers. They not only contribute to noise pollution but also air pollution. And since the coronavirus is a respiratory pathogen, people affected by it and others who have lung problems have a lot of difficulty to breathe during the time of Diwali if we burst crackers. Apart from them, we also must think about the pets at home and the stray animals and birds around us. I request everyone to stay away from firecrackers this Diwali.""

Crackers hazardous for Covid-19 patients: Experts,"GUWAHATI: A day after Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma spoke against curbs on Diwali celebrations, health experts, including those from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Assam, warned that bursting of firecrackers in the name of celebrations can aggravate the condition of Covid-infected patients.Health experts were critical about the concept of ""green crackers"", which continue to be allowed outside Guwahati. They said the condition of many Covid patients may turn critical with bursting of smoke-producing firecrackers during Diwali.""Pollution affects the respiratory system and novel coronavirus does not spare it. People having lung infection are said to have pre-morbid conditions for Covid-19 and have a chance of getting infected by the virus. /So, bursting of firecrackers producing smoke can be catastrophic in this Covid situation,"" Satyajit Borah, president of Assam state branch of the IMA, said.Professor and head of the pulmonary medicine department at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Dr Jogesh Sarma appealed to people to stay away from smoke-releasing firecrackers during the pandemic.""Since during Covid lung is affected. Even after getting rid of Covid infection also, some changes remain in the lungs. Smoke is not good at all for those people who got infections in their lungs. It's a humble request for them to stay away from air pollution triggered by smoke caused by firecrackers,"" said Sarma. He said peaceful Diwali celebrations with earthen lamps can help in joyous celebrations without posing threat to Covid-infected patients. Medical researcher and assistant professor in the pathology department at Assam Medical College Hospital Dr Gayatri Gogoi said it is well known that air pollution causes chronic lung diseases and lung cancer besides many other cancers. ""Covid-19 can be aggravated by air pollution. Delhi is one of the living examples on how rise of pollution is directly proportional to increase in the number of Covid cases,"" said Gogoi.""There is data that every year during Diwali, the air pollution level spikes. When we are in the middle of a pandemic, it will be suicidal if we allow air pollution to rise to hazardous levels,"" she added.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
COVID-19 and air pollution: What diabetes patients should do stay safe,"COVID-19 has become the biggest health challenge that humanity has faced in its entire recorded history. While pandemics are nothing new, the rapid expansion of this disease and the volume of cases recorded globally is unprecedented.Scientists and health experts are continuously working to understand the disease and the various ways in which it impacts our body. Right from the early days of the contagion, it was discovered that it is more threatening for people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, blood pressure or CVDs etc. Now, a relationship between the contagion and pollution has also become clear. According to research, air pollution can lead to conditions like hypertension, diabetes and respiratory illnesses which have been identified as clear risk factors for COVID-19 complications. This assumes a great importance considering the fact that 91% of the world's population resides in regions where air pollution is in excess of the 'safe' levels prescribed by the World Health Organization. /Let's take a deeper look to understand the relationship between the pandemic, air pollution and diabetes to find out how we can minimize the risks in these testing times. COVID-19 and Air PollutionCOVID-19 is primarily a respiratory infection which causes numerous complications affecting cardiac functions, septic shocks, liver and kidney dysfunctions and multi-organ failures leading to fatalities. It has been observed that the disease proves riskier in people who already suffer from such chronic diseases. Living in areas with severe air pollution exacerbates such medical conditions and makes the respiratory illnesses deadlier. It is estimated that roughly 40% of all respiratory tract infections, and almost 20% of coronary diseases and diabetes cases are caused by air pollution and that's the primary area of concern for COVID-19 as well. COVID-19 and DiabetesVarious diabetes related factors such as poor glycaemic control are known to adversely impact our body's immune system. Hence, when a person suffers from viral infections such as COVID-19, the diabetes patients are likely to find it tougher to manage the condition. It can also lead to secondary bacterial infections in lungs etc. Type 2 diabetes is known to cause increase in plasminogen levels which make the coronavirus stronger and boost its growth in the body.Considering the various risks posed by the increased air pollution and diabetes in the wake of the pandemic, it is of utmost importance for people suffering from diabetes to take certain measures to stay protected from the infection. The key precautions include:Avoiding outdoor exercises and walks in open spaces where a lot of smog and air pollution is recorded. The smog is usually denser in winter so early morning walks should be avoided.Wearing face masks is absolutely necessary as it provides protection from air pollution as well as the virus.Hand-hygiene is another key part of the protection strategy from the virus and frequent hand-washing with soap and water especially before consuming food or touching the face is recommended.Managing diabetes levels is an absolute must. Diabetics should regularly monitor their blood glucose levels and adhere to any medication that they take to control the same. Neglecting diabetes or air pollution can be a serious health hazard in the pandemic times. However, by taking simple and effective steps as listed above, the diabetics can keep themselves safe and healthy even in this situation. -By Dr Manoj Chawla, Director and Consultant Diabetologist at Lina Diabetes Care & Mumbai Diabetes Research CentreDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the doctors are their independent professional judgment and we do not take any responsibility for the accuracy of their views.

AIIMS study confirms autoimmune disorders' link with air pollution,"NEW DELHI: Nearly two out of every 10 people in Delhi have pre-clinical autoimmunity. This has been confirmed by researchers from AIIMS who tested 500 apparently healthy people living in the city for over 10 years for markers of autoimmune disease like anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.Simply put, these people did not have autoimmune disease but they had positive autoantibodies, which pre-disposes them for having various autoimmune diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus among others.The result of the study, published in European Journal of Rheumatology, states that people residing within 200 metres of the main road had a higher prevalence of autoantibodies, for example ANA and RF, than those residing at or more than 250 metres away from the main road.In the AIIMS study, doctors found among those living within 200 metres of the main road, 12.5% had higher ANA levels. In comparison, 6.5% participants who lived more than 250 metres away from the main road had raised ANA levels. /Those living closer to the main road also had higher RF levels, which is a marker for Rheumatoid Arthritis that causes debilitating pain and deformity in the joints.Dr Uma Kumar, professor and head of the department of rheumatology at AIIMS, who led the research told TOI, in people suffering from autoimmune disorders, body's immune system attacks its own cells. ""In the past decade, the incidence of autoimmune disorders has risen tremendously. Our study shows that it is caused not only by genetic predisposition but environmental factors, such as prolonged exposure to air pollution, also play a role in it,"" she added.When inhaled, air pollutants can induce lung inflammation, promotion of oxidative stress triggering inflammatory pathways, and reformed immune system leading to autoantibody production which precedes development of clinical disease by many years, the AIIMS study says.Dr Kumar said they started the research to find a link between autoimmune disorders and pollution in 2013. Total 1,500 people were screened and of them, 500 healthy individuals who did not have any illness, acute or chronic, were tested for autoantibodies.""None of them has developed any autoimmune diseases as of now. We plan to continue monitoring their health for the next few years to assess whether and in how many years do these people with preclinical autoimmunity develop the disease,"" the AIIMS professor said.

"8,593 fresh cases in Delhi set grim record","NEW DELHI: Delhi on Wednesday recorded the highest single-day tally of 8,593 new Covid-19 cases and the health department confirmed 85 deaths in the last 24 hours.The previous high was on Tuesday, when the capital recorded 7,830 people cases.The sharp rise in cases suggests that the infection is spreading fast, and the rising number of deaths is an indication of people developing severe symptoms.Positivity rate up to 13.4% from less than 6% in JulyAccording to government data, the positivity rate of Covid-19 in Delhi is 13.4%. It had dropped to less than 6% in July, raising hopes that the crisis caused by the pandemic was receding.However, the situation has only worsened since then, with very few beds being available for Covid-19 patients, especially those requiring critical care. Doctors say if the infection doesn't get contained soon, the city's health infrastructure may collapse. ""I do not know if I will be able to get a bed on testing positive for Covid-19,"" said a senior doctor of one of Delhi's top private hospitals. /He said the hospital has put stretchers in the corridors to attend to the seriously-ill in emergency or until the patient gets a bed.""Patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, who can't find a bed, are seeking tele-consultations,"" said another doctor.Public health experts say urgent measures need to be enforced. ""Festive season shouldn't become an excuse to flout rules. It puts the person and family members at risk of contracting the infection and spreading it further, thereby extending the chain of transmission,"" doctors say.Until now, Delhi has recorded over 4.59 lakh Covid-19 cases and a total of 7,228 deaths due to the infection. Initially, it was believed that the infection mainly affected the lungs. However, new evidence suggests that the virus affects multiple organs, including heart, brain and pancreas, among others.Increase in air pollution over the past week has added to the crisis. Doctors say air pollution is causing more severe symptoms in Covid-19 patients, making recovery difficult. ""High-risk groups, for example elderly, those with co-morbidities especially respiratory problems, shouldn't venture out until the situation improves,"" said Dr Sandeep Nayar of BLK super-specialty hospital. ""So many people are moving around without masks in the markets. Many of them may be asymptomatic cases. If people wear masks, the risk of disease spread will reduce,"" he added.

The mood in India's fireworks capital,"The future is uncertain for the 1,070 units of the nearly century old fireworks industry that employs lakhs of workers in and around Sivakasi - the pyrotechnics capital of India. Hit by the pollution row over the past four years and Covid-19, the owners of the industries are clueless on the way forward.""By this time we would have the factories completely cleaned out with all the stocks dispatched. But due to the ban by various states and uncertainties some factories are left out with up to 20% of their annual stock. The future is so bleak,"" said vice-president of the Indian Fireworks Manufacturers Association A S Rajendra Raja. /""The loss cannot be recovered,"" he said, but feared if the situation persists they will be left with no option but to switch to other industries. ""Even then only the bigger units will be able to move on, the debt-ridden smaller ones may have to shut shop for good,"" he said.Among the last bids to survive the industry is trying to establish a CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute laboratory in Sivakasi and come up with more formulae for green fireworks, as the government-run research body has only been able to give a few formulae that is insufficient to manufacture the hundreds of varieties of fireworks. The manufacturers also hope the government will recognise green fireworks is legitimate and there won't be any further questions raised. Green fireworks being still a nascent idea and not yet offering a definitive solution, is seen with scepticism by the industry.The production has been steadily declining over the years from an estimated ?6,000 crore in 2016 to about ?3,500 in 2019. This has also meant that a few fireworks industrialists began to move out when stringent norms came into place to ensure workplace safety, as it proved to be an expensive one. A few more started to diversify when there was volatility in the market with the entry of fireworks from China. ""Some established education institutions and a handful established showrooms and furniture outlets while continuing the traditional fireworks industries,"" says Sivarajah Ramanathan the founder and CEO of Nativelead, an organisation promoting new-age entrepreneurship in nonmetro regions. However he observed that the fireworks industrialists are conservative in their investments, as they preferred expanding their existing business and not many were interested in diversifying beyond their familiar territory. Some were interested in real estate investments. Given the scenario the industry is going through, he said that they will approach more industrialists in the fireworks segment to become angel investors.Sivakasi town secretary of CPM K Murugan said the workers of the firecracker industry have been most affected. The beginning of the fall began in 2016. ""It began with demonetisation, followed by GST, green fireworks and Covid-19. Production is hit and the industry is affected by the pollution row. Workers are at the receiving end and are clueless about the future of their jobs,"" He said lakhs of people cannot be provided alternate jobs and all at one go and the government needs to step in.""If we are serious about solving the problem we should engage with the industry to see workers get transition to safer jobs,"" said environmentalist Shweta Narayan, while making it clear that green firecrackers are not an environmentally-friendly solution. Fireworks will disturb domestic as well as wild animals. ""Shock due to firecrackers affects birds and the smoke can cause death of insects. On the other hand it is a livelihood concern for lakhs of workers. We are not for an immediate ban. Workers need time to switch to other works,"" says environmentalist P R Viswanathan. He also suggested that the ban could begin with noisy fireworks and slowly phase out others over a period.Various states and union territories have decided to impose a ban on firecrackers and its sale ahead of the festivities due to the rising cases of coronavirus COVID-19 and growing air pollution in a few northern states. They are Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Chandigarh, Haryana , Karnataka and parts of Uttar Pradesh.Photo: K Antony Xavier For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"'Cracker ban is an administrative decision, needs right implementation'","Q.What is the effect of bursting crackers on air quality? • Millions of people burst crackers during Diwali which leads to immense pollution and smog in the air. Firecrackers mainly consist of sulphur, carbon and other chemicals for colouring and binding effects. Post the bursting and explosion of firecrackers, the chemical components, metal particles and dangerous toxins are released in the air and these toxic components stay for hours, contaminating the air and deteriorating the air quality index. /Q. What are the changes in air quality seen during the festival of Diwali?• On festival day, the average concentration of particulate matter 10 increases 35 times compared to a normal day before Diwali in cities like Vadodara and New Delhi. Similarly, concentration of sulphur dioxide has increased 23 times and NOx has increased 3 times on festival day. The trends vary in different parts of different cities. Q. How serious is the pollution caused due to firecrackers? What are its effects on human health? • Fireworks contain chemicals such as arsenic, sulphur, manganese, sodium oxalate, aluminium and iron dust powder, potassium perchlorate, strontium nitrate, barium nitrate and charcoal. Burning of firecrackers releases pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), suspended particles and several metals such as aluminium, manganese and cadmium, which are associated with serious health hazards. Q. What are the most dangerous components of firecrackers? • Among the pollutants, PM 2.5 particles are considered the most harmful as they are able to enter deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs. This can cause short-term health effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath, and in the long-term can affect lung function and worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease.Q. Is pollution from firecrackers worse or more impactful during winters? What about industrial and vehicular pollution? • Air pollution is worse in the winter months (October-January) as particles remain suspended in the air for longer duration of time due to the lower temperature, wind speed as well as higher relative humidity. Pollution due to firecrackers adds to this air pollution. PM 2.5 particles are produced from all types of combustion, including motor vehicles and power plants and some industrial processes. The increased air pollution levels during winters is a combination of all the above components. Q. We have seen that bans do not work effectively. Will a ban on crackers work? • A ban is an administrative decision which needs proper implementation and execution. A ban on firecrackers has an impact on air pollution levels as well as the livelihood of many working in the production of firecrackers. We need to understand the importance of reducing air pollution levels irrespective of a ban is in place or not. The committed efforts from all of us can help avoid health issues related to air pollution due to firecrackers. Q. Does bursting crackers affect people of all age groups? What are the short-term and long-term damages of this exposure? • Populations of certain age group are more susceptible to ambient air pollution due to firecrackers. This is more important for children and senior citizens who can experience irritation in the eyes, nose and increased chances of asthma attacks. Also, people who have recovered from Covid may end up having complications of severe cough and breathing difficulty. Q. What should be the general precautions to be followed by everyone during this festive season with regard to Covid? • Cases of Covid have sharply decreased in comparison to the past few months but there might be a second peak in the total number of cases. It is imperative that we don't let our guard down during the coming few months. There are some precautions to follow during the festival season. Avoid crowding in closed places. Parties with many people in closed rooms can be a source of spreading the Covid infection. If necessary meet in open areas restricting the number of people. The mask is often removed during eating food or having a drink. This can be a source of transmission. People should restrict to staying with close family members so that we can have more celebrations in the coming years. Carelessness on our part can cost the health of our near and dear ones which might ruin the festivities and celebrations.

"Garbage, mechanical, industrial waste being burnt, polluting air in Ambala despite strict instructions from NGT","AMBALA: Despite strict instructions from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) related to increasing air pollution amid Covid-19 pandemic, the Ambala city municipal corporation (MC) and district administration failed to check the burning of garbage, plastic waste by its sanitation workers and residents and also the mechanical and industry waste in the motor market and industrial areas.During a round of the city areas in Ambala on Friday, a large number of people were caught on camera while burning waste in open resulting in the release of dense black smoke in violation of the laid norms. Some mechanics were caught burning mechanical waste in Motor Market area on GT Road, in Ambala City. Industrial waste was caught being burnt along the nullah near Peer Dargah in the industrial area, Manmohan Nagar, Ambala. A resident was also caught burning garbage in open in Jasmeet Nagar area of Baldev Nagar, Ambala City.The fire incidents were brought to the knowledge of the concerned sanitation inspector of Ambala city MC, who assured of taking action.The matters being burnt include hazardous plastic, industrial, mechanical and domestic waste.On one side, following an increase in air pollution and the NGT orders, the Haryana government has instructed district administrations to ban use and sale of firecrackers up to November 30, but its civic bodies have failed to check the burning of waste in their jurisdictions, said the Ambala city residents.As per the bulletin of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Ambala has remained in 'poor' category recording a regular increase in the index value i.e. 258 on November 10; 274 on November 11; and 295 on November 12, with particulate matter (PM) of 2.5.Ambala does not have any garbage processing plant and in the absence of it, the civic body is struggling to manage the waste.Moreover, the door-to-door garbage collection service is suspended from past nearly one year now.Ambala based advocate Rohit Jain, who is also a leader of Congress party said, ""The garbage and waste is being burnt all over the city and the MC officials have failed to tackle this menace. /The residents cannot go out in the morning or evening for walk or jogging due to air pollution. This is the situation of home district of Haryana's urban local bodies' minister.""""With regards to air pollution and garbage burning by sanitation workers, we had filed a public utility services case at permanent lok adalat, Ambala in November 2019. The court awarded the decision against the MC and Ambala administration and it is in process of execution. In the upcoming MC elections, the ruling party will be contesting on the achievement of destruction rather than development"", added advocate Rohit.Onkar Singh of Ambala, a leader of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) said, ""The government has banned the firecracker after collecting license fee from the traders a few days before Diwali and it is registering cases against persons found selling and using the same. But it is completely ignoring the MC sanitation workers who are setting the garbage on fire in the open regularly. Stringent laws are being passed to penalize farmers for setting crop residue on fire but why industries, sanitation workers are and other violators are being spared.""Atul Ahuja of Sector 7, Ambala city a supporter of BJP said, ""The government has improved the infrastructure and the participation and awareness of residents is equally important in keeping the city pollution-free. The dustbins have been placed but what if the garbage is not being dumped into them by the residents.""Ambala city MC executive officer (EO) Virender Saharan said, ""We have issued strict instructions to the sanitation workers of not to set the garbage on fire. If anybody sets the garbage or waste on fire in city area, we have provision of issuing fines to the violators as per norms.""Ambala district municipal commissioner (DMC) Parth Gupta remained incommunicado.

Cooler days add to fear of worse post-Diwali air,"Kolkata: Letting a child light fireworks is to expose the kid to a massive amount of finer particulate matter. Fireworks leave the air so dirty every Diwali that it becomes equivalent for a kid to smoke multiple cigarettes. TOI ran a story on PM2.5 emission against different so-called benign fireworks. /This year, Diwali is happening quite late, with thermal inversion playing a greater role in trapping pollutants low in the atmosphere. The PM2.5 concentration in the city's air rose so badly after last Diwali that breathing turned as bad as smoking eight cigarettes. In 2018, it was equivalent to smoking 12.5 cigarettes. Significantly, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board's air quality records show that the deterioration of the air quality is rapid and vicious compared to a pre-Diwali day. Also, these are the 24 hours average of PM2.5 concentration. The hourly concentration figures were higher. Hourly PM2.5 count shot past 700g/m3 in Kolkata in Diwali 2019. The year before, it zoomed past 1,100g/m3. This year's festival is happening in the middle of November instead of October-end or beginning of November, and the pollutants may stay closer to the ground for a longer period of time due to cooler days, explained WBPCB scientists. There is a significant difference between the pre-Diwali and post-Diwali air quality. Data shows that on Diwali eve in 2019, the PM2.5 concentration was 28.1g/m3. A day after Diwali, it rose more than 100% to 58.9g/m3. Since fireworks continued even a day after Diwali, the PM2.5 count rose further to 175.6g/m3.""Data also shows that the city's air fails to recup-erate from the onslaught. The particulate load starts piling up in the lower strata of the atmosphere and Kolkata's pollution gradually overtakes that of Delhi,"" said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environmental activist. Particulate matter the size of PM2.5, which is 30 times finer than human hair, is considered dangerous since it can reach the deepest portions of the lung. It is declared a class 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and is also linked to heart disease and respiratory ailments. ""It plays havoc with vital organs. In fact, air pollution kills more people worldwide each year than AIDS, malaria, diabetes or tuberculosis,"" said Arup Haldar, a senior pulmonologist with Woodlands and Columbia Asia Hospital.

Air pollution to rise in Pune despite curbs on firecrackers,"PUNE: Covid-19 patients who have recently recovered, senior citizens and people with hypertension, diabetes and heart ailments must stay indoors as much as possible during Diwali. Pune's air quality, which is likely to plunge to ""very poor"", will affect them badly./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/The pollution will take a toll even though firecracker emissions are expected to be 50% less than previous Diwalis.The forecast from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) for this Diwali has said the pollution will affect those with co-morbidities, children, elderly, those with respiratory issues and Covid-19 patients.The state government has banned the use of crackers in some districts due to the pandemic, but the Pune Municipal Corporation has banned them only in open grounds, gardens, schools and tourist spots.""With Diwali falling in mid-November this year, when winter temperatures have already set in, air pollution is already relatively high. Even with 50% less cracker activity in comparison to the 2016-18 Diwali period, air quality is predicted to deteriorate to the lower end of very poor by November 15, the day following Laxmi Puja, the main Diwali day when crackers are burst in abundance,"" the IITM forecast said.Due to the low temperatures, the height of the atmosphere's mixing layers is likely to be low and winds are expected to be calm, leading to accumulation of pollutants closer to the ground. Hence, faster deterioration of air quality is expected, the forecast added.Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra's Covid task force, told TOI that the vulnerable population must wear masks and maintain physical distancing if they venture out. ""The virus may stay longer in polluted air, filled with suspended particulate matter. Particulate matter directly affects lung condition. It may also expose one to a more severe form of Covid-19 infection,"" he said.Joshi said those who have suffered from Covid-19 in the last 90 days should also stay indoors as lung conditions can worsen in poor, cold air.Reinfection in such cases is also not ruled out, Joshi said. ""People who have Covid-19 may also find the infection getting severe after exposure to polluted, emission-filled cold air,"" he pointed out.Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on control measures, said, ""Covid-19 patients or those predisposed to the virus must stay at home for at least four days during Diwali till cracker-related pollution has dispersed. I strongly recommend that those with comorbidities, irrespective of the age, must remain indoors during this period, away from the deadly combination of pollution and cold air. They must seek immediate medical help in case of fever and breathlessness.""Salunke said a sudden, concentrated exposure to polluted air in case of those who have conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can predispose them to Covid infection.WHO experts have said that exposure to air pollution will increase the risk of diseases of the respiratory system, like Covid-19. It will increase the susceptibility, and the vulnerability. This double burden must be tackled by addressing it and the causes of bad air which could exacerbate those diseases and make the patients, the population, more vulnerable to the disease and to the severity of developing a more serious illness.

They have requested the traders to limit the celebrations to the confines of their homes this year in a bid to stop the spread of the virus and protect families, employees and customers. In their circulars issued to members, the trade organizations also urged avoiding bursting crackers and favouring lighting candles and diyas instead. /According to sources, several businessmen in the markets in central Kolkata are either suffering or have recovered from the disease. The rush of shoppers in Burrabazar and adjoining markets had raised an alarm in the run-up to Diwali with police stressing on the need for social distancing and wearing masks in public. However, very few were seen following the safety guidelines. ""We do not want a deluge of cases after Diwali. It will not only be dangerous for the traders, but also for their employees, customers and their families. This year, all of us will have to take the pledge to prioritize health and safety over celebrations because the pandemic is not over yet. We work in very thickly crowded markets where people come from different parts of the state. We don't want a spike in the number of cases after the festival and put others at risk. Once the pandemic is over, we can celebrate our festivals with much more fervour,"" said Sushil Poddar, president of the Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations (CWBTA), an umbrella body of several trade organizations. The trade organizations have also advised their members to use digital tools to communicate with extended family and friends to exchange greetings instead of visiting their homes. ""Several platforms provide the facility of video calling, which we must use extensively at this time to greet our family and friends. Visiting homes to exchange Diwali greetings will increase the risk of contracting the virus,"" said Bijoy Nag, general secretary of the Harrison Road Traders' Welfare Association. There is a consensus among members of the business community this year to avoid fireworks and switch to lighting diyas and candles to protect those with co-morbidities. ""Air pollution can wreak havoc and worsen the condition of those already suffering. So, we have requested our members to follow the guidelines provided by the government,"" said Poddar.

Special teams visit stubble burning spotsin New Town,"Kolkata: The resistance group teams, formed to prevent stubble burning that has been causing heavy air pollution in New Town, inspected on Friday the places in Action Area -II, from where such incidents were being reported in the past few weeks. Officials from the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), along with civic volunteers and locals, found stubble burning at two spots near the Silicon Valley plot. ""The grass was being burnt behind a road side stall. Locals doused it as soon as we reached the spot. There was another spot a few metres away, from where some smoke was billowing out,"" said Kingshuk Chakraborty, a local who accompanied the team. Six to eight volunteers will be moving on bikes across New Town, especially the surrounding area of Silicon Valley land and Action Area II, where most stubble burning cases are being reported. They will be provided with NKDA uniforms for their identity. Awareness drives through announcements will be conducted on behalf of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), a New Town-based NGO.

Air quality in Aurangabad improves,"Aurangabad: The citizens of Aurangabad have been breathing cleaner air this year as compared to the previous year, official data available with the regional office of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) shows.As per MPCB data, the air quality index (AQI) of Aurangabad was in the range of 25 to 70 during April to November which falls in the category of good to satisfactory. The parameter concerned was hovering in the range of 69 to 77 during the corresponding period last year which is considered as only satisfactory.""Aurangabad city has witnessed improvement in air quality as compared to last year. The relatively lesser movement of vehicular traffic this year due to outbreak of Covid-19 is one of the key reasons for drop in the air-pollution,"" MPCB authorities said. /The AQI in the range of 0-50 is referred as good and considered to have minimal impact whereas the range 51-100 is known as satisfactory. It may cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. The high AQI levels 101-200 and 201-300 are counted as moderately polluted and poor air quality respectively. The moderately polluted air may cause breathing discomfort to people with lung disease such as asthma and discomfort to people with heart disease, children and veterans. The poor air quality offers risk of breathing discomfort to people on prolonged inhaling and problems to people with heart disease. The AQI above 200 is considered as very poor and severe air quality depending upon the concentration of air pollutants and poses risk to public health. Green activist Prashant Gire said that the increased number of plantations in and around Aurangabad can put a check on air-pollution. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Kol shows restraint, keeps air free of toxic fumes","Kolkata: Unlike earlier Kali Pujas or Diwalis, the city's air quality index did not go through the roof on Saturday and it was the cracker ban that made all the difference. Courtesy of the court ban and compliance by the public, the high amount of particulate matter that usually gets released into the air due to fireworks was absent this time. ""It is largely because of the shift in focus from noise to air pollution. /Till now, thanks to the Calcutta High Court order, we were mandated to control noise pollution by prohibiting high-decibel fireworks. But the court banned all fireworks this year. Later, the NGT and the Supreme Court, too, championed the same cause. Naturally, the focus shifted from noise to air. Since air pollution entails all kinds of fireworks, it made all the difference,"" said a WBPCB officer.""The low-decibel yet high-emission fireworks never come under enforcement. So, over time, these high-emission fireworks have gained popularity. The more dazzling the fireworks, the higher is the emission level. In 2019, the PM2.5 concentration rose to 700, nearly 12 times the permissible limit,"" said a WBPCB scientist.Controlling air pollution had become a huge challenge for enforcement agencies. But Covid changed plans. ""Covid did what we could not achieve despite our long battle against fireworks polluting the air,"" said Subhas Datta, an environment activist.The frontline health experts also raised a timely alert about the havoc that foul air can cause. ""These inputs were considered by the judiciary before passing the order,"" said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, another activist. However, it is largely due to the people's exemplary restraint that the endeavour was successful. Although there were some pockets of aberrations, the overall impact has been good. Barring Rabindra Bharati University (RBU), monitoring stations recorded AQI to be under 200. At RBU, the AQI rose beyond 200 (poor) after noon, and gradually rose to 226 at 8pm. ""The spike happened at noon when there were no fireworks. So it might have been due to smoke from the Pramod Nagar dumping site,"" said a WBPCB officer. ""AQI remained within the moderate level across the continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations, which was a big change,"" said Sudipto Bhattacharya of Saviours and Friends of Environment.Social scientist Pradip Chakraborty said, ""The pandemic has instilled empathy among citizens as they saw death in the neighbourhood. These were jolts to people who had no awareness about the environment, leading to a large number of people suddenly taking keen interest in the environment and air quality."" ""Ultimately it is people's awareness that matters. I know a friend who used to spend a few lakhs on  fireworks. This time he spent only on LED lamps to decorate his house. It is a welcome change. I think a lot of kids also persuaded their parents not to buy fireworks,"" said Ajay Mittal of Bengal Clean Air Network.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Residents in many housing societies forego crackers,"Nashik: Residents of many housing societies across the city have decided to forego bursting firecrackers against the backdrop of the state government's appeal to avoid fireworks that can lead to air pollution and cause respiratory problems among Covid-19 patients.""In our society - Saptshrungi Avenue on Nashik Road - we have decided not to burst firecrackers individually. This means that none of the residents would burst crackers. Instead, we will go for small tikkiyas, not only cutting down on sound but also smoke,"" Santosh Patel, one of the residents, said. /The decision was not binding, but people still have decided to abide by it, he added. ""People have taken this decision despite the habit of bursting crackers every year,"" Manisha Saindane, of Anant housing society, at Pathardi Phata, added.Meanwhile, the residence of Sankalp Society said the state's appeal have moved them. Also, going by what is taught to schoolchildren about firecrackers, all the families have decided to celebrate a no-cracker Diwali from this year onwards. ""All 12 families in the society would be collectively saving about Rs 60,000,"" said Sanjana Kulkarni, a resident.Firecracker stall owners, however, are worried. Though the stall owners were expecting the sales to be good, at least on the first day of Diwali, the trade figures have not been encouraging. ""The business improved on Friday, but it is nowhere near the volume of business last year,"" said Kshitij Gholap, a resident of Nashik.Firecracker stall owners said last year, 80% of the stock were was sold out by Laxmi puja. This year, only 40% of the goods have been sold. ""This is a worrisome figure. Many people had invested large amounts in the business and have not got the returns,"" Rakesh Yeola, resident of Baglan, said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Track the pollution level in your city,"Exclusive! Rupali Ganguli, Dalljiet Kaur, Himansh Kohli, Vahbiz Dorabjee, Nausheen Ali Sardar on the berserk socialising in Diwali and COVID-19 warning: ""We are being foolish""","Delhi along with three other States - Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan - has added the most number of COVID-19 cases in the last 48 hours. Doctors meanwhile have warned that high levels of air pollution can only increase the risk of getting infected. Moreover, the cold is all above us- a season which too can accentuate the invasion of the virus. But the behaviour of people in even other states smacks of a COVID-fatigue that has set in. /People are going out in this Diwali time with gay abandon and thrown caution to the wind.ETimes TV spoke to some TV actors for their message to the people in today's alarming times. This is what they conveyed:Rupali Ganguly: We are just being foolish. We want to make noise, why can't we bajao some taalis? Do we love smoke? We want to wear nice clothes, what's wrong with the ones we bought last year? Have we outgrown them? Believe me, I am lighting only a few diyas and using the same lights of last year. I am not shopping for a single new outfit this Diwali. They say that the second wave can hit us, but when did the first one go away? My close friend is down with COVID in an ICU. When will we understand?Himansh Kohli: This Diwali is not the usual Diwali like every other year. But so what, why can't we just accept that? First and foremost, let all those who're living have a sense of gratitude that they're alive to see Diwali 2020. Let us stop taking it lightly. My parents are in Delhi- a place which is choking, my 58-year old neighbour has died due to COVID and let's all open our eyes to the sufferings of the people. What purpose will the crackers serve except choke our lungs furthermore? As for the shopping and the hugging-kissing greetings that are being exchanged, it is so foolish that people are indulging in such activities. I am not shopping for sure, our office puja which is normally a big thing was also conducted very quietly. If at all I am buying flowers and diyas, I buy them from roadside vendors whose survival is difficult rather than the shops whose owners are better off- else the mantra 'we should help each other' is mere lip service.Dalljiet Kaur: I went to Dubai last week and there seemed to be no concept of COVID out there. People were not wearing masks and intermingling aaram se. I asked a couple of them why they were not masked, they said 'it doesn't matter'. I realised that each one of them had formed a bio-bubble of his/her own. So what I want to say is that rather than castigating others over their card parties or anything else that doesn't go down well with you, first look within yourself and decide if you are doing all that it takes. I see too many people mixing up with too many people. Why not have a circle of 5-6 people around whom your life revolves for the next few months? Nausheen Ali Sardar: I went to a birthday party with a mask, but while clicking pictures we had taken off the mask. Thereafter, my family has told me not to try and push my luck. So, I have called off a get-together which I was organising with my friends and relatives; my Diwali plans thus stand cancelled. It's really time we understand. The picture ahead is not anything that we can relax about, until the COVID vaccine hits the market.Vahbiz Dorabjee: The vaccine has not yet come, but the people have started taking it lightly again. What can the government do? I am in Pune with my parents and I was in Mumbai for a few days. I was shocked to see the amount of traffic and how people have said goodbye to precautions. People seem to have got a feeling that COVID is only asymptomatic and everyone will get it for some days and be alright again. In this on-going pandemic, I have lost some people and I know. It's not only about Diwali, believe me, the panic seems to have gone. Whatever is happening is simply ridiculous. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Cracker ban goes up in smoke in west UP, AQI stays in severe zone on Diwali night","Meerut/Agra/Bareilly: Air pollution soared in most cities of western UP, including the NCR, as people took to the streets to burst crackers on Saturday night. The Deepawali night's haze stayed till Sunday afternoon when some parts received drizzle which gave a breathing respite. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Agra was in the ""very poor"" category on Sunday. /The level of pollution post-Diwali in 2019 was ""moderate"", better than this year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said.According to data available on CPCB website which monitors air pollution in more than 100 cities across the country pointed out that the AQI in 2019 on the day of Diwali was 100 (satisfactory). However it rose to 319 (very poor) this year on the same day. Similarly, post-Diwali, the AQI was 179 (moderate) in 2019. But, on Sunday it reached 347. The state government's attempt to ban the use of fire crackers in 13 cities including Agra appeared ineffective as the level of pollution increased.The pollution control board is also in the process of analysing the data pre and post Diwali. Confirming this, regional officer of Agra pollution control board Bhuvan Yadav said that a third party is preparing the information and soon they will have the entire analysis of the pollutants, including PM 2.5, 10 and others in the air across the city.Meanwhile, rain accompanied by hailstorms in Mathura and other parts of western cities gave some respite.Meerut recorded an AQI of 373 which was in the ""very poor"" category. But it was better than neighbouring districts like Baghpat which registered an AQI of 430, Bulandshahr with AQI of 427 in the ""severe category"".
