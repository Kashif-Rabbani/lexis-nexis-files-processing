"Indoor, outdoor pollution puts women at higher risk: Studies","MUMBAI: Women, especially in lower income countries like India, bear the brunt of air pollution due to the dual exposure to indoor as well as outdoor pollutants. This was the gist of a discussion on 'Women's Health and Air Pollution' organized by the Columbia Global Center on Tuesday.""Many research studies conducted in the marginalized sectors of India show that women who use biomass are exposed to brown carbon that is dangerous,"" said Dr Jeanine D'Armiento from Columbia University in New York. Her colleagues Dr Mary Beth Terry and Dr Jasmine McDonald participated in the discussion along with Dr Qamar Rahman from Amity University in Lucknow.The speakers highlighted the current state of research regarding particulate matter and the rising cases of early onset breast cancer and the impact of burning fossil fuels on health. /As exposure to environmental toxins could lead to cardiovascular and neurological diseases and various types of cancer, the experts underlined the need to spread awareness about the link between health and air pollution.Dr Terry said her studies underlined the need to understand the effect of exposure to air pollutants, pesticides and other toxins on women's health during pregnancy and menopause. ""The early onset of breast cancer in Indian women is a cause of serious concern,"" said Dr McDonald.""There is a need to include occupational health courses in universities to educate young women who are the future of the nation,"" said Dr Rahman.The event was attended by students, representatives from NGOs and civil society organisations, doctors and researchers from institutions such as The Gender Lab, KEM Hospital, Cancer Institute (WIA), Asia Society India Centre, World Bank, King George's Medical Institute, among others.

"After food safety, city gets ready to tackle pollution","Bhopal: Collector Tarun Pithode, on Wednesday, announced the administration's place to tackle air pollution in the state capital.A drive against adulteration is already underway in the city and the district administration now wants to club it with air pollution to launch - 'Pure Food, Pure Air' campaign.Talking to TOI after a review meeting of all departments involved in the execution of the 'District Environment Plan, Pithode said all petrol pumps have been asked to necessarily install PUC machines by December 15. In case the instructions are not followed, the petrol pumps would be sealed and their licenses would be suspended.The official said, mining department has been asked to ensure that a sprinkler is installed in all crushers to reduce the amount of dust generated by them.The collector also said that RTO would launch a campaign to ensure that all vehicles have PUC certification and action is taken on modified vehicles plying on the roads. He said that parents of minor children driving vehicles will be penalised. Directions have also been given to cancel permits of all 'unfit' vehicles.RTO would also hold joint camps with Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) for pollution check in vehicles.Pithode said, officials of the school education department have been asked to organise workshops on sanitation and air pollution in schools and motivate students to promote cleanliness and help in curbing pollution.He said, instructions to stop burning of tyres, tubes, plastic, stubble and tar on the roadside, have been issued.The collector said, in order to reduce presence of dust in environment, roads should be repaired at the earliest, water should be regularly sprinkled on the roads, green net should be necessarily put up on construction sites and solid waste should not be disposed of by burning.Instructions have also been issued for regular check on smoke and effluents discharged by factories and plants. /Use of ripper in harvesters has also been made compulsory.Under the plan, Capital PROJECT Administration (CPA) and forest department will undertake intensive afforestation programme, all the marriage gardens would be motivated for eco-friendly marriages where there is less sound pollution.He said people from all walks of life, NGOs, unions of bus drivers, auto drivers, traders, contractors, builders, students and all the other stakeholders should be brought on board in efforts to improve air quality in the city and MPPCB would undertake intensive campaigning to motivate them for the purpose.

Remote-sensing tech to check on stubble burning,"Kolkata: The state pollution control board has signed a deal with ISRO and IIT-Delhi to collect images and data of stubble burning from the space so that SPs and DMs can take immediate action against errant farmers. With PCB's study showing trans-border emission contributing to degradation of Kolkata's air, the agency wants realtime preventive measures. /Remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS) and global positioning system (GPS) technology would be used to collect the data so that immediate action could be taken against errant farmers, said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra. ""Stubbles are often set on fire owing to the narrow gap between two crops cycles. Bengal can have three crop cycles. Despite a sustained campaign by the agriculture department, stubble burning takes place. National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration data shows burning of crop residual in rural Bengal is significant and adversely affects the ambient air."" This move would help authorities control pollution, said a WBPCB official.NASA, US, has been keeping a watch on burning of crops since 2012 and has been releasing satellite images each year. Two years ago, NASA's imagery captured by the Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's aqua satellite showed large tracts of land shrouded in smoke.Using the data, WBPCB will also create probability maps to alert government agencies about areas, where chances of stubble burning were high. The system can also track pollution load from stubble burning in places neighbouring the national capital, using satellite data. It can predict the air pollution level for the next 72 hours and forecast the levels of pollutants, coming from sources other than stubble burning. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
WHO contradicts Javadekar's views on pollution and lifespan,"Nagpur: The World Health Organization (WHO), a specialized agency of the United Nations working on international public health, has rebuked Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar for stating that there is no linkage between air pollution and reduced lifespan. ""We wish it didn't kill people but unfortunately it does,"" said WHO officials. The minister, while speaking in the Parliament on Friday, strongly stressed that there was no Indian study to prove the impact of air pollution on public health. Javadekar further told the house not to ""create fear psychosis among people"".Speaking to TOI from the ongoing COP 25 meet in Madrid, WHO director (public health) Dr Maria Neira asserted that strong scientific evidences show exposure to pollution has a major impact on people's health.""Independent of which methodology is used or what are the estimates, it is urgent to take action because the levels of air pollution in certain cities in India are very high and this is definitely having an impact on the health of citizens. /The evidence is available and so are the interventions, the expertise is there and so is the plan of action. We urge the Indian government, which has enormous amounts of expertise and competencies, to do its best in tackling the sources of air pollution and reducing toxic pollutants that citizens are exposed to at the moment,"" said Dr Neira.Also reacting to the minister's statement was WHO'S Climate Lead Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum. ""We have brought together and analysed tens of thousands of studies showing effect of air pollution on health from every population of the world. We are yet to find a study which shows any population, including India, which is immune from the health impacts of air pollution,"" he said.Questioning the reliability of the existing studies, Javadekar had also stated that they were not based on first-generation data. Reacting on this, a top doctor from the biggest government hospital in the country who did not want to be named, said, ""Taking first-generation data is next to impossible as it is a very long procedure. Though there are no long-term studies available in India, we can look at the global data and extrapolate it to the Indian population. While there can be few marginal errors in modelling studies, they can't be completely inaccurate,"" he said.The doctor added that various international studies show that long-term exposure to high-level air pollution can have an overall effect on the lifespan. Replying to a Lok Sabha query in 2015, Javadekar had himself cited an epidemiological study on 'Ambient air quality, respiratory symptoms and lung function of children in Delhi'. Jointly carried out by the Central Pollution Control Board and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, the results showed lung function reduction in 43.5% schoolchildren of Delhi as compared to 25.75% of the controlled group. ""High level of particulate pollution increases the risk of various diseases including respiratory and cardiovascular,"" Javadekar had stated.Highlighting more on the health impacts, top interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat said, ""There is enough evidence that ambient air pollution is equally responsible for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which was only attributed to smokers. It is now the third-largest killer in the world.""A comprehensive study published by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in December last year had highlighted that the average life expectancy in India would have been 1.7 years higher if the air pollution levels were less than the minimal level causing health loss. Stating that one in eight deaths in India in 2017 can be attributed to air pollution, the study said that there were 6.7 lakh deaths due to outdoor particulate matter air pollution and 4.8 lakh deaths due to household air pollution.

"Riding bicycles to work, carpooling and using public transport:Celebs bat for green travel to fight pollution","Even as northern India battles with severe air pollution, on the occasion of National Pollution Control Day (December 2) celebrities tell us about the measures they have taken to curb pollution and how they are doing their bit for a greener tomorrow.'We should adopt a green lifestyle'Sonu Sood believes that keeping urban India green is important. He says, ""We need to start planting more trees and stop cutting down the existing ones. I think we should adopt an eco-friendly lifestyle, ride a bicycle to work, use public transport, opt for car pooling and have more private vehicles operating on CNG. The Metro rail also helps cut down pollution to a large extent.""Sonu Sood'I always make sure my car's fuel-efficient' Aparshakti Khurana, who was in Delhi last month, says the poor air quality caught him unawares. He says, ""The problem of air pollution is severe in urban India, especially Delhi, where I saw people in pollution masks. /It was a scary sight. We should opt for carpool, encourage CNG in vehicles and have fuel-efficient cars. He adds that he makes ""sure that my car is fuel-efficient and maintained. We should be responsible citizens and keep our environment pollution-free. Clean air is our birthright.""Aparshakti Khurana'I like to carpool with my family or friends' Like his celeb counterparts, Vijayendra Kumeria also thinks it's important to plant trees and not cut them down. ""Most urban households have at least 2-3 cars. One must try to minimise the use of vehicles and opt for carpooling. Electric cars are the future, provided we get smooth and adaptable services and infrastructure,"" he says. Vijayendra adds that on a personal level, he's ensured that the housing society he lives in has ""installed a biodegradable machine to dispose of waste. We do not burn leaves or trash. Also, I prefer to carpool with my family or friends, when we are headed to the same location.""Vijayendra Kumaria'Use public transport to work'Avinash Mishra, who has lived in both Delhi and Mumbai, feels that most millennials don't like to walk and instead take pride in flaunting latest models of cars and bikes. He says, ""Parents must encourage their kids to use public transport."" Avinash also recommends use of ""public transport to work. Whenever I get time, I join social events, rallies on streets, be it for Aarey, tree plantation, where I do my bit to generate awareness among the youth. Recently, along with some activists, I planted trees on an entire street of Goregaon.""Avinash Mishra'Burning waste should be banned'Sophie Choudry, who had been to Delhi recently, admits that she hadn't ever imagined that she'd be walking in and around CP ""wearing a mask!"" ""I think every one of us needs to take strict measures to bring pollution levels down. Burning of waste or any trash in open should be made a punishable offence. Crackers should not be burst even during weddings,"" she says. Sophie also suggests using ""more fuel-efficient cars and adopting car pooling, sharing cars, taxis with friends and family. I try to walk as much as I can (especially when I have to cover a smaller stretch). When I am going out, I try to travel with my friends in the same car, and do car-pooling when going out of town, which gives me time with my friends and is my bit in being conscious about my environment.""Sophie Choudry'Electric cars are need of the hour' Mrunal Thakur thinks it's sad that even a basic essential like fresh air is a luxury in urban India. She says, ""Vehicles emitting smoke should be banned. I think the need of the hour is electric cars with proper charging and servicing facilities. As a celeb and as a responsible citizen, Mrunal believes in keeping her surroundings clean. ""Segregating waste must be a part of our habit,"" she says.Mrunal Thakur'I prefer walking to cars'Debina Bonnerjee takes her role as a responsible citizen seriously. She says, ""What we give is what we get back, because nature does not take anything from us. We have contributed to the pollution in our cities."" As a fitness enthusiast, Debina says, ""If you can't go for a morning jog, walk. Whenever I'm vacationing, I walk all the way from my hotel to the destination, wearing my sports shoes. I love walking and avoid using cars - it keeps me healthy and I am also doing by bit for environment.""Debina Bonnerjee'Fighting pollution is a collective effort' Shashank Vyas is of the opinion that celebs need to create more awareness about preserving the environment. ""Fighting pollution is a collective effort. It's not just about making a statement. I'm worried about the well-being of the next generation."" On a personal level, Shashank doesn't drive at all and prefers taking ""public transport, especially Metro"". ""For smaller distances, I prefer taking a rickshaw or even pedalling, which is a great cardio workout for me,"" he says.Shashank Vyas'It seriously breaks my heart to see the condition of Delhi when I visited two weeks back'Aashka Goradia is of opinion that this is not about anyone, but our children.""Sometimes I feel that there is nothing that a person can say or do , which will change or help the situation, when we are living in the times of orchestrated callousness. And it seriously breaks my heart to see the condition of Delhi when I visited two weeks back. I wonder what kids are growing up inhaling. Health for now is challenged and so is for the future. All we need is to take collective measures like stop burning crackers, car-pooling, more CNG vehicles and fuel efficient cars on the road that will have a great impact. And burning crackers is something that I have given up. It seems just unnecessary now. Spreading awareness is half if certain level of grave concern and fear of losing health is not instilled in people's minds. I strongly feel that this is not about anyone; this is about our children; so let's behave well for them. Also, if each one of us starts behaving more consciously towards nature and resources, things can be changed for better.""Aashka Goradia'Endorsing a life close to nature, sensitizing parents through kids is the immediate need''Viineet Kumar Singh encourages people to cycle and use public transport.""We need to get together to control pollution at all levels that can't be done overnight, because this condition, especially in Delhi, has not emerged suddenly. It's extremely sad that we need to put a mask and step out of our houses, and I am afraid that time doesn't come that we need to wear a mask inside our homes. Small things like planting more trees stop cutting down of existing trees, adopting alternate of diesel and petrol vehicles, and taking care of vehicles emitting smoke while running on roads in whooping numbers, use of public  transport and cycle more, should become our habit. Most importantly, topics related to all kinds of pollution, harmful use of plastics, saving the planet etc must be introduced in kids syllabus, with an aim to educate and generate awareness and sensitizing parents, who can contribute in giving a green clean and pollution free planets to their kids to survive. Also, village life must be endorsed to encourage people to get close to nature.""Viineet Kumar Singh'I have made walking quite often in my routine'Mrunal Jain says that one should walk often that keeps one fit and healthy""First thing first, there is a dire need to keep a stern check on the POC and CO2 levels of vehicles emitting fuel, and they must be immediately banned. Then comes, burning of trash that's causing immense air pollution and smog in the air. Also, water pollution needs to be checked as throwing of trash into the water adds to existing pollution. I have a basic and common principle that I religiously follow and that is-things that I do not do inside my house, I ensure not to do it outside too. A lot of infrastructure has built up in Mumbai and Delhi that might bring these cities on top in terms of infrastructure and layout, but it's a big blow to our environment as well as upcoming generation. If I'm going out on longer distances, I ensure that I am going in for pooling. Also, I am a fitness freak, so I don't' mind walking to the gym, which is a kind of great fitness exercise for me. If I have to go from one building to another or even for 1-2 km stretch, I walk quite often. What all I do is that I call up and talk to some friend or anyone over the phone and start walking continuously to my destination, and before I realize, I reach the destination. I just love to do this.""Mrunal Jain For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Curb graft and pollution, bus commuters tell mayor","Nagpur: Mayor Sandip Joshi on Monday warned Aapli Bus programme manager - DIMTS - of action if it did not take remedial measures to curb corruption by conductors who are pocketing bus fares. The mayor also directed DIMTS to keep buses emitting black smoke off roads.He issued the instructions after interacting with commuters at a couple of bus stops - Akashwani Square, near Vidhan Bhavan Square and Mor Bhavan. The mayor was accompanied by transport committee chairman Bunty Kukde, deputy municipal commissioner (NMC) and transport manager Rajesh Mohite, administrative officer Ravindra Page and representatives of red bus operators and DIMTS.Commuters told Joshi that maintenance of city buses has taken a back seat and it is resulting in a lot of air pollution. /""Despite many complaints, neither the operators nor the programme manager have taken any measures to curb the black smoke,"" was the general complaint of the commuters. ""Commuters also pointed out that conductors in most buses do not issue tickets despite collecting fares,"" Kukde told TOI. The transport panel's chairman admitted that corruption by conductors has increased manifold and it is resulting in financial loss to the already cash-strapped NMC.Kukde informed the mayor that the programme manager has failed to increase the number of commuters using Aapli buses. Even revenue collected from commuters in the form of fares has not increased since the NMC took over the city bus operation.Commuters also complained about the rude behaviour of conductors and drivers. At times, buses do not halt at designated stops, they alleged. After getting first hand information from commuters, the mayor instructed the transport department to conduct a programme to enhance the soft skills of the Aapli Bus staff.At the Mor Bhavan city bus terminus, the functioning of the NMC's public works department irked the mayor after passengers drew his attention towards eight damaged and incomplete platforms. The transport department officials informed the mayor that the PWD left the construction of eight platforms midway two years ago. Later, the mayor directed the PWD to complete the construction of platforms within a month.Bus conductors and drivers also aired their grievances. They requested the mayor for a salary hike by urging him to hold meetings with the three bus operators and two ticketing agencies. The mayor assured them that a meeting would be convened soon. While interacting with commuters, the mayor also travelled with them in Aapli Buses on two routes - Vidhan Bhavan Square and Mor Bhavan, Sitabuldi. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Solo flight turns into a combined effort,"Who better than a pilot would know the dirty picture of air pollution produced by waste burning. During my tenure as a wing commander in the Indian Air Force, I would often get a top view of places shrouded in smoke emitted from burning of trash.The only mitigation strategy I started contemplating upon was waste minimization. When I shifted to Nagpur in 2014, the first thing I did was to make a compost pit near the common garden area of our residential society in Seminary Hills area.I started filling it up with wet kitchen waste and leaf litter. /After some coaxing, few other families too started doing the same. When the compost was ready, we started using it for plants and our flower pots. Apart from this, I also utilize my kitchen waste for preparing natural fertilizers using earthen pots. The process is quite simple - first, make three holes at the bottom of the pot and put it on a container. Fill it with an initial four-inch layer of dry leaves, followed by biodegradable waste items like food, citrus fruits, vegetable peels etc. After sprinkling two spoons of decomposer powder on the mixture, cover it properly and leave it for 15 days. Organic and chemical-free compost would be ready.Plastic continues to be the most hazardous for humans as well as environment. To tackle it at an individual level, I have started collecting empty bottles of mineral water and cold drinks. I fill up these bottles with light-weight plastic items like used milk pouches and wrappers. During my walks in Seminary Hills, I collect all the plastic waste littered road side.Taping all this together, I make sitting stools which can be kept indoors as well as in gardens. Though most cities are struggling to treat piles of unsegregated waste, there continues to be a lack of consciousness among citizens. To make certain that our dumping yards do not get over-burdened with municipal solid waste, we need to reduce the waste generated at our homes.Don't throw away papers or cardboards, instead sell them off to recyclers. Target utilizing and recycling as much as domestic waste as you can. Only then we can clean up the trash mountains.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air that we breathe getting worse by the day, NGT warning goes up in smoke","Bhopal: More than a year after the principal bench of National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked all the states and Union territories to prepare an action plan to improve air quality in 102 'non-attainment' cities across the country, including Bhopal, air quality in the state capital has only been deteriorating.As on Monday (December 9, 2019), air quality index (AIQ) at Bhopal according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data at 12 noon was 277 (poor) and at 6 pm, 274 (poor). CPCB boards displaying air quality index (AQI) in the city showing the reading in the range of 200 to 280 is not a rare occurrence for Bhopal, but a regular feature. Once it goes beyond 300, Bhopal, whose air quality and greenery were once the pride of its people, would be rated ""very poor"" in AQI and quite close to Delhi in terms of air pollution.The four-member NGT bench comprising its chairman Justice A K Goel, while talking about the necessity to urgently execute an action plan to reduce air quality in 102 cities across the country identified as ""non-attainment"" cities, had also referred to health hazards of exposure to polluted air. ""According to a survey, 15000 persons died prematurely in Delhi in 2016"", observed the principal bench of the NGT while issuing orders for the long term and short term plans to reduce the pollution level. /Premature deaths in Mumbai, Kolkota, Bangalore and Chennai are between 5000 to 10,000 in 2016, the NGT had observed. ""Altogether 102 cities were identified as non-attainment cities, which means these cities which do not meet the national ambience air quality standards (NAAQS)"", said a TOI report while referring to NGT order of October 8, 2018. Agreeing with the fears expressed by the NGT over serious health hazards that exposure to polluted air may pose, head of department of chest medicine at Gandhi Medical College Dr Lokendra Dave said, ""The respiratory system is the first to be hit by exposure to polluted air. There will be more asthma and pneumonia cases if the air quality in the city is poor. Prolonged exposure to polluted air may lead to cancer. If there is more suspended particulate matter in the air as is the case with Bhopal, incidence of cardiac arrest also rises as the particulate matter penetrates through the lungs to inner vital organs, leading to cardiac arrest and paralysis. It is not only the body, even the brain is affected by exposure to polluted air. It's dangerous both for the physical and mental health"". The NGT had asked all states to formulate an action plan within two months for the most polluted cities in their respective state, but it was only recently that Bhopal administration started showing some concern towards rising air pollution in Bhopal. A couple of meetings have been held at the district collectorate over the past fortnight involving officials of all the departments concerned to decide on action to be taken to ensure that air quality index comes to ideal level-below 50, a task which appears to be ""impossible"" at present.District collector Tarun Pithode, when asked about the district administration's campaign for pure air which they are calling ""Shudh Hawa Ke Liye"" (For the sake of pure air), said: ""Our objective is to sensitise all stakeholders- not only common people, but also developmental agencies, Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC), traffic police, RTO, petrol pumps, farmers - regarding the deteriorating air quality and ways it can be improved. It's possible if all stakeholders come together and take up the task with a missionary zeal. This is what we are aiming at"", he said. A senior scientist at MP Pollution Control Board (MPPCB), on the condition of anonymity, said that municipal commissioners of all the six cities have been invited to attend a review meeting on pollution on December 13. ""The pollution levels in the cities will be reviewed"", he said. He said that MPPCB can't formulate or execute any action plan for reducing pollution on its own, but all the agencies responsible for reducing the pollution level, including the municipal bodies, the traffic police and the transport department among others, should also pitch in.

"Traffic gives Pune hazy mornings, shallow fog only around Sunday","Pune: Mist and haze during the early mornings these days make it feel more like winter, but India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said it could be associated with air pollution in areas with heavy traffic. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune told TOI on Wednesday that the city did not record any instances of fog this winter or post monsoon season except one in November. ""There was fog on November 9, when both Shivajinagar and Lohegaon had their visibility dropping to 4km and 200m, respectively. /Since then, the city has had only mist or haze in isolated areas,"" he added.On Wednesday morning, some locations in Pune recorded mist and haze associated with a drop in the ambient temperature and minimum temperature, as well as the presence of moisture in the air accompanied by pollutants from dense traffic, he said. The minimum temperature in Shivajinagar and Lohegaon was on the higher side on Wednesday morning, at 16 degrees celsius and 17.1 degrees celsius, over four degrees above the normal.""However, we expect shallow fog development to occur in Pune around December 15-16, after the passage of the western disturbance over north India. Once a western disturbance passes, it is associated with a drop in the ambient as well as minimum temperature, which can cause fog in the presence of remnant moisture in the air,"" said Kashyapi.Fog is when small droplets suspended in air allow visibility for less than one km. ""Haze is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon where dust, smoke and other dry particles obscure the clarity of the sky. Like fog, mist is still the result of the suspension of water droplets, but simply at a lower density with visibility more than or equal to one kilometre,"" Kashyapi said.Frost occurs when the temperature of the air in contact with the ground, or at thermometer-screen level, is below the freezing-point of water, 'ground frost' or 'air frost', respectively..

Experts: Air pollution causes 30% spike in asthma cases,"Ahmedabad: With the winter setting in many in Ahmedabad are falling prey to allergic bronchitis and dry cough. But thanks to the deteriorating air quality in the city, the incidence of asthma have witnessed a significant 30% spike year on year, according to medical practitioners.""Against some six new patients of asthma, I attend to at least 10 new patients now. /Most are in the age-group of 15-25. Deteriorating air quality, increasing vehicular pollution are among the most common reasons for rise in the number of cases of Asthma,"" said Dr Narendra Raval, who is a pulmonologist. It is estimated that in Ahmedabad local doctors daily attend to an average of around 65 patients suffering from asthma/respiratory diseases. The paediatric asthma segment has also seen a significant increase on a year on year basis. On an average until date in 2019, while Ahmedabad has seen a 45% increase in the number of people suffering from asthma as compared to last year, approximately, one third of population from Ahmedabad will develop asthma at some time, mostly before the age of 20, indicate experts.Medical experts said that incidence of asthma has gone up among kids as well. ""The average air quality index in Ahmedabad has deteriorated from 100 five years ago to more than 200. With this, there is an estimated 40% rise in the asthma cases among children in the age group of 5-10 years. Pollution has not just led to an increase in the incidents but even in the complication of the cases reported,"" said Dr Tejas Patel, pulmonologist. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Nitish launches projects worth Rs 1k crore in 3 districts,"DARBHANGA/MADHUBANI/PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar covered three districts on Thursday as part of the second phase of his Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali (JJH) campaign, during which he inaugurated projects and announced new ones worth Rs 1,051.71 crore.Addressing a function held at Murtazapur village under Benipur block in Darbhanga, the CM expressed concern over depletion of groundwater, which has reached alarming levels in Darbhanga district and other areas of north Bihar, which he highlighted was the reason behind launching of his state-wide JJH campaign.Recalling his college days, Nitish said, ""Water level was satisfactory then and rainfall used to be 1200-1500 mm and monsoon,too, hit the state timely on June 15 every year.""However, in the past 30 years, the annual rainfall has fallen to 1,027 mm, and in the past 13 years it has come down to around 90 mm. On July 13 this year, Nitish held a meeting with legislators and senior members of all political parties informing them of the prevailing situation.The CM stressed the need to make all water bodies and ponds encroachment free, pointing out that public wells would also be renovated, with water absorbent system to be established in its proximity. Further, rain harvesting at all large government buildings in the state has been made mandatory, he added.The Mithila region requires a vigorous drive, as it was dotted with ponds.Nitish also lamented that male residents were not using toilets made at their homes and defecated outside. /He advised such people to start practicing the use of toilets, as open defecation free villages and areas would yield clean drinking water and also make the area disease free.Noting that tree plantation drive was part of the JJH campaign, the CM said the separation of Jharkhand had left Bihar with only 9% green cover, but after the launch of the Hariyali mission in 2012, the coverage increased to 15% and the JJH drive would now take it to 17%.The CM asked people to go for farming activities taking into account climate change and advised them to choose crops which would yield more. He said eight districts had been selected to cultivate crops suitable to the climate with support from various agriculture research institutions within the state and outside.He also asked farmers to refrain from stubble burning, as it damages soil quality besides causing air pollution and also stressed the need for education of girls as it helped in population control through two-child norms.Earlier, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey welcomed the CM in the presence of chief secretary Deepak Kumar. Two ministers Madan Sahni and Maheshwar Hazari also spoke on the occasion.Samastipur: At Samastipur, the CM inaugurated Janglahi Pokhar as part of the JJH at Ramapur in Maheshpur Panchayat of the district. He also visited the stall erected by Jeevika didis and saw the zero tillage wheat cultivation. He saw the marigold flower and Kashmiri chilli cultivated through drip irrigation. Morwa MLA Vidyasagar Nishad, along with the JD(U) functionaries Ashvamedh Devi, Ram Balak Singh, Raj Kumar Ray and Harinarayan Choudhary, were also present.Meanwhile, CPI(ML) members staged a demonstration to protest against the removal of people living on the ponds. The district administration said they would be provided an alternative place on another government-owned very soon. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"21 people die of respiratory infections, pneumonia each day","BENGALURU: Compilation of data from various states shows that on an average 10 people die of acute respiratory infection each day in the country, while another 11 die due to pneumonia - a pointer to the increasing air pollution and growing health concerns surrounding ARI.As per the National Health Profile-2019 - which has statistics for up to December 2018 - nearly 4.1 crore people in the country were diagnosed with ARI in 2018, a marginal decrease from the 4.2 crore people in the previous year. However, the number of people dying increased from about nine every day in 2017 to 10 each day in 2018.State-wise analysis shows that five states account for 50% of all ARI cases reported in the country, while an equal number of states have reported 75% of all deaths (see graphic). Delhi, for example, figures among the worst states when it comes to the number of deaths, but is not among the states with high incidence of infections.The figures for pneumonia are more alarming with the number of cases increasing to 9.2 lakh in 2018 from 7.6 lakh in 2017. The number of deaths also saw a jump from 4,105 to 4,213, an average of 11 deaths per day.Figures from the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) show that of all the major communicable diseases recorded during the two-year period, ARI accounts for 69.5%. In terms of mortality it is 27%, claiming the most number of lives among all communicable diseases. /Pneumonia accounts for 1.5% of all cases, but 31% of all such deaths.While smoking, genetic diseases and poor air quality are all key factors, experts and pulmonologists say non-smoking-related infections are also high in the country. They point out that from industrial pollution to vehicular exhaust and from occupational asthma to poor air quality in general, people are being diagnosed with infections caused by a variety of such factors.Pulmonologist Dr Hirennappa Udnur said: ""People who are dying of pneumonia are mostly those above 65 years of age or less than 1 year. There are several causes of pneumonia and most of them are curable. Among other infections, there are a lot of non-smokers too who are contracting infections. This is because of poor air quality, even as the reasons for what made their air bad can vary.""Pointing out that early detection is key to curing most of these infections, he said that in some severe cases of pneumonia - where there are multiple organ disorders - the need for early screening is key to preventing progression of infection. Once it reaches the late stages, most people cannot afford the financial burden.Dr Paramesh, another pulmonologist, said: ""Today, there is enough clinical data to show how poor air quality is affecting people. While infections are caused by a variety of reasons, pneumonia is easily the biggest killer. So far as other ARIs are concerned, there has been a massive reduction.""Echoing Udnur's views, Paramesh said children are the most vulnerable and parents and teachers need to be aware of symptoms to enable early diagnosis. He said self-medication must be avoided at all costs. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Kolkata's air, 65% laden with PM2.5, deadlier than that of Delhi's: Study","NEW DELHI: Around 65% of the city's ambient air contains the deadly ultra-fine particulate matter (PM2.5), making it more toxic than that of Delhi where the PM2.5 concentration in the air mix is 45%.Experts addressing the national briefing on controlling air pollution organized by environmental research and advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the high concentration of PM2.5 in Kolkata's air meant that the city carries a heavier disease burden than Delhi with more cases of respiratory and other diseases as well as deaths./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/""The toxicity of particulate matter is what makes the air lethal. In fact, this is what explains the global burden of disease study that found that death due to air pollution is higher in West Bengal or Rajasthan, even though they are less polluted than Delhi as far as annual average of air quality index is concerned,"" said Gurfan Beig, project director, SAFAR, India Institute of Tropical Meteorology. The focus of the briefing was the Indo-Gangetic plain where particulate pollution is playing havoc with human lives. More than one third of non-attainment cities (failing to put pollution under tolerable limit) of India are located in the Indo-Gangetic plain.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) measures the air quality of a metropolitan city, by measuring the overall pollution level and the location-specific air quality of the city. ""Despite stringent measures adopted by the government, the higher proportion of PM2.5 in Kolkata's air is worrisome,"" said Anumita Roycowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) CSE.The air quality index (AQI) in Kolkata is driven by PM2.5 and not the coarser PM10, admitted a West Bengal Pollution Control Board officer. Particulate matter of size 2.5 or PM2.5 are ultrafine particles of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres, which is about 3% of the diameter of a human hair and can travel straight into the blood stream with noxious chemicals.""We need an approach to drastically curb air pollution. In case of Kolkata, pollution must be brought down at least 47% to bring the PM2.5 count to 40 microgram per cubic metre. This requires switching to CNG from diesel. It was a drastic change when Delhi moved to CNG. We needs blanket ban on coal's usage as domestic and eatery fuel. Symbolic introduction of 100-200 electric buses will not be enough, need to move quickly and diesel generators must be done away with"" said CSE director general Sunita Narain.

Track the pollution level in your city,A hotspot third time in a month: Govt should put its act together to clean up office hub air,"GURUGRAM: As Mr Sharma gets off the car, he hops, skips and then jumps to his office after negotiating piles of garbage that line the road. Before he settles down, he holds on to his aching back and tells his colleague that the ride from home was too bumpy. Mr Sharma's commute to office in the past one hour has vividly summed up why Udyog Vihar is Gurugram's most polluted area.For the third time in the past three months, it has been listed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) as the pollution hotspot of the city. The report - based on an inspection since October - has blamed dumping of garbage on roads and dust emanating from unpaved roads as major causes of pollution in the area. /The revelation is no more a surprise for either the residents of the area or the thousands who commute to work there. Many of those employed in the private offices of Udyog Vihar recollect the days they would go up to the terrace for a smoke, but now shudder to spend even 5 minutes in the open. So, why does the dust refuses to settle in Udyog Vihar? Despite multiple warnings by the CPCB, garbage continues to burn in the open and roads are still not paved. What makes the air fouler is the heavy traffic on the roads and unchecked use of diesel gensets. Udyog Vihar is essentially a corporate hub. It has a series of buildings that houses offices of several companies, industrial units manufacturing all your household items and also a row of slums encroaching a section of the area. Officials in several private agencies said the authorities should immediately check the rampant use of diesel gensets if they want to mitigate pollution in the area. But they also pointed out that many of their computers would stop operating if gensets were to be banned suddenly. ""As Udyog Vihar is an industrial area, gensets are being used rampantly. The condition of roads is pathetic, which is also leading to dust filling the air. These apart, we often see garbage being burnt in the open. On our part, we report such garbage burning cases to the authorities. We also encourage employees to use bicycles and buses to commute to work,"" said Sarika Panda, assistant director of Nagarro. Members of the Udyog Vihar chamber of commerce said they had often pointed out to the civic agencies what's causing pollution in the area. ""We have conducted several meetings with the state pollution control board and civic agencies, and raised our concern regarding garbage burning and condition of roads. We have been assured that re-carpeting of roads will be done soon,"" said Raj Singla, a member. Residents and activists pointed out that the city lacked infrastructure for implementing rules of the environment ministry. ""The situation clearly shows there is no integrated approach regarding bulk producers of waste. The government needs to act against violators. The rules were promulgated to protect the environment, encourage resource conservation and protect public health by focusing on scientific waste management practices,"" said Ruchika Sethi, founding member of Citizens of Clean Air, a citizens' advocacy group. She pointed out residents, too, needed to be educated on ways to sort waste at source and not dump garbage along roads. ""There is no integrated approach towards waste generators. Anyone can throw any kind of waste, however, hazardous they may be. All stakeholders must come together and execute their respective roles in minimising and segregating waste,"" Ruchika said. However, officials in state pollution control board claimed adequate action has been taken by the implementing agencies to combat rising pollution levels. ""The Gurugram municipal corporation has already embarked on a cleanliness drive in Udyog Vihar area. They are clearing construction and demolition waste and also removing encroachments and abandoned vehicles. We have been monitoring the area to mitigate air pollution. Re-carpeting of roads will be initiated soon,"" said a senior official. The CPCB's report on Udyog Vihar was prepared after an inspection carried out by a special team across 644 locations in Delhi-NCR. The inspection was carried out from October 7 to December 18 in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut and Sonipat.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Asthma cases on rise in city, yet patients shun inhalers: Doctors","Nagpur: Air pollution due to traffic and dust raised by construction activities have led to 45% increase in prevalence of asthma in the city in 2019 as compared to 2018, claimed leading pulmonologists on Wednesday.""About 5% of Nagpur's adult population is suffering from asthma. This number is nearly 10% in children. We cannot avoid the triggering factors like air pollution while living in urban scenario. /But, early and effective medication can have good control over asthma,"" said Ashish Nikhare, pulmonologist at Lata Mangeshkar Hospital. He was speaking on Wednesday at the launch of second phase of 'Asthma ke liye inhalers hai sahi' - a nationwide campaign to create awareness about use of inhalers to control asthma.Paediatrician Dr Vinod Gandhi said inhalers are the best form of medication in case of children having asthma. ""Asthma is a long-term disease and children detected with it need to take medicines for years. Tablets or syrups have nearly 40 times more quantity of drugs than inhalers. Such a large quantity of drugs consumed for longer period may result in side-effects like osteoporosis, weight gain, diabetes, cataracts, depression and indigestion. In case of children's asthma it is best to use inhalers,"" he said.Doctors also said that despite being the most effective and safe treatment, society still has stigma and myths about inhalers. ""Asthma patients still hide their condition. Use of inhalers is considered as inferior. Many families don't want young girls to use inhalers just because it may create problem while arranging their marriages. People think that inhalers are addictive,"" said Dr Gandhi.The campaign launched by the medical fraternity in Nagpur, along with the pharma giant CIPLA, will create awareness about use of inhalers in asthmatic patients. This campaign was first launched in 2018. Campaign effectiveness study conducted by the IQVIA has reported that 26% decrease in rejection of inhalers was registered in Maharashtra during 2018-19.

Civic officials to observe 'no vehicle day' on Dec 31,"Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff, corporators and office-bearers will observe 'no vehicle day' on December 31. Earlier this month, mayor Surmanjiri Latkar had proposed the idea to create awareness among citizens and encourage them to use public transport.According to Latkar, the 'no vehicle day' initiative will serve two purposes - it will help reduce pollution caused due to the smoke emanating from vehicles and, secondly, it will help reduce traffic congestion in the city. ""We are proposing several measures to tackle the issues of air pollution and traffic congestion caused due to the increase in the number of vehicles plying on city roads. I have conducted several meetings with corporators and staff of all the departments and have appealed to them to refrain from using private vehicles and travel by Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT) buses, auto-rickshaws or walk to their respective offices if possible,"" Latkar said.""I have appointed two officials to lead the initiative and make it successful. /They will reach out to all the staff and ensure that the practice is followed. We have not included emergency staff and related vehicles in this initiative. Ambulances and fire brigades will operate as usual. I have appealed to the citizens to participate in the initiative and avoid using private vehicles - at least for a day,"" Latkar said.The municipal corporation is in the process of drafting the city mobility plan (CMP). It will have both measures-logistics as well as infrastructural to address the daily traffic mess. The KMC is planning to hire a private consultant for drafting the CMP. Corporators suggested that before going for CMP, measures should be adopted to involve the public at large to reduce traffic-related concerns. The 'no vehicle day' initiative and clearing apartment basements for parking of vehicles are some of the measures adopted by the civic body. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Infections top illness list for urban, rural India","Close to 102 million are ill over a 15-day period throughout the country. That is more than the population of Egypt. If it were a country, it would be the 14th most populous in the world. /The 75th round of National Sample Survey found that about 29 in every 1,000 Indians are hospitalised every year, largely to treat infections. The study conducted by the National Statistical Office over a year across the country covered over 5.5 lakh households to collect data on the well-being of Indians and their access to healthcare. Women are more likely to be suffering from an ailment at any given time, at 8.3% of the female population compared with 6.7% of the male population. For those aged 60 and above, 28% of the people are most vulnerable and 9.1% of urban Indians are more likely to fall ill compared with 6.8% of rural Indians at any given time.Even though Kerala ranks high on the health front, it is also one of the sickest. The survey carried out during July 2017-June 2018 reported that morbidity in Kerala is three times higher than the national average.  The national percentage of those who responded as ailing nationally was 7.5% compared with Kerala which stood at 24.5 %. In Assam, it was 2.1%. The number of cases of hospitalisation per 1,000 persons (excluding child birth) across India was 29. In most states it stood between 29 and 40, while in Kerala it was the highest at 105.Infectious diseases accounted for the highest cases of hospitalisations. In both rural and urban areas there has been an increase in hospitalisaton compared with the previous survey.  Injuries followed by gastro-intestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal diseases and neurological illnesses were other major reasons for hospitalisation.Rural India suffered more from infections compared with urban areas -- 36% to 24%. Infections included malaria, viral hepatitis / jaundice, acute diarrhoeal diseases / dysentry, dengue, among others.  While air pollution in cities may have raised fears of breathing ailments, the survey revealed that people in both urban and rural areas suffered from respiratory illness.Most Indians were uninsured.  The number stood at  85.9%  in rural areas and 80.9% in urban.   Only over 13% were insured under various government schemes.  The NSSO data suggests that high costs and poor access act as barriers for poorer Indians seeking healthcare. About 16% of all hospitalisation cases involve the poorest 20% of Indian households compared with 22% for the richest 20% of the families.Majority of Indians preferred to go to private hospitals, in both urban and rural regions, with 55.3% of all medical cases recorded at private facilities. Only 35.3% of urban hospitalisations were at government facilities; for rural, it was 45.7%.  Ayush has few takers and only 4% opted it compared with allopathic treatment.

Track the pollution level in your city,"At 2.3m/year, India tops global list of deaths due to pollution: Report","Kolkata: India tops the list of countries when it comes to premature deaths caused by modern sources of pollution - created by industrialisation and rapid urbanisation - according to a report published last week.The report, 'The Pollution and Health Metrics: Global, Regional and Country Analysis', published by the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution (GAHP), states that around 2.3 million people died prematurely in India in 2017 because of pollution. It is followed by China (1.9 million), Nigeria (0.3 million), Indonesia (0.2 million) and Pakistan (0.2 million). The US, the third most populous country, also makes it to the top-10: with 1,96,930 premature deaths due to pollution, it comes in at No. 7.According to the report, pollution claims three times as many lives a year as HIV, TB and malaria combined and it's responsible for 15 times the nu-mber of deaths caused by war and other forms of violence.""The links between pollution and death (and disability) are well-established and irrefutable. India tops the list because of its huge population,"" says Rachael Kupka, acting executive director, GAHP, which was formed in 2012 by the World Bank, the European Commission, UN Environment, the ministries of environment and health of more than 25 low- and middle-income countries, and the non-profit Pure Earth and other agencies. GAHP is also a part of the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, which was formed in collaboration with The Lancet, among other organisations and individuals.The report comes around two weeks after environment minister Prakash Javadekar said in the Lok Sabha (in reply to a question from Trinamool MP Kakoli GhoshDastidar) that there was no Indian study showing a direct correlation between pollution and mortality.The report, published by the US-based organisation, says that pollution is globally the largest cause of premature deaths, having killed 8.3 million people across the world in 2017, making up 15% of all deaths. /And the top 10 countries on the death list are responsible for two-thirds of all deaths.If one plots countries on the death list proportionately to each country's population, India comes in at 10th position (with 174 deaths per 1,00,000 people), preceded by smaller low- and middle-income countries like Chad and North Korea.The report, which draws its data from the Institute of Health Metrics Evaluation, founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, divides the risk factors into four categories: air, water, occupational, and lead. Of these, air pollution is the deadliest (4.9 million deaths in 2017), which is a combination of household air pollution, outdoor air pollution and ozone. This is followed by water pollution (1.6 million deaths), lead pollution (1 million deaths) and occupational pollution (0.8 million deaths) that includes exposure to hazardous materials because of occupational reasons.According to the report, 40% of pollution-related deaths are caused by ambient air pollution and ozone. China is at the unenviable top slot (with 1.2 million premature deaths per year), followed by India (1.2 million) and Pakistan (1,30,000).It also categorises pollution as ""modern"" and ""traditional"". While modern pollution results from industrialisation and urbanisation and includes ambient air pollution, soil and chemicals pollution, and pollution in the workplace, the traditional pollution refers to indoor air pollution (mostly caused by poor ventilation, smoke from cooking stoves, use of firewood for heating and water pollution from unsafe sanitation). According to the report, modern pollution is much deadlier than the traditional form - it killed 5.3 million of the 8.3 million people who lost their lives prematurely because of pollution. And traditional pollution is decreasing over the years, while modern pollution has been on the rise.""Modern pollution is the consequence of industrialisation and urbanisation which we cannot avoid, but we should adopt measures to mitigate it,"" says public health specialist Pritam Roy, who is also the World Health Organization's (WHO) Bengal coordinator for neglected tropical diseases. ""Reducing crop burning and industrial waste water in agriculture, cleaning up toxic hot spots, use of cleaner cookstoves and use of LPG will help. Research is well developed, with multiple universities and agencies involved globally to formulate solutions. WHO has a newly established air pollution focal area and solution. All we need to do is adopt the existing solutions and implement it to reduce mortality and morbidity."" ""Solving pollution is possible - cost effective solutions exist, but need attention and resources. In a world of competition priorities, pollution and the environment often get lost. But as the Lancet Commission documents, the costs of pollution on health, the economy and implications for climate change and sustainable development are serious and hurting nations now. India is not alone in that,"" GAPH's Kupka told TOI.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
West Bengal Pollution Control Board to provide pellets as replacement of open chulhas,"KOLKATA: In a bid to reduce air pollution, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) is all set to replace open chulhas with environment friendly pellets that generate less smoke. This initiative comes after the board introduced LPG gas connection to the roadside eateries that is safer and pollution free.According to WBPCB officials, pellets are made of organic material and have been developed by the state MSME department in collaboration with the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. ""The technology has been demonstrated to the WBPCB officials on November 30 and the department is trying to popularise the use of pellets. /We are now conducting a study to assess the exact extent of reduction in pollution level with the use of pellets. But there is no doubt that it will be considerably less,"" a senior WBPCB official said.""We are trying to introduce cleaner fuel in eateries and in addition to the gas ovens that we have started distributing in roadside stalls, we are planning to introduce pellets. I am told that the pellets are much less polluting but some market economy has to kick in so that there are some manufacturers who come and help us with the manufacture of these pellets that can be popularized,"" a senior official said.The senior official also said that the state government is ready to create an eco-system and framework for the manufacturers so that they can thrive and survive and at the same time contribute to the societal needs.Earlier the WBPCB has distributed nearly 3,000 gas ovens with LPG cylinders to wayside eateries in Kolkata and its surrounding areas. ""So far we have distributed 1800 has been distributed in Kolkata Police area, over 800 in Howrah Commissionerate area and another 230 have been distributed in Bidhannagar Commissionerate area.

"City faced worst waterlogging, air quality this year","PATNA: The year passing by had a mixed bag of milestones and pinpricks for Patnaites. The worst air quality as well as waterlogging apart, the city witnessed several new beginnings like more facilities at city airport, new guests at zoo, single-use plastic ban and anti-encroachment drive, among others.Waterlogging: Almost 50% of the city remained waterlogged for days and weeks after the 330mm rainfall between September 28 and 30. Most of the houses, flats and hostels in localities like Rajendra Nagar, Kankarbagh, Bypass, Pataliputra Colony, Boring Road, Rajiv Nagar, Gola Road and most of the west Patna were marooned for days together. What added to the residents' woes was the blame game by the urban development and housing department, Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (BUIDCO) for defunct sump houses and choked drains. The main sump houses like at Jogipur, Kankarbagh, Saidpur and Sandalpur were not working properly, while many of the 38 sump houses in the PMC area were hardly operational.Air pollution: According to the figures released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city witnessed around 28 severe days, 63 very poor days, 128 satisfactory days, eight good days and the remaining poor days as far as air quality is concerned. In May, Patna had recorded the year's highest Air Quality Index (AQI) with 470. The main causes of poor air quality were vehicle emission (32%), sand mining (12%), heating (10%), construction (7%), burning of garbage (7%), cooking fire (6%) and brick kilns (4%). The state government, in association with BSPCB and other organizations, launched 'Comprehensive Clean Air Action Plan for City of Patna' in November. /Several measures were underlined to curb air pollution, like installation of diesel particulate filters in trucks, banning two-stroke autos, strict enforcement of Pollution Under Control (PUC) norms, and the promotion of CNG and electric vehicles, zigzag technologies in brick kilns, green cover at construction sites and waste-to-energy plant, among others. Three more air quality monitoring stations were also set up at Eco Park, BIT-Mesra, Patna and SK Memorial Hall.Dengue/Chikungunya outbreak: As the people were struggling with the waterlogging problem, dengue and chikungunya spread their wings and allegedly killed over half a dozen people in the city. However, the state government denied any death due to dengue. According to the data released by the health department, 4813 cases of dengue and 487 cases of chikungunya were reported compared to 1,117 cases of dengue and 108 of chikungunya in 2018. The health department opened camps and provided dengue test kits at several health centres for early detection of the mosquito-borne disease. Long queues of patients suffering from dengue were seen at government as well as private hospitals. Anti-encroachment drive: Several old structures, including 1,000 square feet Gole Market built in 1912 as the first municipal market designed by Joseph Fearis Munnings, the Dudh market as well as several illegal structures were removed as part of the anti-encroachment drive. The width of Bailey road, Boring road, Boring Canal road, Exhibition road and around Gandhi Maidan were increased after removing encroachments. In a bid to ease vehicular movement near Secretariat, the main entrance of Eco Park was shifted to gate number 16 near Vikas Bhawan. Many illegal permanent structures were also removed from Badshahi Nullah as the PMC had blamed encroachments on the big drain for disruption in discharging the accumulated rainwater from the city bypass and its nearby areas like Jagganpura.Plastic ban: The state government banned the use of single-use plastic in August. The ban was implemented effectively in the beginning as the district authorities formed task forces to penalize the offenders. But the plastic bags are back and Patnaites are using them fearlessly. Shopkeepers are rampantly using single-use plastic bags. In April, the BSPCB and urban development and housing department organized an awareness workshop, which was attended by around 200 producers, manufacturers and traders of plastic goods from across the state. According to UDHD officials, approximately 10,000kg of plastic had been confiscated from 1 lakh establishments.Efforts to streamline traffic on Bailey Road: In a bid to ease vehicular movement on Bailey Road, the district authorities blocked intersections and removed traffic signals between Patna high court and Rupaspur and, instead, created U-turns at several points. It was a successful experiment as traffic on Bailey Road has been become smooth with hardly any congestion on this route. However, it caused problems for pedestrians in cross the road. The UDHD has proposed foot overbridge and underground pedestrian walk at several important places on Bailey Road. As a temporary arrangement, crosswalk buttons have been installed at Hartali Mor, Secretariat Mor and zoo gate for the pedestrians to cross the road. Under this system, the pedestrian can press the green button installed on both sides of the road. It signals vehicles to stop. When a pedestrian pushes the button, five-minute timer activates and after that the traffic signal changes to pedestrian walk signal, allowing them to cross the road.Work on new terminal building: Work on a swanky new terminal building along with other utility buildings started at city airport. The new terminal building will be a two-storey structure with six aerobridges and an apron area for parking of 14 aircraft at a time against the existing capacity of six only. The new airport building has been designed by Singapore-based firm Meinhardt (Singapore) Pte Ltd, while the expansion work has been awarded to Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Construction Company Limited. The new terminal building will be able to handle up to 45 lakh passengers per year. The existing capacity is of 7 lakh flyers. As per the design, the terminal building will be developed over an area of 57,000 square metres against its existing expanse of over 7,200 square metres.New routes and parking at airport: The entry and exit routes of airport have been changed owing to the construction work on new terminal building. After taking the computerized slip, the vehicles now take left turn before the civil depot area to reach the pickup and drop area in front of the terminal building. Vehicles exiting the airport premises move towards the cargo area. The new exit route is parallel to the existing one and vehicles move along the boundary wall of BIT-Mesra, Patna. Under the new parking policy, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has reduced the charges by 50% for all types of vehicles and fixed the maximum permissible time of three minutes in the pick-and-drop area. Jumping the permissible time period attracts Rs500 as fine. The free 10-minute time for vehicles on the airport premises has been abolished.New inmates at zoo: The Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as Patna zoo, entered into three exchange programmes with Vandaluru Zoo at Chennai, Alipore Zoo at Kolkata and Assam State Zoo cum Botanical Garden. In June, Patna zoo got one female zebra in exchange of a white tigress, a pair of sambars (large deer) and three black bucks with Alipore zoo. A pair each of Royal Bengal tiger and lion-tailed macaque, also known as the bruh and grey wolves, 10 painted storks, two each of white peacocks, ostrich and reticulated python came to the Patna zoo in exchange of a female rhinoceros and three ghariyals (1 male and two females) with Vandaluru zoo. Recently, the Patna zoo welcomed a male rhino and a pair of Himalayan black bear from Assam zoo in exchange of a female giraffe and three each of swamp deer and black bucks. A baby female giraffe, which has been christened as 'Hema', was born in July. Besides, new facilities like interpretation centre-cum-3D theatre, battery-operated trackless toy train, souvenir shop and renovated restaurant were also inaugurated.

"Sweepers burn dry leaves, Mohali rubs its wet eyes","MOHALI: Throwing anti-pollution norms to the wind, sweepers continue to burn dry leaves and garbage on roadsides or inside neighborhood parks to avoid the labour of burying the filth. It is open defiance of the district magistrate's orders that banned this environment-unfriendly practice. The attitude of sanitation workers of the municipal corporation also defeats the mammoth Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, country's universal cleanliness mission, and fouls the air. /The broomstick squads gather the trash and foliage on the edge of the park or the street and toss a burning matchstick into it.Residents continue to report trash fires from sectors 17-B, 36, and 18. Toxic fumes rising from the plastic and rubber being burnt choke the residents and irritate the eyes of commuters. Local social worker L R Budhania, active in reporting these matters, said: ""We have observed that sweepers shirk their work. They are supposed to bury the litter after collecting but they torch the heaps, knowing well that it pollutes the air. Trash fires have increased of late in neighborhood parks. The ban doesn't deter sanitation workers.""Environmentalists say that the burning of crop residue, garbage, dry leaves, construction debris, and mud-wrapped foliage fouls the air more than even Diwali crackers. The effect of this pollution lasts for months, whereas the Diwali pollution clears out in 12 to 24 hours. Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee chairman T C Nautiyal said: ""Crackers also do cause pollution but dry leaves crushed under tyres hang in air longer. When we burn leaves and organic waste, we not only contribute to air pollution but also destroy the valuable nutrients that should go back to the soil.""He said construction debris also contributed a lot to air pollution and respiratory problems. Nautiyal suggested sensitization and education of the sanitation workers to stop the crushing and burning of dry leaves. He said: ""Tell sweepers to sprinkle water on construction debris and tell farmers to stop burning stubble. That will help save a major part of the environment. Crop fires occur twice a year and last a month, while Diwali smoke disappears in two days.""As flames leap skywards from the heaps, the suspended particles in the air make it difficult for passersby to breathe and clear visibility of the road. A few trapped drivers even try to clear the area in a hurry, a haste which causes many accidents. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Cancer: AI can make up for lack of doctors, says expert","Chennai: Using artificial intelligence for diagnosis and telemedicine services for treatment along with Ayushman Bharath programme will improve cancer diagnosis and treatment outcomes in India, which is reeling under a shortage of doctors, said World Health Organisation chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan.Over the past three days, experts have been discussing how artificial intelligence is proving to be more effective in spotting breast cancer from mammograms than expert radiologists. AI outperformed specialists by detecting cancers that radiologists missed in the images and also junked features they falsely flagged as possible tumours.""If AI can make breast screening more effective and ease the burden on health services where radiologists are in short supply, it will help systems diagnose women in early stages of the disease and improve treatment,"" she said, delivering the Dr S Krishnamurthi Centenary Memorial Oration on 'Cancer in India: Challenges and Opportunities.' The oration was organised by the Cancer Institute, Adyar.Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women after cervical cancer. /The incidence of breast cancer is increasing, particularly among women in urban areas of Tamil Nadu. ""In the rural areas, screening of cervical cancer has substantially improved with health workers screening women with simple tests using acetic acid. Besides radiology, state can use tele-pathology for confirmation as well,"" she told a hall filled with doctors, medical students and social workers.Further, if single dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine proves to be as good as two or three injections at preventing cervical cancer in the ongoing research, it may make the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating cervical cancer easier, she said. The vaccine is now given in at least two doses, but a single dose vaccine will make it easier for countries like India.While an Indian pharamaceutical company is in the final stages of clinically testing a HPV vaccine, research programmes in India should focus on better collection of data through cancer registries across the country and interpretation of data for stronger policies, she said. For instance, effective policies to bring down tobacco use can bring down incidence of cancer substantially. Now, tobacco use is considered the leading risk factor for cancers in India, besides dietary factors, alcohol, air pollution and obesity. ""Though we have a robust cancer registry, there is no data coming from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,"" said.She further added that the Centre's promise to invest more money in research should be directed to understand the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer.

Young minds provide new solutions to old problems,"Chennai: School students have come up with some innovative solutions such as using rice stubble for laying roads, producing electricity from the heat generated by electronic devices and storing excess flood water in underground tanks at IIT Madras.Totally, 19 teams made presentations suggesting solutions for air pollution, traffic management, sustainable use of water and agriculture and storage of grains at the finals of Shaastra's Spark Junior Conference on Sunday.Yash Sharma and Amritanshu Jha from Delhi won the first prize for developing Heat Management System (HMS) - Jugaad Approach which can generate electricity of up to 11 volts from the heat emitted by electronic devices such as refrigerator and microwave oven.They also came up with an idea to purify smoke emitted by chimneys and vehicles through chemical separation. The device is called Smoke Controller And Recycler (SCAR).""If we develop the device and fit into vehicles, it would reduce the vehicle emission. By using low-cost devices like HMS, we can reduce our dependency on coal and petroleum for energy. /Using alternative energy can prevent air pollution,"" Sharma said.Saishyam R and Gowri Krishnan M, both Class X students from Thiruvananthapuram, came up with a novel idea to convert rice stubble into pellets and using them to lay roads to avoid stubble burning in states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. They got the second prize.""We are already using plastic pellets to lay roads. The rice straw has high silicon dioxide content and can be made into pellets through cooling and condensing process. It can also replace bitumen while laying roads. Using rice straw pellets can prevent excessive mining besides stopping the stubble burning in the northern states,"" they said.SVS Manohar, a class XI student from Visakhapatnam came up with an idea to use virtual reality to bring traffic discipline among motorists. ""Currently, the process for getting a licence is too simple. Motorists are not following traffic rules. We can make passing virtual reality training mandatory for getting a licence. The training should simulate real-time traffic and assess the candidate how they respond to free roads or traffic roads,"" he said. He along with two other teams won third prize jointly.

Bihar: Nitish Kumar unveils schemes worth Rs 727.93 crore in Araria district,"ARARIA/ PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday launched 478 developmental schemes in Araria district worth Rs 727.93 crore.Addressing a public meet on the premises of Araria College here on the third day of his sixth phase of 'Jal Jivan Hariyali Yatra', Nitish announced that an engineering college, which is under construction, will be named after famous Hindi litterateur Phanishwar Nath Renu.. ""I had met Renu Ji during my student days and ave learnt a lot from his literature and other writings,"" the CM said.Deliberating on the importance of clean air and water, Nitish said that people can get rid of 90% of the diseases if they have access to clean water. Emphasizing on the need to adapt renewable sources of energy, Nitish said that after installing solar panels on all government buildings, common people will be asked to install solar panels on their houses as well.The CM also asked people to turn up in a large number for the human chain being organised by the state government on January 19 for spreading awareness on 'Jal, Jivan, Hariyali', liquor prohibition, anti-dowry and child labour.""Four crore people had joined hands across the state to form the first human chain organised by the state government to spread awareness on prohibition on January 21, 2017. Later, a 14,000km long human chain was organised on January 21, 2018 to spread awareness about the evils of child marriage and dowry. /We are again organizing a human chain on January 19 o spread awareness on all such issues,"" Nitish said.Addressing another public meeting at Supaul later in the day, Nitish spoke on the harmful effect of stubble burning. ""Apart from air pollution, burning stubble also affects the crop yield and capacity of soil in agricultural fields. Crop residual management has been made a component of JJH. Researches are being done by scientists from four institutes to suggest ways for change in crop cycle as per the changing weather,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Are air pollution, low birth weight linked? Study on in city","Bengaluru: Shalini Balakrishna, 29, from Old Bagaluru Layout, east Bengaluru, is due for delivery by the third week of January. In her third trimester, she wanted to confirm the air she breathes does not impact her baby's health. Volunteering to be part of a study, she wore a device that tracked the quality of the air she inhaled for 24 hours. /She is among 505 pregnant women voluntarily wearing air pollution trackers during their pregnancies and turning up for check-ups at Bagaluru and Sriramapura public health centres. The women must wear this device for 24 hours once each in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy to record their exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution. The ongoing study by Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) is assessing the relation between air pollution and the risk of low birth weight. After a pilot in 2017, the team started the actual study in February 2018. The areas chosen, Old Bagaluru Layout and a slum in Sriramapura, are located closer to commercial areas and main roads. The pregnant women have to wear the personal air quality monitoring device with a power bank kept in a ventilated sling bag, which together weigh less than 300 grams. Shalini told TOI she was curious to know the study outcome. ""The air I breathe should be the best for my child's health,"" she said. ""Most of the participants are homemakers. While resting, they can keep the device closer to them,"" said Prafulla Shriyan, research associate with PHFI who is working on the study. Through the device, the study estimates the level of exposure to air pollutants including coarse particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and carbon monoxide levels in both indoor and ambient environments. During the study, the socio-economic and demographic variables, current and previous obstetric history, fuel used for cooking, heating, location of the kitchen are also considered. Field workers seek information on other sources of indoor pollution such as burning of incense sticks, mosquito repellents and candles. Of the 505 women taking part in the study, 213 have delivered so far. ""We observed higher exposure to indoor pollution among women living in small houses without exhaust/ chimney/ ventilation in kitchen, who used kerosene and solid biomass fuel and whose spouses smoked at home,"" Prafulla said. ""The study will also follow up on the delivered children until they turn two. The objective is to estimate if the absolute risk of having low birth weight is caused by air pollution and other variables, which has been established in global studies. Our focus is on understanding nuances of this issue in the Bengaluru scenario,"" said Dr Giridhar Babu, professor and head of Lifecourse Epidemiology, PHFI, Bengaluru.

Pollution level set to soar this Bhogi,"Chennai: Don't forget to carry your mask when you step out for a morning walk on Tuesday as the city burns waste, including tyres and plastic, to celebrate Bhogi. Experts say pollution level, particularly PM2.5, is likely to be more than double the normal levels. Besides leaving people sick, smoke from fires could delay flights and increase road accidents. /On the day of Bhogi in 2019, although the pollution levels were nearly three times the normal in some areas, the average pollution levels across the city were less compared to the same day in 2018. ""Awareness messages and drive against plastic were largely responsible for decline in pollution levels in 2019,"" said Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board chairman A V Venkatachalam.This year, with plastic back in most households, the levels of pollution could be higher. ""We have made all attempts to stop it through awareness campaigns,"" he said. Posters urging people to avoid burning waste were put up in 25 places across the city. ""We expect a smoke free Bhogi in 2020,"" he added.The board has also been working with AAI, Chennai corporation and IMA to spread awareness on the ill effects of burning waste, he said.However, environmental activists said adequate preventive programmes haven't been initiated. ""They arrested people who burst cracker on Diwali. Why can't they do the same with people who burn tyres and other substances that release carcinogenic substances,"" asked K Swetha, who volunteers for Exnora.City doctors, meanwhile, have geared up for crowded out-patient clinics. Pollution increases risk of hospitalisation for people with lung diseases. Pulmonologists like Dr Raj B Singh of Apollo Hospitals encourage morning walkers and pet owners to continue their brisk walks but they warn against intense activities that makes people gasp for air. Studies have shown that when levels of pollution spike, so does the number of deaths, including those from heart failure, asthma and lung diseases. Researches have shown that air pollution may adversely affect birth weight. A recent study done by researchers at the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research showed that birth weight comes down by 4g when pregnant women are exposed to per 10 microgram /m3 change in particulate matter 2.5 (tiny particles that easily enter airways in the lungs).

"Delhi CM's 'guarantee card' vows clean air, free bus rides for students","NEW DELHI: Ahead of his party's manifesto, CM Arvind Kejriwal released a ""Kejriwal ki 10 guarantee"" card on Sunday, promising to continue the current free public services while vowing to make bus rides free for students, deploy mohalla marshals for women's security, give 24-hour supply of clean piped water to every household and reduce pollution to one-third if elected for another five years.The freebies being currently provided by the AAP government are electricity up to 200 units, 20,000 litres of water per month and bus rides for women. The ""guarantee card"" also promises basic infrastructure in all unauthorised colonies and a pukka house for all slum dwellers.""I, as the chief minister assure 10 guarantees to the people of Delhi. Many of the works detailed in this card have already been done and we promise to continue them, and the rest will be implemented in the next five years,"" Kejriwal said.The 10-point guarantee card includes the promise of 24-hour clean piped water to every household, quality education to all till graduation, cheap, accessible and better healthcare, the largest and cheapest transport system, a ""clean and beautiful"" city and a safe Delhi for women.The guarantee card is not a manifesto. The party is working on a detailed manifesto which will be released in the next 10 days.""People are very much affected by basic services such as electricity, water, education, and healthcare. /We guarantee that the existing services and subsidies in these sectors will continue for the next five years. Opposition parties are spreading rumours that these services will be terminated by March 2020, after the elections. This is a lie,"" Kejriwal stated at the function.AAP manifesto will have a detailed set of promises addressing issues related to specific groups such as advocates, teachers, students, workers and others, separately. ""Those promises also will be implemented effectively in the coming five years as we fulfilled our all 70 promises made five years ago,"" Kejriwal said.Kejriwal guaranteed that overhead electricity cables will be made underground, the Yamuna cleaned while the check on arbitrary fee hikes in private schools will continue if the party returned to power. AAP will create a world-class education system for every child in Delhi, Kejriwal stated.""We'll build more mohalla clinics, polyclinics, and hospitals. We are adding 15,000 beds in Delhi's government hospitals,"" Kejriwal stated. He added that the city's transport system will be made robust with over 11,000 buses and more than 500km of Metro network. ""We will develop last-mile connectivity to ensure women's safety. Along with women, the free bus ride scheme will be extended to include students,"" Kejriwal said.The guarantee card listed solutions to reduce air pollution which has become a hot election issue. BJP and Congress have been blaming the AAP government for pollution while the ruling party maintains that the city's pollution is mainly due to stubble burning in neighbouring states.""Pollution will be reduced to one-third in the course of the next 5 years. Dust on roads will be removed using vacuum cleaners. Delhi will be made green by planting two crore trees. The Yamuna will be cleaned and made pollution-free. We promise that after five years, anyone will be able to take a dip in the Yamuna without fearing of diseases due to dirty water,"" Kejriwal stated.The CM guaranteed a clean city with the three existing garbage landfill sites removed. As part of making the city safe for women, the AAP government promises to set up 1.5 lakh more cameras (1.5 lakh already installed), install streetlights at dark spots and deploy mohalla marshals in different colonies.It also promises roads, drains, water lines, sewer lines, mohalla clinics and CCTVs at each unauthorised colony in the next five years. ""People in the slums of Delhi live in extremely difficult situations. In order to give a dignified life to the slum dwellers, they will be provided with pakka houses near to the slums,"" Kejriwal said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Activists demand pledge for clean air from reps,"New Delhi: Rajiv Chowk witnessed a gathering of residents on Friday afternoon demanding clean air from all candidates who have filed their nominations for the assembly elections.""Air pollution is one of the largest killers in Delhi-NCR. Though our politicians admit to the problem, they don't really do anything about it. Shutting down schools or installing smog towers is not the solution. /We continue to choke in our own city and homes,"" said one of the organisers.The gathering included a young climate activist, 12-year-old Ridhima Pandey. She urged people to give their names and addresses so that their area candidates could be approached with the demand for clean air.Pandey said Delhi air becomes really foul in the winter months. ""We urge people to vote for clean air. You can't just vote for chief minister Arvind Kejriwal or Prime Minister Narendra Modi because you like them. The air is so toxic that it is like smoking 40-50 cigarettes every day. Climate change and air pollution has been completely forgotten. This is about us and our future,"" she told TOI.The organisers, under the banner of Dilli Dhadakne Do, would be conducting a similar exercise in the city's markets. They would also be reaching out to the three main candidates in many constituencies and asking them to sign a pledge to fight air pollution.Sanam Sutirath Wazir, an activist, said this was the only time their voices would be heard. ""We want to reach out to the candidates so that they can be held accountable after they are elected. Not all of us can buy air purifiers. We live in a gas chamber. I don't smoke, but I'm sure my lungs are as affected as a smoker's,"" said the 29-year-old Geetanjali Enclave resident.Uttam Nagar resident 61-year-old Samay Singh said, ""Baat sahi hai. Pradushan hanikarak hai (It's a fact that pollution is dangerous)."" The activists sloganeered: ""Bijli nahin, hawa chahiye (We need clean air, not electricity)."" They were referring to power plants using coal and the power subsidy scheme in the city.Bhavreen Kandhari, one of the organisers, said the authorities need to wake up and realise people's plight and take action accordingly. ""What differentiates Delhi from all the badly-planned cities in India is the Central Vista. The Union government wants to rebuild on 100 acres of land and destroy the only open, beautiful area available to citizens, especially those who live in the cramped parts of the city. Some of India's most historic buildings are here. Is this what Delhi, which is among the world's most polluted cities, needs?"" asked the member of Delhi Tree SOS.

Kolkatans lose 3.5 years of life due to air pollution: Study,"Kolkata: If ever you needed quantification of how much pollution is harming you, here's proof: Kolkata's polluted air is reducing the lifespan of its citizens by as much as 3.5 years on an average, according to a study conducted at Chicago University.The unique study - Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) - was unveiled on Monday in a presentation organised by the city-based Active Citizens Together for Sustainability (ACTS) and the Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago (EPIC).ACTS is a body that fights for environmental issues and awareness.The study was conducted on data collected in 2016. Pollution levels have worsened since then, and experts have warned that had the study been conducted on subsequent years' data, the negative impact on life expectancy would certainly have worked out to be much greater.The limit of PM2.5 pollution set by the World Health Organization (WHO) is 10g per cubic metre annually. The AQLI is based on the finding that every additional 10g/m3 reduced life expectancy by almost a year (0.98 years). Combining this finding with satellite-derived, hyper-localized PM2.5 measurements around the world yields unprecedented insight into the true cost of particulate pollution in communities around the world, said A S Raha, senior associate director, EPIC. In 2016, annual concentration of PM2.5 in Kolkata was 45.5g/m3.Developed by Michael Greenstones, University of Chicago's Milton Friedman professor in economics, and his team at EPIC, the AQIL is rooted in recent research that quantifies the causal relationship between long-term human exposure to air pollution and life expectancy. /The index then combines this research with hyper-localized, global particulate measurements, yielding unprecedented insight into the true cost of particulate pollution. West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra, who took interest in the study, said the city's air fail to comply on two accounts - PM10 and PM2.5. ""For the first time in December, we have managed to bring down PM2.5 under the Indian daily standard of 60g/m3,"" he said.Taken as a whole, pollution is a bigger killer than even smoking, Raha said. Particulate matter, much tinier than a grain of sand, penetrates deep into the lungs, bypassing the body's natural defences. From there, it can enter the bloodstream, causing lung diseases, cancer, stroke, and heart diseases. Globally, it cut short lifespans by two years.The index also illustrates how air pollution policies can increase life expectancy if pollution levels were reduced to WHO's safe guideline or existing national air quality standards. This information could help local communities and policy-makers about the real benefits of reducing air pollution.The scope of this study emerged in China in 2013, when a study found that high air pollution had cut the lifespan of people living in northern China by about five years, compared with those living in the south. This led to some sweeping changes in China's policy on air quality improvement. The country's particulate pollution has declined by 12% since then, resulting in a gain of life expectancy of 0.5 year. India's particulate pollution is now akin to what China had experienced in 2013, Raha said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
OSPCB fines polluting industries Rs 1 cr each,"Kendrapada: The Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) has slapped a Rs 2 crore fine on two industries and a penalty of Rs 25 lakh each on five hotels in Paradip for polluting the environment. ""We have fined the two industries Rs 1 crore each and the five hotels Rs 25 lakh each,"" said Ramesh Kumar Ekka, regional officer of OSPCB, Paradip. They have been asked to deposit the amount within 15 days. /The OSPCB had earlier issued show cause notices to them on January 24. As per the OSPCB, the comprehensive environmental pollution index (CEPI) in Paradip at present is 60.61, bringing the town under severe pollution zone. ""In 2018, the National Green Tribunal directed OSPCB to take stern action against the polluting units. It is because of this that they were fined,"" Ekka stated.Two years back, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) identified Paradip Port as one of the most polluted areas of the state. It had declared Angul, Talcher, Ib Valley and Jharsuguda as critically polluted industrial areas under CEPI parameters. CPCB's analysis reveals that 43 industrial areas or clusters out of 88 in the country are critically polluted with respect to one or more environmental components. In this, Paradip ranks 44th. Five years back, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, identified Paradip industrial hub as one of the country's most polluted places.Locals welcomed OSPCB decision to fine polluting units in Paradip. ""The fate of people living near Paradip and adjoining villages is at stake because of the air and water pollution caused by 15 polluting industries, including the port,"" said Sarat Rout of Paradip. Dust from coal dumped near Paradip port for distribution purpose spreads due to the wind and often settles on the ground, damaging crops, Rout alleges. He also claimed that water and air pollution are causing many people to suffer from skin diseases, kidney ailments and cancer.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
20 govt depts to be powered by solar plant in Bijnor,"Bijnor: Work on installation of a 50-Kw solar power plant has begun at Vikas Bhavan building here. The building houses at least 20 government departments.The district's largest solar plant, constructed at a cost of Rs 23 lakh, will be offering excess power to the electricity department.According to officials, the solar power generation plant will be a boon for environment as it will curb use of diesel generators during powercuts at Vikas Bhavan. Besides, these generators emit smoke and cause air pollution. SK Singh, project officer of New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (NEDA), said, ""We had prepared a proposal last year and sent it to the authorities concerned. The budget was sanctioned two months ago and work on the installation of a 50-Kw solar plant has started.""Singh added, ""The plant will supply power to 20 departments here.

"On Delhi pattern, UT plans to install air purifier towers","Chandigarh: While Chandigarh is in the list of 100 cities identified on the basis of level of pollutants such as NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 by the Central government for pollution reduction, the UT administration has now planned to install air purifier towers on the pattern of Delhi.In the recently held meeting on the implementation of directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), UT adviser Manoj Parida has asked officials of the environment department and Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) to explore the idea of installation of air purifier towers in the city. The officials were asked to prepare a detailed report on the issue and the UT will take a final call.In Delhi, the equipment was installed by the Traders Association Lajpat Nagar (TALN) with the help of east Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir.The city's air quality had touched the 'very Poor' category on a number of occasions between October to December 2019.A senior UT official said they will study the concept and will prepare a comprehensive report. The final decision will be taken by the senior officials, he added.The Union government had recently directed the UT administration to submit details of steps taken to control air pollution in the city till December 31, 2019.The UT, in its action plan to control air pollution, had submitted various plans from promoting battery-operated vehicles, green buffers along the traffic corridors and introducing intelligent traffic management system. /The action plan was submitted to the Union government last year.The UT had also submitted that they had already launched extensive drive against polluting vehicles and had even prepared an action plan to widen roads and improvement of infrastructure for decongestion of roads.The other initiatives mentioned in the action plan includes synchronisation of traffic signals in the city, greening of open areas, and introducing water fountain at major traffic intersections wherever feasible with the use of tertiary treated water.The UT submitted that the ambient air quality of the city was mainly affected by the construction and demolition waste and increase in the number of vehicles.The UT had submitted, ""There has been an increase of around 60% in the number of vehicles in 10 years with no change in the length of roads. Increase of light motor vehicles (LMVs), basically cars, by more than 100% in the past 10 years in comparison to approximately 48% increase in two-wheelers. This has resulted in more congestion, ultimately contributing to air pollution.""The UT had also stated other factors, too, including road dust re-suspension, horticulture waste, and stubble burning in the neighbouring states, leading to air pollution.The administration is also working on promoting hybrid and electric vehicles. Two years ago, a team of the transport department had visited Nagpur to study charging stations' set-up.Nagpur was the first city in the country to have electric vehicle charging stations in place. Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles in India with around 12 lakh registered ones, including two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The number of vehicles per house on an average is two, which has led to a sharp deterioration in air quality.To cut down the pollution level, the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) will induct electric buses. At present, around 3,000 e-rickshaws are plying on the city roads.Rs 7L DEVICEAir purifier tower, which is also called smog tower, was installed in Delhi recently. The tower is 20-ft-tall and erected in Veer Savarkar Marg in Lajpat Nagar Central Market.Last year, China built the largest smog tower over 328 ft high at Xian in Shaanxi The tentative cost of the device is Rs 7 lakh. It was procured by Gautam Gambhir Foundation and has been installed with the help of Lajpat Nagar Traders AssociationIt is cylindrical in design and built like a pole with a big inlet and four outlet units. The giant air purifier is fitted with exhaust fans to suck in polluted air with the help of a big inlet unit. The tower will run on electricityThis smog tower will purify the air within a circumference area of almost 500 metres to 750 metresA machine fixed inside the tower will remove nearly 80% of the particulate matter i.e. PM 2.5 and PM 10 and help to bring down pollution levels and spew fresh air out through four outlet unitsAQI | Remarks |Health impacts0-50 Good | Minimal | Impact51-100 | Satisfactory | Minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people101-200 | Moderate | Breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases201-300 | Poor | Breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure301-400 Very poor | Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure401-500 | Severe | Affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Study: City records highest stroke deaths due to PM2.5 exposure,"Hale-and-hearty youngsters suddenly collapsing and dying of stroke is not an unheard-of phenomenon in the city. A study by IIT-Kanpur has attributed the exposure to PM2.5 in the air to the high premature mortality rate in Kolkata, a reason that had remained mostly unexplained so far. In fact, stroke death rate due to PM2.5 exposure in a city was the highest in Kolkata, revealed the study, which surveyed million-plus population in 29 cities in India. /Kolkatans in the age group of 25 to 50 years, who are the most exposed to pollution in the air, were considerably at risk. The epidemiological survey revealed that 1,14,700 people in the 29 cities died owing to PM2.5 exposure every year. The exposure to the toxic particulate matter, which straight enters the lungs, cause stroke, ischemic heart disease, lower respiratory infection, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of deaths, accounting for 58% of PM2.5-related premature deaths across the city, in Kolkata, the biggest culprit is cerebro-vascular disease, commonly known as the stroke.The study, presented by Mukesh Sharma, professor at IIT-Kanpur and a leading member of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) Committee, at Anil Agarwal Dialogue, 2020, revealed that premature deaths due to PM2.5 exposure in Kolkata was only second to Delhi. While the figure recorded in Delhi is 20,000 a year, it is 12,000 in Kolkata. Mumbai emerges third, with annual premature deaths due to PM2.5 exposure being 10,000. The report came following the release of 'India's State of Environment 2020', annual anthology of critical review of India's myriad environmental issues by Centre for Science and Environment. ""People usually associate air pollution with effect on lungs and respiratory systems. But evidence shows the largest health impact of air pollution is associated with cardio-vascular systems. Kolkata's annual concentration of PM2.5 in 2019 was 77 microgram per cubic meter (g/m3). Kolkata needs to cut down on 47% of its PM2.5 count to meet the national ambient air quality standard of 40 g/m3. It will automatically result in 18% reduction in premature mortality. The figure will go up to 80% if World Health Organisation (WHO) standard of 10 g/m3 is met,"" said air-pollution expert and CSE executive director Anumita Roychowdhury. Total premature deaths per 1-lakh population in the city due to PM2.5 exposure is 80, out of which 35 is due to stroke, 34 due to ischemic heart disease, 6 COPD, 3.5 lower respiratory infection and 1.5 because of lung cancer.

Pollution from fossil fuels costing India Rs10.7 lakh crore every year,"Nagpur: Air pollution from burning of fossil fuels costs India Rs10.7 lakh crore annually, reveals a latest report. In a first-of-its-kind study, the scientific analysis by Greenpeace Southeast Asia and Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) has quantified the global cost of air pollution emitted from fossil fuels.Titled 'Toxic Air: The Price of Fossil Fuels', the report states that China mainland, the United States and India bear the highest cost of air pollution due to fossil fuels. The cost for India is equivalent to 5.4% of its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Highlighting the growing death toll attributed to air pollution, the report states that one million deaths per year in India are caused due to air pollution generated from burning fossil fuels. /Apart from this, the pollution is also a major health threat to children. ""Over 12 lakh children in India live with asthma linked to fossil fuel pollution. Exposure to pollution from fossil fuels also leads to around 49 crore days of work absence due to illness,"" the report adds. The study stresses transition to renewable energy is essential to combat climate change as well as to protect public health. ""Every year, air pollution from fossil fuels takes millions of lives, increases our risk of stroke, lung cancer and asthma, and costs us trillions of dollars. But this is a problem we know how to solve, by transitioning to renewable energy sources, phasing out diesel and petrol cars, and building public transport,"" said Minwoo Son, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia.TOI recently reported coal-fired power plants across the country have missed the emission reduction deadline for the second time. ""Strict action must be taken against non-compliance of thermal power plants. The government must ensure construction of new coal-fired power plants is halted and existing plants must be shut down in phases. Moving our energy generation sector from fossil fuels to renewables would help prevent premature deaths and vast savings in health costs,"" said Avinash Chanchal, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India.He further pointed out the country spent around 1.28% of its GDP on health while air pollution from burning fossil fuels costs an estimated 5.4% of the GDP. ""This year, the Central government allocated only Rs69,000 crore for the health sector in the Union budget. This makes it clear that as a country we must fix our priority and stop burning fossil fuels which are harming our health and economy both,"" he said, adding that a just energy transition to renewable energy was feasible for the country.On mitigation measures, the report states clean transport system can significantly reduce toxic pollutants. ""Effective public transport system, walking and cycling infrastructure will not just reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also lead to a decrease in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, obesity, diabetes, mental illness and respiratory diseases,"" it adds.

"Kharghar, Taloja residents protest against air pollution","NAVI MUMBAI: The members of Kharghar Taloja Colonies Welfare Association began their protest against air pollution outside the office of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in Belapur-CBD on Thursday afternoon. /<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Angry cries of ""MPCB hai hai!"" rent the air outside the office of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). Several residents, including senior citizens, held banners and posters on the serious issue of air pollution in Kharghar and Taloja areas, and demanded quick action from the state government agencies.The president of KTCWA, Mangesh Ranawade, said while addressing the protesters, ""We have been appealing and requesting MPCB and others to monitor the worsening air quality in Kharghar, Taloja areas due to the presence of chemical industries and smoking brick kilns. However, no action was taken. It is, therefore, time to protest so that the government takes a solid decision. The time for discussion is over.""Some of the officials of MPCB, including senior officer Sachin Adkar, later came to meet and talk to the protesters. ""We are soon going to form a committee which includes the local stakeholders, in order to sort out the issue of air pollution in Kharghar and Taloja. With regards to the pollution due to the brick kilns in the area, the local revenue officials must also be contacted,"" said Adkar.However, the citizens were visibly angry and several people raised their voices to say ""We were assured of clean air and a healthy lifestyle by Cidco and others at the time of buying flats in Kharghar and Taloja. But now it is painful to even breathe the air in the morning hours. MPCB must take concrete steps to ensure basic clean air for us.""Ranawade also told mediapersons that they will continue their stir for an indefinite period outside Raigad Bhavan building, where the office of MPCB currently is. Many locals will also sit on hunger strike in this regard.Many protesters have also demanded that MPCB must atleast install five air pollution monitoring machines in Kharghar, Taloja areas so that the exact air pollution levels can be observed in real time.

Track the pollution level in your city,#Antipollution beauty products are most in demand in 2020,"Dhool, mitti aur pollution banaati hai apki twacha ko rukhi aur bejaan - which is why pollution-battling skincare and beauty products are on the rise in markets. Regular reports on increasing pollution levels, deteriorating air quality, depleting ozone layer, the Delhi Apocalypse and wider climate concerns, have all caused a huge shift in consumers' attitude over the past few years. And this is reflected in the new range of anti-pollution lines being churned out by almost every high-end skincare brand across the world today. Environmental concerns are also dethroning 'fairness' as one of the main prerequisites in beauty products. /A study by Neilson, a global data and research company, states, ""While fairness has historically comprised half the Rs 7,000 crore skincare category, anti-pollution creams and formulations are rising in the double-digit compared with overall skincare which is growing at 7%.""  From anti-pollution mists and anti-photoageing creams, to urban cover foundations - anti-pollution cosmetics are flooding the Indian market and will be a key cosmetics trend across the globe in 2020.  Anshu Budhraja who is a direct seller of Amway India, says that their anti-pollution skincare products are outperforming the other skincare regimes by at least 25%, while Nitin Passi, chairman of Lotus Herbals, tells us, ""Anti-pollution products are now growing three times faster than our fairness range."" HOW POLLUTION AFFECTS YOUR SKINThe common symptoms that show that your skin has been undergoing damage due to pollution, include burning sensations, rashes, and the appearance of pigmentation and fine lines in your 20s. Fine dust, CO2 emissions enter pores, causing patchiness, dehydration, dryness, dark spots, dullness, itchy skin, sensitivity, and rashes. Excessive exposure also aggravates dark circles, and worsens inflammatory skin diseases like eczema, acne, psoriasis, and rosacea,"" says skin specialist Dr Anuradha Patwardhan. Sunlight: While UVA is responsible for skin ageing (photoageing), radiations along with UVB result in damage to the immune system in some people, and cause malignant melanoma, and other such serious conditions. Air pollution: Pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides, particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), etc, cause skin ageing and inflammatory or allergic skin conditions, such as eczema, psoriasis or acne, while skin cancer is among the most serious effects of pollution.WHAT POLLUTION-FREE BEAUTY'S ALL ABOUTAlmost every skincare brand today has an anti-pollution line to its name. While Ren offers the Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist, Innisfree has a City Pollution Defender bubble foam, and Clinique a City Block Purifying Charcoal Clay Mask & Scrub. Other anti-pollution products include Keihl's Pollutant Defending Masque, and Clarins' UV Plus Anti-pollution Day Screen Multi-Protection cream. Ingredients in anti-pollution products range from Vit C and E extracts, to hyaluronic acid and antioxidants, to charcoal, green tea and matcha. ""Avon's R&D and global science team have created a face cream to combat the harmful effects of major pollution issues. The formulation comes with an SPF 50/PA+++, forming a protective layer over the skin and keeps pollution such as PM2.5* and harmful UV-A and UV-B rays,"" says Swati Jain, marketing director. VLCC has a range of anti-pollution skin and hair products ""that are enriched with green tea, a powerful antioxidant which protects the skin from the damaging effects of pollution, environmental stress and orange peel oil which moisturises naturally,"" says a spokesperson from the brand. DO THESE PRODUCTS WORK?""It is important that you have a certain beauty regime in place to maintain your skin's health, however, more than topical creams, facewashes and treatments, a healthy lifestyle can help negate the impact of pollution on your skin. Eating foods that are loaded with antioxidants, proteins and Vitamin C and E help improve your skin's immunity and resilience and help save it from toxic air and sunlight. An active lifestyle and sleep are great way to help your skin battle pollution. Ensure that you drink plenty of water and apply sunscreen with a minimum of 30 SPF every day,"" says Dr Shweta Iyengar, skin exp ert.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Hyderabad sees bad air days, records higher AQI than Delhi","Hyderabad: The city has been dealing with worse pollution levels than Delhi over the past week with experts suggesting that rains in the capital might be a reason for pollution levels plummeting there. In the last week alone, on three occasions the Air Quality Index (AQI) - used to monitor pollution in the city - for Hyderabad was higher, in spite of the city getting light drizzle.On Thursday, the AQI in the city was 118 as opposed to 79 in Delhi. The next day, figures were 90 in the city and 66 in Delhi and on Saturday, levels were at 83 in the city and 67 in Delhi. /An expert from the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) said the rains in the capital might have been a major reason for the fall in pollutants. ""This is a temporary phenomenon likely because of the rains experienced in Delhi,"" the expert said.He said change in wind directions could also be attributed to levels remaining above 90 in Hyderabad even though there have been brief spells of rain.Also suggesting the rain as being the major reason, experts said smaller factors may have reduced vehicular traffic. ""The recent violence in the capital and coronavirus fears may have reduced vehicular pollutants. Such factors must be analysed before we reach any conclusion,"" said Babu Rao, an air pollution expert. Besides this, the greater awareness may also be a contributing factor, say some experts, adding that Hyderabad needs to do more.As per TSPCB data, the AQI index was the highest in February at IDA Pashamylaram (115), followed by Zoo park (113). The data was based on the levels monitored by Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations. The least AQI levels were noticed at Sanathnagar at 79.Levels above 100 are categorised as 'moderate' where it might cause ""breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases"", as per the Central Pollution Control Board's standards.

Green adieu to pyres: City to get three eco-friendly crematoriums,"Lucknow: If an ambitious civic plan succeeds, the city will soon boast three green crematoriums or 'greenatoriums' that will offer residents an environment-friendly way to bid the final goodbye to their loved ones.According to LMC officials, the 'greenatorium' is a cross between the traditional funeral pyre made of wood and an electric crematorium comprising a metal chamber and an exhaust pipe. Chief engineer RN Tripathi said the green crematorium system would comprise a burning chamber equipped with a body tray, two exhaust pipes or chimneys and a water tank to ""neutralise"" the fumes.""The body will be placed in the drawer-like pyre and covered with wood. It will be lit and then pushed into the chamber, which will be then closed. /The toxic, black smoke will be passed through the first chimney and a water tank before being released as white smoke through the second chimney,"" Tripathi explained.The 'greenatorium' has several advantages over a traditional pyre. One, it will require only 75kg of wood instead of around 350kg used in last rites. Two, the cost of burning a body will come down to Rs 300-500 against Rs 4,000-plus. Three, the system can bring down air pollution levels, besides aiding conservation of trees.The LMC has allocated a budget of Rs 1.35 crore from the 14th Finance Commission for these eco-friendly crematoriums in Kudiya Ghat, Baikunth Dham in Gomtinagar and Alambagh. A Gorakhpur-based private company has been roped in and installation work is expected to begin from the first week of April. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said Lucknow would be the first city in UP to boast green crematoriums. ""The 'greenatoriums' will offer people the opportunity to light a traditional wood pyre without damaging air quality,"" she added.Taking its environment concerns farther, the LMC will set up smart dustbins in 12 prominent areas of the city. Each sensor-equipped bin will send an alert to the command centre as soon as it reaches capacity. A budget of Rs 1 crore has been set aside for this project.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Low testing could explain India's small COVID numbers',"What explains the relatively very low number of Covid-19 cases in India? It could be down to inadequate testing, Dr T Sundararaman, public health expert and former Director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre tells Rema NagarajanThe numbers seem to indicate that we have COVID-19 under control. Is that the case?It is too early to be sure. And the number of persons we are testing, and the number of laboratories for testing are very low. /But the most worrying is that the current whom-to-test protocol will completely miss any community transmission. What is the best case scenario and what is the worst case scenario?This is more in the nature of speculation than any scientific estimate. The best-case scenario is that this virus is very sensitive to the Indian summer and decreases completely, and does not come back later. The total infected remains lower than say 10,000. The worst-case scenario is that it peaks in July, when it infects a high proportion of the adult population over 30 years of age, say 30 to 50%, and over 4% of these need critical care.There are zero cases from states such as Bihar and Gujarat with large migrant populations. Why?I feel it's because of extraordinarily low level of testing. Bihar has just one testing centre in Patna, Gujarat two in Ahmedabad and Jamnagar. How can we expect someone with flu symptoms to travel such long distances to be tested? In several states, I was told of instances where people going with flu symptoms to the general hospital are being turned away because there is no testing centre there. Why can't there be testing centres in at least in the 272 government medical colleges and in district hospitals?In practice they don't seem to be testing anyone except those with history of travel abroad or of contact with someone who had COVID-19. But if community transmission has set in, which is very likely, the majority of the infected would not have such a history.Do we have the resources to test all people with flu symptoms? It's just a PCR test like you do for other diseases like dengue, HIV, Hepatitis C or drug resistant TB. So scale up and implementation for COVID-19 is possible. There is the issue of bio-safety in handling the samples and that would have to be addressed by rapid training programmes and necessary protocols. The government should procure and make test kits available across testing centres for free in an emergency like this. Having just 52 centres across India makes no sense. And not even all of these are fully functional. ICMR says it is doing random testing of cases of flu like symptoms. Would that help?Random testing is not the same as testing all people with clinical symptoms of flu. Random testing is usually done at a much later stage for getting population-based estimates of the spread of the disease by testing for antibodies. Right now, they ought to test everyone with flu-like symptoms. South Korea found huge cluster of cases in the most unexpected of places because they did extensive testing. But we seem more inclined to do dramatic things like cancelling all visas, closing all educational institutions etc, but not enough on the ground like setting up testing centres. Even one testing centre per district would mean only about 700 centres, an easily achievable target.It's said that community spread is inevitable but can be slowed down. Is it feasible to slow down the spread once it spreads into the community in a country like India?All our measures will help slow it down. But the flu happens in surges. It might well go down, if this virus act similar to flu viruses that go down in summer. But there could be a surge when the monsoon starts in July. We buy some time by slowing the spread, but we have to be prepared for the July surge. There is usually one more surge in winter. How well prepared is the health system?Going by an estimate that 30 to 50% of a population could get infected and of this 4% would need critical care, we are talking of 25,000 or more in a district of 20 lakh population. We hardly have any ICU beds or ventilators in district hospitals. We need to start setting them up immediately. But we don't hear anything about district hospitals being strengthened or surveillance for flu and flu-like illness being set up. Once the epidemic is over, we might have surplus capacity of ICUs and ventilators. That's how a public system has to be. It has to have surplus so that it can expand its capacity in times of emergency. Moreover, India has a large amount of insecticide poisoning and cobra-snake bites, which also requires ventilators. We also have a high incidence of chronic lung disease and seasonal flu, some of whom develop complications for which ventilation would be required. So these facilities can be put to good use. Why can't we requisition help from the private sector in an emergency for ICU beds and ventilators?Even the private sector doesn't have enough capacity, except a few concentrated pockets mostly in urban areas. They will have to be roped in for isolation, quarantine and support services. In a specific district with an outbreak, you might have to commandeer all the private resources. The government has the powers under the Epidemic Act. It needs to have a plan ready on how it can take over all private healthcare resources in an emergency and run it and hand it back once the emergency is over. Someone has to try out the drill, develop a protocol on how to do it; that's what emergency preparedness is all about. Every chief medical officer of a district ought to know how many beds can be commandeered in a district if needed, what provision for transport exists and so on. But my guess is that we won't have that sort of pressure for hospitalization. Why do you think we won't have that sort of hospitalization?We could get lucky and much less could get infected. But a more likely reason is that we could be in denial since we are not doing enough testing to identify the cases. Access to hospitalization is even now very skewed. Otherwise, why is there such a huge difference between hospitalization rates in Kerala and Bihar. Because the latter doesn't have systems to capture the data, we cannot measure the excess deaths that are happening due to lack of hospitalization even before this pandemic.Do you think India has an advantage because of a larger proportion of young population?Going by the pattern in other countries, because we have a younger population, we should have less incidence. Having fewer old people might mean fewer deaths and so mortality rate might be less. However, whatever advantage younger age gives us would be lost because of widespread malnutrition and chronic respiratory disease. India has a high susceptibility to TB. India's rate of chronic lung disease is five to ten times higher than developed countries, probably related to its higher levels of air pollution, and this means a higher incidence of respiratory illnesses. However, even if there is a spike in hospitalizations and deaths due to acute respiratory illness, if we are not testing, we will attribute those deaths to the co-morbidities. There is no way to clinically differentiate a death from acute exacerbation of COPD from a COVID-19 death, though COVID-19 could be the cause of the exacerbation, unless you test. Are shutdowns the answer?Other than mitigating the health impact of the epidemic, we need to mitigate the economic and social impact. We need to be careful about the societal and economic shutdowns. The impact of tourist business, restaurants, travel, etc being shut down is felt hardest by contractual labour living precariously on daily wages. We seem to have no plan to mitigate their loss and no compensation for them. The burden of a shutdown will be borne disproportionately by the poor. If this shutdown prolongs, the adverse impact on their health could be more from the economic crisis and hunger than from the pandemic. If public health expenditure does not rise sharply, more and scarce public health resources would require to be diverted to fight the epidemic and that could mean that it leaves less for treating other diseases that they are dying of.

Corona curfew on bad air: Pollution levels decrease,"Varanasi: After nationwide lockdown, the city registered a dip in air pollution on Thursday. Reason: No communting and industrial activities led to better air quality. At a time when the novel coronavirus has wrecked a havoc on human health and lives across the globe, the efforts to check its spread has brought a positive impact on environment particularly after the lockdown. /""We can notice a significant improvement in air quality not only in Varanasi but other places too due to the imposition of lockdown in the country. The vehicular exhausts and industrial pollutants, which are the major source of air pollution, have been stopped. Obviously, it resulted in improvement of air quality, which is good to human health to fight against the coronavirus,"" said noted environment scientist of Banaras Hindu University Prof BD Tripathi. The data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) suggests that the air quality in most of the cities, which used to breath in bad air, has witnessed a significant improvement. Varanasi, which had witnessed 378 Air Quality Index (AQI) in very poor category in the beginning of January, recorded 135 AQI (moderate) on Thursday. A day after Janta Curfew the city's AQI was 99 (satisfactory) on March 23. More or less similar was the condition in other cities including Kanpur and Lucknow, which were in the categories of 'good' and 'satisfactory' respectively. Kanpur's AQI was 50, while Lucknow recorded 91 AQI. Out of 102 cities in CPCB's AQI Bulletin only two cities -Muzaffarpur and Guwahati had 'very poor' air with AQI 216 and 214 respectively. While 22 cities were in 'Good' category, 14 were in 'moderate' and 64 cities were in 'satisfactory' categories. Mandideep was the cleanest with 29 AQI in the country. The 'Good' AQI (0-50) has minimal on health, 'Satisfactory' (51-100) category suggests minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, 'Moderate' (101-200) causes breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. The 'Poor' AQI (201-300) makes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure, while 'Very Poor' (301-400) AQI causes respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. The 'Severe' (401-500) category AQI affects health people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. Prof Tripathi said that such a situation came after the restriction on public and private transport, including autorickshaws, taxis, and all inter-district and inter-State transport buses, railways and air service.

MP breathes easy as air pollution levels go down,"Bhopal: Barely a week into the nationwide lockdown - with little vehicular movement - pollution levels have dipped in major cities of the state, said officials on Friday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Ujjain improved in just a week's time, with Jabalpur being the only exception. /Construction activities, which have come to a halt also helped. Data says that air quality of Bhopal on March 20 was 'moderate'; it turned into 'good' on Friday. In Indore, the air quality was 'moderate', which turned into 'satisfactory' on Friday. Air quality of Gwalior was 'satisfactory' on March 20, which moved to 'good' on Friday. In Ujjain too, the air quality has changed to 'good' from 'moderate' for the past one week. Surprisingly, air quality remained 'satisfactory' from March 20 till this report was filed on Friday. Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). While vehicle emissions lead to rise in SO2, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity. PM-10 is caused by dust and construction, including building of roads. PM2.5 levels are sensitive to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful as it causes severe lung diseases.

City records best air quality amid crisis,"Nashik: The absence of vehicles on roads for the last nine days has ensured the city reports its best air quality in the past few years.The impact of the nationwide lockdown on the air quality was felt immediately. On March 26, a day after the nationwide lockdown was announced, Nashik city recorded its lowest air quality index in past couple of years.Sources in the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board said that the air quality index was 115 on March 2, which reduced to 23 on March 26.Sources said that the air quality index was at 46 on March 30, but reduced to 33 on April 1. On Thursday, the air quality index was again recorded at 47. This is because marginal vehicular movement was noticed in the city.As per parameters, air quality index between 1 and 50 is considered good and has minimal impact on people. /In comparison, an index between 101 and 200 is moderate and causes breathing discomfort to the people with lung, heart disease, children and older adults. Index between 301 and 400 causes respiratory illness to people in case of prolonged exposure.""Vehicular movement has almost completely stopped due to lockdown. Many people are working from home. I think that work from home should continue in the private establishment wherever it is possible. This will help control fuel burning due to vehicles and minimize air pollution,"" said environmentalist Rajesh Pandit.He added that minimum human interference into nature has led to drop in air pollution. It is nature correcting itself, he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Neeri develops indoor air purifier, hands it over to Mayo hosp","Nagpur: Taking note of the safety of medical persons working in government hospitals while treating coronavirus patients, CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has developed a first-of-its-kind bench scale air purification scrubber (BAPS) that will purify indoor air.On Friday, the scientists handed over the scrubber to Mayo Hospital where nine corona positive patients are currently undergoing treatment. The original design of BAPS developed by the institute was used for treating outdoor air pollution. Wet scrubbers are effective air pollution control devices for removing particles or gases from indoor or outdoor exhaust streams. /It operates by introducing the dirty gas stream with a scrubbing liquid.According to scientists, the same invention has been modified to decontaminate indoor air. ""The scrubber works on the principle of absorbing dust particles from the air. In the pilot experiment at Mayo, we have replaced the regular liquid with soap water and disinfectants. There are higher chances of presence of virus inside the hospital air. The scrubber will clean the air from particles and bound bio aerosols, and release treated air out,"" said PS Rao, senior principal scientist at Neeri.Rao added that the vacuum pump takes in the ""impure air, dirt and pollution from the atmosphere and delivers it to the lower chamber of the system through a pipe"". ""A mixture of disinfectant and soap water is present in the lower chamber. The impure air from the atmosphere reacts with the disinfectant soap water mixture takes up the particles including bio aerosols and it gets purified,"" she said.The dirt in the air settles down at the bottom the chamber as the dirt particles are heavier. ""Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the bio aerosols falls apart and dies, or rather it becomes inactive. It is reported that the bio aerosols including virus can remain active in ambient air and many surfaces for hours,"" said Rao.If proven effective, BAPs can be used on a large scale at airports, malls, cinema halls and other places which have huge footfalls.

People living near power plants in Korba vulnerable to Covid-19: Study,"RAIPUR: Communities residing near coal-fired thermal power plants in Korba-the power capital of Chhattisgarh-are two times likely to suffer from respiratory diseases amid the Covid-19 pandemic.This was revealed in a recent study released by Chhattisgarh's State Health Resource Centre (SHRC) which assessed the health impact on communities in Korba living near coal-fired thermal power plants. The study establishes the hypothesis that the population living near thermal power plants has greater exposure to particulate matter resulting in higher respiratory illnesses than the general population.SHRC executive director Dr Prabir Chatterjee told TOI, ""As per findings of the study, communities living in close vicinity of coal-fired thermal power plants in Korba are more prone to respiratory diseases than the general population. Therefore, if a disease like COVID-19 which attacks respiratory system, if reaches Korba, this population is highly vulnerable to the disease.""Dr Chatterjee added that studies like this help us identify clusters of vulnerable populations and design services that are most needed for them, not just during normal circumstances but also during pandemics like Covid. /For Korba we need a process of continuous monitoring of health and a robust health system dedicated to mitigation of the air pollution related problems among the residents.Korba-based environmental activist Laxmi Chauhan said, ""The findings of the report vindicate our claims of serious impacts on health of the people in the region due to air pollution from the power plants. We welcome the findings of the report and now urge the state administration to ensure that these recommendations are implemented in a time-bound manner to ensure that there is no further damage from power plants on our health and environment.""In this cross-sectional study, samples from exposed populations living within a 10-km radius of the power plants in Korba and samples of unexposed population of village Katghora about 20 kilometres away from Korba were compared. The findings of the health study show significantly elevated prevalence of respiratory diseases like asthma symptoms and bronchitis among the exposed population in Korba than unexposed ones in Katghora. As per the findings, asthma symptoms and bronchitis were 11.79% and 2.96% among the exposed group while 5.46% and 0.99% respectively in the unexposed group.The study also claims that there have been anecdotal reports from the villagers about increased prevalence of skin problems, lung problems, and asthma in the region. Local farmers have reported crop damages and contamination in irrigation water which affects the paddy fields. Many farmers have been reportedly abandoning their lands due to reduced crop productivity.Based on these findings, SHRC Chhattisgarh has made urgent health recommendations to set up a specialised health care infrastructure operated by the state health departments at polluters' cost, under the 'polluter pays principle', to cater to health issues of residents in the region. Recommendations has also been made to the state to conduct a cumulative health impact study of various industries on the health of residents in the area to formulate a necessary health mitigation plan for the region.

Citizens' post-shutdown mantra: Stay disciplined,"GUWAHATI: The ongoing lockdown period is a great lesson on cleanliness, appropriate social norms and self-isolation, a section of citizens has said. With more than half of the lockdown period behind us, a number of citizens said they felt this period will have a lasting impact on the way people look at life and that many will move towards healthier habits once things are back to normal. ""Science says it takes 21 days to grow any habit. So, the lockdown can make us better human beings with better social behaviour. /The lockdown taught us to be patient, people stood in queues outside shops, ATMs, people were not allowed to roam around unnecessarily. I would be happy to see these changes in people even after life returns to normal,"" said Preeti Das, a Gauhati high court advocate.Coronavirus has taught people the necessity of maintaining physical distance, said Suman Tembe, a young employee of Guwahati. ""Unnecessary physical contacts such as instant hugs among friends, sharing each other's clothes as a sign of friendship would be a thing of the past. Etiquettes are no longer a choice, it's the need. The lockdown will change the way we look at friendship,"" she said.For actor-turned-politician Bobbeeta Sharma, cleanliness norms such as washing of hands, regular cleaning of houses, office premises, etc, should now become permanent habits once the lockdown is over.""Habits such as washing hands, cleaning lifts, touch pads of ATMs were not taken so seriously. But now it has become mandatory health rules. This must continue even after the virus scare is over. We were taught by elders that we should not touch our faces with the hands, since they come in contact with hundreds of other things. These are rules we must continue to follow carefully,"" she said, adding that the city should be cleaned up from time to time.For Lokesh Mathur, a public relations professional, the best thing the virus taught us was to maintain a healthy social distance. ""I have often picked up fights with people for entering the ATM while I am inside for transaction, when it is clearly written that one person should enter at a time. I hope this period will teach people to be patient and learn to wait for their turn,"" he said.Prastuti Parashar, another Assamese film actor said, the fear psychosis that was prevailing among people due to the virus outbreak would make people follow social norms in the days to come. ""Queuing in front of shops, being organised in public events, maintaining physical distance in public spaces are lessons that need to be learnt from this period,"" she said.Atul Borgohain, Professor of Assam Agricultural University, Khanapara and an environmentalist said there should be a lockdown in the entire world every year to rejuvenate the ecosystem. ""The environment has immensely benefitted from the lockdown. Wild animals are showing up without fear, the air is clean, noise pollution is low. I would say, to slow down the process of global warming; all governments across the world should announce a 10-day lockdown every year.""Ninety cities of India have recorded a dip in air pollution over the past 11 days.Naushad Hussain, an adventure sports professional and a tour guide from Guwahati, said, ""We are all going through a bad time, but there are lots of things we hope to learn from the lockdown such as recycle, reuse and sustainability. I would back more lockdowns in future as a disaster and disease response plan.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
People living near thermal power plants will be hit harder by Covid-19: study,"Nagpur: People residing near coal-fired power plants are more prone to respiratory illnesses and diseases like coronavirus than others, reveals latest scientific study done by Chhattisgarh State Health Resource Centre (SHRC).The cross-sectional study establishes that people living near thermal power plants have greater exposure to particulate matter. It compares samples from exposed population living within a 10 km radius of the power plants in Korba, which has the world's second largest open cast mines and 10 power plants in its vicinity producing 6000MW of electricity. The second group of samples is taken from Katghora, a village 20 kms from Korba. /The findings show significantly elevated prevalence of respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis, which were 11.79% and 2.96% among the exposed group respectively. Both diseases were at 5.46% and 0.99% in the unexposed group, thereby establishing the higher disease burden in communities residing around the thermal power plants. The air sampling was carried out in nine locations in Korba. The results indicated that five of them had PM2.5 levels above the permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) as prescribed by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).Levels of manganese exceeded in six out of seven samples by 2.2 to 6.03 times the safe limit while the levels of lead in one location (Kharmora) was found to be 1.02 times above the safe levels. Apart from this, the levels of arsenic in two samples (Dari Nagoikhar and Kharmora) exceed the government standards by 1.01 and 1.51 times respectively and levels of nickel in five samples were 2.05 to 3.0 times above the permissible limit.Based on the findings, experts have warned that Covid-19 is likely to hit harder in air pollution impacted communities. ""It is because exposure to air pollution in long-term reduces the capacity of organs to function fully and makes it more vulnerable to infections and diseases. In the context of the current pandemic, such individuals are likely to face higher complications, including serious ones,"" said Dr Yogesh Jain from Jan Swasthya Sahyog, Bilaspur.Stating that the findings corroborate serious impacts on public health due to pollution from thermal power plants, Korba-based environmental activist Laxmi Chauhan said, ""We have been complaining about health problems, severe air pollution, contamination of groundwater and soil in the region for several years now. We welcome the findings of the report and now urge the state administration to ensure these recommendations are implemented in a time-bound manner.""In its report, SHRC Chhattisgarh has recommended setting up a specialized healthcare infrastructure operated by the state health departments at polluters' cost, under the 'polluter pays' principle. It further suggests the state government to conduct a cumulative health impact study of various industries on the health of residents in the area to formulate a mitigation plan.Dr Prabir Chatterjee, executive director of SHRC, said, ""This study is important as it documents the health burden of the population due to the operations of the power plants.

PMO responds to Greens' complain of burning Uran garbage dump during lockdown,"NAVI MUMBAI: The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has responded to complaints against the 21-day-long toxic smoke and unbearable stench emanating from the burning municipal garbage dump near an ONGC pipeline at Uran, in Raigad district of Maharashtra, which they said is posing a grave risk to the public health amid the current coronavirus scare lockdown.City greens pointed that the Uran Municipal Council (UMC) has been dumping the garbage next to the mangroves in brazen violation of Bombay high court order, even as the people in the vicinity continued to suffer due to unchecked air pollution.""They are obviously taking advantage of the absence of environmental officers' surveillance check due to corona care,"" BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation, which has filed a grievance addressed to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his website drawing his attention to the fact that the people with breathing problems face corona risk.""We are happy to note that the PMO has taken note of the issue and referred to under secretary Ambuj Sharma,"" said B N Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation.Kumar has earlier also written to the Bombay high court-appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee, the State Environment department apart from the chief minister.The PMO had closed the old case in December 2017 on the UMC's assurance that proper care would be taken while disposing of the garbage, said Samir Ashrit, who has been fighting for the people living at Bori Pakhadi in Uran. /""This assurance was never meant to be followed and we the residents continued to suffer,"" he said.The dump was set afire by some miscreants disposing of packets of potato chips and ever since then fire tenders belonging to the ONGC have making trips to douse the flames. But the dumping has not been halted while continuous smoke and an intermittent fire continue from the heap.When TOI contacted the Uran Municipal Council for their comment on this issue, a civic official Mahesh Lote said: ""The dumping ground site at Uran has been given to us by the Raigad district collectorate. Once we get another dumping site, we will vacate this area. Whenever any smoke or fire is noticed at Bori Pakhadi, we immediately inform the fire brigade to douse it.""The activists have been posting daily fire bulletins to the PMO, state chief minister, the environment minister, mangrove committee chairman and the Raigad district collector pleading for immediate intervention before the situation gets worse.The Mangrove committee has three months ago directed local planner Cidco and Raigad collector to clear the garbage dump and find an alternative site, while the revenue officials themselves filed an FIR against the UMC officials under the Environment Protection Act, said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.Local residents, who have been forced to bear the brunt of the garbage dump, were in fact cynical as no positive development has taken place over the years. To make matters worse, the civic body started spraying pesticides in heavy doses on the garbage being dumped non-stop, said Ashrit.The people at Bori Pakhadi and neighbouring Hanuman Koliwada in particular have been facing breathing problems due to the smoke billowing out of the burning plastic, rubber, tyres and other muck, even as the mangroves continue to be choked.""Our protests have been ignored and we do not understand the officials' mind-set in making us suffer like this,"" said another resident Pritam Thakur. ""We cannot come out due to the lockdown and the Section 144 in force and are unable sit at home due to the unbearable stink,"" he said and pointed out that several elderly people are silently suffering.Advocate Ratnadeep Patil, spearheading the Uran Yuva forum, said the law abiding residents agitating peacefully so far and that their patience should be tested too long.The continued destruction of the nature, caring two hoots for the Court and the mangrove committee directive, bears stark resemblance of the burial of mangroves and wetlands by NMSEZ during the last Lok Sabha elections when the environment officials were away on poll duty, Kumar said.""We have in fact cautioned the authorities against the possibility of unscrupulous elements talking advantage of the complete lockdown and curfew period,"" he said and regretted: ""Our premonition, unfortunately, came true.""Tukaram Koli of Paaramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruiti Samiti, said today you see about 3,000 people exposed to the toxic fumes. ""But we cannot imagine the situation if a major disaster occurs on the fire as the ONGC pipeline is close by,"" he said. ""We are shocked at the inaction of the authorities - from Cidco, the cCollector to the UMC CEO - as we are forced to breathe pollution,"" Koli said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution adds to north Chennai's vulnerability,"Chennai: In North Chennai, which is reporting more Covid-19 cases with respiratory infections, the presence of pollutants could make residents, particularly in high-risk groups, more vulnerable to the disease.Satellite images captured by researchers of Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) show nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over parts of north Chennai during the first phase of lockdown. Researchers said though levels of NO2, which could be emissions from thermal power plants, may be lower during the lockdown, they still poses risk as the gas converts into PM 2.5 that people may end up inhaling. NO2 comes mainly from combustion of fossil fuels and from petroleum products. /Analyst Sunil Dahiya, who studied the pollution levels before and during lockdown periods with the images, said the level of NO2 in the north Chennai region was within the limits of the national ambient air quality standards but still risky. Between March 11 and 24, the levels were between 3.32 ug/m3 and 12.52 ug/m3 at Manali village station and between 7.22 ug/m3 and 19.1 ug/m3 in Manali. From March 25 to April 7, the levels were between 1.3 ug/m3 and 8.68 ug/m3 in Manali village and between 1.74 ug/m3 and 24.68 ug/m3. National ambient air quality standards say levels of NO2 should be 80 ug/m3 when monitored every 24 hours. However, the Central Pollution Contgrol Board (CPCB) continues to show air quality index in the region as 'moderate' and not 'good'. The presence of the pollutant in the region comes at a time when studies have found that high levels of air pollution could raise the risk of dying from Covid-19.Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan, director, ICMR Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Sri Ramachandra Institute for Higher Education and Research, said air pollution may increase the vulnerability of the population to Covid-19 though several other factors like population density in the area and contact with an infected individual are involved. ""You cannot directly associate high level of pollution to high level of covid cases because many other factors come into play. But one thing is for sure, both air pollution and all kinds of environmental hazards that predispose you to ill health aregoing to play on the vulnerability of the population.""

"Lockdown, rain make Kolkata's air cleanest in recorded history","Kolkata: Long-term lockdown and a downpour pushed all pollutants - PM2.5, PM10, SO2 NO2, CO, benzene and ammonia - below the stringent WHO standard, making city's air the cleanest in the entire country. It was also the cleanest in Kolkata's recorded history. Experts said such air quality will help people suffering from heart, lung and kidney ailments in battling the Covid-19 far more effectively. /""Lockdown has transformed the air and water quality significantly. Hundreds of emission-controlling measures worth hundreds of crores could not have brought the pollution level down so effectively,"" said Subhas Datta, city's foremost environment crusader. ""Air pollution contributes to co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and make people vulnerable to Covid-19. The clean air, on the other hand, enables one to fight the pandemic effectively,"" said Arun Sharma, professor-director (community medicine), University College of Medical Sciences, University of Delhi.Moreover, a polluted area will have more dust particles that can act as a carrier for the virus. ""The cleaning up of air significantly coincides with introduction of BS-VI emission standard. The superior emission technology will reduce the pollution. But at the same time, we have to phase out old polluting vehicles more effectively,"" said Prabir Bose, a leading automobile expert. While the lockdown brought down the overall pollution level drastically, Tuesday's downpour did the rest, cleaning up the air to such an extent that the presence of pollutants in the air was negligible. The lockdown evidently has had an even bigger impact on NO2 levels. ""It is now our collective responsibility to maintain the air quality. If we can dot that, we can get rid many of diseases. Otherwise, we would invite more trouble,"" said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, environment activist and automobile emission consultant. Ghosh added that people must understand that polluted air can make a pandemic more potent. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Indoor pollution from firewood poses higher Covid risk: Researchers,"Chennai: If avoiding outdoors could protect people from Covid-19, researchers warn that staying indoors may not be any safer. Researchers said Indian slum dwellers will be exposed to extreme indoor air pollution while burning firewood or coal for cooking that could put them at greater risk for suffering respiratory infections and make them vulnerable to Covid-19. The issue of regular exposure to biomass burning for cooking gains significance as the people living in tiny shacks are unable to maintain social distance and forced to stay indoors, end up inhaling the smoke.The researchers from Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad, and Maastricht University, Netherlands, said communities of slum dwellers, refugees, guest workers are most vulnerable as they often use solid fuels for cooking and heating inside their poorly ventilated houses. They said while women and young infants are routinely exposed to indoor pollutants during cooking, with total lockdown, the entire family is forced to stay indoors where men may also smoke. /The observations were made based on several international studies that found a link between exposure to air pollution and Covid-19.""Pollution impairs the first line of defence of upper airways - cilia. A person living in an area with high levels of pollutants is thus more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and susceptible to any infective agent,"" said the research paper published in Environmental Research journal. As there is a lack of evidence, the researchers suggested epidemiological studies to study the association between exposure to biomass smoke and Covid-19.One of the studies based on which the researchers made the observations is one done in Northern Italy, which indicated higher prevalence and mortality of Covid-19 could be partly associated with exposure to a higher level of air pollution. Another study in the United States found significant association between air pollution and Covid-19 deaths. An analysis during the outbreak of SARS in 2002 in China revealed that infected people living in more polluted regions were twice as likely to die as those in less polluted areas. Smokers too are at greater risk. A recent study in China on Covid-19 patients in hospitals found smokers were 14 times more likely to die as compared to non-smokers.According to studies by Chennai-based Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER), household air pollution is believed to be responsible for 4.8 lakh deaths in India every year. Household air pollution, whose main source is burning of wood, coal and charcoal for cooking, is also a major cause of pneumonia, a leading cause of death in young children from low income families. It is also believed to contribute to low birth weight and stunting in children, increased blood pressure and other cardiovascular and respiratory effects in adults.India, including districts of Nagapattinam and Kallakurichi, is now part of a global study to assess the impact of LPG stove use on household air pollution and health.Kalpana Balakrishnan, director, ICMR Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health, SRIHER, who is involved in the study, said, ""The multi-country study, which is the first such trials conducted in India, is expected to have major implications for expanding and accelerating the use of clean cooking among rural populations and especially, among pregnant women in India.""

Nearly 50% of fires due to dry grass burning,"Panaji: The recent incidents of massive crop stubble burning in the fields in Taleigao and along the Mapusa highway has once again brought to fore the dangers of this practice.Nearly 50% of fire incidents reported in the state are due to burning of dry grass. The state government had last month banned the burning of crop stubble.Speaking to TOI, director of fire and emergency services Ashok Menon said that burning of dry grass, which is undertaken especially in fields, leads to plumes of smoke being released into the air that contributes to respiratory problems among people staying in the vicinity.Menon also said that at a time when air quality levels must have been improved due to the ongoing lockdown, dry grass fires could prove counter productive and lead to a spike in air pollution.During 2019-2020, the fire and emergency services had received 2,953 fire calls, which included incidents of dry grass, plantations, residential, electrical, commercial/industrial units and garbage.Menon said that dry grass fire is considered a man-made disaster as it is banned. He also said that steps have been taken to prevent such man-made disasters.Agriculture director Nevil Alphonso told TOI that his department is continuously creating awareness to prevent burning of dry grass, and their efforts have paid dividends. /He also said that reports of dry grass fires is not much in Goa as compared to the rest of India.""Burning of dry grass is banned by law. At present, such incidents have declined due to awareness,"" he said.In a bid to ensure that farmers don't resort to burning the standing grass of the crop stubs from the previous season in order to fertilise the soil for the next crop, a method that is polluting and presents the risk of wildfires, the North Goa collector last month cautioned against the practice.""The burning of standing grass of the crop of the previous season is prohibited,"" the order signed by collector R Menaka had stated.The collector's order came after the directorate of fire and emergency services had written seeking preventive steps against the setting of fire in agricultural land.Earlier in his letter, Menon had highlighted that such instances could prevail given the government's decision allowing farmers to restart agricultural activities under restricted conditions.

"On World Asthma Day, let's all pledge to stop polluting air","The morning air feels cool and pure, as I stretch my limbs on the roof of my house. The sky is clear, the sun is about to rise to the tune of chirping birds. /There is not a soul in sight and I revel in the silence, serenity and peace of the surroundings.Ever since the lockdown was announced, among the many changes in our lives while being confined to our homes is the immense reduction in the polluting air, which makes breathing easier for all of us, particularly the asthmatics and those with other respiratory diseases. A colleague, who is asthmatic for 15 years now, said he usually finds it difficult to breathe this time of the year, due to the harvesting season in April, and had to increase his medicines and the use of inhalers. But, so far this year, he has not once taken medicines or had to use inhalers due to less pollution and cleaner air! Bronchial asthma, which may be genetic, occupational or due to allergens and smoking, is characterised chiefly by an increase in cough, wheezing and breathlessness. According to WHO almost 300 million people in the world, about 15 to 20 million people in India and 10 to 15% of children have this disease.On World Ashthma Day, let's all work towards making the air we breathe cleaner by reducing air pollution by all means even when the lockdown ends and life returns to normal.(Writer is a retired senior medical officer of the Punjab government) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Heart patients opting for clot busters instead of angioplasty,"Jaipur: While Covid-19 cases are on the rise, cardiac emergencies have dipped as most doctors are combating heart ailments with clot busters. Rather than angiography, doctors and patients are unanimously preferring clot busters and thus avoid being admitted to hospital fearing corona infection. The dip in heart attack cases after coronavirus outbreak has surprised doctors. /""We have performed only one cardiac surgery in emergency in the past one month. Normally, we perform at least daily four to five such surgeries in emergency of patients with cardiac arrest. We are not aware why there is a decline in the number of such patients,"" said Dr Anil Sharma, head of the department (cardiothoracic surgery), SMS Hospital, who had conducted two heart transplants early this year. However, Sharma claimed that patients are opting for clot busters such as streptokinase to avoid angioplasty and hospitalisation. ""Two of my patients informed me that they had injected streptokinase injections for clot busters in their heart at the hospital near to their homes. There condition has improved,"" said Dr Sharma. Even private hospitals are surprised about declining cardiac arrest patients. ""Due to Covid-19 fear and lockdown, a lot of patients are coming to us after getting injected with clot buster such as streptokinase. But, angioplasty has better results. It is 95% effective but clot busters have a result effective up to 60%. It means that clot buster such as streptokinase open the blockage in 60 patients out of 100 patients, but in angioplasty the result is 95%,"" said Dr Prakash Chandwani, a private hospital cardiologist. Since, streptokinase is available even in rural areas, patients are not risking travel to other cities for angioplasty.Majority of the doctors have stopped elective cardiac surgeries amid lockdown. ""With voluntary postponement of elective surgeries, only emergency patients are reporting and that too in the nearest facility. If there is no facility for angioplasty, they are opting for clot busters as they avoid travelling to higher centres where the angioplasty is available. Moreover, there may be insignificant decrease of patients of acute heart attack as the triggers like stress, smoking tobacco and alcohol consumption has really gone down,"" said Dr Rajeev Bagarhatta, professor cardiology, SMS Hospital. Cardiologists are claiming that there could be many other factors for reducing number of cardiac attack patients coming to hosptials. Explaining the possible reasons for this trend, Dr Samin K Sharma, chairman of Eternal hospital, Jaipur said, ""Overall improved mental and physical health. Home containment has resulted in less work-related stress and increased indoor physical activities. Our working hours have become shorter and one of the biggest irritant in our working lives, traffic, has been altogether eliminated. Less restaurant visits, no junk food, balanced home cooked meals, reduced eating and drinking have contributed in reducing heart attacks."" ""Reduced vehicular and air traffic have improved ambient air quality and significantly reduced air pollution. The possibility cannot be denied that heart attack patients might avoid seeking hospital care for fear of exposure to coronavirus. This may contribute to some of the anecdotal deaths at home being encountered in the current era,"" said Sharma, who is also the director of interventional cardiology, Mount Sinai Health System, New York.

"Aerosol concentration, directly linked to pollution, reduces in country: VNIT study","Nagpur: Lockdown has brought another good news for the environment. The concentration and depth of aerosols in the atmosphere has significantly reduced across the country during the lockdown period.This was revealed in the latest scientific research carried out by Yashwant B Katpatal, professor at the department of civil engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur, along with his MTech students.The research, which was done using data of three satellites obtained from NASA and spatial modelling, reveals that between March 25 and April 25, in 2016 to 2019, the aerosol concentration was very high as compared to the same period in 2020.Aerosols are tiny droplets, dust particles, bits of fine black carbon, and other gases and pollutants present in the atmosphere which affects the climate and pollution levels. ""Aerosols can be natural or man-made. /Examples of natural aerosols are fog, geyser steam, volcanic dust while examples of man-made aerosols are haze, dust, particulate air pollutants and smoke,"" stated a press release issued by VNIT.The aerosol concentration is measured by estimating the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) using satellite sensors. ""AOD is less when its concentration is less in the atmosphere. It is more when the concentration of particles is more,"" researchers stated.In the research, students Vikas Patel and PrakashTaksal measured AOD and Aerosol Index (AI) using data from NASA for three Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) during 25 March to April 25.The study estimated aerosol AODs between 2016 and 2019 and average of these years was generated for India. ""This average image was then compared with AOD estimated for the lockdown period during March 25 to April 25 this year. A significant difference can be observed; the AOD decreased drastically, especially in Rajasthan, north India, east part of India, south India and central India. Less difference was observed in the western parts,"" researchers stated.Another measure of aerosol concentration in the atmosphere is aerosol index, which too was found to be drastically reduced pan India, especially in north and central India. According to researchers, aerosol index is more closely related to air pollution. The research has also estimated phase-wise aerosol levels in India.It also estimated aerosol concentrations in context of global climate change. ""If human activity is less, it directly affects aerosol concentrations which are directly related to pollution and climate,"" it added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Mahul tenements for Covid-19 quarantine?: State, BMC will tell Bombay HC","MUMBAI: State government and BMC on Tuesday told the Bombay high court that it will inform whether vacant tenements in Mahul, Chembur would be used for quarantine of suspected Covid-19 patients including inmates of Arthur Road jail. A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Amjad Sayed, via videoconference, heard a public interest litigation by Sharda Tevar, mother of an undertrial, and NGO Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan. Tevar's son is lodged at the Arthur Road jail since November 2019 and his trial is yet to commence.According to the petition, Mahul is a heavily industrialized belt and home to 9 major industrial units including refineries of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre as well as private industrial units. /The high court on September 23, 2019 stopped project affected persons from being rehabilitated in these buildings. The petition cited news reports and said two buildings being considered for quarantine at Mahul are close to the refineries.Apprising the bench of the PIL, petitioners' advocate Ronita Bector submitted that it challenges the decision of state government as Mahul has been held to be uninhabitable by the Bombay high court, National Green Tribunal and even the Supreme Court due to the toxic air pollution arising from industries. She said the courts have held that there is a causal relationship between respiratory health issues faced by persons living in Mahul and the emission of pollutants from the refineries. Also, that as COVID- 19 patients have severe respiratory diseases such as pneumonia it would be improper to quarantine them in Mahul.Bector told the court that it appears that the state government has temporarily rescinded its decision and must issue a clarification on the same. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia and senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, sought time to take instructions and inform the court at the next hearing on May 15, 2020.

Vizag gas leak: Activist calls APPCB note on LG Polymers 'misleading',"VIJAYAWADA: EAS Sarma, former Union expenditure secretary, on Tuesday called the press note issued by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board on the styrene leak at the LG Polymers plant in Visakhapatnam as ""inaccurate and misleading.""In a letter to Neerab Kumar Prasad, special chief secretary to the EFS&T Department to the AP government, Sarma said, ""While explaining APPCB's role as a regulatory authority, the press note states that 'APPCB is not the statutory authority for implementation of zoning and safety aspects of the industries'.""""Apparently, those who issued the press note are blissfully unaware of the powers and the responsibilities vested in APPCB under the following two legislations: The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; and the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.""""Under Section 17(1)(h) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, APPCB has the responsibility to 'advise the state government with respect to the suitability of any premises or location for carrying on any industry which is likely to cause air pollution'.

Sarma says in the letter.According to him, another misleading statement made in the press note states that ""A.P. Pollution Control Board (APPCB) issues Consent for Establishment (CFE) and Consent for Operation (CFO) to the industry under Water Act and Air Act in pollution point of view only"".""It gives the impression that APPCB acts merely as a rubber stamp in giving CFE and CFO approvals! As a responsible statutory authority, APPCB should have known that LG Polymers was handling ""hazardous substances"" covered under the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989 and also covered under Sections 41A to 41H of the Factories Act. The Board should also have known that Sections 41A to 41H were introduced in the Factories Act to prevent accidents such as the one that took place near Bhopal in 1984. The fact that APPCB's CFE and CFO minutes dated 4-5-2017/7-8-2017 and 14-6-2018 respectively for the expansion project of LG Polymers made no mention of the hazardous nature of the company's operations shows how insensitive the Board is to people's safety. The casual manner in which APPCB issued CFE/CFO to the company raises questions about its professional integrity,"" the letter says.""By the time LG Polymers proposed to expand the capacity of its unit in 2017, the population density of the villages all around had already increased in leaps and bounds. Had APPCB been sensitive enough to the safety of the people, it would have invoked its powers under Section 17(1)(h) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and Section17(1)(n) of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act and rejected approvals for the expansion on the ground that it would endanger the people's lives. APPCB's failure do so has cost many lives and imposed a heavy disease burden on many others,"" it says.""In the press note, APPCB has tried to absolve itself of any involvement in industrial units obtaining Environment Clearance (EC) under the Environment (Protection) Act, by saying that ECs for Category-A projects are issued by the Union Ministry of Environment & Forests and ECs for Category-B projects by the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC)/ State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). APPCB should not have suppressed the fact that it acts as the Member-Secretary of SEAC and supports both SEAC and SEIAA. In other words, APPCB is closely involved in the issue of Ecstatics by SEAC/SEIAA.It should be made clear to the public that APPCB's CFE and CFO approvals are not stand-alone clearances, totally unrelated to the conditions stipulated in the statutory EC. APPCB cannot issue CFE/CFO and allow any industrial unit to operate without a valid EC. The conditions laid down in CFE/CFO cannot be out of tune with those in the EC,"" Sarma says.""APPCB should not consider itself equivalent to a mindless machine that issues CFE/CFO clearances. It has the responsibility to monitor and ensure that an industrial unit complies with the conditions attached to the EC/ CFE/CFO. The widespread occurrence of industrial pollution that we experience across AP today is a standing testimony to the laxity in regulation on the part of APPCB,"" it says.Sarma has filed suit against LG Polymers at the National Green Tribunal in New Delhi. The NGT had ordered LG Polymers India to deposit Rs 50 crore with the district collector as part of the ""polluter pays"" principle, according to Sarma, even as it set up a 5-member commision to inquire into the styrene leak at the LG Polymers plant in Visakhapatnam, which killed 12 people and injured scores more.

'9 of 10 daily-wage earners without income',"New Delhi: The weekly incomes of Delhi's daily-wage earners, most of them employed in the informal sector, dropped 57% as working days plummeted 73%, notes an analysis carried out the University of Chicago and University of British Columbia. By early-May, weekly incomes had fallen to zero for nine of every 10 survey respondents, who mostly lived in slum clusters. Migrant workers were not part of the study.The study also considered salaried, lower-middle class employees, whose monthly income was converted into weekly wages to assess the drop. /Dr Ken Lee, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in India (EPIC India) and lead author of the study, told TOI that even salary incomes fell 30% in the first three weeks, sliding further as the lockdown continued.The study collected data related to 1,392 non-migrant workers. To compare the income data, figures from 2018 and 2019 were considered as 'normal' and considered the baseline to measure the fall in earnings. Lee said the study highlights relatively high rates of mental and emotional well-being among the works, ongoing challenges in food supply in terms of higher prices and lower quantities, and dwindling levels of reported savings. Lee said while the researchers were concerned at the increase in hunger and inability of the poor people to access medical care during the lockdown, they had not observed significant problems in this regard in the first seven weeks of the lockdown. ""For this particular group of mostly non-migrant workers in Delhi, we have not yet seen alarming changes in the rates of hunger, access to health care, scarcity, or security,"" said Lee.The EPIC India executive director said a lot of people had reported being beneficiaries of Delhi government's food assistance programme. ""In fact, 36% of the workers surveyed said they had availed of the state government's meal scheme at least once. This is a substantial figure and the government action helped curb the food problem to a great extent,"" said Lee.However, there was a positive aspect in behavioural change in behaviour, and people reported masks, curbed smoking and increased their handwashing. The study said, ""Despite this unprecedented job loss, the study finds widespread compliance with public health directives. Compared with levels before the arrival of Covid-19, mask usage rose from 20% (during the air pollution season) to 90%; time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95%, and regular handwashing rose from 88% to 98%."" Lee added, ""A big question is whether these positive behaviours can persist once the lockdown is lifted."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Huge drop in income, work for Delhi's native workers: Study","Nagpur: Almost two months into the lockdown, most poor and non-migrant workers in New Delhi have seen their incomes and working days drop by at least 57% and 73%, respectively.This was revealed in the latest study of non-migrant workers done by researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of British Columbia. Researchers found widespread compliance with public health directives important in reducing the spread of the virus, as rates of mask usage, handwashing, and social distancing increased.By early-May, nine out of 10 survey respondents stated that their weekly income had fallen to zero. Despite this unprecedented job loss, the study finds widespread compliance with public health directives. /Compared to levels before the arrival of Covid-19, mask usage rose from 20% (during the air pollution season) to 90%, time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95% and regular handwashing rose from 88% to 98%.""Even for non-migrant workers in Delhi, the lockdown has been devastating economically. It also brought about a massive change in behavior. People started wearing masks more, they started staying indoors and socialized less, they washed their hands more regularly, there were even fewer reports of smoking. These habits are crucial for limiting the spread and the health impacts of the virus,"" said Dr Ken Lee, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in India (EPIC India) and the lead author of the study. The researchers pointed to the role of extreme fear and media coverage in driving these unprecedented behavioral changes. ""Throughout the lockdown, 80% of people reported feeling extremely concerned about Covid-19. To demonstrate the unparalleled media coverage of Covid-19, the researchers used Twitter data to show that since March 25, Covid-19 coverage has accounted for more than 56% of all media coverage,"" a release by EPIC India stated.""For this particular group of mostly non-migrant workers in Delhi, we have not yet seen alarming changes in rates of hunger, access to health care, scarcity, or security. A lot of people reported benefiting from the Delhi government's food assistance programme. That said, the latest projections expect a surge in infections in the coming months and so the government should prepare itself to rapidly expand these types of assistance programs,"" said Dr Lee. Apart from this, the study noted there were relatively high rates of mental and emotional well-being problems, ongoing challenges in food supply chains, in terms of higher prices and lower quantities, and dwindling levels of reported savings.The study was based on data collected from 1,392 non-migrant workers, many of whom live in the capital's informal settlements. The data was collected in 2018, 2019, and during the lockdown, between March 27 and May 13.LOCKDOWN EFFECT- Incomes of non-migrant workers dropped by 57%- Working days dropped by 73%- Mask usage rose from 20% to 90%- Time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95%- Time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95% For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
12-year-old climate activist launches clean air campaign,"Nagpur: To ensure that the air remains clean forever like how it is during lockdown now, 12-year-old climate activist from Dehradun Ridhima Pandey is launching a nationwide digital campaign. She was one of the 16 children to petition the United Nations in September last year on governments' inaction towards combating climate change. The nationwide lockdown has led to drastic improvement in the air quality. /On May 21, TOI had reported the findings of UK-head quartered Nature Climate Change which said that carbon levels had dropped to 2006 levels. It has also brought a steady dip in the Air Quality Index (AQI) with average levels hovering around 60. At its worst, it goes beyond 500. As part of the campaign, a new video titled #SaalBhar60 was released on Saturday by Jhatkaa.org. The video calls on citizens to participate in a nationwide digital movement on June 5, World Environment Day, by sharing photos from their city demanding 'Clean Air for All'. A corresponding petition on the platform is asking for the initiation of a Clean Air Boss who will solely be in-charge of reducing air pollution levels. According to the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the country has 122 non-attainment cities which do not meet the national ambient air quality standards. Maharashtra tops this list with 18 non-attainment cities in the state.The initiative invites citizens from these cities to participate in the digital movement demanding 'Saal Bhar 60'. ""Citizens will be asking the government to put in place concrete measures to ensure air quality in India remains within permissible, healthy standards even after the lockdown ends,"" a press release stated.""In the past two months, it has felt like all the things my generation has been fighting were gifted to us - blue skies, low emissions, clean air. This only means that an AQI of 'Saal Bhar 60' is possible. Our government needs to treat it like the emergency it is, and have strict timelines for bringing down pollution levels. Breathing clean air is a basic right,"" says Ridhima Pandey.Stating that Covid-19 pandemic has shown us two things, lung surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi says, ""First, that we too can have clean air. Second, how bad air can affect our health, increasing our vulnerability to diseases. Studies from Harvard and Italy have shown a significantly higher number of Covid-19 cases and mortality in areas with high Air Pollution. High levels of air pollution across Indian cities pose a major threat to the well-being of our children.""Several environment groups across India including Let Me Breathe, Fridays For Future, Let India Breathe, Greenpeace India, Waatavaran Foundation, Help Delhi Breathe, My Right To Breathe, Kolkata Clean Air forum, Mumbai's Aarey Conservation Group and Awaaz Foundation are supporting this initiative.Campaigns manager at Jhatkaa.org Shikha Kumar says, ""We have made strides towards acknowledging the severity of the problem as evidenced by initiatives like NCAP. But we need concrete state-wise planning and implementation for Saal Bhar 60 to be a reality.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Beyond the lockdown: Gurugrammers hope for better air days,"GURUGRAM: Slightly more than a year ago, a Greenpeace study on air quality was released, naming Gurugram as the most polluted city on Earth. Shortly before that we had a heavy metals study that showed shockingly high levels in Gurugram of metals like lead and copper in the air. As citizens mobilized to protest this toxic air, more and more studies came in, showing us just what was at stake - not just respiratory illnesses, but also heart disease, stroke, diabetes - all are exacerbated by the bad air quality.At highest risk are those who have the highest exposure and most vulnerable - elderly, small children, poor and those on the roads, like our traffic policemen. /Health studies are damning, in all cases, showing that a considerable amount of damage has already been done. For parents, it is particularly nerve-wracking, as effects are cumulative and lifelong, much like smoking cigarettes, so even for children that don't display symptoms or sickness, there is evidence that their lungs are getting weaker and that they will be at a much higher risk of many diseases for their entire lifespan. It is estimated that 1 lakh children under the age of 5 die every year due to air pollution, while 44% of Delhi's schoolchildren have compromised lung function.""Responsible development is the need of the hour. If we go back to our ways after 10 weeks of lockdown,we would have learnt nothing from th Covid-19 pandemic. The clean air, blue skies should remain throughout the year. We deserve saal bhar 60!"" says Dr Sarika Verma, senior ENT and Allergy Consultant Gurugram.In the midst of all this, the coronavirus pandemic struck and India went on lockdown for a couple of months. Clear skies were experienced for many for the very first time in their lives. The conversation about air pollution has spread, and many newcomers have joined the campaign. This window of sorts is important. As widespread economic hardship prevails in the country, we can talk about rebuilding better. We have seen that economic growth fueled by the burning of the worst fossil fuels is a fragile, short-term good, what we need is a wellness- and equity-driven model of prosperity that protects our natural wealth for our children. The pandemic, cyclone, locust invasion, forest fires - all have been connected to global warming, and serve as a prequel to the greater disasters that scientists are warning us about. ""I am 10 years student living in Gurugram, I think it's for the first time I am seeing blue sky in Gurugram. I am so excited and I want this to continue every day because air pollution impacts children more than adults, it impacts our health and development. We demand saal bhar 60"", says Avira Bhatt, a student of Class 6, Heritage Xperiential Learning School, Gurugram.All these signs point to one thing: A future where environment and health is given the weight it deserves. As vast amounts of money is mobilized for the recovery, we can look at investments into clean air. Proper planning, implementation of laws, and maintenance of our AQI where the law says it should be - #saalbhar60 - is the way forward. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Climate change like Covid: Experts,"Hyderabad: Millions of people die every year due to pollution and environmental degradation and climate change is also a pandemic just like Covid-19, said experts t a webinar on Covid-19 and environmental concerns hosted by department of civil engineering, Osmania University on World Environment Day on Friday.Linking the spread of coronavirus to ecological factors, environmentalist Kajal Maheshwari said, ""Coronavirus has originated from animals. Contact happens among other reasons from the loss of their habitat. Extreme weather conditions such as drought and heat destroy the natural habitat of species making them step out of forest areas, thereby, making humans more vulnerable."" Dr Wesam Al Madhoun, a professor from Malaysia, said, ""Every year, over 3 million die of household air pollution in India, with women and children being most vulnerable. These could be because of pollution-related lung and heart disease."" Experts said the use of technology can help.

"Lockdown cleaned up air, #SaalBhar60 aims to maintain it","Nagpur: Thanks to the lockdown, air pollution in major cities of the state has gone down, coming close to the targeted reduction of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).As per the data analysed by Urban Emissions, a repository of information, research and analysis related to air pollution, Nagpur, Pune, Chandrapur, and Aurangabad have witnessed drastic fall in levels of toxic pollutants between March 21 to May 31.To ensure that the air quality across non-attainment cities remains good, the state has joined hands with the digital campaign #SaalBhar60. The campaign demands that the government put in place measures to ensure that the PM 2.5 levels in cities is 60 mpcm, which is the safe limit (for 24 hours) prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).In Nagpur, the average level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was 32.9 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm). Seeing nearly 30% reduction, it has now gone down to 24.1 mpcm.The average level of PM10 too saw a decline of 38% in the city. From 65.4 mpcm 30 days before the lockdown, the level dropped to 40.5 mpcm last month. Nagpur witnessed a substantial drop in the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) too.Pune too saw a significant improvement in its air quality. /From 54.8 mpcm pre-lockdown, the PM2.5 levels came down to 21.4 mpcm. Levels of SO2 and NO2 too saw a decline of 47% and 20% respectively.The air quality in Chandrapur and Aurangabad too improved drastically during the lockdown period. All these cities have been listed among 122 non-attainment cities which do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Under the NCAP, these cities have been asked to reduce air pollution levels by 20-30%.#SaalBhar60 was recently launched through a video released by Jhatkaa.org, featuring Haridwar based 12-year old climate activist Ridhima Pandey on the 60th day (May 23) of the lockdown. Sarath Guttikunda, director of Urban Emissions, said, ""We know the air pollution sources and now we have to take that extra step to make these sources clean. Achieving #SaalBhar60 is very much in our hands, it is hard work but very much possible,"" he said.Stating that we must now constantly aim for clean air, Dr Arvind Kumar, lung surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and founder and managing trustee at Lung Care Foundation, said, ""The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us we too can have clean air and also how bad air can affect our health, increasing our vulnerability to diseases. High levels of air pollution across Indian cities pose a major threat to the well-being of our children.""""Good air quality can be achieved with stricter policies and its stringent implementation, which is what cities like Nagpur, Chandrapur and others need,"" said Leena Buddhe, director of Nagpur's Centre for Sustainable Development.

ESA Map: Concentration of key air pollutant drops by around 40% in India in lockdown,"NEW DELHI: Concentration of sulphur dioxide, a significant contributor to air pollution, dropped over India during the Covid-19 lockdown, says a report of the European Space Agency (ESA).A new satellite map, released by the ESA on Wednesday, shows that the drop is more significant over Delhi and areas around many large coalfired power plants as well as other industrial zones in the country.Attributing the drop to substantial reduction in human and industrial activities since the beginning of lockdown in March, the report says the concentration of sulphur dioxide in polluted areas in India had decreased by around 40% in April this year compared to April 2019.It, however, notes that though some large plants in Odisha, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh have maintained a substantial level of activity, such operation appears to have ceased entirely in other parts of the country in April which coincides with the first two phases of lockdown in India.The new maps are produced by scientists using data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. The Copernicus Sentinels are a fleet of dedicated EU-owned satellites, designed to deliver a wealth of data and imagery that are central to the European Union's Copernicus environmental programme.""In India, emissions of sulphur dioxide have strongly increased over the last ten years, exacerbating haze problems over large parts of the country. However, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, human and industrial activity dropped considerably since the beginning of its lockdown on 25 March 2020,"" says the report.Certain reports had last year flagged India as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide.Though some atmospheric sulphur dioxide is produced from natural processes globally, such as volcanoes, a substantial amount is produced by human activities - predominantly from power plants burning fossil fuels - and therefore environmentalists and proponents of sustainable development across the globe have consistently been pitching for shift from current fossil fuel dependent economy to clean energy based systems.The lockdown period had seen substantial decline in concentrations of other pollutants as well. /An independent research organisation, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CERA), had recently noted decrease in level of nitrogen dioxide - another key pollutant - in first two weeks of the lockdown period compared to its levels during two weeks before the lockdown period.The CERA in its analysis used both ground and satellite data, showing ""drastic and clear reductions"" in pollution levels, and attributed it to decreasing fossil fuel consumption in transportation, industries and energy sector.

Air pollution to affect economy of cities,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow's economy is estimated to lose 6% of the city's annual GDP due to air pollution in the first half-year despite a strict lockdown.According to a new online tool by IQAir AirVisual and Greenpeace Southeast Asia, health damage from air pollution is expected to cost 1% to 5.8% of cities GDP in the major metropolitan cities of the world in the first half of this year. Of all 28 cities studied, Delhi bears the highest economic cost of air pollution as a percentage of GDP due to the impacts of PM2.5 and NO2 pollution.Air pollution in Lucknow is linked to the loss of an estimated 3,000 lives in the first half of 2020, despite a strict Covid-related lockdown.The estimation is also expected to grow bigger in the upcoming winter season. While some cities have seen a temporary return of blue skies as a result of quarantine restrictions, these gains were reversed as soon as lockdowns ended.Research shows that long-term air pollution exposure increases the risk of severe Covid-19 infections and death.Chronic air pollution exposure is associated with diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. /Patients with these conditions are at a greater risk of hospitalization with Covid-19.As governments look to rebuild economies, it is more important than ever that investments are directed toward green, just and sustainable sectors of society, said Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner at Greenpeace India.

Delhi lost 6% of its GDP to bad air in 6 months: Study,"New Delhi: Of the 28 metropolitan cities around the world, Delhi has borne the highest economic cost - 5.8% of the GDP - due to air pollution in the first six months of the year despite the lockdown, a new online analysis by IQAir AirVisual and Greenpeace Southeast Asia has found.The study estimated that Delhi lost around 24,000 lives in the first half of 2020 due to high PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, while the economic cost was around Rs 26,230 crore (US$3.5 billion). It analysed 28 major metropolitan cities and found that air pollution impacted 1-5.8% of the city's GDP, depending on the varying levels of pollution.These costs included absences at workplaces due to sick leave, number of people suffering from asthma and asthma-related trips to hospital, years of life lost and years lived with the disability and preterm births.""Despite cleaner air because of the lockdown, pollution continues to be a serious public health crisis and a threat to our economy,"" said Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner, Greenpeace India. Chanchal added that as the governments looked towards rebuilding economies, it was more important than ever that investments were directed toward green, just and sustainable sectors. ""Rather than providing a last lifeline to the fossil fuel industry, we must invest in more economically viable solutions like renewable energy and clean-powered public transport systems, which also help the less privileged,"" he said.In Mumbai, air pollution from PM2.5 and NO2 was responsible for the loss of an estimated 14,000 lives and a cost of Rs 15,750 crore (US$2.1 billion) since January 1. These figures were expected to grow further in winter.The study was built on a similar tool developed by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), which pegged Delhi on top of the list of metros that were most impacted by air pollution, followed by Beijing, Mumbai, Shanghai, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Bangkok, Moscow, Hong Kong and Seoul. /The other causes for consideration included prevalence of risk factors for chronic diseases and level of healthcare services available.""In Delhi, non-communicable diseases and lower respiratory infections have been intensified by PM2.5 and NO2, resulting in deaths, years of life lost and years spent living with the disability. Lower respiratory infections in children have resulted in deaths and years of life lost. Over 4,000 new cases of asthma in children have been attributed to high levels of NO2,"" said the CREA analysis.Subsequently, the number of children suffering from asthma increased by 16,000. Exposure to PM2.5 led to over 15,000 asthma-related emergency room visits for children. The costs of children's lives lost due to PM2.5 reach $310 million, said CREA.

Relief for CM as court junks plea against secretariat demolition,"Hyderabad: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's ambitious new secretariat project got a shot in the arm when the Telangana high court on Friday dismissed a petition, challenging the demolition of the old secretariat buildings. The court, which on July 10 passed an order staying the ongoing demolition of the blocks, gave the go-ahead with the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) stating that rules require prior environmental clearance (EC) for big constructions only when the actual construction work commences and not for demolitions preceding such constructions. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, while dismissing the plea of the petitioners, also acknowledged that the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), in its report, had said that prior permission for demolition was not the mandate of the law.Assistant solicitor general N Rajeswar Rao furnished to the court the reply given by the MoEF, which said that demolition does not require a prior EC, but a new structure, before commencement of construction, does require it. /At this point, advocate general BS Prasad said that the government would obtain it at that stage. The judges also perused the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act and concluded that the petitioners did not produce any evidence that the government was pressing ahead with the demolition without taking required precautions at a time when the pandemic is sweeping across the state. ""The AG is saying that the government is alive to its duties and is doing all that is required,"" they said.The AG also argued that preparation of the ground by demolishing existing structures does not require prior EC from the MoEF. ""What was required under the same EIA notification rules 4(3) is to take approvals from the local authorities for disposal of waste. The government is aware of its constitutional and statutory duties and  has taken all permissions and precautions to prevent air pollution in the vicinity,"" he said. The petition was filed by professor PL Vishweshwar Rao of Telangana Jana Samithi and Cheruku Sudhakar of Telangana Inti Party. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Without pollution, we could live for 10+ years: Report","Lucknow: Have you ever considered how much longer you could live if you were breathing in clean air? A Lucknow resident could add 10.3 years to his life if WHO guidelines on particulate matter in the air are met. This is the the maximum number of years in the entire country that can be added to a person's life by cutting down on PM2.5 pollutants in the air as per pollution data of 2018. The conclusion was drawn by data churned out by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) webtool developed by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). The report was released on Tuesday.As per AQLI, Lucknow tops the chart in India with 10.3 years which could be added to a citizen's life. /It was followed by Delhi with 9.4 years and Kanpur with 9 years, if WHO's safe exposure levels are followed. This also means that in Lucknow, concentration of PM 2.5 was higher than that of Delhi in 2018. WHO sets reduction of PM2.5 concentration from 35g/m3 to 10g/m3 as a safe level of exposure. The method has been developed by EPIC director Michael Greenstone and is rooted in peer reviewed research co-authored by him. It converts particulate air pollution into its impact on life expectancy. If data from AQLI is believed, then a quarter of India's population is exposed to pollution levels not seen in any other country. The nearly 200 million residents of Uttar Pradesh are losing more than 8 years of life expectancy according to WHO's guideline. Within UP, the tool measures increase in life expectancy of residents of Rae Bareli by 9.9 years, Amethi by 9.8 years, Bulandshahr by 9.8 years and Kanpur by 9 years. Jhansi and Lalitpur at the lower rung of the data ladder with relatively lower levels of PM 2.5, can add 5 and 4 years respectively to the life of their residents if WHO guidelines are met. ""Though the threat of coronavirus is grave and deserves every bit of the attention it is receiving-perhaps more in some places-embracing the seriousness of air pollution with a similar vigour would allow billions of people around the world to lead longer and healthier lives,"" said Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman distinguished service professor of economics and creator of AQLI. He added that in India, the solution lies in robust public policy.The index is based on the diseases and harm air pollution can cause to the human body. Air pollution's deadly effects on the heart, lungs, and other systems have a more devastating impact on life expectancy than communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, behavioural killers like cigarette smoking, and even war, the report said. PM2.5 penetrates deep into the lungs, bypassing the body's natural defences. From there, these tiny particles can enter the bloodstream, causing lung disease, cancer, stroke and heart attack, it added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lockdown gives Bhopal lungs a breather,"BHOPAL: Does lockdown improve air quality? Certainly it does due to reducing vehicular movements and putting on hold of commercial activities to check the spread of coronavirus.Ten days of lockdown in Bhopal improved air quality of Bhopal by 20 points. Ambient air quality of the city was 57 on July 25 morning which came down to 39 on August 4 morning. Air quality has improved in other main cities of the state too./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/The surge in corona cases in Bhopal forced the government to impose lockdown in Bhopal from July 24 to August4. Ambient air quality between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while ambient air quality between 51 and 100 leads to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, as per the pollution control board.Air quality index that measures pollution levels has reduced to more than half in MP cities, if compared from March when the first lockdown was imposed. Comparison of air quality before lockdown on March 20 and Tuesday indicates that air quality in major cities have turned from moderate, satisfactory to good. Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. CPCB data points that air quality of major MP cities improved to two levels. Officials said lockdown helped in controlling corona or not is debatable, but it helped in cutting down air pollution to unexpected levels. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Track the pollution level in your city,Choose cycling to beat the lockdown blues and boost immunity,"Delhi - NCR has seen a major boom in cycling clubs in the recent months with more than a dozen of them mushrooming all over Delhi. Clubs based on zone, gender, age and interests have not only seized people's interest but cycling tournaments, cyclothons, cycle races, destination cycling tours and expeditions are now hugely trending. During the darkest hour of a dreaded disease in our human life span, cycling has come as a boon taking care of health and fitness of mankind. The viral menace has compelled the entire human race to be locked down forcing us into social distancing with no social gatherings, no health clubs, no swimming pools, no community participation and no sporting activities. /In such a dark time, cycling has come in handy as a healthy exercise and has kept rolling the wheel of life and health. During this COVID pandemic, this age-old mode of transport and a fun activity has proved to be the biggest blessing for Delhiites, if done properly with all COVID-safety-protocols in place.Mask is a must during cycling also but rest of the COVID restrictions are easily adaptable for this form of exercise. As cycling is an individual activity, there is obviously no social crowding. It is done in open sun-exposed spaces, therefore closed infected surroundings are totally ruled out. During this time when gymnasiums, health clubs and swimming pools are closed due to COVID restrictions, cycling is helping enthusiasts keep fit and fight boredom. Since the roads are generally empty of the routine hustle and bustle of busy traffic and life is mostly arrested withing the four walls, cycling has slowly become the most popular, safe and favourite past time of most people. Over the last few years, Delhi-NCR has also experienced drastic air-pollution and environmentalists have been trying to get the attention back to cycles as a safe and non-polluting mode of transport. Covid has almost proved to be a turning point bringing back the glamour of cycling. Early morning cycling is now trending as a healthy habit to keep fit. Pedaling to a clean and green surrounding on a cycle has its own advantages over gymming which can get quite monotonous considering that it confines people to a closed, crowded and cramped space. Another advantage of cycling is that it doesn't involve huge financial investment or training. There are a variety of cycles available that suit everyone's pocket offering same health benefits across models. With no air-pollution, no noise pollution and being safe and affordable, cycling has almost become a new age fashion trend. A holistic exercise, exercising our entire body and with immense benefits to the lungs, cycling is the perfect antidote for all our lifestyle diseases in the era we live in. Sedentary lifestyle, fast food / junk food, working in shifts and long working hours have all led to obesity, hypertension, diabetes, depression, poor sleep, cardiac diseases and even cancer. Cycling is the one stop shop cure for all these diseases and even WHO has accepted that cycling helps reduce risk of cancer, heart diseases and diabetes. It improves muscle strength, general well-being, quality of sleep and also mental health. Since its invention, a bicycle had been a mode of transport, recreation, exercise, exploration and sport. In fact, it was the most important mode of transport in the pre-independence era and even after. However, over a period of time, with the development of faster commutes and larger vehicles, the humble cycle had lost its glory and was mostly considered only for the poor. Now is the time to go back to the benefits of cycling, so fit it into your daily schedule and reap the enormous benefits.By Dr Sharad Joshi, Principal Consultant, Pulmonology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Vaishali For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Why more women report of autoimmune disorders than men,"Until a decade ago, anyone with issues related to joints, muscles or ligaments would often go to an orthopedic or any other practicing physician only to be recommended to a rheumatologist much later. Sometimes the delay caused worsening of a health condition which could have been handled better by doctors who are especially trained to deal with these issues - the rheumatologists. However, it is only recently that people are becoming more aware of the field of rheumatology. Dr. Uma Kumar, Sr. /Rheumatologist and Head of Rheumatologists Department, AIIMS shares how these diseases pose a tremendous burden on the society and are on rise due to environmental factors. According to WebMD, rheumatic diseases affect your joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, and muscles. They also include many types of arthritis, a term used for conditions that affect your joints. Sometimes they are also referred to as musculoskeletal diseases. To put it simply, most of the rheumatic diseases occur when your immune system goes wrong and starts to attack your own tissues - these are also commonly known as autoimmune diseases. Rheumatic diseases affect more women than menGender plays a significant role in rheumatic diseases. Several studies have shown that the autoimmune disorders are more common in women than men. Dr Ruma explains, ""Women have a more strong immune system than men- and that is the reason the mortality rate of a female child is less than a male child. This is because most of the immune related genes are located on the X chromosome and because women have two X chromosomes, their immune system is considered stronger."" In an ideal case scenario, our body is prohibited from attacking its own cells but when it goes haywire, they start attacking their own cellular system, leading to autoimmune disorders. ""Moreover, estrogen hormone is pro inflammatory, which makes it all the more risky for women in case the cells self attack.""Why are rheumatic disorders becoming common?While there is no concrete data on why these disorders are becoming common, a lot of it is a result of factors around you. The rate of infections have gone up tremendously. Cases of chikungunya, dengue, bacterial and fungal infections are all going up. Then air pollution, smoking, stress, exposure to toxic chemicals and pesticides through the food we eat is also leading to an increase in rheumatic disorders. Sometimes the incidence is also genetic. The hygiene hypothesisDr Kumar feels that our overly cautious approach towards hygiene is to be blamed too! ""As a child I remember walking and playing barefoot. But today parents ensure that their kids maintain the highest levels of hygiene while playing and so these kids are not exposed to good and bad bacteria. Such children, when they grow, have higher tendencies of bacterial infections.""There are primarily two types of rheumatic diseases - organ specific and systemic (involving multiple organs). Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, lupus, gout, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis are some of the diseases. Symptoms that are often missedLike most medical conditions, some rheumatology conditions creep in silently - sometimes these conditions are often ignored or misunderstood. Dr Kumar shares, ""Sometimes prolonged fever is mistaken for TB, or people tend to ignore pain and swelling around joints, oral and genital ulcerations, excessive hair fall, dryness of eyes and mouth among others.""COVID and rheumatology patientsWhen COVID struck, Dr Kumar was extremely worried about her patients. However, she was happy to see that COVID didn't impact her patients the way she was fearing. ""The few patients who tested COVID positive recovered easily."" She feels it could also be because of the medications they are on - like hydroxychloroquine.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Masks should adhere to safety standards first and then serve vanity',"The way in which haute couture is conceptualised, created, showcased and consumed, has undergone sea change given the coronavirus situation across the globe. In this post-pandemic world, the fashion industry will surely need a new dictionary and redefine its ways and its already inching towards that.In the last few months, the flourishing mask-making industry has only grown bigger. And this, earlier non-existent piece of clothing, has now gone on to become a part of fashion just like your bags, shoes, glares/ sunglasses and other accessories were; synonymous almost, to your identity and sass. In fact, abroad, masks are now very much on the Red Carpet too (Venice Film Festival, MTV VMAs, at a Red Carpet premiere in LA last month and others). The erstwhile medical necessity is now also decorative and glamorous. /Designers and fashion labels from Mumbai tell us more...Masks go all glam for the bride and baratisDuring the wedding season, these masks are a rage. Designer, Nishit Gupta says, ""We have hand-embroidered wedding masks for the brides and the baraatis. In order to match one's wedding outfits, we made 'non-surgical unembroidered' reusable masks from cloth that was meant for designing garments.""On the other hand, with brides adding their own twists to their D-day outfits, the ethnic fashion brand put a couture spin to the bridal masks and introduced intricate hand-woven embellished masks as an added accessory. These masks are worn as a precaution and aren't medical-grade. However, many of them are washable and reusable. Nishit says, ""Whether a classic or a modern bride, bold or romantic, these pretty couture mask options are the perfect fit for the altar.""Saving livelihoods by making masksDesigner Purvi Doshi understands that today, masks are the need of the hour to safeguard ourselves and others from the spread of contagious diseases. She and her team have also tried to save livelihoods of weavers and craftsmen by making masks. She says, ""We are conscious of this fact and have hence created reliable, reusable and attractive looking masks for use. Generally, these masks are a by-product of fabrics being used in production of fashion clothing. However during these trying times when consumption is low and the weavers are idle in occupation, this is serving to be their only source of employment and revenue. So, we have cost-effective and protective masks for use that not only save lives but also the livelihoods of these weavers and crafts-people.""Nishit adds, ""Even for the embellishments, we relied completely on traditional textile techniques. While creating masks that can be best described as hand-embroidered face-coverings, we have been supporting rural artisans and handloom communities from their tailoring units by equipping them with the required tools to perfect the craft as well as make a decent living for themselves.""Masks are produced keeping in mind safety standardsVeteran fashion designer Monisha Jaising says, ""Until there is a proven vaccine, it seems for the foreseeable future that we will have to try and maintain social distancing as best possible, and follow recommended guidelines of the government including wearing masks. Whilst, it seems this has created a new subset: the fashion mask, and whilst there is somewhat of a micro-trend related to masks - designer mask or the perfectly matched mask and outfit; we have not yet developed the 'fashion mask'. I am totally for wearing masks, however it is most important that masks are produced keeping in mind safety standards as prescribed by the health authorities, and then serve vanity.""Handcrafted, protective non-surgical masks focussing on style and safety are gaining popularityCo-founder of contemporary fusion line that specialises in a variety of Indian wear, Vikash Pacheriwal, says, ""To ensure the safety of the people and the livelihood of workers, we are now producing protective non-surgical masks. Each mask is handcrafted, using high-quality fabric that ensures breathability and protection for consistent use. The masks are made keeping in mind the users, hence are sweat- free, comfortable and snug. These trendy reusable masks come in various colours and prints that are not only gentle to your skin but also pair well with your outfits. Our masks are made of 100 per cent natural fabrics and can be worn by all. They are anti-bacterial, anti-pollution and anti-dust, thereby focusing on both safety, and unique style.""Manufacturers say that their priority is quality masks at consistent ratesFounder of a fashion label Deep Bajaj says, ""In line with our vision of providing quality health and wellness solutions to customers at reasonable prices, we have quality masks at consistent rates even amidst the supply chain disruption during the lockdown. In fact, much before the pandemic, the company has been addressing respiratory wellness concerns, due to air pollution, with a range of masks of different sizes and filtration efficiencies.""Multiple filtration layers are adequate for protectionSachi Maker who heads the marketing of a fashion label says, ""There are different masks available in the market now. However, it is important to be able to differentiate between a protective mask for you and a surgical mask meant for the doctors. What we need is a reusable protective mask with an anti-virus, antibacterial, anti-dust, anti-pollution mask system. Our masks are engineered exactly with these features, also keeping in mind comfort, breath-ability and safety. Our protect mask is engineered with a six layer filtration system. first filtration layer helps to filter coarser unwanted particles, middle filtration layer is of spun and melt blown which works as bacteria and small particles filter and prevents any bacteria sized three micron, last filtration layer is a cotton fabric for moisture control and has an anti-bacterial feature.""So, what is your mask mood today?Masks with large bows to make a statementSparky masks with reversible sequinsMasks made of silk, denim and the polyester and elastane used for bathing suitsTie-dye masks, super hero prints, one liner printsPinstriped masks that are perfect for workMasks in tartan, camouflage and batikMasks in animal and floral print For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Doctors come together to talk about the importance of clean air,"To celebrate the First International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies on September 7, doctors from various disciplines from across the globe participated in a first-of-its-kind virtual event on September 6, called Doctors for Clean Air Conclave.The conclave was a full day program focused on ""Health Impacts of Air Pollution and the Role of Doctors in Advocating for Clean Air"". Seven national medical associations that joined hands to make it happen included the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP), the Cardiological Society of India (CSI), the Indian Chest Society (ICS), the Indian Academy of Neurology (IAN), the Association of Surgeons of India (ASI) and the Medical Students Association of India (MSAI).The event began with the keynote address given by Dr. Maria Neira, Director, Dept. of Environment, Climate Change and Health, World Health Organisation. This was followed by one hour panel discussions and presentations on the benefits of clean air on pregnant women and newborns (by the FOGSI), children (by the IAP), cardiac health (by the CSI), lung health (by the ICS) and neurological health (by the IAN). Dr H. Paramesh, a member of the IAP, highlighted the importance of creating awareness about the depleting levels of clean air by stating, ""Delhi has gone from having 10 trees per person to now having just one tree per person.""Not even the air within homes is safe, said Dr Alok Gupta during the session that discussed the benefits of clean air on children. /""Cooking using biomass and kerosene leads to the open fire in homes becoming a direct pollutant which causes non-communicable diseases, chronic heart diseases and chronic pulmonary and respiratory diseases,"" he explained.The conclave was an initiative to bring together doctors from all over the country to try and turn the awareness campaign to attain clean air into a people's movement.

Exposure to high baseline levels of PM 2.5 pollution ups Covid death risk: Study,"Pune: A six-city study by experts from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) has indicated that people exposed to higher baseline levels of particulate pollution (PM 2.5) run a higher risk of Covid-19 mortality.The findings essentially suggest that the baseline levels of PM 2.5 (the minimum or permanent level of the pollutant when external, manmade pollution sources are absent) could play a major role in Covid-19 mortality.The study analysed air quality levels and Covid mortality rates across Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai.Scientists said environmental pollution mainly triggers respiratory mucosa damage and obstructive pulmonary disease because the respiratory tract is the first part affected by pollutants. The respiratory tract is also the part which is highly vulnerable to Covid-19, the researchers said. The study was recently accepted into the international journal, Environmental Research, published by Elsevier. A scientist from IITM told TOI, ""The highest Covid-19 mortality counts were found in Mumbai, where baseline PM 2.5 was highest. /Our study also revealed that Delhi had relatively fewer deaths when compared to many Indian cities where ambient pollution levels were much lower. This was because although the 'normal ambient pollution level' was found to be the highest in Delhi, its 'baseline levels' of PM 2.5 were much lower when compared to Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad."" Ambient pollution levels (or the prevailing pollution level contributed by man-made pollution sources) is different from the baseline pollution level, which represents the lowest levels of ambient pollution that is not produced locally from man-made sources. Essentially, the baseline level is that value which would have been naturally present in the air in the absence of pollution from man-made sources. The study found that the Covid-19 death count was highest (909 as on May 22) in Mumbai as the city's PM 2.5 baseline level was found to be high (33 microgram per cubic meter of air or g/m3). Around the same time, it was relatively very low (22 g/m3) in Delhi, where death count too was less, at 231.The IITM researcher said, ""The mortality count of Delhi was even lower than that of relatively less polluted cities such as Pune or Ahmedabad because the baseline levels of the two cities were found to be higher than that of Delhi's. The baseline PM 2.5 pollutant level for Pune was at 29 g/m3 with total mortality count, until May 22, recorded at 243. Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Pune (in that order) had the highest baseline levels of the pollutant as well as the highest mortality count (in the same order) among the six surveyed cities.""The experts added this trend was found to be true until the end of May and that the correlation may change with time. ""More research will have to be conducted,"" they said.In May, a nationwide study from the United States, by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, had made similar observations. The study showed that people with Covid-19, who lived in US regions with high levels of air pollution, were more likely to die from the disease than people who lived in less polluted areas or regions. The IITM pollution study also found that higher the maximum temperature, lower is the probability of infection due to Covid-19. But researchers found that this correlation was not significant, even at 90% confidence level. ""However, no correlation was found between Covid-19 and some other environmental or weather parameters such as average temperature, ambient pollution levels, annual pollution levels etc.,"" the IITM researcher added.The study was jointly conducted by IITM, Pune; Utkal university, Bhubaneswar, and the India Meteorological Department, New Delhi. The researchers sourced the Covid mortality data from the ministry of Health and Family Welfare. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Haryana picks 30 hotspots in each district before paddy harvest,"CHANDIGARH: With procurement of paddy set to start from the first week of October, the Haryana authorities have identified vulnerable hotspots in every district to curb incidents of stubble burning. The deputy commissioners (DCs) of each district have also been apprised about the stubble burning hotspots in their areas to ensure timely action and prevent farmers from burning paddy straw.During last year's paddy season, Haryana had witnessed around 6,600 stubble burning incidents - identified by Haryana Space Applications Centre (Harsac) -and around 2,000 FIRs were registered.Haryana managed to reduce incidents of stubble burning by use of deterrents like cancellation of arms licences of farmers found burning stubble in their fields.S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), told TOI that 30 vulnerable hotspots have been identified based on the previous years' data and patterns in every district. He also confirmed that the main focus is on five districts - Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Fatehabad and Sirsa - where highest number incidents related to stubble burning have been reported in the previous years. /He added that HSPCB monitoring and educating farmers about ill-effects of stubble burning and action will be taken by the teams of agriculture and other departments at district level.'Ensure there's no stubble burning'Narayanan, however, said that like previous year, this year also they are expecting a decline in the number of stubble burning cases.Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora recently directed district administrations to ensure 'zero-stubble' burning during this paddy season. She said that in view of the spread of coronavirus it is imperative to ensure zerostubble burning in the state because many types of respiratory diseases are likely to spread due to increase in pollution in environment, which can then increase the chances of spreading coronavirus.Stubble TroubleStubble becomes a burning issue when paddy is harvested in Punjab and Haryana in autumn. After paddy harvest, the window for sowing wheat is narrow, leading to a spurt in stubble burning as farmers have next to no time to prepare their fields for the next crop.Farmers in northwest India, especially these two states, face strong criticism for drastic rise in air pollution during winters due to burning of crop residue. With an average of 20 quintals of paddy straw generated per acre, it is of little or no use to the farmers, who can either plough it back into the soil or dispose it of by burning or put it to some other use. The two state governments are working to ensure it is ploughed back into the soil by providing farmers machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue.

As the Covid-19 pandemic is at its peak across North India and particularly Punjab, Sanjeev Nagpal- an established agriculture, soil health and environment expert, who has been consulting the Punjab and Union governments on systems and for crop residue management has warned that stubble burning which is likely to start later this month during the Rabi crop season, can exacerbate the Covid-19 situation. He has also suggested that crop residue buying from farmers and its conversion into silica rich manure is only solution to stubble burning as Silica acts as a shield against Covid-19.Sanjeev Nagpal said that, Stubble burning contributes about 18% to 40% to the particulate matter air pollution in the Northern plains. /It emits large amounts of toxic pollutants in the atmosphere which contain harmful gases like methane, Carbon Monoxide , and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons etc. If alternate arrangements to stubble burning are not made, these pollutants could give rise to respiratory problems, which will further worsen the COVID 19 situation, as the Coronavirus also impacts the respiratory tract. Nagpal underlined that stubble burning not only causes massive air pollution but also affects the health of soil.It is important to state here that the practice of stubble burning combined with excessive use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years, has resulted in the decrease of soluble silica, carbon and other essential nutrients in the soil. Nagpal further said, Silicon (Si) is one of the most prevalent soil macro-elements, performing an essential function in healing plants in response to environmental stresses. The loss of Soluble Silica in the soil has given rise to Silica deficiency in humans exposing people to a greater threat of Covid-19 and other diseases. The reason: insufficient amounts of Silica in humans reduces their immune response towards viruses and pathogens.Sharing the solution to the open field burning of crop residue, Nagpal explains that the resolution lies in large scale collection of crop residue, its storage and then using technology for its conversion into organic manure and also bio gas. Nagpal Sampurn Agri Ventures (SAVPL) project in Punjab' s Fazilka has already created this technology in association with IIT and PAU, Ludhiana. The state-of-the-art project had purchased about 10000 MTs of paddy straw last year which benefitted around 500 farmers. The plant is making 8 MTs of silica manure per day now and the capacity is 25 MTs per day. The capacity of the project is to process 15000 MTs every year.Sanjeev Nagpal elucidates, ""Our concept is to process stubble to make silica-rich manure that will improve soil health and food quality thereby improving people health. We want the Punjab government to give a fillip to the model of crop residue management through its conversion into manure so that it is replicated across the state. This will not only solve the stubble burning problem but will also popularise quality manure among farmers and people in general to see the difference in plant growth. We will then connect farmers to consumers for quality food and better income of farmers."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Chandigarh: Straw burning about to start, might worsen Covid-19","CHANDIGARH: Farming and soil health expert Sanjeev Nagpal warns of a worse Covid-19 situation, if the burning of crop stubble starts again in September-end.The pandemic is peaking across North India, Punjab in particular. Nagpal, who advises the Punjab and Union governments on crop residue management, suggests buying straw from farmers for turning it into silica-rich manure. The side benefit is that silica also acts as a shield against Covid-19.Nagpal said: ""Field fires contribute 18 to 40% of particulate matter to air pollution in the northern plains. /The toxins include methane, carbon monoxide, and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, all of which can aggravate respiratory problems, and coronavirus attacks the respiratory tract first.""The burning straw is also bad for soil health. Combined with the overkill of pesticides and chemical fertilisers over the years, it has depleted the farm soil of soluble silica, carbon, and other essential nutrients. Silicon (Si) is among the most prevalent soil macro-elements and its role is to heal the plants in response to environmental stresses.The loss of soluble silica in the soil causes silica deficiency in the humans, lowering their immunity against Covid-19 and other diseases. Nagpal says the solution lies in large-scale collection and storage of straw for converting into organic manure and biogas. Sampurn Agri Ventures (SAVPL) in Punjab' s Fazilka area has created this technology in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.The project team purchased 10,000 metric tonnes of paddy straw last year from 500 farmers. The Fazilka plant makes 8 MT silica manure out of it daily, although its capacity is 25 MT. It can process 15,000 MT staw every year. Nagpal said: ""We want the Punjab government to adopt this model of crop-residue management. This will not only solve the problem of stubble burning but also give quality manure to farmers and immunity to people. We can also connect the farmers to the consumers for quality food to the latter and better income to the former."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Covid reverse migration of labour may cause Pb, Hry $1.48 billion losses","Chandigarh: The mass exodus of migrant labour from Punjab and Haryana due to Covid-19 pandemic is expected to translate into economic losses of up to US $ 1.48 billion due to lower production of paddy and wheat -- between 9% and 21%-- says a study.In a double whammy for the two states, the delay in rice transplanting is also likely to worsen the seasonal winter air pollution associated with paddy stubble burning and push up associated health risks and Covid resurgence.These are the findings of a research study ""Agricultural labour, Covid-19, and potential implications for food security and air quality in the bread basket of India"" by scientists from reputed agriculture research institutes in India, Nepal and US, and published in the journal of Elsevier - a Netherland based global information analytics company. As per the study, Punjab is expected to face a loss of US $1,140 million and Haryana $ 337 million. The maximum loss in Punjab is expected in Ludhiana district (US $ 123 million) while Kaithal in Haryana is projected to be have the highest loss of US $ 58 million. The study, however, says, ""the simulated yield outcomes under plausible transplanting delay scenarios from Covid-19 indicates less impact on the rice yields, but the potential for significant losses for wheat.""It has been found that more than 95% of area under paddy in India is dependent on manual labour for crop establishment and the lockdown has triggered a huge reverse migration from the northwestern states of Haryana and Punjab, with estimates suggesting that around one million labourers had returned home.""In all scenarios, the spike in air pollution in the winter months, caused in part, by rice residue burning, could coincide with an anticipated Covid resurgence in the fall, potentially making the public health impacts more severe by increasing both morbidity and mortality rates,"" reads the study. /It has also been observed that there is a large overlap between causes of deaths of Covid-19 patients and diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM 2.5). The researchers have observed that during the peak pollution period of November and early December, rice residue burning is a significant source of particulate matter (PM 2.5) in the region. How to cope with labour shortageAny delay in transplanting due to labour shortage can result in use of old (aged) seedlings, says the study. By delaying nursery sowing to better match delays in transplanting, yield potential can be conserved for rice.The researchers are also of the view that direct seeding of wheat into rice residues using the Happy Seeder can reduce the turnaround time between rice harvest and wheat sowing by 7-10 days and potentially eliminate the need of residue burning. With the Covid-19 mediated delayed transplanting, this window is expected to be further narrowed in this winter.It has also been recommended that timely planting of rice can also be achieved by adopting dry direct seeding of rice (DSR) using mechanized seed-cum-fertilizer planters, which requires less labour and water. DSR matures 8 to 10 days earlier than puddled transplanted rice, leading to an earlier harvest and higher yield of the following wheat crop.Replacing rice with maize in the monsoon season is another option to alleviate the potential shortage of agricultural labour due to Covid-19. The researchers have also recommended adoption of shorter duration rice varieties that maintain yield potential even with later transplantation. ?? For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Fractional increase in PM2.5 could raise Covid death rate by 8%: Plea,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday said it would re-engage on October 6 in finding a solution to the annual stubble burning carried out by farmers in north Indian states after amicus curiae Harish Salve said pictures released by Nasa showed that stubble burning incidents had started early this year.Meanwhile, a PIL filed by two students, claiming to be environmentalists, said stubble burning would bring the dreaded smoke to Delhi and NCR region causing massive air pollution. The petitioners cited a Harvard study to warn that even a fractional increase in PM 2.5 pollutants in the air would increase the Covid-19 death rate by 8%. If the smoke from stubble burning reached Delhi and NCR, which are still under the grip of Covid-19, it could push up the case fatality rate (CFR) among Covid-19 infected people, they said.Recent pictures released by Nasa showed more than 80 sites of stubble burning in Punjab, which is also witnessing farmer protests. The SC's green bench has been grappling with this issue but its stern warning to the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to stop crop burning has been largely ineffective in controlling massive air pollution in northern India, especially in Delhi.The green bench was headed by Justice Arun Mishra. /But after his retirement on September 2, environment matters have not been taken up every week as was the norm with the green bench. Seeking urgent hearing of the stubble burning case, Salve told a bench headed by CJI S A Bobde that ""crop burning has already started and it requires urgent steps"".The bench said it was on the same page with Salve and directed listing of the matter on October 6. The SC has been acting tough with the governments of Punjab and Haryana and had told them to incentivise farmers, rather than punishing them, to dissuade them from resorting to stubble burning after the harvest.In November last year, the SC had summoned the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and pulled them up the lethargic work done to stop stubble burning. It had stopped all construction activities in Delhi and NCR to ease dust caused increase in pollution levels. Meanwhile, the PIL filed by the two students said though the stubble burning season was yet to begin, farmers in Punjab and Haryana had started their annual ritual as seen from pictures released by Nasa, which showed that the two states had failed in their effort and commitments before the SC to stop crop burning.

Have heart condition? Don't delay check-up even during pandemic,"In the last six months, since the Covid-19 lockdown in the country, non-Covid illnesses have taken a back seat. Even many heart patients have delayed routine check-ups. There have also been instances of patients delaying hospital visits despite complications, leading to exacerbation of the existing condition and even death.On the eve of World Heart Day, cardiologists say, it is important to make patients aware not to neglect non-Covid illnesses. /""I am regularly seeing patients who have delayed their treatment till they are forced to come to hospital at an advanced stage. Some of them may even have succumbed to it,"" said Dr Ashok Seth, chairman of Fortis Escorts Heart Institute.The fear of going to hospital despite worsening of a disease is not the right way because timely treatment saves lives, he pointed out. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), World Health Organization (WHO) says, are the number one cause of deaths globally. It has many causes - from smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity to air pollution, and rare and neglected conditions such as Chagas disease and cardiac amyloidosis.During Covid-19, WHO adds, CVD patients are faced with a double-edged threat. ""Not only are they more at risk of developing severe forms of the virus, but they may also be afraid to seek ongoing care for their hearts,"" the UN body states.Disruption in travel and transport have prevented many people from smaller towns and rural areas from reaching hospitals. While there is no data or analysis to understand what is happening to these patients, Dr D K Jhamb, director and head of the cardiology department at Paras Hospitals in Gurgaon, said it was clear that many of them had not been able to receive medical care and treatment on time.""Patients with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes, among others, are experiencing delay in diagnosis and treatment, which, in turn, will significantly increase the burden of heart disease and preventable deaths,"" he added.Heart failure is the end result of many conditions of the organ, for example, heart attack, valve disease and viral infections of heart, Dr Seth said. ""There is no centralised registry for heart failure patients in India. It is needed to make a fair assessment of the burden of the disease and save lives.""The Times of India has launched Beat Heart Failure in partnership with Novartis to create awareness about timely diagnosis and management of heart failure and the need to create an effective national heart failure registry.

"Industries at IDA Nacharam leaking gases, say locals","Hyderabad: Residents living near the IDA Nacharam have been complaining of air pollution over the past fortnight. They say industries are surreptitiously leaking gases at night when no one is there to monitor.Speaking to TOI, Navoday Kumar, a resident, said, ""there is a faint chemical smell during the day time, but after 10 pm, we suffer badly. Industries are releasing polluted air at a time when few people are out or can monitor what is happening."" /A resident of Boddupal said: ""We are sneezing and coughing during the day. With several pharma firms located a stone's throw away, we assume they are responsible for the smell."" Kumar alleged that it is not just air pollution, but even water is contaminated. ""The local Raa Cheruvu has foam in it. I registered a complaint with the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) a few months back, but there was no response. I have tweeted tagging them again on Wednesday,"" he said. Also complaining about air pollution, Gowtham Valiveti agreed that the problem was most intense at nights. ""We have been raising this issue as clean air is our primary right."" He, however, stressed that it was also basic hygiene that was lacking in the area. ""There are pigs strolling around the area all the time. When municipal officials cannot deal with this, it seems unlikely they are going to deal with tougher challenges such as pollution,"" he said. M Venkanna, executive engineer, TSPCB said: ""We received complaints and are investigating the matter. Our night patrol teams are keeping an eye out."" Apart from Boddupal, residents of Mallapur, which is also close to the industrial belt, have been suffering due to foul smell. ""I have seen a plume of black smoke from industries on several occasions this week. After years of bearing the brunt, I feel it is time to move out of the area considering the health of my children,"" said Sabita Jayakiran, a resident of Mallapur. The complaints come a few weeks after the state human rights commission took notice of pollution-related problems faced by a large swathe of the city from Bachupally till Nallagandla. PCB officials said it is impossible to identify the source in such cases.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Tamil Nadu: Gasifier crematorium uses firewood, releases smoke","CHENNAI: Thick black soot from a crematorium marred the colourful sky in Chromepet on Saturday and was caught by a TOI photographer. The crematorium, one of two operated by the Pallavaram municipality, operates a gasifier unit using chips of firewood as fuel to generate 800C-900C to turn bodies into ashes. / Such black smoke is hardly visible inside city limits though most units use similar gasifier technology. A few electric crematoriums also function in the city limits. The manager of the unit, operated under the Chennai National Trust, responded to questions by TOI on air pollution as well as the other norms to be followed. The 50-ft-tall chimney, operating as per government norms, discharges soot at a level where it would not cause pollution, he claimed. Wood chips are fed into the gasifier unit through which a blower sends in pressurised air to create the fire needed for attaining the required temperature. ""This is what causes the black soot,"" he said. The gasifier was designed by a Madurai-based professor of Annamalai University around 15 years ago, he said adding that the unit planned to use LPG gas as source fuel and had received permission from the municipality. Switching to an electric crematorium is tough as it is costlier and cools down faster and needs skilled maintenance, compared to gasifier units, the manager said.

Delhi: Bad air may add to Covid burden,"NEW DELHI: Years of exposure to high levels of pollutants has left people in Delhi-NCR with structural changes in lungs that may cause respiratory problems in future. They may also develop serious complications due to this if they contract infections causing diseases such as Covid-19.According to Dr Nitin P Ghonge, senior consultant radiologist and academic coordinator at the radiology department of Apollo hospital, they recently conducted a study involving 120 patients that showed people living in Delhi-NCR were twice as likely to have structural changes in lungs that could lead to respiratory problems compared to those from other states like Bihar, Odisha and Bengal. /Patients, who didn't have any history of smoking or pre-existing lung illness, were visiting hospital for medical reasons.The radiology unit performed CT densitometry - a software-based test that allows detection of fine changes in the lungs at an early stage when it is not visible to human eyes during routine CT scan interpretation. ""We found that 63% of the patients from Delhi-NCR had damaged lung structure compared to 38% in the patients from other states,"" Dr Ghonge said. The findings herald an ongoing silent harm to the lungs of Delhi-NCR people due to air pollution, he added. ""In absence of adequate measures to improve air quality, these findings may gradually manifest on routine CT images and may even cause respiratory symptoms."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Maharashtra cities not equipped to undertake holistic action against air pollution: Parisar report,"PUNE: Parisar NGO's recent report, 'Clearing the Haze: An analysis of air quality management in six smart cities in Maharashtra', has found that while all cities have fitted air sensors under the Smart Cities Mission, there was no clarity on how the data generated by these will be used by these cities.The report was based on a study conducted in six non-attainment smart cities of Maharashtra - Aurangabad, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Solapur and Thane. To understand how the Smart Cities Mission has dealt with deteriorating air quality in cities, the study looked at how the cities determined their base level (on a scale of 1-4), projects they proposed to improve air quality and finally the status of those projects. The study used data received from the smart city SPVs, and stakeholder consultations. /The study found that all cities have fitted air sensors under the mission, but there was no clarity on how the data generated by these will be used by the city.The study representatives said that mission city information, such as project status and actual outcomes were also difficult to obtain. ""While it is mandatory for each city to report on air quality in the proposal, there is no logic as to why certain projects have been proposed and to what extent they would help improve air quality. Poor convergence was found between the city AQ action plans made under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and the Smart Cities Mission,"" a representative said.He said that while it was announced that the mission would be used to leverage the NCAP in the 43 nonattainment smart cities, the analysis showed that this goal had not been achieved.

Residents write to EPCA over 'rampant' waste burning in Gurgaon,"Gurgaon: Residents of the city have written to the chairman of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Thursday over ""rampant"" garbage burning in the city. The letter sent to EPCA chief Bhure Lal by Citizens For Clean Air, a city-based civic group, pointed out that given the pandemic, people need to protect their lungs as the novel coronavirus targets the respiratory system. They also said the city will witness smog in the coming months, and the rampant round-the-year garbage burning releases more toxins directly into the atmosphere.This exacerbates underlying health issues and impacts the vulnerable sections of society the most, including pregnant women, children, senior citizens and those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, the letter added.""We have come to realize that the practice of garbage burning, particularly in most districts of northern India, is actually a way to manage waste, especially in districts such as ours, which are rapidly being urbanised. /The municipal waste collection mechanism is yet to catch up with all categories of waste generators,"" said Ruchika Sethi, a member of the group.The group also pointed out that most local informal waste collectors or even locals set fire to large or small dumps of garbage, unaware of the impact of smoke from such fires on human health and the immediate environment. Risks to health on account of air pollution are still not understood, the letter said.""We have conceptualised and designed messages for communication, which can be effectively used on large public hoardings which can be put up at strategic locations for mass visibility and awareness,"" said Shona Chatterji, another group member who lives in Gurgaon.TOI had on Thursday reported that the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) will be implemented in Gurgaon from October 15. Under the plan, the sanitation wing of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) has been asked to ensure that garbage is not burnt for which the sanitation wing will start issuing challans from October 15. Enforcement teams will conduct checks at night in different areas and issue challans if residents are found burning garbage, a senior official from the sanitation department had said.

"As air quality worsens, make sure your mask fights COVID and pollution","With farmers in Haryana and Punjab having already started stubble burning, NCR is bracing for months of poor air. While wearing masks has become a part of the new normal ever since the coronavirus struck earlier this year, NCR residents have been wearing masks in the October-January period for quite some years now. The annual crop burning in neighbouring states, coupled with Diwali's crackers, turn Delhi's air into a nightmare this time of the year.At a time when the world is already plagued by coronavirus, poor air quality can just aggravate the situation in NCR, warn experts. So it's important to wear masks that can protect us from both the virus and bad air. /So what kind of masks should we turn to at a time like this? Experts weigh in.Masks to fight both air pollution and COVID-19 As Dr Ashvind Bawa, surgeon and Associate Professor, Dayanand Medical College & Hospital, Ludhiana, says, ""People should know that it is more important now to find the right mask that helps them fight COVID-19 and pollution both. If you live in a polluted area like Delhi it is important to wear N95 masks, which give dual protection. Besides, IS 9473 certified masks are also quite efficient in providing dual protection. When you are buying a mask, you should look for original certification.""Dr Nitish Dogra, public health physician and Johns Hopkins and Fulbright alumni, says, ""Air pollution affects airways and lungs in various ways. Most significantly, it affects the cilia in airways such that they are less efficient in pushing out viruses, and hence there's a greater risk. As pollution and the pandemic collide this year, these individual concerns are increasingly worrisome because PM2.5 is emerging as an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Masks like N95 and nanotechnology options are wise investments.""Jai Dhar Gupta, founder of a protective solutions company and of the citizen movement My Right to Breathe, says, ""In addition to Viral Filtration Efficiency (VFE), one now needs masks with Particulate Filtration Efficiency (PFE), as well. Certainly, masks with nanotechnology filters that are lab tested and backed by lab reports are a safe bet. Nanotech filter masks are also more breathable and will ensure higher comfort over extended periods of time. Lastly, make sure the mask is fitted and seals your face completely, so all the inhaled air is forced through the filter."" 'NCR residents not very particular about the masks they are buying yet'While experts talk about the importance of masks that can fight both air pollution and COVID-19, it seems as if the residents of NCR are yet to wake up to this requirement. A staff member of a pharmacy at the Delhi airport tells us, ""Whoever asks us, we tell them that N95 masks (without valves) definitely help in combating pollution and coronavirus. But what we have realised now is that people are not very cautious about the type of mask they are buying. They don't deliberate on the pros and cons and what kind of masks will actually help them, while making a choice. They just buy any mask, it's for the sake of buying and to avoid being called out or penalised for not wearing a mask."" However, pharmacists say that like every year, once the air quality worsens, such enquiries will go up.'Regular masks and coverings not effective for pollution; N95 masks without valve is the best option'Ravi Meher, Professor of Department of ENT, Maulana Azad Medical College, says, ""For coronavirus, you can have a three-layered mask or face coverings, but these are not effective for pollution. To deal with pollution, you need to have an N95 mask. Till last year, we used to recommend N95 masks with valves as breathability is easier in N95 with valves. But this year, we have COVID-19 pandemic and pollution both, and hence I would say people should buy a N95 mask which is without valve, it is most effective to combat both. These valve masks are not advisable for COVID-19. If a person is infected with COVID, they are more vulnerable to complications because of pollution.""People exposed to poor air might fare worse if infected with COVID-19: ExpertsMedical experts say that poor air quality can cause lung inflammation and it can also increase respiratory infections. Hence, bad air can worsen the symptoms of COVID-19. So apart from wearing a mask to protect oneself from the virus, one also needs a mask to safeguard themselves from poor air.Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Washington Post, ""Given what we know now, it is very likely that people who are exposed to more air pollution and who are smoking tobacco products are going to fare worse if infected with COVID-19 than those who are breathing cleaner air, and who don't smoke.""

"'Centre sat idle, while we took measures all year'","New Delhi: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Tuesday lashed out at the Centre saying that it was sitting idle and engaging in tokenism, while Delhi government was taking measures throughout the year to tackle air pollution.""This year, pollution from stubble burning will be very deadly because of Covid-19. The Centre has completely failed to save north India from pollution. It should take immediate concrete steps to curb this menace. The smoke of farm fires in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana has already started showing its effect in the entire region,"" said Sisodia.Enumerating measures taken by Delhi government, Sisodia said the city's green zone had seen a record increase, a new tree transplantation policy had been introduced, an electric vehicle policy was implemented, public transport buses were increased and smog towers had been installed.Mentioning that stubble burning was not just a problem limited to Delhi and didn't originate in the city, Sisodia said, ""The entire northern part of India is suffering from the adverse consequences of the central government's inaction. /We should not just talk about pollution in Delhi, but the entire north India.""""If pollution from stubble burning can reach Delhi, then it is also a matter of great concern for people living in the villages of Punjab. Why hasn't the central government taken any concrete steps to save the lives of citizens in north India?"" the deputy CM asked.He also questioned the role of Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) and urged the body to take concrete steps. He claimed that EPCA had been unsuccessful in getting the neighbouring states to control pollution.However, EPCA chairman Bhure Lal told TOI that they had been holding meetings regularly on the issue and carrying out field visits across the NCR to not only look at pollution through stubble burning, but other sources such as dust, C&D waste, vehicles, industries and garbage burning.""These are unwarranted allegations. We began holding review meetings for stubble burning four months ago. A review is held every fortnight and we had issued directions to control pollution in each sector,"" added Lal.A spokesperson from Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change said the Centre had taken several initiatives to fight pollution in the region over the past six years and a number of projects were still on.""The construction of eastern and western peripheral expressways reduced pollution levels considerably by preventing 60,000 heavy vehicles from passing through Delhi daily. We shut down Badarpur thermal power plant, introduced BS-VI at a cost of Rs 65,000 crore and shifted 2,600 industries in NCR to PNG. In addition, 2,800 brick kilns were made to shift to cleaner technology. Machines worth Rs 1,400 crore for cutting stubble were provided to farmers. This resulted in 15% reduction in pollution in Punjab and 20% in Haryana,"" said the spokesperson. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
